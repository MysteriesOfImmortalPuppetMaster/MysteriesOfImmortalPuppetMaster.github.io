Chapter 208: Peak of the Ninth Layer!

The reformation team of the City Lord's Mansion had been in seclusion for cultivation for some time.

When the three leaders, Li Duolun, Feng Dao, and Guan Tiesuo, met, they discussed Ning Zhuo.

The chubby Li Duolun spoke first, "Have you heard? Someone has already matched our record!"

The short Feng Feidao nodded, "I know, it's Ning Zhuo from the Ning family."

Guan Tiesuo's voice was deep and puzzled, "We have Young Master Meng Chong on our side. What's the situation with the Ning family? How did they do it?"

Li Duolun explained the situation.

It turned out that Ning Zhuo had used Five Elements Spells, blasting his way through.

Even someone as tough as Guan Tiesuo couldn't help but take a sharp breath.

He admired, "Impressive!"

"We've all cultivated these Five Elements Spells. For Ning Zhuo to rely solely on them to break through to the second gate shows his extraordinary mastery of spells."

"Remember, we are ranked on the leaderboard and can regularly draw rewards from the leaderboard."

"As long as we choose spells, we can receive guidance and gain casting experience."

"Even so, none of us have achieved what Ning Zhuo has."

"He has no rewards from the leaderboard and relies entirely on himself. That's truly terrifying!"

Feng Feidao crossed his arms and speculated, "How could Ning Zhuo master various Five Elements Spells to such an extent in such a short time?"

"Could it be that he spent all his time practicing spells outside of cultivation?"

"Thinking about it, he must have been stuck at the third layer of Qi Refining for a long time."

"But without subsequent techniques, his cultivation couldn't progress."

"In such a situation, it's only natural that he would devote all his time and energy to practicing spells."

But Li Duolun shook his head, "That's just the standard for normal people. From what I know, Ning Zhuo is not a normal person."

Li Duolun clearly knew more.

He briefly explained Ning Zhuo's deeds to the other two.

Ning Zhuo controlled the black market and resolved the Ning family's young patriarch issue.

Ning Zhuo, with the help of three families, was publicly refining a Golden Core Stage mechanical ape.

Although he repeatedly clarified that this time he was only forging the outer shell and skeleton of the mechanical wolf ape, achieving this with his Qi Refining third layer cultivation was remarkable.

Now, the Ning family's reformation team was entirely under Ning Zhuo's control, with him making all the decisions.

The Ning family's main branch genius, Ning Xiaohui, had already been sidelined by him.

"Young men like him, who climb up from the bottom, are not to be underestimated," Li Duolun highly praised Ning Zhuo.

The other two fell silent after hearing this.

As pioneers, they felt the pressure of being chased.

Feng Feidao sighed, "This Ning Zhuo is indeed no ordinary genius!"

"I'm very curious about his talent."

Guan Tiesuo's eyebrows slightly raised.

With a hint of disbelief, he guessed, "Could he be a celestial talent?"

The three exchanged glances and fell silent again.

In the best cultivation chamber of the City Lord's Mansion.

Meng Chong looked at the jade slip in his hand, his brows slightly furrowed, and muttered, "Ning Zhuo..."

For the first time, Meng Chong officially learned Ning Zhuo's name.

"Hmph."

"Trying to catch up to me? You have a long way to go. First, try your best to stand shoulder to shoulder with me."

"If you can do that, I'll be very happy."

"Because the current exploration is somewhat boring."

Meng Chong eagerly awaited the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng to cause him trouble.

He longed for revenge.

However, recently, under Ning Zhuo's arrangement, Dasheng had been actively avoiding him, making Meng Chong very uncomfortable.

Putting aside the jade slip, Meng Chong immersed himself in cultivation again.

Celestial Talent—WildSprint Thunderclap!

In the next moment, countless electric lights surged through his body.

With the boost of the electric lights, his cultivation advanced rapidly, improving with every breath.

Due to frequently using his celestial talent, Meng Chong had become even thinner recently.

Now, his cheekbones protruded, and his eye sockets were deep.

He had used his celestial talent too frequently.

But while he paid the price, he also reaped great rewards.

Currently, his cultivation had reached the late stage of the fifth layer, nearing its peak!

City Lord's Mansion, study.

Fei Si was handling official duties.

He had started working at dawn.

The jade slips he had processed were neatly stacked in a corner of the desk, almost reaching Fei Si's chin.

Just as Fei Si was about to take a breath, Xia Qu brought in a new pile of jade slips.

Fei Si was already accustomed to this situation and let out a sigh.

Since the recruitment order was issued, the number of affairs he had to handle had increased tenfold.

Many matters seemed trivial but were actually of great importance.

Because many important figures had flocked to Fire Persimmon Immortal City, such as the Golden Core Stage true disciples of the Great Purity Palace and Purple Dawn Pavilion.

Fei Si had to handle these matters properly.

If not handled well, it could greatly impact the stability of Fire Persimmon Immortal City and Meng Kui's rule.

At the same time, he had to guard against demonic cultivators from the Soul Devouring Sect and others.

Not long ago, Luo Shang had fought in a secret underground base.

During the battle, even a trace of Nascent Soul level aura had erupted.

This situation sounded an alarm for Fei Si.

After investigating the scene, they also discovered traces of the Void Sect's spellcasting.

Based on their speculation, at least one Golden Core Stage true disciple of the Void Sect had participated in the battle.

But they still didn't know who it was.

The recruitment order had turned Fire Persimmon Immortal City into a vortex, with turbulent currents!

This move by the King of the Southern Bean Kingdom had greatly diverted Xiang Xiao's energy and manpower.

Not only Fei Si but even Chi Han was also exhausted recently.

Fei Si had thought about recruiting an assistant, but he wasn't satisfied with the candidates.

They either lacked ability or status.

Naturally, Fei Si thought of Ning Zhuo.

Although the latter was only at the third layer of Qi Refining, his cultivation was lacking, but his abilities had long been noticed by Fei Si.

Fei Si couldn't help but recall the latest intelligence on Ning Zhuo.

He hadn't expected Ning Zhuo to achieve such a feat—matching Meng Chong's record!

"Now Ning Zhuo has also obtained the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique."

"But too much is as bad as too little."

"Perhaps he doesn't understand this principle, being so young and having achieved so much."

"Only after suffering setbacks in this area can one truly understand."

"Young man, you should stop now. If you go further, you'll be in trouble."

Fei Si only thought this in his heart and never actually advised Ning Zhuo.

He admired and had high hopes for Ning Zhuo, seeing him as a younger version of himself.

He had also suffered from overreaching in the past.

Now he wanted to see Ning Zhuo suffer the same setback.

Fei Si silently waited for the opportunity.

He wanted to wait until Ning Zhuo hit rock bottom before stepping in to help.

This way, his efforts to win people's hearts would be twice as effective.

Ning Family Estate.

"Damn it, damn it!" Ning Xiao'e suddenly opened her eyes.

Her aura was boiling like hot water, and her chest heaved.

When she practiced the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, she was always restless and irritable.

Comparison only brings harm.

Especially after experiencing the great convenience brought by the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, she found it increasingly unbearable to practice slowly now.

She missed the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman dearly.

It's easy to go from frugality to luxury, but difficult to go from luxury to frugality.

Every time she thought of the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman in Ning Zhuo's hands, she felt extremely uncomfortable.

Her precious talisman was helping her enemy and rival, aiding him in increasing his cultivation!

Ning Xiaohui felt very distressed and depressed.

She didn't know that after obtaining the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, Ning Zhuo had set it aside and handed it to Sun Lingtong for inspection.

After all, the talisman was taken from Ning Xiaohui.

Ning Zhuo couldn't guarantee whether she had tampered with it.

What Ning Xiaohui longed for was dispensable to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo didn't care about improving his cultivation; what he lacked was the purification and refinement of his Three Treasures cultivation.

In the cultivation chamber, Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a mat.

He swallowed a Pure One Pill, activated his mana, quickly digesting the pill, and wrapped the medicinal power with his essence blood.

His qi and blood circulated throughout his body, integrating the medicinal power.

He took out the Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact to purify his mana.

At the same time, he used the Clear Source Treasure Mirror.

This magical artifact, obtained from the Zheng family, was purchased by Ning Zhuo with the proceeds from selling subsequent techniques.

The quality of the magical artifact was very high, and its effect was far superior to the Tornado Windmill.

Ning Zhuo infused his Three Treasures cultivation into the Clear Source Treasure Mirror.

Then, the Clear Source Treasure Mirror would return the cultivation.

The returned cultivation was much purer and more refined than before.

Throughout Ning Zhuo's cultivation process, the formation in the cultivation chamber was always in effect.

The formation provided significant assistance to Ning Zhuo.

This formation was specially crafted for Ning Zhuo by several formation experts from the Zhou family, sent by Zhou Zeshen, and had powerful refining effects.

With all these methods combined, Ning Zhuo's speed of purifying and refining his cultivation became astonishing!

The cultivation world had developed to such an extent that the development of most resources was highly efficient.

Various auxiliary cultivation methods were abundant and highly advanced, affecting all aspects of a cultivator's practice.

This unprecedented demand for resources made cultivators' need for resources unprecedentedly huge!

As long as resources were abundant and the methods were appropriate, cultivation could be extremely fast.

Ning Zhuo relied on his connections and his own skills to utilize the resources of the three major families.

Previously, even prodigies like Zheng Jian and Zhou Zeshen found it difficult to achieve what Ning Zhuo had.

The emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace had given each of the three families their own goals.

Due to the pressure from the City Lord's Mansion, the three families had to cooperate closely.

This provided Ning Zhuo with ample room for growth.

In the past, it was difficult to mobilize the resources of the three families as Ning Zhuo did!

Several days passed quickly.

In the cultivation chamber.

Ning Zhuo was enveloped in layers of floating clouds.

He was multitasking, pushing the ninth layer technique, beginning a crucial breakthrough.

In an instant, he broke through from the peak of the eighth layer to the early stage of the ninth layer.

The breakthrough was so natural, without any obstacles.

As Ning Zhuo continued to operate the three techniques simultaneously, his Three Treasures cultivation rapidly soared!

Early stage of the ninth layer...

Mid stage of the ninth layer...

Late stage of the ninth layer...

Peak of the ninth layer!

Just as Sun Lingtong had predicted, the dual cultivation of Yin and Yang last time was significant, giving Ning Zhuo a solid foundation.

When Ning Zhuo purified his eighth layer cultivation to the extreme and broke through, he advanced from the early stage of the ninth layer to the peak of the ninth layer in one go!

Ning Zhuo felt his three dantians finally no longer swollen and uncomfortable.

He felt a sense of relief.

"Peak of the ninth layer!"

"The speed far exceeded my expectations!"

"Next is further purification."

"And preparing for Foundation Establishment!"

Three Dantians Foundation Establishment...

Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel full of anticipation and excitement.

In the cultivation world, it was extremely rare to cultivate three different techniques in three dantians simultaneously and then advance to the Foundation Establishment stage.

Even in major sects like the Soul Devouring Sect and the Void Sect, this was the case.
