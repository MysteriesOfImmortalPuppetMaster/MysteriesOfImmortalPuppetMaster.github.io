Chapter 147: Zhu Xuanji Enters the Immortal Palace

A group of Golden Core Stage cultivators slightly concealed themselves as they flew towards Fire Persimmon Mountain.

Leading this group of Golden Core Stage cultivators was Zhu Xuanji.

Behind him were Zheng Family's Golden Core cultivator Zheng Danlian, Zhou Family's Golden Core cultivator Zhou Nongying, and the Ning Family's Golden Core Patriarch.

The Jian Family and Zheng Family had received Zhu Xuanji's invitation, and naturally, the Ning Family's Patriarch was no exception.

Lei Si noticed the commotion from afar, his face darkening: "This Zhu Xuanji truly lives up to his royal lineage, managing to win over the local families so quickly. Sigh, it seems the City Lord will have a hard time stopping him this time."

Zhu Xuanji led the three Golden Core cultivators to the mountaintop to meet Meng Kui first.

Meng Kui's expression remained calm and unperturbed, like an ancient well, even offering his blessings for Zhu Xuanji's venture into the Immortal Palace, hoping he would have a fruitful harvest.

Zhu Xuanji carried the royal decree, using the pretext of an investigation to enter and exit the Lava Immortal Palace, leaving Meng Kui with no grounds to delay.

Seeing Meng Kui's helplessness, the accompanying Golden Core cultivators secretly rejoiced.

These three local families had long suffered under the City Lord.

This time, using Zhu Xuanji's identity to suppress Meng Kui, the Golden Core cultivators felt a sense of relief from their long-standing grievances.

"My lord, as long as we approach the Immortal Palace, a treasure light will guide us," Zhou Nongying acted as the guide, "Of course, this is only if our proficiency in mechanical techniques meets the entry standards."

Zhu Xuanji nodded and followed the instructions.

This was his first time entering the Immortal Palace.

As they approached the Immortal Palace, a treasure light indeed shone upon him.

The treasure light emitted a faint pulling force.

Zhu Xuanji relaxed, offering no resistance, allowing the treasure light to drag him into the Immortal Palace.

Entering the Immortal Palace!

Soon after, Zhu Xuanji truly set foot inside the Lava Immortal Palace.

Behind him were the three Golden Core Patriarchs.

"Finally, we're in."

"How long has it been since the last time?"

"Haha, this time Meng Kui won't be able to act against us openly." The three family Golden Core cultivators were quite excited.

Zhou Nongying said, "Lord Zhu, you must have received the crucial information by now, right?"

Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly, "I have. According to the information, as long as we contribute to the Lava Immortal Palace, we can use our contributions to exchange for rewards within the palace. The rewards are varied, including many excellent materials related to the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts, as well as spells, mechanical blueprints, and more. With enough contributions, we can utilize many facilities within the palace, and our range of activities will expand accordingly. The greatest reward is the position of the City Lord of the Lava Immortal Palace!"

Zhou Nongying felt relieved after hearing this, "Lord Zhu, our timing is excellent. The Lava Immortal Palace is currently under siege by demon beasts, and a Golden Core level beast has already fallen. By mingling in the front lines and slaying demon beasts, we can easily accumulate contributions with low risk and high rewards."

Zhu Xuanji nodded, "Then let's proceed with that plan."

Afterwards, he and the three Golden Core cultivators joined the front lines of the Lava Immortal Palace.

When Golden Core cultivators took action, it was naturally extraordinary.

Wherever they went, demon beasts fell, leaving behind numerous demon corpses.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit watched this scene, its eyes widening in anger.

It snorted in frustration.

Its truest desire was for the demon beasts to break through the Immortal Palace.

However, according to the constraints left by the Three Sects' Elders, it had to fully assist in the normal operation of the Lava Immortal Palace.

Of course, as the state of the Lava Immortal Palace declined, the constraints on the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit were not as stringent as they initially were.

It was precisely by exploiting these small loopholes that the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had gradually dragged the Immortal Palace to its current state.

After slaying over a dozen Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts, Zhu Xuanji slowly stopped.

The three family Golden Core Patriarchs continued their relentless assault.

Opportunities to quickly accumulate contributions were rare.

Zhu Xuanji transmitted a message to the three engrossed in slaying demon beasts, telling them to explore the surroundings.

Zheng Danlian quickly reminded, "Lord Zhu, you may not know this, but the Lava Immortal Palace is not a place we can wander around freely unless under special circumstances."

The Ning Family Patriarch sighed, touching the dent on his head.

This dent served as a constant reminder of how Meng Kui had once thwarted his plans!

Zhu Xuanji was unconcerned, waving his hand, "Fellow Daoists, do not worry. I have a solution." Saying this, Zhu Xuanji took out a talisman and activated it.

The talisman burned and quickly transformed into a strange light.

The strange light fell upon Zhu Xuanji, disappearing instantly, but Zhu Xuanji's aura subtly changed, becoming different from before.

It was this difference that allowed Zhu Xuanji to wander around freely.

"This is the Spirit-Breaking Talisman." Zhu Xuanji arrived at a wall, reaching out to touch it, and immediately felt a sensation, recognizing it.

The wall was thick, with large talismans resembling windows affixed at regular intervals.

Zhu Xuanji slightly channeled some of his qi, which the wall absorbed entirely.

During absorption, lines of formation patterns flickered across the wall.

The Spirit-Breaking Talisman was used to store various types of spiritual energy.

Geothermal energy, qi, and other forms could be accepted and stored within.

Even if the wall was destroyed, the stored geothermal energy, qi, and so on would not explode but remain stored within the wall bricks.

Moreover, with some special formations, it could forcibly absorb the qi contained in the spells cast by enemies.

Zhu Xuanji followed the wall, continuing his exploration.

After a while, he paused, discovering a well.

The well was sealed, but Zhu Xuanji was certain it contained no water.

"This is a Dragon Well."

"The Lava Immortal Palace has an intricate network of subterranean dragon tunnels."

"These tunnels crisscross the entire Lava Immortal Palace. The palace's mechanical troops are transported through these dragon tunnels. Unfortunately, I can't enter."

Zhu Xuanji continued his investigation, stopping at damaged areas or obvious battle scars, using his Golden Eyes and Tracing Back to the Source Technique to investigate.

One of his missions in coming to Fire Persimmon Mountain was to uncover the secret behind the early emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace.

"What is that?" Zhu Xuanji stood on a high platform, looking at a row of bronze furnaces.

These furnaces resembled large gourds sitting on the ground, evenly spaced.

From a distance, they looked like a forest of furnaces, neatly arranged.

"Bronze Furnace, Iron Furnace, Silver Furnace, Gold Furnace!" Zhu Xuanji immediately recalled the relevant information.

"The Lava Immortal Palace has four types of furnaces, with the Gold Furnace being the most precious, totaling eight. Once damaged, they are nearly impossible to repair, unless the Three Sects' Elders personally intervene. These furnaces are responsible for creating various mechanical constructs. The continuous operation of the Lava Immortal Palace, with its endless supply of mechanical constructs, relies entirely on these furnaces."

Zhu Xuanji descended from the high platform, continuing his exploration.

He gradually realized that even with the royal talisman, the areas he could freely explore were limited.

"It seems I need to increase my contributions to the Immortal Palace. Fortunately, I came prepared!"

With this thought, Zhu Xuanji took out three mechanical constructs from his storage bag.

White Porcelain Dragon!

Thermal Phoenix House!

Spiral Flood Dragon Worm!!

The White Porcelain Dragon was as white as snow, entirely made of exquisite porcelain.

The Phoenix's feathers were dazzlingly colorful, especially the tail, embedded with thousands of gemstones, capable of absorbing and releasing vast amounts of light and heat.

The Spiral Flood Dragon Worm resembled an earthworm, with a metallic body that was highly flexible.

Its front end had a terrifying mouthpiece with countless rotating sawteeth, excelling in underground excavation.

Each of these three mechanical constructs possessed near-Golden Core combat power!

Zhu Xuanji offered these three beast-shaped constructs.

In an instant, his contributions to the Lava Immortal Palace skyrocketed, surpassing countless predecessors.

In the depths of the clouds, Meng Kui sighed softly.

He had witnessed Zhu Xuanji offering the three beast-shaped constructs.

It was clear that Zhu Xuanji had come prepared.

Whether it was the talisman he used earlier or the three beast-shaped constructs he later presented, Meng Kui quickly recognized the true attitude of the Southern Bean Royal Family towards the Lava Immortal Palace.

Meng Kui was not surprised.

The Southern Bean Emperor and the Three Sects' Elders had a deep friendship.

The Lava Immortal Palace held a special significance for the Southern Bean Royal Family.

Even disregarding this, the Southern Bean Royal Family would naturally value the legacy of a Void Refining expert within their domain.

Meng Kui had previously thought Zhu Xuanji was not serious because the royal family had only sent one Golden Core cultivator, not appearing to be making a serious move.

Now, that illusion was completely shattered.

Zhu Xuanji's alliance with the three families placed the City Lord's Mansion in a clearly disadvantageous position.

Especially since Meng Kui's two Golden Core subordinates were not qualified to enter the Immortal Palace.

Meng Kui transmitted a message to Meng Chong: "Good grandson, in the upcoming exploration of the Immortal Palace, you must bring others along. The situation is urgent, and opportunities are fleeting. We must seize this chance while it's still in our hands!"

Meng Chong's expression changed slightly, immediately nodding and replying loudly, "Grandfather, I understand!"

The City Lord's Mansion's renovation team was even more outstanding than the Zhou Family's.

Meng Chong preferred to act alone, but since his grandfather had personally instructed him, he would lead a team to break through together.

Meng Chong summoned the renovation team to meet him, emphasizing:

"Let me make it clear, if we encounter the Mechanical Ape, do not interfere. I can defeat it alone!"

Three hours later, Meng Chong's soul entered the Immortal Palace.

Following closely were the sixteen members of the City Lord's Mansion's renovation team!
