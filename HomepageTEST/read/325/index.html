<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 325: Zheng Danlian: I Will Kill! (Seeking Monthly Tickets)
At the final critical moment in the battle with Qi Bai.

A massive fist came crashing down, accompanied by a chilling wind, suffocating with a terrifying killing intent.

Ning Zhuo raised his head, glaring fiercely at the Bull-Headed Ghost Soldier.

"Is this the moment I have to use the Buddha-Healer after all?!"

Bang!

Unexpectedly, the Bull-Headed Ghost Soldier’s attack was blocked.

Suddenly, a figure appeared, standing like a mountain in front of Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's eyes widened as he stared at the figure, exclaiming in his heart: "Yuan Dasheng?!"

Ning Zhuo had previously installed the Fire Essence Heart Furnace in his Golden Core-grade mechanical ape.

He thought to himself, “Even with regular fire essence, it's hard to fuel such a heavy mechanical ape.”

However, he realized, "The difference between fire essences and fire persimmons is negligible. Using millennial or ten-thousand-year fire persimmons would work."

"The Buddha-Healer’s mechanism is stored in the City Lord’s warehouse, and stealing some fire persimmons would be easy!"

Zhu Xuanji, after consulting the royal calculations, determined that the one who had intervened was Yuan Dasheng.

He then flew into the sky, making a high-profile entrance, shattering the roof as he descended in front of Ning Zhuo.

"Why did you kill Yuan Dasheng?" Zhu Xuanji's voice was as cold as iron, without a trace of warmth.

The tremendous pressure from him was like an invisible mountain, crashing down on Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo staggered, his back bending under the weight, but he didn't kneel. Instead, he braced himself, barely standing.

He was ready to deploy the Shadow Demon Buddha-Healer!

As the Golden Core chaos unfolded, Ning Zhuo saw a group of Shadow Demon cultivators making their moves, forcing him to abandon his original plan.

The Buddha-Healer mechanism no longer needed to participate in the battle.

Zheng Danlian faced a true disciple from the Taiqing Palace!

A glimmer of cold light flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes.

With a mighty swing, the Great Serpent Scythe decapitated the Taiqing disciple!

Within the Immortal Palace.

Ning Zhuo transmitted a message to Sun Lingtong: “Boss, something's off with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit! If it contacts you in the future, don’t trust it blindly.”

“And although we can communicate via the Life Thread, I fear the Immortal Palace’s powers might allow the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit to eavesdrop on our messages.”

“After all, each of us, upon entering the Immortal Palace, has a Life Thread hanging from the Lava Immortal Palace.”

“There’s even a possibility that the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could tamper with our communications!”

“To be safe, we should communicate face-to-face.”

Sun Lingtong nodded, “Understood!”

Ning Xiaohui was already dead.

Ning Zhuo slightly opened the Spirit Box, letting out a small wisp of spirit energy, like fireflies, that flowed directly into the Flowing Cloud Talisman!

Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up: "It really worked!!!"

For a moment, he was overwhelmed with joy, his eyes moist with emotion.

This had been just a theory of his, but now it was perfectly proven in practice.

Replenishing the Flowing Cloud Talisman’s spirit energy could indeed be drawn from a cultivator’s essence.

Ning Xiaohui, in her lifetime, had cherished this talisman, practically treating it as her most precious item.

Because of this strong connection, after being burned down to a spirit form, a small part of her essence could be absorbed by the Flowing Cloud Talisman, enhancing its power.

Ning Zhuo quickly shut the Spirit Box, holding the talisman in hand, standing still for a long while.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit appeared before Ning Zhuo again.

“Master, Master, I am the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!”

Its tone sounded extremely weak.

“That Zhu Xuanji is causing trouble again!”

“He’s trying to use the monster tide to investigate the Golden Furnace in the Gourd Forest.”

“Master, I may have mentioned it before, but they used up one Golden Furnace to create Yuan Dasheng’s mechanism.”

“If Zhu Xuanji finds out…”

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit appeared both excited and anxious, continuing in a weak voice, “Master, you're decisive and bold. We should join forces now and use the Five Elements Cannon Tower to strike them hard!”

Ning Zhuo was suspicious: “Why is the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit so nervous?”

“The Golden Furnace…”

“The fifth furnace was used on Yuan Dasheng, the third for the Great Serpent Scythe, and the fourth for my mother. The problem must be with the first or second furnace.”

“There must be a vulnerability with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!”

Ning Zhuo composed a poem and handed it to Zhu Xuanji.

Although Zhu Xuanji did not reveal what he was investigating, Ning Zhuo had a hunch.

Buddha-Healer Meng Yao was tracking Zhu's movements, allowing Ning Zhuo to gather first-hand intelligence and make more accurate judgments.

“What exactly are they looking for?”

“Does it have something to do with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit?”

Buddha-Healer Meng Yao had gained enough spirit energy to act independently.

Even during Ning Zhuo's trials, she continuously gathered intelligence.

During the third round of trials.

Meng Kui intentionally lowered his defenses, guiding the attacks of the Scarlet Flame Beasts. As the Lava Immortal Palace's defenses weakened, many restrictions faded.

Taking advantage of this, Buddha-Healer Meng Yao broke into the Secret Pavilion of Opportunity.

When she saw Ning Zhuo lying on the ground, scorched by karmic fire, though she had no memory, an endless fury rose within her.

Her spirit trembled as she tenderly helped Ning Zhuo to his feet, overflowing with boundless affection.

Meanwhile, Meng Yao brushed past Ning Xiaohui’s grandmother.

Sun Lingtong, unaware of the truth, charged in recklessly, trying to defend Ning Zhuo. Meng Yao easily subdued him with a single finger.

As Ning Zhuo's wounds rapidly healed, the karmic flames in his eyes were purified by the Buddha’s light. He stood up suddenly, shouting, “Xiao Zhuo, you've hidden so much from me!”

Ning Zhuo smiled wryly, just about to explain.

“Watch out!” Sun Lingtong cried out.

He had spotted Zhu Xuanji charging toward Ning Zhuo from behind.

Although Ning Zhuo had just recovered, remnants of karmic fire still clung to him, and his divine sense could not extend beyond three feet. His senses had barely returned when Zhu Xuanji closed in on him.

Divine Power - Golden Mountain Stance!

Divine Power - Jade Pillar Posture!

Zhu Xuanji charged with unstoppable momentum, like a mountain pressing down, overwhelming and impossible to avoid.

Facing him, Sun Lingtong felt his resolve waver.

Compared to the massive Zhu Xuanji, Buddha-Healer Meng Yao seemed frail and delicate.

Suddenly, she sidestepped and extended her palm to protect Ning Zhuo.

Divine Power - Jade Soft Petals!

Divine Power - Cloud Wave Rebound!

A delicate jade flower bloomed, tender and beautiful. Surrounding it, clouds began to roll.

Zhu Xuanji's fierce attack, unmatched in its force, was suddenly neutralized by the Buddha-Healer Meng Yao’s defenses. The accumulated force was absorbed into the clouds.

In the next moment, the clouds trembled, and the absorbed power shot back at Zhu Xuanji.

Caught off guard, Zhu Xuanji was forced back several steps, crashing through a small door and retreating out of the secret chamber where Ning Zhuo stood.

“What an incredible display of softness overcoming strength!” Zhu Xuanji exclaimed in surprise. He hadn’t expected that a mere mechanical puppet could execute not one but two divine powers in perfect harmony.

These two powers combined even more seamlessly than his own Golden Mountain Stance and Jade Pillar Posture.

Zheng Danlian’s eyes burned with crimson fire. Already deep in a state of madness, his fury surged as karmic backlash filled him with murderous intent. He charged straight at Ning Zhuo.

Zhu Xuanji shouted in shock, “Stop!”

Zheng Danlian, wielding his scythe, recklessly burst through the door.

The scythe mechanism activated suddenly, its blade extending like a crescent moon. In a flash, the tip of the blade pierced Zheng Danlian’s forehead and exited through the back of his skull.

Zheng Danlian’s charging figure slowed to a walk. By the time he reached Ning Zhuo, he collapsed to his knees with a thud.

He still clutched the scythe's handle, his eyes bloodshot and lifeless, his face frozen in a wild, crazed expression.

Click, click, click.

The mechanical scythe transformed, turning into a massive snake.

The snake opened its jaws and swallowed Zheng Danlian’s body whole.

It hissed joyfully, then slithered over to Buddha-Healer Meng Yao, lowering its head in submission.

Meng Yao stood aside, gently stroking the snake's head.

The mechanical serpent flicked its tongue, its tail wagging in excitement, affectionate and obedient.

Chi Dun, Zhou Nongying, and Yang Chanyu, who had arrived just in time to witness this scene, gasped in shock.

The sight of the mechanical serpent devouring Zheng Danlian’s corpse sent chills down their spines.

They all realized that this was no coincidence but part of a meticulously crafted plot—one that had led directly to the death of a Golden Core stage cultivator from the Zheng family.

Yang Chanyu, stunned by the depth of the scheme, finally grasped the full scope of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong’s machinations.

"So this is how deeply their plot runs... So ruthless! No wonder they've been so confident in vying for control of the Lava Immortal Palace!"

In that single, fleeting moment, Chi Dun, Zhou Nongying, and Zhu Xuanji, still standing in the darkness of the rain-soaked night, all understood the same truth.

The mechanical serpent quickly reverted back into its scythe form, falling obediently into the hand of Buddha-Healer Meng Yao.

She turned and faced the small door outside the chamber, and with a simple, graceful motion, she made a single cut.

A sense of profound despair, helplessness, and desolation swept over the onlookers as they were momentarily caught in an illusion.

Chi Dun’s neck erupted in a fountain of blood. A massive gash nearly decapitated him, and he staggered back, clutching his throat in a desperate attempt to heal himself.

Zhou Nongying was flung backward, his protective talisman shattered into two pieces, his eyes wide with terror.

Zhu Xuanji’s body radiated with golden light, but even the indomitable Golden Mountain Stance was cleaved at an angle, nearly splitting the mountain in four.

The delicate golden branches and jade leaves adorning the mountain crumbled under the force, scattering with a series of sharp, brittle sounds.

He coughed up blood, struggling to stay on his feet, but his body trembled uncontrollably as he was forced back several steps.

His vision dimmed as a deep purple hue crept into his eyes.

Zhu Xuanji was horrified.

It wasn’t the frontal attack from Buddha-Healer Meng Yao and the mechanical serpent that had left him in such dire straits. The true threat lay in the hidden affliction within his body, which had combined with external forces to overwhelm him.

“When did I get hit?” he wondered in shock.

And then, suddenly, he remembered: “It must have been when I investigated the history of the Golden Furnace and was exposed to the Purple Qi Corruption. I thought I had cleansed it all… but I was wrong!”

Yang Chanyu's face turned deathly pale as she instinctively took several steps back, overwhelmed by fear.

Though she hadn’t been directly attacked, the devastating scene unfolding before her left her trembling in horror.

Ning Zhuo, still weak, turned to Sun Lingtong and said, “Boss, we should leave.”

Buddha-Healer Meng Yao immediately stepped forward to protect them, guiding the pair toward the chamber’s exit.

The Golden Core cultivators, still reeling from the attack, were momentarily frozen in place—some healing their wounds, others simply watching in stunned silence.

Ning Zhuo was well aware of his own condition.

Buddha-Healer Meng Yao had used a great deal of spirit energy to unleash two divine powers and control the mechanical serpent. She was nearing her limits.

Fortunately, Ning Zhuo’s bluff had worked, leaving their enemies too shaken to pursue.

As they reached the doorway, Ning Zhuo paused, his voice faint but resolute:

"Anyone who dares to follow… will be cut down."

The entire chamber remained silent. No one dared respond.</div>
