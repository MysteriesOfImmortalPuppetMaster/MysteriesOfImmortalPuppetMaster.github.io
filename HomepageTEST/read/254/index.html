Ning Zhuo focused his attention on the butterfly wings behind Rudie Niang.

Among the entire framework of the mechanical construct, her wings were the most striking.

At first glance, Ning Zhuo was captivated by these wings.

However, he prioritized probing the main body of the mechanical puppet to its current limits.

This is the correct sequence for studying a mechanical construct.

Understanding the main structure and functions first allows for more accurate testing of other mechanical components.

Rudie Niang's butterfly wings were extraordinarily splendid! Ning Zhuo shifted his angle slightly and could always see the seven-colored rainbow light refracted from the wings, which was incredibly magnificent and exquisite.

After a detailed examination, he was surprised to discover that what appeared to be a single pair of wings was actually seven pairs.

These seven pairs of wings were so tightly layered that they seemed like one.

Ning Zhuo could imagine that when Rudie Niang fully activated, seven pairs of wings would flutter behind her.

Each layer of wings was extremely delicate, with a primary color of red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, or purple, corresponding perfectly to the seven colors of the rainbow.

The construction of the wings was so intricate that Ning Zhuo was in awe.

It was the most exquisite mechanical construct he had ever seen!

The wings were composed of countless fine threads forming the foundational structure, supplemented by condensed spiritual energy.

Ning Zhuo was not unfamiliar with these threads—he had just found them in Rudie Niang's hands and feet.

The technique of solidifying spiritual energy into form was extremely precious, reminiscent of high-grade spirit-gathering formations that could condense ambient spiritual energy into liquid or even spirit stones.

However, such high-grade spirit-gathering formations were usually enormous, covering entire mountain peaks or even spreading across half a mountain range.

Thus, the technique of solidifying spiritual energy into form on the wings was terrifying! "Who on earth designed this mechanical puppet?" "To create such functionality on such thin wings?!" "It's terrifying."

An outsider sees the excitement, but an insider sees the intricacies.

After careful study, Ning Zhuo broke into a cold sweat.

Rudie Niang's material was not extraordinary, merely of Foundation Establishment grade.

Yet, the cultivation technique was so terrifyingly advanced that it made Ning Zhuo feel a sense of fear.

The wings were both sturdy and flexible, and their combined weight was comparable to a sheet of rice paper.

Ning Zhuo speculated that because the wings were formed by solidified spiritual energy, they likely had a strong self-repairing ability. "It feels like a master of mechanical arts, on a whim, decided to show off and created this Rudie Niang." "Is Song Fuli planning to auction her as the final item at the auction?"

Ning Zhuo kept speculating in his mind.

The style of Rudie Niang's mechanical construction was exquisite, luxurious, and extravagant to the extreme.

In contrast, the Golden Core-level mechanical body Ning Zhuo crafted for Yuan Dasheng was the opposite—relying on sheer volume and low craftsmanship to achieve results.

Continuing his research, Ning Zhuo was shocked to find that each layer of the wings had at least one formation.

The formations were arranged in a variant style, with extremely high-end techniques, turning the craftsmanship into art.

It was breathtakingly beautiful!

Ning Zhuo exhausted his mind, using various mechanical tools to assist himself, and finally understood the function of the outermost wing formation.

His eyes flashed with insight as he grasped the key, exclaiming softly, "I understand, I understand." "The silver crown on her head, the silver patterns under her skin, all complement these wings."

"When the wings are activated, the formation will also be triggered. The outermost wing formation will instantly set up a formation around, altering the space." "At that time, the spherical space centered on Rudie Niang will be cut into countless small pieces by various types of mana. From the outside, it will look like countless tiny, colorful glass shards, stacked together, both beautiful and deadly!" "Activating the formation requires a lot of mana, so the master of mechanical arts deliberately added 'blood' to this mechanical puppet."

"This special spiritual milk can carry a tremendous amount of mana, essentially acting as a constantly transforming mana pool." "Rudie Niang's skin is made of a composite material with high cloud cotton as the main component, allowing it to continuously absorb natural spiritual energy from the outside world." "This spiritual energy is converted and stored in the spiritual milk blood, to be used when the formation is activated."

Listening to Ning Zhuo's thorough analysis, Fairy Chanyu couldn't help but raise her eyebrows slightly.

She suddenly realized that this young man before her was indeed skilled, deducing Rudie Niang's offensive methods after just a bit of probing.

Inside the cloud whale, Fairy Chanyu had personally experienced the formation scene Ning Zhuo just speculated.

At that time, she couldn't see the details.

Fortunately, Sun Lingtong stopped it in time, winning with words, otherwise...

Listening to Ning Zhuo now, she realized that being trapped in such a powerful formation would have been costly, even if she could break free. "In a short time, this is all I can detect." Ning Zhuo sighed regretfully, wiping the sweat from his forehead.

He said to Sun Lingtong, "Brother Sun, why don't you give it a try?"

Sun Lingtong shrugged, "Forget it, in terms of mechanical expertise, both Fairy Chanyu and I are not as good as you." Fairy Chanyu heard this and slightly raised her eyebrows, wanting to refute, but recalling Ning Zhuo's performance just now, she closed her mouth.

She had to admit that in mechanical arts, this young Qi Refining Stage cultivator indeed had a knack!

Sun Lingtong asked Ning Zhuo, his tone cautious, "Should we awaken her now?" Ning Zhuo frowned slightly.

To be honest, after this examination, he was somewhat apprehensive about Rudie Niang's combat power.

Despite her being made of Foundation Establishment-grade materials, such terrifying cultivation techniques could allow her to exert power comparable to a Golden Core.

Cultivation is, after all, the study and utilization of the truths of the world.

Once Rudie Niang awakened, she could be a double-edged sword beside Ning Zhuo.

But ultimately, Ning Zhuo nodded slowly and said to Sun Lingtong, "Awaken her."

After deep contemplation, Ning Zhuo realized he had little choice.

Once the palace examination began, the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace would undoubtedly be a bloody storm.

His opponents would be numerous Golden Cores, and even Nascent Soul-level like Meng Kui.

By that time, his cultivation would at most reach the Foundation Establishment Stage, and based on the timeline, it would only be the early Foundation Establishment Stage.

Therefore, he must seize every opportunity to secure high-end combat power for his side! Rudie Niang's quasi-Golden Core combat power was something Ning Zhuo had to strive for.

For this, he needed to take a gamble.

And here, in the medical pavilion of the Lava Immortal Palace, was the most suitable environment.

With Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu by his side, it was the safest time.

Take a gamble and awaken Rudie Niang! The method to awaken Rudie Niang was simple: recite the secret incantation from before.

Sun Lingtong recited it once, quite fluently and with clear enunciation.

Ning Zhuo listened to the chant, glanced at Sun Lingtong, and his eyes flickered.

Sun Lingtong also looked at Ning Zhuo and glared at him.

Their small interaction ended quickly, but Fairy Chanyu, standing nearby, keenly caught it!

"What's going on?" She was moved, instantly realizing that the relationship between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong might not be as simple as collaborators.

After Sun Lingtong finished singing, he gently patted Rudie Niang's shoulder and arm.

He softly called, "Rudie Niang, Rudie Niang, wake up."

Rudie Niang slowly opened her eyes, her clear, water-like gaze sweeping around before fixing on Ning Zhuo.

Her voice remained gentle, with a slight tremor, "Where is this? Are you the mechanical cultivator who repaired me?" Ning Zhuo nodded slightly.

Sun Lingtong said, "Rudie Niang, for the next period, follow this mechanical cultivator. He can cure your ailments, but you need to cooperate fully."

Rudie Niang behaved very obediently, nodding gently without any suspicion. "Can I stand up?" she asked.

Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement.

Rudie Niang then floated up, her wings behind her gently flapping, allowing her to hover in mid-air.

She kept looking at Ning Zhuo, her large eyes suddenly welling up with tears, which then fell like large beads.

Such an extremely lifelike display surprised the three cultivators present.

Rudie Niang reached out, lowered her head slightly, and gently wiped her tears.

Then she continued to stare at Ning Zhuo, her gaze unwavering, "Healer, is my condition serious? Can it still be cured?" Ning Zhuo secretly praised her, "She's worried about her 'illness,' such intelligence far surpasses Yuan Dasheng!"

Ning Zhuo nodded and reassured her, "The problem isn't severe, but the treatment is quite complicated and will take a long time. You need to be patient." "During this process, I need your full cooperation. For example, conducting real combat to test your body. Any command I give, you must strictly follow, understand?" "Yes, Little Butterfly understands." Rudie Niang nodded obediently.

As Sun Lingtong had conveyed, Rudie Niang was simple-minded and quite easy to deceive.

Calculating the time, it was about right.

Ning Zhuo began tidying up the severe treatment room, putting everything back in place.

The materials Sun Lingtong had given him, along with Rudie Niang, were temporarily stored here, not intended to be taken out.

Sun Lingtong communicated with Ning Zhuo, "What do you plan to do about Ning Xiaohui?" "She's been striving for the position at the Historical Records Pavilion." "Your entry into the Immortal Palace seems to have spurred her." "She's practically working herself to death, resting only one or two hours a day, striving for achievements."

"If she succeeds, then even our secret meeting this time might be recorded by the Historical Records Pavilion." Ning Zhuo sighed, "Ning Xiaohui is a big problem, and I'm currently looking for an opportunity." "From my observations over the past few days, the Golden Core ancestors place great importance on the reformation team." "No matter the situation, they always keep at least two people active near the reformation team."

"I believe that Ning Xiaohui, entrusted with such an important task, is certainly being protected. And the level of protection for her is much higher than for us." "Eliminating her is very risky; we need to find the right opportunity. At the same time, we need to find a way to deal with the subsequent investigation." "Currently, Zhu Xuanji seems to have discovered something, and his attention on me is quite unusual." "If anything happens to Ning Xiaohui, I fear I'll be the first one he investigates thoroughly!"

"I have some confidence in disguising myself, but I'm most afraid of being imprisoned and temporarily losing my freedom!" This situation would be fatal for Ning Zhuo! Sun Lingtong nodded, agreeing with Ning Zhuo's assessment.

Fairy Chanyu added, "According to your previous plan, you intended to stir up the cloud merchants to create an opportunity for yourselves."

"But strangely, so many days have passed, and logically, the cloud merchants should have discovered the fake goods we left behind. Yet, there's been no movement from them!" After raiding the auction warehouse, Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu had used their methods to create corresponding fake goods and placed them back.

They retraced their steps, replacing the empty spots on the shelves with fake items, creating the illusion that the goods were still there.

They deliberately designed these fake items to disappear automatically after a few days, revealing a huge flaw.

According to the plan, the cloud merchants should have erupted days ago.

Yet, until now, there's been nothing but silence from that side.

It's very peculiar!</div>
