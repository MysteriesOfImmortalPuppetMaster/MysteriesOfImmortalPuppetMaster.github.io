Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique!

Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on the meditation mat, holding the Five Elements Ruler in his hand.

He infused his Five Elements Mana into this magical artifact.

The array patterns on the Five Elements Ruler flashed, releasing five streams of single-element mana—white metal, green wood, black water, red fire, and yellow earth!

The five streams of single-element mana swirled around Ning Zhuo, resembling dragons spiraling up and down.

Metal generates water, water generates wood...

Following the mutual generation relationship of the Five Elements, the single-element mana ultimately transformed and merged into yellowish-brown earth-element mana.

Ning Zhuo's eyes glowed faintly as he divided the earth-element mana into two parts.

He retained twenty percent as earth-element mana, while the remaining eighty percent transformed into metal-element mana through the generation cycle.

The metal-element mana was then divided into two parts.

One part remained as metal-element mana, while the other part transformed into water-element mana through the generation cycle.

Water transformed into wood, and wood transformed into fire.

In the end, the five streams of single-element mana still surrounded Ning Zhuo.

However, compared to before, these five streams of mana had significantly reduced.

Although the Five Elements mutually generate each other, there is considerable loss during the transformation to the next stage.

Ning Zhuo had practiced this exercise over a thousand times!

At first, he struggled with this exercise, taking a long time to complete it.

But now, his entire transformation process was incredibly smooth, reducing the time to a tenth of what it initially took.

After practicing mutual generation, Ning Zhuo began practicing mutual restraint.

He made the five streams of single-element mana oppose each other.

For a moment, five-colored radiance illuminated his face, and the five streams of single-element mana intertwined and opposed each other like serpents, constantly transforming and extinguishing.

The complex changes were extremely dazzling, making it hard for anyone to follow.

"With the Five Elements Mutual Restraint, I can restrain any mechanical construct as long as it uses either mixed or single-element mana." Ning Zhuo thought of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique and the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique.

"The three sect masters designed these three techniques to strictly control mechanical constructs from the aspects of divine sense, mana, and blood restrictions. The Buddha Heart Demon Seal and the Life Thread Divine Ability are even higher-level control methods. It seems the three sect masters were very afraid of mechanical constructs going out of control."

"The techniques and spells they designed all strengthen the control over mechanical constructs." Ning Zhuo slowly withdrew his mana and stored the Five Elements Ruler in his storage belt.

"The Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique has already shown some results."

Since obtaining this technique, Ning Zhuo had been diligently practicing it without interruption.

Now, he had practiced this technique to the point where it was as natural as breathing, becoming an instinct.

"Next, I need to refine my skills through practical use."

"This isn't something that can be achieved through mere hard work; it requires moments of inspiration during use." Ning Zhuo planned to reduce his practice time.

Refining skills through practice is unpredictable.

It could take days, dozens of days, or even years.

He knew it was time to go to the second Dao Gate and receive the Five Elements Transformation Disk.

At Ning Zhuo's residence.

He summoned his fellow members of the reformation team.

In the small courtyard, everyone gathered, their faces filled with excitement and joy.

The young men greeted Ning Zhuo enthusiastically.

"Brother Zhuo, how is your research on the substitute puppet fortress going? I can offer my own flesh and blood for your research without asking for a single spirit stone!"

"Brother Zhuo, can we really create that mechanical ape? It's at the Golden Core Stage! The three major families are all working on this, and you're truly amazing."

Ning Zhuo's collaboration with the three families to forge a Golden Core Stage mechanical ape had a significant impact.

It's important to note that Ning Zhuo was only at the third level of the Qi Refining Stage, yet he managed to accomplish such a major task.

His fellow members couldn't help but feel admiration and respect for him.

Ning Zhuo needed to clarify this point.

He said, "The matter of the Golden Core Stage mechanical ape is still far from complete."

"I just want to create its skeleton and external armor first."

"The real key has always been its internal structure and various mechanical components."

"I'm still designing this aspect. Sigh, it's very challenging!" Ning Zhuo shook his head and smiled bitterly.

He candidly told everyone, "In fact, whether it's researching the substitute puppet fortress or creating the Golden Core Stage mechanical ape, it's all driven by my inner fears."

"Sigh, the previous joint action of the three families, where Ning Xiaohui framed me, hurt me deeply and had a significant impact on me!"

"If my own family can do this, what about outsiders?"

"Recently, Elder Ning Houjun and Elder Ning Youfu also specifically reminded me to be cautious."

"I happened to be involved in the black market by chance, and I've been in the spotlight ever since. I don't know how many people are secretly watching me. It's indeed very dangerous."

Ning Yong was the first to get agitated, "Ning Xiaohui is a despicable person. I secretly liked her when we were studying together!"

"She is simply a disgrace to the main branch and to the Ning family!"

Ning Chen comforted, "Brother Zhuo, don't worry. Our family's ancestor has already spoken highly of you. You are the greatest contributor to the Ning family. The main branch won't dare to openly target you anymore."

Someone expressed disagreement, "But isn't it even more difficult to guard against secret attacks? Isn't that even more terrifying?"

Most people were filled with righteous indignation, "Hmph, these despicable people can't stand seeing a pillar emerging from our branch, a future elder!"

"Alright, alright." Ning Zhuo raised his hand to stop the discussion.

As usual, he began to share his insights on spellcasting.

The fellow members quickly immersed themselves, listening intently.

Ning Zhuo often demonstrated the Five Elements Technique, frequently eliciting exclamations of amazement.

Ning Ji wore a smile on his face, appearing fascinated.

In reality, he hadn't truly immersed himself; he felt out of place with the reformation team.

"I don't cultivate the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique!"

Listening to these spellcasting insights, he felt impatient, bored, and uninterested.

In his mind, he was reminiscing about the wonderful feeling of wielding authority and power in the black market.

Initially, when he joined Ning Zhuo, Ning Ji felt extremely uncomfortable and secretly complained to his father, Ning Ze.

He found the black market dirty and chaotic, filled with immense risks.

Doing these tasks felt arduous and unrewarding, with no sense of honor.

He also worried that Ning Zhuo might seek revenge for past grievances.

Ning Ze reassured him, saying, "Ning Zhuo will definitely tolerate you."

"I've already seen that Ning Zhuo is ambitious and wants to achieve great things. He must care about his reputation."

"He would never do something as ungrateful and harsh as forgetting his family after achieving success!"

This reassurance opened a new world for Ning Ji.

After trying it out in the black market, he found that many people indeed tolerated him because he was Ning Zhuo's relative, even going out of their way to please him.

This allowed him to wield authority, secretly accepting bribes and abusing his power to grant favors.

His days were quite comfortable, experiencing the wonders of power, even if it was just a little.

The former stewards had reported his behavior, but Ning Zhuo ignored these reports, showing no reaction.

This attitude made everything clear.

The astute former stewards followed suit, turning a blind eye to Ning Ji's corrupt actions.

After explaining many spellcasting essentials to everyone, Ning Zhuo also evaluated their mechanical constructs, purchasing the outstanding ones with spirit stones.

It's worth mentioning that Ning Zhuo, with the help of his fellow members and Chen Cha's workshop, had been acquiring mechanical constructs from outside.

He accumulated them quickly.

In his life-and-death battle with Cheng Bai, he had nearly exhausted his sixteen years of combat reserves.

In a short time, he had replenished nearly thirty percent of his previous stock!

When Ning Zhuo told his fellow members that they would explore the Lava Immortal Palace together, they were thrilled.

"Brother Zhuo, we've been waiting for this day!"

"We can finally explore the Immortal Palace with you again."

"Exploring with Brother Zhuo is so exciting!"

According to the Immortal Palace's mechanism, each person could enter the Immortal Palace three times a day.

But in reality, the trial disciples rarely used all three opportunities.

Sometimes, they didn't even explore once.

The main reason was that they couldn't gain much from exploring the Immortal Palace.

They had already obtained all the spell rewards they could from the Immortal Palace.

Each person received different spells, and they shared them with each other, quickly mastering all the spells.

This was the advantage of having many people.

They couldn't make it onto the leaderboard to receive leaderboard rewards.

At most, they could practice their mechanical skills by challenging the levels in puppet bodies.

But this efficiency was far inferior to creating mechanical constructs in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City or the workshops.

Moreover, exploring the Immortal Palace consumed soul power.

For most people, without significant progress in strength, repeated exploration was meaningless.

Soon, everyone gathered at the Lava Immortal Palace.

The puppet Ning Zhuo led the way, guiding his fellow members through the levels.

Seeing various spell rewards being effortlessly obtained by Ning Zhuo, Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.

When Ning Zhuo acquired dozens of Flying Hand mechanisms, his spellcasting prowess took a significant leap.

With the Flying Hand mechanisms casting spells alongside Ning Zhuo's puppet body, it was like dozens of cultivators attacking simultaneously.

A large number of spells erupted together, creating a grand and dangerous spectacle of intertwined spell lights.

Watching Ning Zhuo's confident and graceful demeanor, effortlessly wielding wind, thunder, fire, and lightning, his fellow members were filled with excitement.

At sixteen or seventeen, they were at the age of idolizing heroes and craving attention.

Ning Zhuo's display of elegance made them yearn from the depths of their hearts!

During breaks between levels, Ning Zhuo smiled and encouraged everyone, "You can also reach my level."

"But it requires diligent practice, a lot of time, and effort."

"To master these spells, I've also put in a lot of effort behind the scenes!"

Having exchanged a large amount of spellcasting experience through leaderboard rewards, Ning Zhuo spoke without blushing.

Seeing Ning Zhuo, who possessed talent, worked hard, and remained humble and approachable, everyone was deeply impressed.</div>
