Lava Immortal Palace, Main Hall.<br/>
<br/>
The dragon turtle fire spirit shed its usual diminutive form, once again becoming immensely large! It raised its head and roared, its dragon horns nearly crashing into the ceiling of the hall. It was furious, it was exploding with rage!<br/>
<br/>
"No, Ning Xiaohui must not leave alive!" "Absolutely not!!"<br/>
<br/>
The dragon turtle fire spirit had plotted and prepared for so many years, paying countless painful prices, to gradually weaken the Lava Immortal Palace. It sought to regain its freedom! After all the painstaking efforts, the final moment was at hand. How could it allow its grand plan to be thwarted by Ning Xiaohui!<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, that useless brat, can't be relied upon. He's been forced to act by Zhu Xuanji!" "I can only rely on myself!!"<br/>
<br/>
"I—the dragon turtle fire spirit—would rather die than be bound any longer." "I want freedom, freedom!"<br/>
<br/>
It roared to the heavens, unwilling to accept defeat, determined to risk everything. However, it was constrained by the three sect elders, even though they had long since perished. Its authority was insufficient to directly kill Ning Xiaohui. Ning was also unreliable!<br/>
<br/>
Cornered, the dragon turtle fire spirit could only resort to its old tricks, borrowing the power of the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts. Just as it had once deliberately left behind the Mechanical Demon General. But this time, its move was even grander!<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
With a loud noise, the Five Elements Tower fired, not killing many, but successfully inciting the wrath of the demon beast horde. The demon beasts began a full-scale assault, attacking madly. The dragon turtle fire spirit directed the defensive forces, deliberately reducing the mana support to the light barrier. The golden light sphere immediately weakened to sixty percent.<br/>
<br/>
Crackling sounds...<br/>
<br/>
The attacks of the demon beasts quickly caused cracks to appear on the surface of the spherical light barrier. This time, the dragon turtle fire spirit, driven to desperation, no longer increased the mana supply as before. Instead, it diverted crucial mana to other irrelevant mechanical structures.<br/>
<br/>
Bang.<br/>
<br/>
With a muffled sound, a large hole was torn open in the spherical light barrier. The Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts roared with excitement, pouring into the hole like a waterfall descending from the sky, fiercely flooding into the Lava Immortal Palace!<br/>
<br/>
Directly below the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts was the Historical Records Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
In the main hall, hundreds of fire whips formed tightly, lashing at the dragon turtle fire spirit in turns! Yet the dragon turtle fire spirit, unlike its usual fleeing demeanor, stood tall and proud, roaring continuously, exuding immense grandeur.<br/>
<br/>
"Having played the turtle for so long, who in the world knows that I was a fire dragon in life?!"<br/>
<br/>
The dragon turtle fire spirit's eyes shone like the blazing sun, enduring the fire whips' strikes, continuing its control. Numerous mechanical constructs took to the air, clashing and battling with the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts. Under the dragon turtle fire spirit's command, the mechanical constructs intentionally herded the demon beasts towards the Historical Records Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
"What sound is that?!" Ning Xiaohui felt something was amiss upon hearing the explosion. The next moment, she realized something, her face turning pale. When she opened the door of the Historical Records Pavilion and saw the surging Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts surrounding the area from all sides, with more falling from the sky, she was stunned. Intense fear enveloped her entire being. At this moment, she was petrified!<br/>
<br/>
A figure suddenly appeared nearby, casting a spell aimed at Ning Xiaohui's head. It was Yang Chanyu!<br/>
<br/>
"Don't even think about it!" At the critical moment, Zhu Zhen appeared, not only blocking Yang Chanyu's attack but also launching a counterattack. Yang Chanyu was taken aback. She hadn't expected someone to be hiding nearby. Zhu Zhen was a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, a powerful golden core cultivator dispatched to gather intelligence from other countries. Concealment and stealth were among his specialties!<br/>
<br/>
Just as Yang Chanyu blocked Zhu Zhen's counterattack, several golden core figures surrounded her. They were the golden core ancestors of the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families!<br/>
<br/>
"The fish has taken the bait, hahaha!" "It's you again, Yang Chanyu!"<br/>
<br/>
"Void Sect... You were the ones who instigated the previous golden core melee, weren't you?" The golden core cultivators of the three families gritted their teeth, wielding magical artifacts, attacking in unison. Yang Chanyu's heart sank, and she could only keep retreating. But her attempt to conceal herself failed. Zhu Zhen pursued relentlessly: "Yang Chanyu, you've been marked by my spell. You can't escape for an hour. Surrender now, you can't get away!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's pupils contracted, her body trembling with fear. She finally realized she had just brushed past death. If Zhu Zhen hadn't stopped it, she would have died at Yang Chanyu's hands. Ning Xiaohui watched the golden core cultivators battling in mid-air, slaughtering the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts, and fully understood her dire situation.<br/>
<br/>
"I am the only one who has entered the Historical Records Pavilion!" "I hold all the evidence of the true culprit!!" "It's the dragon turtle fire spirit that wants to kill me!!!" "I must escape, I must flee quickly."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui had researched the Historical Records Pavilion's information and was the most knowledgeable about the dragon turtle fire spirit on Fire Persimmon Mountain. Numerous mechanical constructs charged towards the Historical Records Pavilion. Ning Xiaohui dared not trust these mechanical puppets, knowing they were all under the dragon turtle fire spirit's command. Fortunately, the battlefield was chaotic, and she saw an opening, immediately fleeing!<br/>
<br/>
This scene was witnessed by Sun Lingtong. But he did not act!<br/>
<br/>
The dragon turtle fire spirit's massive body nearly filled the entire main hall. It couldn't command the mechanical puppets to target Ning Xiaohui. To eliminate Ning Xiaohui, it had to rely on outsiders. Originally, Ning Zhuo was its planned dagger for murder, but now that Ning Zhuo was absent, it surveyed the situation and immediately set its sights on Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Lingtong!" The next moment, the dragon turtle fire spirit's voice echoed in Sun Lingtong's ears. "Kill Ning Xiaohui!" "She has entered the Historical Records Pavilion and knows all of Ning Zhuo's secrets!" Sun Lingtong's body shuddered slightly.<br/>
<br/>
"Hurry up and act!" The dragon turtle fire spirit shouted. Sun Lingtong was stunned: "Who are you? Suddenly appearing to scare me, and trying to deceive me?!"<br/>
<br/>
Dragon turtle fire spirit: ...<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui stumbled, finding a chance to survive amidst the chaotic battlefield. Two Foundation Establishment-level Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts spotted fresh blood and charged at Ning Xiaohui. Bang bang. Two muffled sounds, the two Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were blasted apart mid-charge. It turned out to be a golden core cultivator from the Zhou family, protecting Ning Xiaohui. Ning Xiaohui quickly ran. More Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts surrounded her. Zheng Shuangjun threw his Moon Hook. The Moon Hook flew into the air, pouring out a large amount of golden core mana, forming a mana avatar of Zheng Shuangjun. The mana avatar, holding the Moon Hook, landed beside Ning Xiaohui, slaying the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts. Ning Xiaohui was saved once again.<br/>
<br/>
"Did you discover anything in the Historical Records Pavilion?" The Moon Hook avatar asked. Ning Xiaohui shuddered, waking up: "Yes! If I reveal the truth now, the dragon turtle fire spirit and Ning Zhuo will be finished. They won't have the energy to kill me anymore..." Thinking of this, Ning Xiaohui quickly shook her head, blurting out: "I was just about to read when this happened, I haven't had a chance to look yet." The Moon Hook avatar nodded, not suspecting anything: "I'll escort you out first." Ning Xiaohui: !!!!! At this moment, she was extremely shocked and terrified! The words she just said were not what she intended, but she had indeed spoken them. She was not in control of herself!<br/>
<br/>
"What's happening?!" "Why did I say that?" "I clearly wanted to reveal the truth, why can't I control myself?!!" Ning Xiaohui tried to widen her eyes, looking at the Moon Hook avatar for help. But at this moment, a golden core-level Scarlet Flame Demon Beast attacked. The Moon Hook avatar looked serious: "Run quickly, I'll hold it off!" Ning Xiaohui was only at the Qi Refining Stage, the Moon Hook avatar had to maintain distance, preventing her from being swept into the golden core-level battle. Seeing the Moon Hook avatar about to leave, Ning Xiaohui hurriedly seized this last opportunity, shouting— "Senior, please be careful!" The Moon Hook avatar was taken aback, then laughed heartily: "Little girl, you be careful. I'm just a mana avatar." "No, this isn't what I wanted to say at all!!" Ning Xiaohui screamed internally. Fear! An overwhelming fear gripped her heart tightly. Ning Xiaohui was nearly suffocating from it.<br/>
<br/>
"What on earth is happening to me?" "Why can't I speak a single truth?" "The dragon turtle fire spirit, yes, it must be it!" "This is its territory, it's interfering with me, it wants to kill me!!" Ning Xiaohui's face was ashen, devoid of any color.<br/>
<br/>
The face of the criminal puppet was equally pale. He sat in the cell, the dim light casting a sorrowful expression. Suddenly, a hidden door in the center of the stage opened, and the black-clad envoy puppet emerged. The lights on either side focused on the black-clad envoy puppet, further emphasizing the darkness of the surrounding cell. The low drumbeats accompanied each step of the black-clad envoy puppet, making the audience below the stage feel a sense of darkness and pressure.<br/>
<br/>
The criminal puppet stood up as if electrified, shouting: "I didn't confess, I didn't confess, I never said you were the real culprit!" The black-clad envoy sang in a cold voice: "Do not worry, I have a plan. As long as you confess, you will be free from disaster." After singing, he spoke softly: "Commoner, do not worry, I am here to help you escape danger." "Just confess to the crime, and I will ensure your safety!" Clang. A gong sounded, indicating the character's shock. The criminal puppet was so frightened that he took a step back, falling to the ground. He looked at the black-clad envoy, urgently singing: "The judge is an honest official, how can I falsely accuse him? I am just a commoner, how dare I cause trouble?" "This fabricated charge, how can it become true?" "Oh dear...<br/>
<br/>
The criminal puppet shook his head, slightly turning, facing the audience, spreading his hands: "How can I be so despicable? How can I turn black into white, how can I deceive the people?" The envoy puppet sneered. The sound of the jinghu suddenly rose sharply. The black-clad envoy sang: "What if he is an honest official? The people are just a rabble." "A rabble is the easiest to manipulate. As long as words are many, public opinion can be swayed." "When has the truth ever been important?" "As long as we accuse him, he will be doomed!" Thus, the second act of "Seeking Justice" came to a close.</div>
