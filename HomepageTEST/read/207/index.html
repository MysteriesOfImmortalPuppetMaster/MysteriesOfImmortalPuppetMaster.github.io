<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The envoy from the Ning family patriarch came to find Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's expression was not pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
She had been deeply immersed in her cultivation, only to be interrupted by an outsider.<br/>
<br/>
"You better have something important, or else..." Ning Xiaohui looked at the envoy, her gaze dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Her cultivation was stuck at the third level of Qi Refining Stage, but she possessed the Innate Talent Ice Jade Hand.<br/>
<br/>
The latter was her main focus in cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, she participated in the forging of the Zheng family's Mechanical Black Snake Weapon, gaining significant insights, especially in the profound mysteries of the Ice Jade Hand.<br/>
<br/>
The Zheng family's mechanical weapon was extremely fierce, filled with killing intent.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui used her innate talent to help the mechanical weapon survive a deadly situation.<br/>
<br/>
This forging process had a strong impact on her, and on the night she returned, she discovered that her innate talent had greatly improved, even to the point of being able to repair Golden Core Stage items!<br/>
<br/>
Previously, when her soul entered the Immortal Palace, she could use her innate talent to repair puppet bodies, but the grade of the items repaired by her talent was not high.<br/>
<br/>
This time, she found that she even had a certain ability to repair Golden Core Stage items.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Xiaohui used her Innate Talent Ice Jade Hand, she could freeze damaged items into ice blocks.<br/>
<br/>
After the ice melted, the damaged items often had their defects mended.<br/>
<br/>
For example, cracks would be filled, and wounds or flaws would grow and heal like trees.<br/>
<br/>
The envoy waited for a long time before finally seeing Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
He first brought her good news and then handed her a jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
The jade slip contained the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique from the fourth to the sixth layer.<br/>
<br/>
"Good, good, good. With this, I can finally advance to the mid-stage of Qi Refining." "I will have more mana and be able to use my innate talent more frequently."<br/>
<br/>
"Wait." Suddenly, Ning Xiaohui's expression changed slightly.<br/>
<br/>
She thought of a possibility and asked, "How did you get this? After I left, did the three families successfully defeat the Mechanical Ape?"<br/>
<br/>
The envoy knew the details and had intended to keep them hidden, but since Ning Xiaohui specifically asked, he had to reveal the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Upon learning that Ning Zhuo was the one who succeeded in the challenge and obtained the subsequent techniques, Ning Xiaohui's brows furrowed deeply.<br/>
<br/>
"Him?!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's lips twitched, still in disbelief: "How could it be Ning Zhuo? How could he have such strength?"<br/>
<br/>
Envoy: "He really does..."<br/>
<br/>
"In this exploration of the Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo led the charge alone, displaying a variety of techniques." "He led his trusted followers, breaking through all obstacles."<br/>
<br/>
"The reformation team followed behind him, only playing a minor role as cannon fodder during the battle with the Mechanical Ape." "Ning Zhuo ultimately repelled the Mechanical Ape, reached the second Dao Gate, and obtained the subsequent techniques." "You should know, the City Lord's Mansion recently revealed that Meng Chong and others were practicing the techniques from the fourth to the sixth layer." "This means that our Ning family's reformation team has caught up with the City Lord's Mansion!"<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph..."<br/>
<br/>
The envoy, filled with strong family pride, spoke with increasing enthusiasm, not noticing the growing dark cloud on Ning Xiaohui's face.<br/>
<br/>
Sensing Ning Xiaohui's icy gaze, the envoy immediately shut his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's fingers, gripping the jade slip of the technique, turned white from the force.<br/>
<br/>
"Good, good, good." Ning Xiaohui gritted her teeth and spat out three words.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, she didn't know what to say.<br/>
<br/>
It was because of Ning Zhuo that she was forced to leave the reformation team and take the path of entering the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Since she left, she had been progressing smoothly, even participating in the forging of Golden Core Stage items.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Xiaohui was inherently proud.<br/>
<br/>
As a member of the main branch, she couldn't accept being driven away by a branch member.<br/>
<br/>
She harbored extreme hatred for Ning Zhuo and was determined to seek revenge.<br/>
<br/>
She had become a different person since leaving the reformation team, cutting off all leisure and rest, seizing every moment for cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever she was exhausted and felt she couldn't go on, she would think of Ning Zhuo's face, instantly gaining immense motivation.<br/>
<br/>
Her cultivation was almost maniacal, to the point where even her grandmother couldn't bear to watch, repeatedly forcing her to rest.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's plan was simple: to cultivate her innate talent madly, preparing to reclaim her honor in the future.<br/>
<br/>
But now, she suddenly heard of Ning Zhuo's great success!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui was deeply shocked.<br/>
<br/>
She had never imagined that Ning Zhuo would one day catch up with Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
After all, Meng Chong possessed Immortal Talent!<br/>
<br/>
But the fact was as it was.<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps, in this lifetime, I may never catch up to Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, she realized that in the field of mechanical techniques, there was a chasm between her and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The gap was so vast that no matter how hard she worked, she might never close it!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui, who had always been proud of her main branch status, now realized that she might never surpass Ning Zhuo, a member of the branch family.<br/>
<br/>
This realization brought her immense pain and frustration!<br/>
<br/>
The jade slip recording the technique felt cold, but at this moment, Ning Xiaohui found it unbearably hot.<br/>
<br/>
She wanted to throw it away, smash it on the ground, and shout proudly, "This is Ning Zhuo's doing, I disdain it! I will earn the subsequent techniques on my own!"<br/>
<br/>
But she couldn't do that.<br/>
<br/>
After taking the path of entering the Immortal Palace, she discovered many new opportunities and understood that to obtain the subsequent techniques, she would have to go through the trial checkpoints.<br/>
<br/>
She no longer had the face to enter the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
If discovered, she would be ostracized and ridiculed.<br/>
<br/>
Being ostracized was one thing, but the thought of being mocked by other trial disciples made Ning Xiaohui lose the courage to enter the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
This feeling was worse than death!<br/>
<br/>
She couldn't bear it.<br/>
<br/>
"So, to seek the subsequent techniques, I can only rely on Ning Zhuo's."<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it, damn it!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui, knowing shame and courage, wanted to become stronger, desperately wanted to become stronger.<br/>
<br/>
But to become stronger, she had to practice the subsequent techniques obtained by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
This made Ning Xiaohui feel like she had swallowed a fly, extremely uncomfortable and awkward.<br/>
<br/>
The envoy, observing her expression, quickly tried to comfort her, informing her that the subsequent techniques had already been purchased by the Ning family patriarch.<br/>
<br/>
"What?!" Ning Xiaohui was stunned.<br/>
<br/>
She immediately felt much better!<br/>
<br/>
She snorted coldly, disparagingly: "This Ning Zhuo is so selfish and self-serving." "He is a member of the Ning family, raised under the family's protection, and now he uses his achievements to leverage the family?" "Where is his loyalty?"<br/>
<br/>
"He actually dares to openly trade these things with the family?" "What does he take the family for? A white-eyed wolf!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui had never seen such behavior from a branch member!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's actions made her extremely disgusted and repulsed.<br/>
<br/>
The envoy, bracing himself, said, "The jade slip of the technique has been brought. There is also another important matter concerning the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman." "Under the patriarch's orders, I am here to retrieve this talisman from you."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui was taken aback: "What?"<br/>
<br/>
"No way." She instinctively opposed.<br/>
<br/>
She had always kept the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman close, using her innate talent and mana to nurture and refine it daily.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the family wanted to take the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, leaving Ning Xiaohui unprepared.<br/>
<br/>
She felt puzzled: "Why? I just got the subsequent techniques and am about to practice diligently. I need the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman."<br/>
<br/>
The envoy hesitated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui, being smart, thought of a possibility and showed a hint of anger: "What do you mean?" "Are you planning to give the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman to Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
"Exactly!" The envoy sighed, his face full of bitterness, "This is part of the deal between Ning Zhuo and the patriarch."<br/>
<br/>
"Outrageous!"<br/>
<br/>
"A branch member dares to make such demands, how audacious!"<br/>
<br/>
"The patriarch actually conceded to this extent? So weak? Letting a mere branch member ride roughshod over us?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui screamed in anger.<br/>
<br/>
"The Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman contains spirituality and is a family treasure. It should be used by the main branch first, not given to a branch member?" "This is turning the world upside down!"<br/>
<br/>
"Who is really in charge of the Ning family?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's face turned livid as she scolded.<br/>
<br/>
The envoy lowered his head, silently enduring the scolding.<br/>
<br/>
He had anticipated Ning Xiaohui's reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui cursed Ning Zhuo fiercely for a long time, until she was exhausted and stopped.<br/>
<br/>
The envoy took the opportunity to explain that he was just a small figure, and the order was made by the patriarch.<br/>
<br/>
He pleaded with Ning Xiaohui not to make things difficult for him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly: "Wait here, I will go talk to my grandmother about this!"<br/>
<br/>
However, when Ning Xiaohui's grandmother heard about this, she instead persuaded Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo is not someone to be trifled with."<br/>
<br/>
"He has many means, and there are experts from the branch family guiding him. Even Ning Xiaoren, the young patriarch, was brought down by him." "Now, he controls the black market, with many Foundation Establishment elites under him, and the entire branch family stands behind him." "He also has close ties with the Zhou and Zheng families."<br/>
<br/>
"Most importantly, he has caught the eye of our family's ancestor. The latter publicly stated that Ning Zhuo has contributed to our Ning family!"<br/>
<br/>
"Xiaohui, a gentleman's revenge is never too late."<br/>
<br/>
"Right now, Ning Zhuo is in the limelight. We can bide our time, wait for his momentum to wane, and then take revenge. It's not too late." "A small impatience will spoil great plans. It's okay to endure for now."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui pouted, holding her grandmother's arm, shaking it and acting coquettishly.<br/>
<br/>
But this time, her grandmother was resolute: "Xiaohui, how do you compare to Ning Xiaoren?" "If you go against him at this critical moment, you might end up in prison too!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's face turned pale: "Grandmother, with you protecting me, how could I..."<br/>
<br/>
Her grandmother interrupted directly: "I am just an elder. Look at the patriarch, his status is much higher and more important than mine. Did he manage to protect his own son?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's lips trembled, unable to respond for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, she handed the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman to the envoy with a livid face.<br/>
<br/>
The envoy, having obtained the talisman, quickly took his leave, not daring to stay any longer.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui watched the envoy's departing figure, almost grinding her teeth to pieces.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
"I will repay today's humiliation a hundredfold!" "Hmph, your good days won't last long."<br/>
<br/>
"I have discovered that entering the Immortal Palace is the key. Once I accumulate enough contributions, I can exchange for a position in the Immortal Palace." "The highest position should be the Palace Master."<br/>
<br/>
"I have the Innate Talent Ice Jade Hand and am close to meeting the standard to exchange for the position of a healer." "With the healer position, my contribution accumulation speed will increase by more than five times, and I will progress rapidly."<br/>
<br/>
"My future cultivation, contributions, and position will all crush you!" "I remember all our grievances clearly." "One day, I will settle the score with you!"</div>
