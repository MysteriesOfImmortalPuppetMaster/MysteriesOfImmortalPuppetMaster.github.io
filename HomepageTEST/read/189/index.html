Underground Secret Base.<br/>
<br/>
A massive blood transformation pool, resembling a coffin, hung from the ceiling beam of the room.<br/>
<br/>
A thick golden curved pipe extended from the blood transformation pool.<br/>
<br/>
The pipe connected to a gigantic blood oil bottle, filled with turbid essence blood, appearing black and red.<br/>
<br/>
From the bottom of the blood oil bottle, five or six pipes extended.<br/>
<br/>
These pipes were ultimately inserted into the back of a mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the mechanical ape, Yuan Dasheng's spirit was fully exerting the ninth layer of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Essence blood was continuously infused from the blood oil bottle into Yuan Dasheng's mechanical body.<br/>
<br/>
Then, under the operation of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, it transformed into demonic essence blood.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged opposite Ai Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Between him and Yuan Dasheng, as well as around them, was a simple and somewhat hasty formation.<br/>
<br/>
The formation emitted a faint red light and a slight bloody smell.<br/>
<br/>
The ninth layer of demonic essence blood cultivated by Yuan Dasheng was purified through this formation and finally entered Ning Zhuo's body.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then used the seventh layer of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to continuously convert it, removing the essence blood that did not conform to his own, and continuously accumulating his Qi Sea cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Often, out of ten portions of demonic essence blood, only two to three portions could be used by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
But by doing so, Ning Zhuo did not need to cultivate himself, saving him a lot of time.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, as long as the scale was large enough, theoretically, his Qi Sea cultivation speed would be extremely exaggerated!<br/>
<br/>
"Having clan members is really good."<br/>
<br/>
"How can I expand the number of clan members so that I can obtain more blood and flesh?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had been pondering this question.<br/>
<br/>
After tasting the enormous benefits, he found it hard to extricate himself.<br/>
<br/>
But he did not lose his reason.<br/>
<br/>
He was very clear: his large-scale public acquisition of clan members' blood and flesh had already entered a rather gray area.<br/>
<br/>
Just one more step forward, and he would be suspected of cultivating demonic arts.<br/>
<br/>
He had been too high-profile recently, violating his principle of always hiding his strength.<br/>
<br/>
Now, many people were watching him, waiting for him to make a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, his large-scale procurement of clan members' blood and flesh was like retrieving chestnuts from the fire, extremely risky.<br/>
<br/>
Although he did it under the pretext of "developing puppet mechanisms," to show the public.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Houjun and Ning Youfu, the former elders of two branches, had sent people or letters to remind Ning Zhuo to be extremely cautious about his reputation!<br/>
<br/>
The scale could not be expanded any further.<br/>
<br/>
If it expanded further, it would be very easy to be accused and have his reputation ruined.<br/>
<br/>
And reputation was extremely important for righteous cultivators!<br/>
<br/>
Crack.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the left arm of the mechanical ape made a muffled sound and then broke off at the elbow.<br/>
<br/>
Then, as if triggering a chain reaction, the shoulder, chest, and abdomen of the mechanical ape all burst out with mechanical fragments.<br/>
<br/>
A large amount of essence blood spurted out.<br/>
<br/>
In the torrent of blood, the mechanical ape could not bear the burden and shattered into pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned.<br/>
<br/>
He was neither surprised nor distressed, after all, the mechanical ape was typically crudely made.<br/>
<br/>
However, this was already the one hundred and thirty-second one.<br/>
<br/>
The broken remains had already piled up into a small hill.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked up at the ceiling beam.<br/>
<br/>
The giant blood transformation pool and blood oil bottle hanging there also showed fine lines, with signs of disintegration.<br/>
<br/>
"It's time to properly create a mechanical ape," Ning Zhuo thought.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, he and Sun Lingtong had been crudely making them, mainly to quickly break through to the seventh layer.<br/>
<br/>
After reaching the seventh layer, Ning Zhuo's cultivation of the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit broke through the bottleneck and could continue to rise.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Ning Zhuo had reached the seventh layer of cultivation, he needed to focus on the future.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, he needed a Golden Core Stage mechanical ape to fully utilize Yuan Dasheng's spirit, and on the other hand, he needed a mechanical ape that could produce higher quality essence blood.<br/>
<br/>
Combining the two, Ning Zhuo decided to immediately start refining a new mechanical body for Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
He took the initiative to invite Zheng Jian to jointly refine the mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian was very surprised.<br/>
<br/>
Last time, he had learned a lot of mechanical knowledge from Ning Zhuo and was quite impressed with Ning Zhuo's mechanical skills.<br/>
<br/>
"I wonder what ingenious ideas Brother Ning has this time?" Zheng Jian asked Ning Zhuo for guidance.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: "I might disappoint you, Brother Zheng. This time, my refining of the mechanism is different from last time..." After explaining, Zheng Jian indeed showed a disappointed expression.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that Ning Zhuo did not intend to disclose the mechanical design, but needed high-quality materials refined with the help of the Zheng family and Zheng Jian.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded, thinking that with his friendship with Ning Zhuo, he could help refine the materials once.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took out the Scarlet Sun Copper.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian was astonished.<br/>
<br/>
"This kind of Golden Core Stage copper material requires extremely high firepower to melt. No wonder Brother Ning came to me."<br/>
<br/>
"But I am only at the Qi Refining Stage. Brother Ning, you might be overestimating me."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo indicated that other cultivators from the Zheng family could be invited to do the work.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian then nodded: "As long as Brother Ning can afford the price, with our friendship, I will surely help you invite the experts from the clan!"<br/>
<br/>
"The price is negotiable." Ning Zhuo appeared very straightforward.<br/>
<br/>
The expert from the Zheng family invited by Zheng Jian quoted a high price.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled and bargained: "What if I need not only the Scarlet Sun Copper refined?" He took out the second material.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, the expert from the Zheng family frowned after looking at it: "This Ten Thousand Mechanisms Black Iron requires painstaking effort, at least ten thousand strikes."<br/>
<br/>
"Although it is a Golden Core Stage material, it consumes too much labor."<br/>
<br/>
"I don't have much time to take private jobs. There are many important tasks in the clan pressing on my shoulders."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took out the third material.<br/>
<br/>
This time, the expert from the Zheng family directly shook his head, indicating it was impossible.<br/>
<br/>
"Unless it's the Golden Core Stage, it can be directly refined."<br/>
<br/>
"I am only at the Foundation Establishment Stage and need to borrow the Heaven-character refining room to have a chance to melt it."<br/>
<br/>
"But currently, the Heaven-character refining room is occupied."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then asked how long it would take for the room to be available.<br/>
<br/>
"That is uncertain. I advise you not to have too much expectation." The expert from the Zheng family was very honest.<br/>
<br/>
After leaving the Zheng family, Ning Zhuo soon contacted Zhou Zeshen.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen praised: "Brother Ning is truly ambitious, daring to touch Golden Core Stage mechanical constructs at the Qi Refining Stage. Such a grand gesture! Remarkable, remarkable!"<br/>
<br/>
"I am willing to fully support you!"<br/>
<br/>
As a result, when Ning Zhuo mentioned the specific requirements, Zhou Zeshen expressed considerable difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Ning, you want to set up formations on these Golden Core Stage materials, and such a large, dense formation at that. I, Zhou Zeshen, cannot do it."<br/>
<br/>
"The Foundation Establishment cultivators in my family can barely manage, but it requires a lot of manpower working together."<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, the construction period will be very long."<br/>
<br/>
After calculating, Ning Zhuo found that the remuneration from the Zhou family was very high, and with more people, the cost made Ning Zhuo feel quite strained.<br/>
<br/>
However, when Ning Zhuo summoned the former stewards under his command and assigned them the task of making talismans, he received good feedback.<br/>
<br/>
These elite Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Ning family all expressed their willingness to refine various martial arts talismans for Ning Zhuo for free.<br/>
<br/>
However, how could Ning Zhuo agree?<br/>
<br/>
Saving spirit stones was not important.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not want to take the lead in breaking his own rules and the hard-earned team atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
Paying his subordinates was far more valuable than paying the Zheng family or Zhou family!<br/>
<br/>
After comprehensive calculations, Ning Zhuo found that if he paid spirit stones, he could barely reach one-third of the project volume.<br/>
<br/>
This was not because the Zhou family or Zheng family deliberately raised prices; in fact, their prices were already quite fair compared to the market.<br/>
<br/>
Materials reaching the Golden Core Stage made Ning Zhuo's accumulated funds seem very shallow!<br/>
<br/>
His idea of jointly refining mechanisms with various forces was good, but when implemented in reality, many difficulties arose.<br/>
<br/>
After thinking for a while, Ning Zhuo came up with a solution.<br/>
<br/>
"It's time to expose some information about Meng Chong!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo secretly leaked the information about Meng Chong's achievements and the acquisition of the fourth to sixth layers of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique to the three major families through the Turtle Breath Gang.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen exclaimed: "Meng Chong is indeed formidable! The City Lord's Mansion is far ahead!"<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian clenched his fists: "I must obtain the subsequent techniques. Being stuck at the third layer is really unbearable."<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch and elders discussed: "The Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique left by the three sect masters has great potential. The subsequent techniques are a major matter for our clan."<br/>
<br/>
The elders discussed: "Who can take on this important task?"<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui has already left the reformation team."<br/>
<br/>
After a brief discussion, the elders' minds all turned to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
For the Ning family to obtain the subsequent techniques, it seemed, perhaps, they could only rely on Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
The elders continued to discuss: "Although personally very averse, I have to admit that Ning Zhuo is capable."<br/>
<br/>
"The key is, with Ning Zhuo's character, even if he obtains the subsequent techniques, will he hand them over to the clan?"<br/>
<br/>
At this point, the elders looked at each other and fell into silence.<br/>
<br/>
After a long time, someone broke the silence and looked at the Ning family patriarch: "Ning Zhuo loves money. Please, patriarch, communicate with him more."<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch nodded with a grim expression.<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking about Ning Zhuo gave him a headache.<br/>
<br/>
There were two routes to explore the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the palace physically could earn merit points to exchange for various cultivation resources.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the palace spiritually required passing numerous tests but could obtain the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
And this was a reward that those who entered the palace physically could not obtain.<br/>
<br/>
In the arrangement of the three sect masters, entering the palace physically was for outsiders and guest cultivators, while entering the palace spiritually was for cultivating their own people, and the true transmission secrets would not be made public.<br/>
<br/>
For the three families, they had deeply studied the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Even with only three layers, they found this technique extremely excellent.<br/>
<br/>
Their desire for the subsequent techniques had always been there, silently accumulating.<br/>
<br/>
And this desire was precisely what Ning Zhuo discovered and manipulated as "puppet strings."<br/>
<br/>
Without Ning Zhuo seeking them out, Zhou Zeshen and Zheng Jian took the initiative to find him.<br/>
<br/>
They did not know how many tests needed to be passed to obtain the technique rewards.<br/>
<br/>
But they knew that Ning Zhuo was very strong and had great conflicts with the main branch of the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
If they could invite Ning Zhuo to assist, it would be very beneficial for their exploration of the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Strengthening their relationship with Ning Zhuo and supporting him would be advantageous for the potential second internal conflict within the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
This multi-benefit approach made the Zhou and Zheng families, who harbored ulterior motives, enthusiastic and willing to offer discounts to Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
The problem troubling Ning Zhuo was thus resolved.<br/>
<br/>
The main branch of the Ning family was furious upon learning of Ning Zhuo's cooperation with the Zhou and Zheng families.<br/>
<br/>
Many wanted to take this opportunity to accuse him of colluding with outsiders and disregarding the clan's interests, thereby ruining Ning Zhuo's reputation.<br/>
<br/>
But they were persuaded to stop.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch, pinching his nose, once again summoned Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gladly went.<br/>
<br/>
After returning, the sound of things being smashed was heard again from the Ning family patriarch's study.</div>
