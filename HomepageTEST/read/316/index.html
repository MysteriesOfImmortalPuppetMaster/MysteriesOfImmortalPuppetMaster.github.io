<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The Scarlet Flame Beasts converged like a tide, layer upon layer, continuously landing on the Lava Immortal Palace, launching a frenzied assault on the palace's interior.<br/>
<br/>
Fire Persimmon Mountain occasionally trembled, a residual effect of the massive eruptions. Above the mountain's peak, smoke and dust billowed. The lava demons that once densely populated the sky had already submerged back into the magma. This was due to the frequent clashes of Nascent Soul-level cultivators in mid-air, with each strike's aftermath being unbearable for these lava demons.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui wielded his magical power, advancing and retreating in tight coordination, entangling with the fire snakes, flame lizards, and the Fire Fusion Demon Ape, these three Nascent Soul-level beasts. Meng Kui held back some strength, constantly probing for the hidden Five-Tailed Fire Fox among the beast horde. This fox, evidently a Nascent Soul-level beast from the Great Purity Palace, possessed intelligence far surpassing that of wild beasts, posing a greater threat than the three Scarlet Flame Nascent Soul beasts!<br/>
<br/>
Several miles away from Fire Persimmon Mountain, Meng Hu clashed fiercely with a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Great Purity Palace. The cultivator specialized in beast taming, but his main beast was still at the mountain's entrance, forcing him into a defensive position, unable to attack. Fortunately, he wielded the Fate Shield, combining defense with offense, steadfastly guarding his position, making it extremely difficult for Meng Hu to shake his battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
Within the inner circle of the Lava Immortal Palace, the mechanical techniques entry standards  process weakened, allowing Golden Core stage cultivators without mechanical expertise to enter and exit the palace. In an instant, more than ten Golden Core cultivators emerged from various places. Their target was almost unanimously the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace!<br/>
<br/>
Most of them were clad in black robes, their appearances strikingly similar. Shadow Demon Cultivators! The original number of Golden Core cultivators in the Lava Immortal Palace was relatively small, making it difficult to resist so many Shadow Demon Cultivators. In fact, many from the righteous path were disguised as Shadow Demon Cultivators. Knowing they were their own people in disguise, they naturally held back during interceptions. As a result, a large number of Golden Core cultivators rushed directly to the vicinity of the main hall.<br/>
<br/>
They couldn't get in! They were all blocked by the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, with purple-blue currents shuttling and connecting between the pavilion's blocks, weaving into an all-encompassing electric net. The attacks of the Golden Core cultivators fell on the electric net, only to be devoured by the purple-blue currents. When they reappeared, they landed outside the Lava Immortal Palace, amidst countless Scarlet Flame Beasts.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suddenly leaped, jumping directly into the purple-blue electric net. The next moment, the currents swallowed him. When Sun Lingtong came to his senses, he had already been transported into a secret pavilion. Many Golden Core cultivators witnessed this scene. Some tried to imitate him, but their Golden Core cultivation became the biggest obstacle. Only those at the Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment stages had a chance to enter.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, many Golden Core cultivators were even willing to endure the restrictions, suppressing their cultivation to the Foundation Establishment level. They tried repeatedly, each displaying their own methods, but all failed. Ning Jiufan, Zhou Nongying, and Zheng Shuangjun, among others, escorted their respective low-level cultivators to the vicinity of the main hall.<br/>
<br/>
"Clan Leader Ning Zhuo, we're here to help you!" Ning Xiangkun, Ning Xiangqian, Ning Chen, and Ning Yong all leaped, being transported into the secret pavilion by the currents. "The Lava Immortal Palace is too damaged, the restrictions weakened. Perhaps we, the eliminated trial disciples, can still become the palace master by sitting on the throne?" With hope in their hearts, Zhou Zhu, Zhou Zeshen, and others also set out one after another.<br/>
<br/>
Among the Ning family crowd, Ning Xiaoren kept his head down, wearing a hood, deciding to take a risk. He had been found colluding with outsiders, severely damaging his status and prospects within the family. More crucially, he had been actively sacrificed by the Ning Family Clan Leader. Thus, Ning Xiaoren had a falling out with his father, relying solely on himself. He resolutely leaped into the mechanical secret pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
"Xiaohui, Xiaohui, you're here, you must be here, right? Don't be afraid, grandma is coming to find you!" Ning Xiaohui's grandmother murmured continuously, diving into the secret pavilion. Under the escort of several Golden Core cultivators from the Meng family, Li Duolun, Feng Dao, and Guan Tiesuo led the reformation team, all entering the Secret Pavilion of OpportunitiesTurtle Breath Gang's leader concealed himself, also sneaking in.<br/>
<br/>
A Shadow Demon Cultivator, after several failed attempts, suddenly struck. He no longer attacked the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities but instead targeted the low-level cultivators preparing to enter the pavilion! "If I can't get in, why should you low-level cultivators be able to?" He roared, his attack filled with anger, blocked by the vigilant Golden Core cultivators. "Demonic path scum, you deserve to die!" The righteous path cultivators were furious, launching a counterattack.<br/>
<br/>
The other cultivators quickly distanced themselves. During this process, several Golden Core cultivators attacked the cultivators beside them. Two Golden Core cultivators from the Great Purity Palace, disguised as Shadow Demon Cultivators, attacked Zheng Shuangjun together. Zhou Nongying, disguised as a Shadow Demon Cultivator, also attacked him. From the heart's perspective, traitors are often more hateful than enemies!<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun, holding a Sun Hook, faced the siege of three opponents of the same level, lamenting his predicament, retreating step by step. His divine consciousness swept over Ning Jiufan, quickly transmitting a message: "Brother Ning, name your price, can you return my Moon Hook?" It turned out that he had previously used the Moon Hook to stab Ning Jiufan in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities. As a result, Ning Jiufan took the opportunity to suppress the Moon Hook, and in the final battle, dragged the nearby Zheng Shuangjun down with him, eliminating them together.<br/>
<br/>
After being transported back, they each returned to their original positions. Zheng Shuangjun wanted to retrieve the Moon Hook, but before he could make a move, he had to protect the low-level cultivators of the Zheng family and head to the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities amidst the chaos. Although everyone knew that the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities no longer restricted cultivation, with Zhu Xuanji and others having already returned to the Golden Core stage, the low-level cultivators were no match for them.<br/>
<br/>
But the victory mechanism was to break through the pavilion and enter the main hall. Since the three families had fought to this extent, they naturally wouldn't retreat at the final critical moment. These family cultivators, occupying various Secret Pavilions of Opportunities, would have firsthand information to transmit. If the restrictions completely collapsed, even cultivators without the qualification for the palace trial might enter the main hall and seize the palace master position by chance.<br/>
<br/>
The three families considered this, and the City Lord's Mansion thought the same. The lone Golden Core cultivators who ventured in also realized this, targeting these low-level cultivators, acting out of self-interest rather than mere anger. For a time, Golden Core cultivators surrounded the main hall, attacking each other. Various artifacts, magical artifacts, and spells were displayed in succession, dazzling and brilliant.<br/>
<br/>
Some cultivators, after fighting for a while, voluntarily withdrew from the battle group, heading to various parts of the Lava Immortal Palace, where there were no restrictions or the restrictions were weak, beginning to plunder with all their might. Some cultivators, with clear objectives, continued to attack the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, attempting to break through and directly storm the main hall. Others came with heavy responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the two Golden Core true disciples of the Great Purity Palace fought more fiercely, filled with murderous intent, aiming to kill Zheng Shuangjun. Zhou Nongying, after a brief involvement, withdrew himself. The intensity of the battle between Zheng Shuangjun and the two Golden Core disciples of the Great Purity Palace quickly escalated, making him feel increasingly strained and unwilling to take on excessive risks, choosing to retreat first.<br/>
<br/>
"It's really lively, I like it, hahaha." Luo Shang also entered the Immortal Palace, but he didn't participate in the inner battle group, instead continuously attacking the Scarlet Flame Beasts. He slaughtered them and extracted their demonic souls. These souls were among the best cultivation resources for the Soul Devouring Sect. Luo Shang secretly watched the Golden Core cultivators' battle group, ready to lend a hand and send someone to their death, thereby obtaining the souls of human cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
The Book Master used his magical power to condense his lower body, unable to heal in time, launching a fierce attack on the beasts. The Meng family's Golden Core cultivators were the most numerous, becoming the backbone at this moment, struggling to resist the various assaults of the beast tide. The Golden Core true disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion lost an arm, though eliminated, he still fiercely attacked the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, holding onto a last glimmer of hope. Yang Chanyu hid in the shadows, not making a move. Severely injured, she chose to heal before fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere was a battlefield! Between beasts and cultivators, between cultivators themselves, all vying for supremacy. Since the Lava Immortal Palace was blown open months ago, the struggle for it among cultivators had reached its most intense stage today!<br/>
<br/>
Within the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, Zhu Xuanji and other Golden Core cultivators frowned. The influx of numerous low-level cultivators into various pavilions greatly diminished their divine ط consciousness' detection effectiveness. As long as Golden Core cultivators concealed and disguised their aura, reaching the Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment level, they could blend in with the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Chong!" Ning Zhuo tightly focused on Meng Chong's position, swiftly crossing one pavilion after another, relentlessly pursuing. He used the Cloud Concealment Bud, hiding his presence, even when encountering Ning Yong midway, he didn't reveal himself. Each time he pushed open a door, there was a flaw. However, even if discovered, it didn't matter. At this point, he couldn't care less about these things. Letting Meng Chong enter the main hall would be the worst outcome.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it, damn it!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit watched as Ning Zhuo got closer to Meng Chong, gritting its teeth in anger, yet helpless. The Lava Immortal Palace's restrictions had greatly diminished, but it was still restrained, not gaining much freedom.<br/>
<br/>
On the other side, Zhu Zhen once again contacted Zhu Xuanji: "Cousin, I've successfully condensed, and this is a relic from the Fourth Golden Furnace. Do you still need it?" "Send it over." Zhu Xuanji responded while on the move. Official Technique—Crossing!<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Zhu Xuanji held the waste material, activating his innate talent. The mysterious cultivator with the purple light trace once again "appeared" in Zhu Xuanji's eyes. He seemed heavily injured, trudging with difficulty, his body burdened as if carrying a thousand pounds, each step arduous. Eventually, he reached the Fourth Golden Furnace, opening it. He climbed inside!<br/>
<br/>
Flames surged, the furnace silent. The flames gradually extinguished, and a figure descended, landing in front of the furnace. The furnace collapsed, and a mass of spirit, like a homing swallow, flew into the descending figure. The figure, originally rigid, became agile with the spirit's entry. The figure moved, observing itself, and as it did, the hooded robe covering it revealed its true face before Zhu Xuanji's eyes. It was the Buddha Healer!</div>
