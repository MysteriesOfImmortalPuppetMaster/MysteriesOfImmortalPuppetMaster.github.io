"Don't kill!" Sun Lingtong shouted.<br/>
<br/>
Without needing his reminder, Ning Zhuo had already given the order to the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng, being a martial arts grandmaster, could control his actions with ease and immediately halted his attack.<br/>
<br/>
"Xiao Zhuo, use the talismans I gave you!" Sun Lingtong added.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, "Don't worry, boss, I'm familiar with these."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took out several talismans and rushed to Cheng Bai, sticking them on his three dantians and other vital points.<br/>
<br/>
The talismans activated, emitting a continuous glow that completely sealed Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
"Hurry and leave!" Sun Lingtong urged before his vision went black, and he fainted.<br/>
<br/>
At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui's expression slightly changed as he observed the outcome of the battle between Cheng Bai and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The result of this battle surprised him somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
When he saw Ning Zhuo applying the talismans without immediately taking Cheng Bai's life, his brows furrowed even more.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, he murmured softly, sending a transmission.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Han and Fei Si had been on standby.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Han immediately soared into the sky, heading towards the site of Cheng Bai's defeat.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's retreat was very timely.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Chi Han landed, the place was already a wasteland, devoid of any people.<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, too late." Chi Han quickly used a spell, attempting to find some clues.<br/>
<br/>
How could Ning Zhuo have left any obvious traces?<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Chi Han in action, Zhu Xuanji, who was hundreds of miles away, immediately felt a stir in his heart, "The City Lord's Mansion has started to intervene. Meng Kui's divine technique is coming to an end!" Zhu Xuanji immediately realized this.<br/>
<br/>
When the entire fate energy field was activated, the City Lord's Mansion, under Meng Kui's orders, had retracted all its tendrils, remaining inactive and watching from the sidelines.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji understood: This was because the City Lord's Mansion and Meng Kui's fate energy were intertwined, especially Fei Si and Chi Han, who were Meng Kui's right-hand men, their fate energy closely linked and inseparable.<br/>
<br/>
If the two of them were drawn into the fate energy field, Meng Kui would be unsettled and also implicated.<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Kui's divine technique ended very quickly this time, far beyond my expectations."<br/>
<br/>
"According to previous battle records, he could sustain the technique for a long time. This time, he restrained himself a lot, considering the citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City."<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps, he is also taking care of the Lava Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
"The performance of the Lava Immortal Palace under the beast horde attack was far below expectations. Sigh, its weakness also far exceeded my expectations."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji ceased observing the battle and moved once more.<br/>
<br/>
He cautiously advanced towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
During this process, whenever the wind chime rang, he would halt and retreat a certain distance, ensuring his fate energy remained unaffected.<br/>
<br/>
As Zhu Xuanji had anticipated, the intangible and formless field of fortune was rapidly contracting.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the speed of this contraction was increasing.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhou retracted the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng and, along with Sun Lingtong and Cheng Bai, arrived at an underground base.<br/>
<br/>
For over a decade, he and Sun Lingtong had secretly searched for gaps in the Immortal City, constructing more than twenty underground bases in secret.<br/>
<br/>
Many of these bases had never been used since their construction.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhou typically only used one of these underground bases—the one his mother had left for him, which had also once held Han Ming captive.<br/>
<br/>
This particular underground base was small in space.<br/>
<br/>
Since its completion, Ning Zhuo had never returned.<br/>
<br/>
Primarily, it housed a healing formation.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the solid materials used, with almost no regard for cost, the healing effects were exceptionally outstanding.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of his battle with Cheng Bai, Ning Zhuo had continuously teleported, deliberately exposing over a dozen underground bases to exhaust his formidable enemy.<br/>
<br/>
However, there was no need to expose this healing-focused underground base.<br/>
<br/>
Such exposure would be a pure waste, and Ning Zhuo was not foolish.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, when Sun Lingtong awoke again, weakly opening his eyes, he found himself within the formation.<br/>
<br/>
The ineffective green light points swiftly merged into his body, vigorously repairing his physical injuries.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Sun Lingtong woke up, he said, "Little Zhuo! Help me up, I need to disarm Cheng Bai!" Ning Zhuo immediately stopped the healing formation and brought Sun Lingtong out.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was extremely weak.<br/>
<br/>
In the recent battle, both his body and soul had been severely injured, the wounds terrifying.<br/>
<br/>
If not for the nearly miraculous Autumn Life-Saving Pill, he would likely have already perished.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, unable to walk on his own, leaned on Ning Zhuo for support, breathing heavily, his face pale, and soon a layer of cold sweat appeared on his forehead.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss, can you manage?" Ning Zhuo asked with concern.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong extended his small hand, "Give me a Vigorous Spirit Pill."<br/>
<br/>
This pill could make a cultivator enter a powerful state in a short time, significantly restoring their mana, energy, and spirit, sweeping away any fatigue.<br/>
<br/>
The side effect was that they would fall into a very weak and lethargic state for a long period afterward.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, Ning Zhuo had already taken one during his battle with Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, he was controlling the Blue Azure Iron Armor, unleashing its ultimate stance, but failed to hit Cheng Bai's fatal spot, striking his chest instead.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, with Sun Lingtong's reminder, Ning Zhuo had mustered his strength to fight again, rekindling his vigor, and charged towards Cheng Bai amidst the ruins.<br/>
<br/>
It was at this moment that Ning Zhuo, within the Blue Azure Iron Armor, secretly consumed a Vigorous Spirit Pill.<br/>
<br/>
Only one Vigorous Spirit Pill could be taken within a day; taking more would have no effect.<br/>
<br/>
For those with weak constitutions, taking it rashly could even result in sudden death.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had taken it many times.<br/>
<br/>
When he lost contact with his master and was saved by Ning Zhuo, he was only at the Qi Refining Stage.<br/>
<br/>
Living in the vast Fire Persimmon Immortal City was very difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, facing danger, he had no choice but to take a Vigorous Spirit Pill to cope with immense crises.<br/>
<br/>
Due to frequent consumption, Sun Lingtong had gained much experience.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, after taking one, his breathing immediately became rougher, and his pale cheeks turned rosy again.<br/>
<br/>
His energy, spirit, and vigor surged significantly, and his eyes began to sparkle once more.<br/>
<br/>
Even his hair stood on end, as if electrified.<br/>
<br/>
He lowered his head, pulled down his pants, and took a glance inside, nodding in satisfaction. "This pill is of superior grade." The superior-grade Vigorous Wind Pill could make Sun Lingtong's entire body stand tall and proud.<br/>
<br/>
The medium-grade one wouldn't have the same effect. <br/>
<br/>
So far, Sun Lingtong had never consumed a supreme-grade Vigorous Wind Pill.<br/>
<br/>
Supreme-grade pills were extremely rare and often possessed miraculous effects.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, with his head held high and chest puffed out, marched confidently towards Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's body was covered with talismans and placed within a formation.<br/>
<br/>
He was unconscious, showing no signs of waking, and his three seas of essence, qi, and spirit were precisely suppressed by the talismans.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong extended his delicate hand and gave Cheng Bai a light slap.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai remained motionless, but the part of his cheek that was struck swelled up visibly.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sat down cross-legged, clasped his hands together, closed his eyes, and began to chant a profound incantation.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, he slowly opened his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
His sclera and pupils were covered with spiritual light, and his hands emitted white smoke, which swirled like clouds and mist.<br/>
<br/>
Tiny silver lights, like countless shattered diamonds, sparkled continuously within the white smoke, dazzlingly bright.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's chanting grew quieter and quieter, almost to the point of being inaudible.<br/>
<br/>
After a few breaths, his hands completely disappeared, replaced by two streams of cloud smoke connected to his wrists.<br/>
<br/>
Void Sect Technique—Boundless Sea Cloud Grasp!<br/>
<br/>
The white cloud smoke touched Cheng Bai's body and quickly penetrated into his upper dantian's divine sea.<br/>
<br/>
The cloud smoke churned, flowing endlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, the cloud smoke retracted.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike before, it was now greatly swollen, clearly enveloping something.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong manipulated the cloud smoke to float to an empty spot beside him and then slowly dispersed it.<br/>
<br/>
A seal was immediately revealed.<br/>
<br/>
It was a square jade seal, perfectly square, resembling black jade, cold and eerie.<br/>
<br/>
On the seal's surface was a human skull, as clear as crystal, with a spirit pearl clutched within its teeth.<br/>
<br/>
The pearl constantly burned with blue Nether Fire.<br/>
<br/>
The inscription on the bottom of the seal read: "Netherworld Ghost God!"<br/>
<br/>
The Netherworld Ghost God Seal.<br/>
<br/>
This was not just a magical tool but a Magical Treasure! Cheng Bai had relied on this Magical Treasure to summon the avatars of the Judge and the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier.<br/>
<br/>
This was Cheng Bai's primary treasure, the core of his combat strength, and the first item Sun Lingtong had stolen.<br/>
<br/>
"This kind of jade seal can be refined with yin-attributed mana. Even though we are not ghost cultivators, if we ever venture into the underworld, this will be a powerful weapon!" "Let's seal it first."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong took out talismans and placed them on the front and back of the Magical Treasure.<br/>
<br/>
He once again stirred the white smoke, sending it surging into Cheng Bai's Sea of Consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after, the white smoke returned, bringing out a rattle drum.<br/>
<br/>
It was the very Soul Shaking Rattle Drum that had given Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong such a hard time in battle.<br/>
<br/>
Like the Netherworld Ghost Seal, it was also a Magical Treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong used a talisman: easily subduing it.<br/>
<br/>
After all, it was not a Spiritual Treasure and did not contain spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
There were no treasures hidden in the upper dantian of the Sea of Consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
However, Sun Lingtong still extracted a lot of divine sense, storing it all in a jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
He then used the Sea Gazing Cloud Catching Hand, probing into Cheng Bai's Qi Sea.<br/>
<br/>
There were no tangible treasures in the Qi Sea, but there were quite a few spell talisman seeds.<br/>
<br/>
When a cultivator practices a certain spell to a certain extent, it will form a spell talisman seed.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing to develop along this path can also lead to the development of divine abilities.<br/>
<br/>
However, the difficulty and cost far exceed those of innate talents.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the divine abilities formed are relatively common.<br/>
<br/>
Innate talents are recognized as the soil for divine abilities, and the divine abilities condensed from them are either exceptionally powerful or uniquely extraordinary.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong used the cloud smoke to extract the talisman seeds, obtaining only some shadowy images of the seeds.<br/>
<br/>
He took out talisman paper, and the cloud smoke, carrying the shadowy images of the seeds, fell onto it, immediately turning the talisman paper into one talisman after another.<br/>
<br/>
"All are top-quality, they can be sold for money!" Sun Lingtong nodded in satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, said, "It's better to stockpile some for ourselves first."<br/>
<br/>
In the recent battle, he had almost exhausted his accumulation of Mechanical Constructs over the past ten years, leaving him feeling very uneasy.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Sun Lingtong used the cloud smoke to extract a large amount of Cheng Bai's mana, infusing it into the Spirit Storage Orb.<br/>
<br/>
The cloud smoke formally entered the lower dantian of the Essence Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong fumbled around for a while, suddenly his body shuddered, and a look of surprise appeared on his face.<br/>
<br/>
He blurted out, "It turns out to be this item, what a treasure, what a treasure!"</div>
