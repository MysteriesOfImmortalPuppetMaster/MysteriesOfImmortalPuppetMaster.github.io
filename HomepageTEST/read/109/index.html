<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Que’s home also had a cultivation room. <br/>
<br/>
After finishing his meal, Ning Zhuo entered the cultivation room to begin his practice.<br/>
<br/>
First, he thoroughly inspected the surroundings and found no surveillance measures. <br/>
<br/>
He then carefully examined the array within the cultivation room. <br/>
<br/>
The array was intricate and interconnected with the main array of the Ning family. The Ning family’s main array, in turn, was linked to one of the array pillars of the Great Array of Lava Immortal City. <br/>
<br/>
This layered and refined relationship allowed the array in Ning Que’s cultivation room to provide abundant spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
The source of this spiritual energy was the endless fire elemental energy within the Lava Mountain. <br/>
<br/>
The massive fire elemental energy, laden with toxic elements, was purified by the Great Array of Lava Immortal City, yielding purified fire elemental energy. This energy was then converted into neutral spiritual energy through various complex arrays. <br/>
<br/>
By the time it reached the Ning family’s domain, the neutral spiritual energy had been further converted into ice elemental or water elemental energy. <br/>
<br/>
This was because the Ning family’s primary cultivation methods involved ice or water elemental techniques.<br/>
<br/>
After his alteration in cultivation techniques, Ning Zhuo now used the Five Elements Breathing Technique, which covered a wide range and could absorb any spiritual energy related to the five elements. <br/>
<br/>
Hence, this cultivation room was perfectly suitable for him.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, clouds began to drift within the cultivation room. <br/>
<br/>
The layers of clouds enveloped Ning Zhuo entirely, wrapping him into a large cotton-like ball. <br/>
<br/>
However, due to the large space in the cultivation room, the clouds only gathered around Ning Zhuo and did not fill the entire room.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family had invested significant effort and resources when setting up their family compound. <br/>
<br/>
Wrapped in clouds, Ning Zhuo first took out some spiritual food pastries, enjoying the lingering taste on his tongue. <br/>
<br/>
He then drank a bottle of specially made juice worth hundreds of spiritual stones, causing spiritual energy to surge within him, making his whole body feel almost swollen with energy.<br/>
<br/>
Taking too many pills could lead to medicinal toxicity, so he avoided them for now. <br/>
<br/>
Spiritual food had no such drawbacks, although it spoiled easily, was difficult to preserve for long periods, and was expensive. <br/>
<br/>
Spiritual food was much pricier than pills. <br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo was wealthy! <br/>
<br/>
His current income included profits from the Fireburst Monkeys, periodic rewards from the Lava Immortal Palace leaderboard, and the resources tricked out of his uncle. <br/>
<br/>
The largest portion came from the cultivation resources distributed by the three families in their joint effort. His share had always been substantial. <br/>
<br/>
The recent assaults on the three family prodigies had greatly alarmed the families, causing them to increase resource distribution by three to four times!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had already demonstrated his cultivation level and potential innate talent, which had not yet been fully tested. <br/>
<br/>
As a result, the resources he received were top-tier, on par with those of Zheng Jian and others. <br/>
<br/>
Thus, Ning Zhuo had the means to lavishly indulge in these spiritual foods.<br/>
<br/>
After consuming spiritual food, Ning Zhuo prepared to take some pills. Additionally, his meditation cushion, a high-quality auxiliary cultivation tool, was ready. <br/>
<br/>
Today, the joint efforts of the three families had delivered a new batch of resources. <br/>
<br/>
Among these, the Sharp Advancement Needle and the Ice Light Strong Meridian Talisman caught Ning Zhuo's eye. <br/>
<br/>
These were usually reserved only for geniuses like Ning Xiaohui from the main branch!<br/>
<br/>
Using the Five Elements Breathing Technique, refining the Devil-Dyed Blood Vessel Technique, and meditating with the Mirror Platform Spiritual Communication Technique, Ning Zhuo's progress with these three cultivation methods was visibly rapid due to the abundance of resources.<br/>
<br/>
At the start, Ning Zhuo was surrounded by a halo of five colors, which dyed the surrounding clouds. <br/>
<br/>
Then, his face was enveloped in a red glow, and blood energy surged outward. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, his aura receded, and a Buddhist tranquility ascended, filling his face with a look of compassion.<br/>
<br/>
After reaching the physical limits of his body, Ning Zhuo decisively stopped. <br/>
<br/>
Progressing too quickly with cultivation techniques wasn't good either. <br/>
<br/>
The body, especially the three Dantians, needed time to adapt and buffer. Rapid improvement could lead to unstable foundations, which is why a balance was necessary.<br/>
<br/>
However, among the resources Ning Zhuo used were many items that accelerated the adaptation process. <br/>
<br/>
He didn't hold back and used them all.<br/>
<br/>
"Right now, I need to go all out, moving at the maximum speed to seize the Lava Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
"Money is just an external thing. If I fail to capture the palace and lose my life, no amount of spirit stones will matter."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo understood this deeply. He opened the door of the secret room and walked out, smiling.<br/>
<br/>
The results of this cultivation session were greater than any before.<br/>
<br/>
"The Sharp Advancement Needle and the Ice Light Strong Meridian Talisman were indeed effective. If only I could also use the Gather-Disperse Wishful Spiritual Breath Formation, it would be even better. Unfortunately, I can't use it."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was very wary of the strength and style of the Zhou family. Among the three families, he understood the Ning family well and had a certain grasp of their actions. <br/>
<br/>
The Zheng family was straightforward, making it easy to predict their next move.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family was different. In terms of strength, the Zhou family was undoubtedly the strongest among the three, a fact even the Zheng family acknowledged. <br/>
<br/>
However, the most prominent family in Lava Immortal City was not the Zhou family but the Zheng family.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family preferred careful planning and had deep strategies. <br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu was an exception; Zhou Ze Shen represented the typical Zhou family cultivator, embodying many of the family's traits and characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
"I accidentally uncovered the Zhou family's little secret while using the Golden-Blooded War Ape, Da Sheng. To this day, the Zhou family has kept silent about it."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo certainly wouldn't reveal it on his own.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family's secrecy was advantageous to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Masters, this way, please. Young Master Ning Zhuo is in the side hall," a servant guided Ning Chen and Ning Yong.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the side hall, the two saw Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah Zhuo!" Ning Yong raised his arm and waved excitedly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen smiled and bowed to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo waved his hand dismissively, "With our friendship, there's no need for formalities. Let's sit down and chat while we eat."<br/>
<br/>
"Exactly, no need to be polite with Ah Zhuo! We've been through life and death together," Ning Yong said heartily, taking a seat and seeing the array of spiritual food and pastries on the round table. <br/>
<br/>
His eyes widened in amazement.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh my, so much spiritual food!" Ning Yong exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen, also astonished, sat down. They had been cultivating at home when a servant came with a message saying Ning Zhuo had invited them. <br/>
<br/>
Given Ning Zhuo's elevated status, the two felt a mixture of affection, admiration, and hidden guilt, readily agreeing to come.<br/>
<br/>
The three chatted leisurely in the side hall. Ning Yong ate voraciously, his cheeks never deflating. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen initially felt reserved, but under Ning Zhuo's encouragement, he also indulged in many pastries.<br/>
<br/>
From the moment he saw them, Ning Zhuo began to use his embryonic spiritual ability, the Thread of Fate. <br/>
<br/>
It took two full tea breaks before he successfully wove a thread of fate above each of their heads. <br/>
<br/>
These threads were much finer and more translucent compared to those he had used on his cousin Ning Ji and aunt Wang Lan.<br/>
<br/>
"Understanding the target greatly influences the manifestation of the Thread of Fate!" Ning Zhuo thought to himself.<br/>
<br/>
The embryonic spiritual ability merely informed him that he had learned this skill. <br/>
<br/>
It was like growing legs, making Ning Zhuo realize he could walk, run, and jump, but how far he could go, how fast he could run, and how high he could jump still required practice.<br/>
<br/>
Upon observation, Ning Zhuo realized his previous estimates were too optimistic.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Chen and Ning Yong have been my classmates for fourteen years. Although we weren't particularly close, we were familiar enough to know each other's general information. My cultivation level is also higher than theirs, yet it still took two tea breaks to establish the Thread of Fate."<br/>
<br/>
This showed that the practical value of the Thread of Fate in combat was limited. <br/>
<br/>
Most opponents in battle were not well-known to him. <br/>
<br/>
In the heat of battle, with rapid shifts in offense and defense and life-threatening situations, who could methodically establish the Thread of Fate? <br/>
<br/>
At least for now, Ning Zhuo couldn't.<br/>
<br/>
"This spiritual ability is mainly for managing influence rather than excelling in combat. Unless I set up the Thread of Fate in advance."<br/>
<br/>
"But as it stands, setting up the Thread of Fate requires us to be very close to each other. Anything beyond three steps is extremely difficult!" <br/>
<br/>
Once the Thread of Fate was established, Ning Zhuo stopped the idle chatter and said proactively, "I invited you both here to lend a helping hand. Your cultivation levels are currently behind mine. I've reached the peak of the third layer and have plenty of experience. I can share all this experience with you."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong and Ning Chen exchanged glances, each seeing the delight in the other's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
"That's fantastic!" Ning Yong cheered.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen stood up, his expression serious, and bowed deeply to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately stood up, smiling as he helped him up.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Ning Yong also hurriedly expressed his thanks with a bow.<br/>
<br/>
"We've been classmates for over ten years and have faced life and death together. There's no need for such formalities," Ning Zhuo said with a hearty laugh. "Let's head to the training chamber in the main house. I'll personally guide you both."<br/>
<br/>
The three of them went into the main house's training chamber.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the main family's training chamber. In our house, it’s mostly used by my grandfather, then my father. I only get to use it occasionally," Ning Yong sighed. "Ah Zhuo, it seems your uncle isn't too bad to you."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen chuckled, "That must be a recent change! If mistreatment was just a rumor, it couldn't have been the case throughout all our years at school, right?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled, neither confirming nor denying, "My uncle has a secret mission. He's been away on duty recently, so I got to use this chamber." <br/>
<br/>
This was the official line they were sticking to.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Gui's situation hadn't become public knowledge, restricted to only a few individuals. <br/>
<br/>
On one hand, Ning Xiao Ren knew it was his own scheme and wouldn't publicize it. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Ning Gui valued his reputation and would never admit to it. Lastly, Ning Ze had no incentive to reveal this scandal. <br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan and Ning Ji were doing everything to keep it a secret, let alone spread it around.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had the two sit down.<br/>
<br/>
They were also part of the reform team and took out their meditation mats from their storage pouches, beginning to breathe and circulate their energy.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo circled around them and immediately began administering acupuncture.<br/>
<br/>
They had brought their own sets of Sharp Advance Needles and Ice Light Strong Pulse Talismans.<br/>
<br/>
They used their own sets of Sharp Advance Needles, but for the Ice Light Strong Pulse Talismans, Ning Zhuo used part of their supply and part of his own.<br/>
<br/>
This served as a layer of concealment, a precaution against unforeseen events.</div>
