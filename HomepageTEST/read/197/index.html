<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 197: Harvesting Yang to Supplement Yin

Ning Zhuo stood on the broad and sturdy shoulder of the Mechanical Ape, opening the latter's skullcap.

Then, he took out a mechanical component from his storage pouch.

It was a drum.

The drum body resembled a short, stout cylinder.

The drum was a bright red, its surface smooth and clearly lacquered, giving it an ancient yet solemn appearance.

The drum had two skins, both yellowish-brown, tightly stretched, thick, and elastic.

Around the drum skins were iron-embedded steel nails, each nail head was quite rounded.

The drum body was adorned with numerous patterns and designs, depicting a battlefield where warriors from both sides fought fiercely, all roaring with full force.

This was the reward Ning Zhuo received from the Lava Immortal Palace—a mechanical component—the Wild Thought Disrupting Drum.

Beating this drum produced a deep, resonant sound that echoed in the mind, capable of inducing various chaotic and violent thoughts and emotions.

The orthodox use was to strike it during battle to affect surrounding enemies, driving them into a state of rage, losing their rationality, and creating numerous flaws.

However, Ning Zhuo thought of using this drum to help the Mechanical Ape think.

Various chaotic and violent thoughts could still be considered thinking.

The result of such thinking would often be wild attacks, disregarding one's own safety to kill the enemy. "This doesn't matter."

"Yuan Dasheng's spirit has already advanced to the Wisdom Spirit Stage, inherently possessing strong cognitive abilities." "Using Yuan Dasheng's spirit can suppress the violent thoughts, preventing a complete loss of rationality." "Of course, prolonged drumming would fill the mind with violent thoughts, suppressing Yuan Dasheng's rationality." But this was precisely the state Ning Zhuo sought.

At that time, Yuan Dasheng would become completely berserk.

According to the mechanical setup on its body, it would unleash at least twice its combat power!

Ning Zhuo had already lifted the skullcap of the Mechanical Ape.

After taking out the Wild Thought Disrupting Drum, he first checked it to ensure it was intact, then placed it inside the Mechanical Ape's skull.

A base had already been prepared inside the skull.

The Wild Thought Disrupting Drum was placed on the base.

Ning Zhuo inserted several rods, each of which could fold in the middle.

He inserted the rods into the base, then bent them at the middle, inserting the other end into the mechanical slots on the drum body.

Ning Zhuo infused his mana, slightly activating it, and immediately a drum sound echoed within the skull.

After confirming it was intact, Ning Zhuo began arranging the inner wall of the skull.

He took out a talisman brush, drawing on the inner wall, and then took out dozens of talismans from his pocket, sticking them up, even covering the inner wall of the skullcap.

After completing these, he reattached the skullcap.

"I should set up a Resonance Formation, but for now, I'll use talismans to temporarily substitute."

Ning Zhuo was busy to the point of sweating all over, not daring to slack off for a moment, let alone rest.

"Brother Sun is in danger; I must race against time, exerting all my strength to win more chances for him!" "Alas, Brother Sun is probably in trouble because of me."

"My Life-Hanging Thread Divine Ability is tied to him; if I am impacted, he will be affected as well." "In fact, if it weren't for me, he could have left Fire Persimmon Immortal City long ago." "But he stayed here to help and protect me."

"Given his personality, hiding in these underground bases is more unbearable than killing him. But he has endured until now, never showing any resentment towards me." "Nothing will happen, nothing will happen!"

"These days, I have worked hard to perform, gaining fame and recognition, planting Life-Hanging Threads on many people." "My divine ability is now complete, able to borrow others' fate energy. I already have a vast foundation of fate energy to counter misfortune." "So, Brother Sun, you will be fine!" "Brother Sun, please don't get into trouble."

Ning Zhuo continued urgently installing the Mechanical Ape while trying to adjust his emotions.

In the underground base.

In the Ghost Granny's Whirlpool.

"Hehehe, it's your turn, Sun Lingtong!" Yang Chanyu's face was filled with a crazed smile, her eyes brimming with affection, making one's heart ripple.

"Yang Chanyu, calm down, calm down!" Sun Lingtong was tightly embraced by Yang Chanyu, struggling with all his might but unable to break free.

"Wait, let go of me, let go of me, I can't breathe!" His face was buried in Yang Chanyu's chest, almost suffocating.

Yang Chanyu giggled, holding Sun Lingtong tightly, swaying her body as if trying to absorb him into her own.

Ghostly energy entwined Yang Chanyu, filling her mind with endless lust, leaving her without any rationality.

At the brink of life and death, Sun Lingtong was pushed to the limit, unexpectedly making a breakthrough in desperation!

"Empty Void Seal!!" He squeezed out every bit of his strength, calling upon the mark of the Empty Void Seal with unprecedented frenzy.

The mark emitted a faint glow, spreading from Sun Lingtong's body to Yang Chanyu.

It worked!

Yang Chanyu's face immediately showed signs of struggle and hesitation, and the seductive ghostly energy that had infiltrated her was driven out significantly.

Yang Chanyu released Sun Lingtong, but her hands still gripped his arms tightly.

"They're going to break, they're going to break!" Sun Lingtong shouted, "Yang Chanyu, wake up quickly." Yang Chanyu's expression constantly shifted between infatuation and clarity.

Sun Lingtong, suppressed by the ghostly mist and restrained by Yang Chanyu, still couldn't break free and regain his freedom.

"Little Zhuo, Little Zhuo, come save me!"

Sun Lingtong's pupils contracted as he saw Yang Chanyu losing the struggle, her expression becoming infatuated again.

She giggled foolishly and puckered her lips to kiss him.

Sun Lingtong quickly turned his head to the right, avoiding the kiss.

Yang Chanyu pulled back and kissed again.

Sun Lingtong turned his head to the left, once again dodging Yang Chanyu's lips.

Yang Chanyu kissed repeatedly, and Sun Lingtong dodged left and right.

After failing for a long time, Yang Chanyu coquettishly smiled, "Little brother, I didn't expect you to be so shy? But it's useless!" With that, she activated a secret technique—Harvesting Yang to Supplement Yin!

"Something bad is going to happen, something bad is going to happen!" Sun Lingtong was so anxious that his face turned red.

He was bound and could only fall victim.

"It's happening!" The same exclamation echoed in Zhu Xuanji's mind.

Leading three Golden Core cultivators, he had delved deep into the Fire Persimmon Mountain, reaching the old lair of the Fire Melting Demon Apes.

Not only did they suffer an ambush, but now they couldn't break through and were temporarily trapped in a corner by the relentless waves of demon apes.

Zhu Xuanji stood at the forefront, a one-man defensive line!

Since the battle began, he had displayed numerous magical artifacts, his personal combat power far surpassing the three Golden Core cultivators.

Frowning, he repelled another attacking Golden Core-level Fire Melting Demon Ape, his eyes shooting golden light as he stared at a nearby cave entrance.

"Look in that direction, there's a cave entrance. During our previous attempts to break through, whenever we chose that direction, the demon apes became very tense and defended with all their might." "That cave likely leads to the outside!" Zhu Xuanji communicated his guess through voice transmission.

"It could also be the ape nursery." Zhou Nongying, who had retreated to the rear to heal himself, added.

Zhu Xuanji continued, "In a moment, I will release a quasi-Golden Core-level mechanical construct to charge in that direction, drawing the demon apes' defense." "Once they become tense, other areas will inevitably show weaknesses. We will feint and seize the opportunity to break through and return the way we came!" Zhu Xuanji had the three Golden Core cultivators prepare, then counted down through voice transmission.

At the count of "one," he suddenly shouted, "Move!"

Zhu Xuanji released a tiger-shaped mechanical construct, charging towards the cave entrance without hesitation.

As expected, the Golden Core-level demon apes attacking them became very tense, swarming to block the tiger-shaped construct.

"Go!" Zhu Xuanji led the charge, seizing the breach in the demon apes' formation.

Roar.

The next moment, the Fire Melting Demon Ape King descended like a demon god, blocking Zhu Xuanji's path.

Seeing Zhu Xuanji blocked, the three Golden Core cultivators behind him attacked.

Various techniques struck the Demon Ape King, but the effects were minimal, reducing the power of their spells by at least thirty percent.

Instead, it provoked the Demon Ape King's ferocity.

With a roar, it combined fists and feet, sending Zhu Xuanji flying.

It lunged at the three Golden Core cultivators.

Their hearts pounding, the Golden Core cultivators scattered, causing the Demon Ape King to miss.

Zhu Xuanji suddenly shouted, "Don't resist me!"

With that, he controlled the tiger-shaped mechanical construct that had been charging forward.

The tiger-shaped construct, already battered and on the verge of collapse from the Golden Core-level demon apes' attacks, immediately shot out several beams of guiding light.

The beams shone on the human Golden Core cultivators, pulling them with an overwhelming force.

Having been forewarned by Zhu Xuanji, the three Golden Core cultivators did not resist, allowing the beams to pull them.

The tiger-shaped construct, guiding all the human Golden Core cultivators, suddenly turned, moving the beams to another direction.

"Roar!!!"

The Fire Melting Demon Apes roared in unison, falling into a state of rage.

Pulled by the beams, the human Golden Core cultivators moved swiftly, reaching the other end in almost two blinks of an eye.

And this end was precisely the cave entrance they had just targeted.

"Hahaha, Master Zhu, well done!" Ning Jiufan laughed.

"Enter, make these Fire Melting Demon Apes hesitate!" Zhu Xuanji still led the charge.

Since the battle began, he had always been at the forefront.

Such a noble demeanor secretly won the admiration of the three Golden Core cultivators.

"Not good!" The next moment, Zhu Xuanji suddenly stopped, exclaiming in a low voice.

The three Golden Core cultivators behind him also looked up, their faces changing.

They saw an old ape lying asleep, now slowly opening its eyes.

Its aura was at the Nascent Soul level.

Roar, roar.

Outside the cave, the Golden Core-level demon apes crowded together, none daring to rush into the cave.

The human Golden Core cultivators were stuck in the middle, with a Nascent Soul-level old ape in front and several Golden Core-level Fire Melting Demon Apes behind, leaving them in a dilemma.

"Damn it!"

"There's actually a Nascent Soul-level demon ape among the demon apes!!" "Why didn't it appear when the Lava Immortal Palace was shaking earlier?"</div>
