<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Recruitment Decree." Meng Kui sneered inwardly.<br/>
<br/>
The King's move was not unexpected; the Recruitment Decree was within his calculations and had countermeasures.<br/>
<br/>
In the days following the decree's announcement, three Golden Core Stage cultivators entered Fire Persimmon Immortal City and were successfully "recruited" by the City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
The Meng family had discovered the Lava Immortal Palace many years ago.<br/>
<br/>
For the Meng family, controlling the Lava Immortal Palace justified occupying Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Although the city's resources were not outstanding, its strategic location was invaluable.<br/>
<br/>
For the Meng family, it was not just a stepping stone.<br/>
<br/>
The Meng family's sphere of influence could expand significantly outward from this point.<br/>
<br/>
Within the entire Southern Bean Kingdom, the Meng family's influence would also rise dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
These benefits were what the Meng family truly valued!<br/>
<br/>
"The heavens are about to change!"<br/>
<br/>
The proclamation echoed throughout the city, and Ning Zhuo naturally heard it.<br/>
<br/>
His brows furrowed, his gaze deepened, and the pressure in his heart doubled.<br/>
<br/>
To compete for the inheritance of the Lava Immortal Palace, there were currently two paths.<br/>
<br/>
The first was the old path, open to those in the Foundation Establishment Stage, Golden Core Stage, Nascent Soul Stage, and above.<br/>
<br/>
Each level of cultivation had standards for proficiency in mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
As long as one met these standards, they could participate in the competition.<br/>
<br/>
Through various actions, they could assist the Lava Immortal Palace and earn corresponding palace contributions.<br/>
<br/>
Accumulating enough palace contributions could be exchanged for corresponding resources.<br/>
<br/>
The highest contribution should be the position of the palace master.<br/>
<br/>
The second was the new path, only open to those in the Qi Refining Stage, specifically those who had cultivated the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Reaching the peak of the third layer of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique would qualify one to have their soul drawn into the palace by the Life-Hanging Thread.<br/>
<br/>
In the trial checkpoints specially set up by the three sect elders, Qi Refining cultivators would take on the form of puppets and continuously break through the checkpoints, learning and growing in the process.<br/>
<br/>
As for whether this new path could ultimately lead to the palace throne, Ning Zhuo was not entirely sure, but he speculated that it could.<br/>
<br/>
The discovery of the new path was a significant boon for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
However, as he continued to advance and break through, he encountered many unexpected events, several of which were life-threatening crises.<br/>
<br/>
From being on the leaderboard at the start, to Yuan Dasheng's sudden appearance, to Cheng Bai capturing Sun Lingtong...<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had exhausted much of his accumulated resources over the past decade.<br/>
<br/>
His mechanical constructs were almost entirely consumed in the battle with Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was currently hiding in one of the few remaining underground bases, which was also not safe.<br/>
<br/>
The issuance of the Recruitment Decree would undoubtedly attract countless external cultivators, leading to a massive influx of new competitors.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt uncertain about this.<br/>
<br/>
The world was full of talents, as numerous as carp crossing the river.<br/>
<br/>
It was not surprising for a dragon fish to emerge.<br/>
<br/>
"Especially those from prestigious sects, those cultivators have received the best education and superior cultivation resources since childhood. How can I compare with them?"<br/>
<br/>
"My proficiency in mechanical constructs stands out in the Ning family, but the Ning family itself excels in talismans."<br/>
<br/>
"Among the incoming cultivators, there will certainly be those whose proficiency in mechanical constructs far surpasses mine."<br/>
<br/>
"My advantage in mechanical constructs will become insignificant in comparison!"<br/>
<br/>
"My current greatest advantage is my head start. My progress in the trial checkpoints is the fastest, and I am first in the 'entry standards' of the five rankings."<br/>
<br/>
"But how long can this advantage last?"<br/>
<br/>
"Reaching this point, I have already given my all." Ning Zhuo desperately wanted to break through the next checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, he had the peak cultivation of the sixth layer of the Divine Sea Stage and could push open the second Buddha Gate.<br/>
<br/>
However, the first checkpoint behind the Buddha Gate was quite challenging.<br/>
<br/>
After attempting it, Ning Zhuo found that the challenger would first enter half a room.<br/>
<br/>
Half the room was a mechanical workshop.<br/>
<br/>
The challenger temporarily had a limited number of mechanical tools and mechanical bases.<br/>
<br/>
The checkpoint provided some materials for the challenger to choose from, three out of nine times.<br/>
<br/>
After nine consecutive selections, the chosen materials were used for crafting.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of what mechanical construct was crafted, it had to cooperate with the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng to face the upcoming test.<br/>
<br/>
During the test, the other half of the room would be moved over, combining with the mechanical workshop to form a complete room.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, the other half of the room contained various obstacles and traps that the intelligent mechanical construct had to navigate through.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, the other half of the room contained spell puppets, martial puppets, or mechanical beast hordes that the intelligent mechanical construct had to defeat.<br/>
<br/>
Other times, the combined room came with a cage, inside which a living Scarlet Flame Demon Beast was bound, requiring the intelligent mechanical construct to kill the beast.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo successfully passed seven tests consecutively but failed on the eighth attempt, resulting in a direct defeat.<br/>
<br/>
There was no room for him to re-enter the checkpoint; he was directly ejected from the Lava Immortal Palace, his soul returning to his body.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, Ning Zhuo constantly reflected and gained many insights.<br/>
<br/>
"As Brother Sun mentioned before, the intelligent mechanical constructs crafted for trial disciples by the Lava Immortal Palace are crucial."<br/>
<br/>
"In subsequent challenges, they are based on the intelligent mechanical constructs, with further developments built upon them."<br/>
<br/>
"At least, this is the case for the Buddha Gate route."<br/>
<br/>
"After the second Buddha Gate, the materials provided by the checkpoints are clearly of a higher grade than before."<br/>
<br/>
"Following this trend, the materials in subsequent checkpoints should be even better."<br/>
<br/>
"The difficulty of the checkpoints after the second Buddha Gate far exceeds the previous ones. The trial content has increased nearly tenfold, and since it has not yet been fully explored, the exact extent of the content increase is still uncertain."<br/>
<br/>
"Each test battlefield can be cleaned up. Various mechanical traps, obstacles, puppets, and Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts are new materials that can be used to repair intelligent mechanical constructs, create more mechanical components, and even directly manufacture mechanical entities."<br/>
<br/>
"The other rewards from the first Buddha Gate can directly aid this checkpoint."<br/>
<br/>
"The rewards from the first gate, the Demon Gate, do not provide direct assistance. Throughout the entire trial process, I could not command Yuan Dasheng and had to rely on Yuan Dasheng's autonomous attacks."<br/>
<br/>
"From this point, it is also evident that the intelligent mechanical constructs crafted during the first Buddha Gate are extremely important! The more intelligent they are, the greater the advantage in subsequent checkpoints."<br/>
<br/>
"Others who reach this point will face much greater difficulties than I did, and the effort and time they invest will far exceed mine."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, I almost forgot."<br/>
<br/>
"The Buddha Gate and Demon Gate have been closed by me."<br/>
<br/>
"They have no chance of entering."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and realized there were still flaws.<br/>
<br/>
In the second transfer hall, there were still Demon Gates and Buddha Gates.<br/>
<br/>
He needed to cheat again to close them.<br/>
<br/>
The main issue was that this time, leaving the palace caught Ning Zhuo off guard.<br/>
<br/>
After failing the checkpoint, he was directly ejected.<br/>
<br/>
"No matter, next time I have the chance, I'll try closing the gates first." While Ning Zhuo was considering the checkpoints, the Ning family patriarch and the young patriarch were discussing him.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo has indeed made significant contributions this time." The Ning family patriarch sighed.<br/>
<br/>
The young patriarch, Ning Xiaoren, echoed, "This child is indeed a mechanical prodigy, with astonishing talent in mechanical constructs."<br/>
<br/>
"However..." Ning Xiaoren's tone shifted, "He proactively expressed his desire to taste Ice Jade Wine, which left a bad impression on me."<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch squinted his eyes, speaking meaningfully, "Xiaoren, you need to pay attention."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, Ning Zhuo organized a team and acted independently without informing us."<br/>
<br/>
"Among those who acted with him, there was not a single member of the main branch."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren took a deep breath, "Father, I also noticed that Ning Zhuo merely raised his arm, and these people gathered around him, acting with him. Ning Zhuo's influence in the collateral branches cannot be underestimated!"<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps he is only in the Qi Refining Stage now, but he is known for his talent and has already been favored by countless collateral branches."<br/>
<br/>
"If we do not restrain him during his sapling stage, once he grows into a towering tree, it will be too late, and we will regret it."<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch slowly nodded, "Very good, your awareness is not in vain after my years of careful nurturing."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo is indeed a good seedling with talent, but he is too young, and young people tend to be rebellious."<br/>
<br/>
"He has overstepped his bounds, and it is time to make him understand that the family comes first, and the individual comes second."<br/>
<br/>
"Let him know that some rules must be followed."<br/>
<br/>
"Go and knock some sense into him. Teach him well, so he can become a sharp blade for our main branch in the future."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, Father. I take my leave." Ning Xiaoren cupped his hands in salute, took a few steps back, then turned and left.</div>
