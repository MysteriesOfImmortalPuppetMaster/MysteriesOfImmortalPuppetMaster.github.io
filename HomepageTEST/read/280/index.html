<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The flame snake suffered a severe blow and began to retreat. Its wings flapped, and it quickly dove into the thick magma, leaving a trail of fiery snake paths along the way.<br/>
<br/>
"Unfortunately, I couldn't predict its demise," Meng Kui's pupils returned to normal as he coughed a few times, his face pale. The use of his lethal move had greatly depleted his vitality.<br/>
<br/>
With the retreat of the flame snake, the scarlet flame beasts fell into disarray, their morale plummeting. Many beasts turned and fled, mimicking the Nascent Soul-level flame snake by diving directly into the magma.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, the human cultivators shouted in unison, dispelling the gloom. They pursued the retreating beasts, and without further support, the infiltrating flame snakes gradually succumbed under the onslaught of various artifacts, magical artifacts, and spells.<br/>
<br/>
Before long, they all lay defeated on the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood at a high vantage point, surveying the scene. Seeing the battlefield littered with scars, his heart felt heavy. How would his achievements change once everything was tallied?<br/>
<br/>
His heart sank as he reviewed his achievements—one hundred and twenty-seven positive points. Thanks to the collective efforts of the three reformation teams, Ning Zhuo's achievements were no longer in the negative. After turning positive, they surged to over three hundred.<br/>
<br/>
"But when it comes to the final tally, my accumulated achievements might be insignificant," he thought. "Without enough achievements, I won't rank high enough to qualify for the palace examination. How can I squeeze into the list?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt deeply worried. "No, I must find a way!"<br/>
<br/>
"Should I connect with the City Lord's Mansion and leverage their power?" No, that wouldn't work. Ning Zhuo's three positions corresponded to three mechanical buildings, and the positions below them were almost entirely filled. Besides, he couldn't enjoy any achievement shares from other mechanical buildings.<br/>
<br/>
"What about entering the Immortal Palace to take on other positions?" Ning Zhuo realized this path was also blocked. On one hand, the alliance of the three families included him, prohibiting him from entering the Immortal Palace during this period. On the other hand, the trials set by the Three Sects Master didn't allow for a winner-takes-all scenario but rather provided opportunities for everyone, even giving a chance to beasts like Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo understood that even if he passed the trials again and took on a position, the authority of the previous path would be considered automatically forfeited. In other words, through the trials, a trial disciple could hold at most three positions. The Three Sects Master encouraged fairer competition, wanting to leave opportunities for those who came later.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered deeply and finally decided to focus on mechanical techniques and to make a move to counter the beast tide. He assessed the situation and judged that the Nascent Soul-level flame snake was likely to attack again. If he could find a more efficient way to eliminate the scarlet flame beasts and protect the Lava Immortal Palace, he would gain considerable achievements.<br/>
<br/>
With his profound knowledge of mechanical constructs, Ning Zhuo quickly formed a plan. That was to modify the explosive monkeys to steal the core from within the flame snake. The core was the lifeblood of the flame snake; if it were stolen, the flame snake's combat power would plummet by ninety-nine percent.<br/>
<br/>
In this regard, Yuan Dasheng's techniques, "Backhand Grab" and "Sun Shattering Hand," provided Ning Zhuo with crucial inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
As expected, in the following days, the Nascent Soul-level flame snake repeatedly attacked. The flame snake group continuously infiltrated. Clearing the flame snakes became a task that the cultivators in the Immortal Palace were exhausted from handling.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's plan to improve the explosive monkeys made little progress. In the actual research, he found too many problems to solve, with many steps requiring experimentation and the testing of new composite materials, among other things. He was confident he could succeed in the research, but the key was time! His time was too tight.<br/>
<br/>
However, during this arduous process, he did gain some rewards. He managed to acquire Zheng Jian's belongings. The subordinates in the black market demonstrated their value. But he didn't obtain much of Ning Xiaohui's relics. It was said that Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was deeply affected, seemingly driven to madness, spending day and night holed up in Ning Xiaohui's room, obsessively keeping Ning Xiaohui's belongings close.<br/>
<br/>
She would reminisce about Ning Xiaohui, sometimes washing her face with tears, sometimes crying out in madness. Whether it was sobbing or shouting, it was chilling to hear.<br/>
<br/>
In the intensive care ward, Ning Zhuo cremated the relics of the two. He successfully replenished Zheng Jian's spirituality to its full potential. Ning Xiaohui's relics were few, only pushing the spirituality of the Floating Ice Jade Hand mechanism to sixty percent.<br/>
<br/>
Sixty percent spirituality... although it could still perform the Ice Jade Hand, it was only enough for one use. According to Ning Zhuo's estimation, after using it, the spirituality of the Floating Ice Jade Hand would be greatly damaged, nearing obsolescence.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, other gains included the achievements of Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu, which soared rapidly under Ning Zhuo's care. The number of spots for the palace examination was limited. If Ning Zhuo could help them squeeze into the list, it would also be beneficial for him.<br/>
<br/>
"The key issue now is still my achievements!" <br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul-level flame snake attacked once more. Meng Kui repelled it. Initially, everyone thought the situation was leading towards gradual victory. That was until the collapse of a core building. The dragon turtle fire spirit in the main hall suddenly burst into laughter.<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha, I succeeded, I finally succeeded!" The golden barrier surrounding the Lava Immortal Palace suddenly revealed multiple breaches. No matter how much mana was infused, these breaches couldn't be mended.<br/>
<br/>
With the breaches appearing, a massive wave of scarlet flame beasts surged in like a flood. The cultivators were caught off guard and, being vastly outnumbered, could only watch helplessly as numerous buildings collapsed under the beast tide. Some were even shattered into pieces, with stones and broken wood flying everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
One building after another fell into ruins while raging flames quickly spread, seemingly intent on consuming everything within the Immortal Palace!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, deep in thought, shouted decisively, stepping forward at the critical moment to take on the role of battlefield commander. Under his command, the cultivators barely managed to hold a defensive line, slightly curbing the scarlet flame beasts' offensive.<br/>
<br/>
However, looking down at the Lava Immortal Palace, most of its outer circle had fallen, becoming a place ravaged by countless beasts. The situation took a drastic turn for the worse!<br/>
<br/>
In the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace, the dragon turtle fire spirit was overjoyed, dancing with delight. <br/>
<br/>
"Indeed, indeed, the palace examination has also been brought forward!" <br/>
<br/>
This was predictable. In past years, whenever the Lava Immortal Palace was damaged to a certain extent, it would automatically lower the standards for selecting cultivators by one level. From top to bottom, it would lower the standards, from Nascent Soul, golden core, Foundation Establishment, Qi Refining... until now; the palace examination, which was once at a distance, was greatly advanced due to the perilous situation of the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, you're doomed to be eliminated!" "With the palace examination, all achievements will be settled in advance. You have no hope at all!" "Hahaha, you used explosive monkeys to bomb the Immortal Palace, and even used the Five Elements Earth Tower to bomb..." "Hahaha!"<br/>
<br/>
"You fell into my trap, no matter how cunning and insidious you are, you fell into the scheme of this dragon turtle fire spirit." <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo felt a tightness in his left index finger. Zheng Jian's innate Heart-Piercing Insight suddenly activated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, who was worried about his achievements, was startled when Heart-Piercing Insight activated. "Not good!" "The Lava Immortal Palace is in grave danger, and the palace examination might be brought forward." "I have a bad feeling about this. With my insufficient achievements, I might be squeezed out of the palace examination list." "What should I do?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth. "It seems I have no choice but to take the last resort." "I must offer up the Buddha Heart Demon Seal!!!"<br/>
<br/>
A transmission light circle appeared, and Ning Zhuo resolutely took out the treasure seal. In an instant, he recalled his mother's words: "Ning Zhuo, my son, this treasure seal has been imbued with the techniques of the Flying Cloud Kingdom by your mother. It is most attuned to you. You must take good care of it. Its high grade will be a great aid in your future cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
"No, no, no!" The dragon turtle fire spirit was shocked at this moment. Although it had long known that Ning Zhuo possessed the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, it never thought that without any information prompting him, Ning Zhuo would offer up the treasure seal in advance!<br/>
<br/>
The dragon turtle fire spirit fiercely resisted, wishing it could shout in Ning Zhuo's ear: "What are you doing submitting this? With the treasure seal being this good, you're going to give it up? Are you worthy of your mother?!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes shone with determination. "Since I can even gamble with my life, why would I hesitate over a mere magical artifact?" "Submit, submit, submit!"<br/>
<br/>
The Buddha Heart Demon Seal was thrown into the transmission light circle, quickly disappearing from Ning Zhuo's sight. In that instant, Ning Zhuo felt an emptiness in his heart. He clenched his teeth, tightened his fists, and silently endured the intense turmoil within.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, a message was directly transmitted to everyone's mind—the Lava Immortal Palace palace examination has begun! Achievements are settled, and the top thirty-six are selected. The list is as follows: Zhu Xuanji. Book Master. ... Yang Chanyu. Ning Zhuo. ... Meng Chong ... Zhou Zeshen Zhou Zhu ... Entry Standard.<br/>
