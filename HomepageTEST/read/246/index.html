Ning Zhuo slightly opened his mouth as if to say something, but ultimately remained silent.

Finally, he turned his gaze towards the distant sky where the cloud whale resided.

The cloud whale was so immense, occupying a corner of the sky, that compared to it, Ning Zhuo seemed like an ant.

After a moment of silence, Ning Zhuo asked, "Such a colossal cloud whale, was it once just a small cloud seed?" Song Fuli chuckled softly, "Yes, indeed it was." "It's hard to imagine for outsiders, isn't it?" "That's the wonder of cloud seeds."

"They are born from the Myriad Clouds Sea, and once they reach a certain maturity, they naturally detach from the sea, drifting with the wind." "During their drifting, they absorb the essence of the sun and moon, draw in various astral energies from the firmament, encountering countless radiances and colorful clouds." "The cloud seeds absorb these, growing continuously, eventually transforming into various types of cloud beasts with unique attributes." As Song Fuli spoke, he too looked towards the cloud whale at the horizon.

He continued, "This cloud whale wasn't one I raised from a young age." "I encountered it midway, and due to a fortunate coincidence and the help of a benefactor, I was able to make it my own." "Based on our speculation, this cloud whale likely absorbed a massive amount of atmospheric energy during its cloud seed phase and then encountered a cluster of leisurely clouds." "It hibernated within those clouds for many years. Hence, its enormous size, vast storage capacity, and gentle temperament." "Such a temperament has its pros and cons; on one hand, it's indeed easy to control; on the other hand, its combat prowess isn't ideal, even though it's at the Nascent Soul level." Song Fuli said this while looking at Ning Zhuo, "Flying Cloud Kingdom has quite a variety of specialties, especially various types of cloud qi, so numerous that even I am dazzled and cannot know them all." "When you return in the future, you should take the time to experience them."

"Encountering different places and different types of cultivation resources can be very inspiring for cultivation itself." "Young Master Ning Zhuo, your expertise in mechanical constructs is impressive, and new materials can spark your inspiration in many mechanical creations." Ning Zhuo instinctively nodded, feeling a surge of excitement.

But when he thought of the Lava Immortal Palace, that excitement suddenly vanished.

Ning Zhuo continued to stare at the cloud whale, "I've heard that every cloud beast actually has its own lifespan limit, and the stronger the cloud beast, the larger its size, the shorter its lifespan?" Song Fuli nodded, "Yes, that's indeed the case." "So our cloud whale is actually already in its old age." "In a few years, we will have to assist it in returning to the Myriad Clouds Sea."

"Every cloud beast, upon sensing its end approaching, will fly back to its birthplace—the Myriad Clouds Sea." "There, they are born, and there, they will also die, like a cycle." "No matter how humble or glorious the past was, they return to where they came from, and all achievements are buried with the wind."

"The past is buried, and new hope is born. Such a Nascent Soul-level cloud beast will give birth to a vast number of new cloud seeds." "And these new cloud seeds will naturally drift outward. Eventually, they may become various types of cloud beasts, and with luck, they might become new cloud whales." At this point, Song Fuli sighed, "The life of a cloud beast is very similar to our own lives, isn't it?" "Cultivators of the Flying Cloud Kingdom have always had a close relationship with cloud beasts." "Many cultivators begin by receiving and nurturing cloud seeds at the start of their cultivation journey." "By investing various cultivation resources, they cultivate cloud seeds into various forms of cloud beasts." "Large cloud beasts are like our homes when we travel outside, our personal Immortal Palaces." Song Fuli looked towards the mountain peak, knowing that the Lava Immortal Palace was there.

He said to Ning Zhuo, "In terms of direct confrontation, even our cloud whale can't match the Lava Immortal Palace." "But in terms of size and storage space, the cloud whale is much larger than the Lava Immortal Palace." "The cloud whale also has other advantages, such as being easy to maintain."

"It mainly consumes cloud qi and spiritual qi from heaven and earth as food, and it can self-repair and heal naturally." "Whereas repairing something like the Lava Immortal Palace is not so easy." Ning Zhuo suddenly thought of something, his expression changed slightly, and he couldn't help but ask:

"Senior Song, from what you just said, it seems that cultivators of the Flying Cloud Kingdom generally cultivate cloud seeds. So, does everyone have a cloud seed?" Song Fuli nodded, "Almost everyone has a cloud seed, but truly cultivating it is not so easy." Ning Zhuo asked urgently, "I have a question! My mother was from the Flying Cloud Kingdom, but among her relics, there was no cloud seed or cloud beast." Song Fuli's expression became serious, "May I ask, Young Master Ning Zhuo, your mother's esteemed name?"

Ning Zhuo replied, "My mother's surname is Meng, and her name is Yaoyin." "Meng Yaoyin?" Song Fuli heard this and showed a hint of confusion, "Why does it sound familiar?" Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel curious and nervous, "Could it be that Senior Song knows my mother?" Song Fuli frowned and thought for a while, then shook his head slightly, "It just sounds familiar, I can't recall anything at the moment." "However, although there are many people in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, there aren't many with the surname Meng. There is a Meng family that is quite extraordinary, with remarkable roots." Ning Zhuo continued to inquire.

Song Fuli explained to him, "The Myriad Sect of the Flying Cloud Kingdom is a super sect, almost controlling the Myriad Clouds Sea." "Within the Myriad Sect, there are twelve peaks, one of which has long been held by the Meng family."

"This Meng family established itself through mechanical arts, and was once very powerful, but has declined over the past few decades." "The Meng family..." Ning Zhuo murmured, keeping this information in mind.

He hadn't forgotten about the cloud beasts and continued to ask:

"Although my mother has passed away, I didn't find any cloud beast or cloud seed among her belongings." "If these cloud beasts still exist, where would they be?"

Song Fuli shook his head, "That question is difficult for me." "Cultivating a cloud seed requires a lot of resources, especially to reach the Golden Core level, which often requires a long period of hibernation." "But as far as I know, Young Master Ning Zhuo, your mother was only a Foundation Establishment mechanical cultivator, so it's basically impossible for her to have a Golden Core-level cloud beast." "And cloud beasts at the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment levels aren't very strong, and it's likely that they dissipated along the way." Ning Zhuo sighed, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.

As their conversation reached this point, a subordinate from the caravan approached Song Fuli to report, "Leader, all the mechanical fire monkeys have been counted, and there are no discrepancies in quantity or quality." After confirming, Song Fuli laughed heartily and bid farewell to Ning Zhuo.

Before leaving, he paused slightly, turned around, and handed Ning Zhuo a talisman.

"This is a talisman we made using the cloud mud from the cloud whale." "You can think of it as a ticket."

"As long as you carry it, you can enter the cloud whale and travel to other places." Ning Zhuo quickly expressed his gratitude, also indicating that although he had this ticket, he might not necessarily return to the Flying Cloud Kingdom with Song Fuli and his group.

Song Fuli waved his hand, "We're not returning to the Flying Cloud Kingdom immediately either. Next, we'll be wandering around the Southern Bean Kingdom, and if business is good, we might continue south." "This talisman isn't just effective within the cloud whale; it's also a credential."

"In the future, if you encounter other cloud merchant caravans, you can use this to prove your good relationship with our cloud merchants. With this talisman, cultivators can still board other cloud merchant ships or cloud beasts." The practicality of the talisman Song Fuli provided far exceeded Ning Zhuo's expectations.

Ning Zhuo thanked him again, watching as Song Fuli, along with numerous mechanical fire monkeys, returned to the cloud whale.

A large number of Mechanical Monkeys were sent into the cloud whale, where the caravan's cultivators conducted the handover.

"Next, it's up to you!" "Everything's been counted, and the numbers match."

"Alright, open the warehouse doors, and we'll place these goods inside." The warehouse doors, like clouds and smoke, quickly dissipated.

Then, from within the warehouse, emerged cloud octupuses.

These octopuses floated in the air, extending their tentacles to bind the mechanical fire monkeys, lifting them into the air, and then slowly drifting into the warehouse.

The spaciousness of Warehouse No. 188 was considerable.

The warehouse was empty, without even a single shelf.

The cultivator responsible for managing the warehouse approached the wall, took out his identity token, and placed it at a key position on the wall.

He channeled his mana into the token.

The token quickly emitted a faint yellow light.

The yellow light rapidly spread, permeating the cloud-like walls, flowing out swiftly, transforming into a network of lines like flowing water.

These lines quickly spread across the entire wall.

In the next moment, the wall underwent a transformation, resembling swirling clouds, then rapidly condensed together, forming a massive shelf tightly attached to the wall and ceiling.

The octopus hands holding the mechanical fire monkeys floated into the air, placing the mechanical fire monkeys into the compartments of these shelves.

It was evident that these compartments could be adjusted at will.

The current space was just enough to fit one mechanical fire monkey.

Under the work of hundreds of cloud octupuses, although the number of Mechanical Monkeys was large, it only took the time of a cup of tea to arrange them all neatly.

After a final check by the caravan cultivators, they retracted all the cloud octupuses and left.

After they left, a large mass of cloud mist slowly emerged, then quickly condensed, forming a solid wall that replaced the door.

Thus, Warehouse No. 188 was empty and very quiet.

Suddenly, a ripple appeared in the air.

Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu emerged from within one of the mechanical fire monkeys.</div>
