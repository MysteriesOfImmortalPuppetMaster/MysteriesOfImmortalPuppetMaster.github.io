<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The current Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had already been swept into a massive whirlpool, unable to control its own fate!<br/>
<br/>
"If it weren't for Ning Xiaohui, I would never have revealed this crucial information to Ning Zhuo!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was very reluctant. As it sighed, its expression suddenly turned fierce, revealing a look of horror.<br/>
<br/>
"Life-Hanging Thread!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo is in a crisis and urgently needs key information. He couldn't get it from Ning Jiufan, but he got it from me. The reason I helped him is because of Ning Xiaohui."<br/>
<br/>
"Even though Ning Xiaohui despises and hates Ning Zhuo, she has also been planted with the Life-Hanging Thread. Her fate energy can be used by Ning Zhuo!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was naturally quite familiar with the Life-Hanging Thread Divine Ability.<br/>
<br/>
Realizing the hidden competition of fate energy, the mysterious changes and influences, it couldn't help but shrink its head back into its shell.<br/>
<br/>
The complete Life-Hanging Thread Divine Ability was already in effect.<br/>
<br/>
However, very few people could detect it!<br/>
<br/>
Even the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had only glimpsed a corner of the fate energy's influence and changes.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
He understood the implication of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's words—as a guardian of the palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit itself could not take action against the trial disciples, but he could!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had informed him because it knew Ning Zhuo could stop Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
The reason was simple.<br/>
<br/>
Life-Hanging Thread!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui had long been planted with the Life-Hanging Thread by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Once this divine ability was activated, it might lead Ning Xiaohui to her death.<br/>
<br/>
"But this matter requires careful planning."<br/>
<br/>
Directly using the divine ability would inevitably attract Ning Jiufan's investigation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui was a genius, possessing the Ice Jade Hand, and was a prominent figure in the main branch at the Qi Refining Stage.<br/>
<br/>
If she died, the entire Ning family would be shaken.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family's and Ning Jiufan's investigation was not the main concern; the real threat was Zhu Xuanji!<br/>
<br/>
Given Zhu Xuanji's current alliance with the three families, he would almost certainly participate in the subsequent investigation.<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, I still haven't had the chance to ask the Fire Spirit about the Foundation Establishment method." Ning Zhuo sighed.<br/>
<br/>
In his two exchanges with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, he was always in a hurry and never had the opportunity to inquire about the Foundation Establishment method to confirm his previous suspicions.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo licked his dry lips, stopped thinking about it, and immediately entered the Immortal Palace with his soul.<br/>
<br/>
He needed to contact Sun Lingtong immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Although there were other means of contact, they could no longer be used now.<br/>
<br/>
"Zhu Xuanji asked me a few questions and then left."<br/>
<br/>
"He came and went with great fanfare, only giving me three days to respond. It was all thunder and no rain! This is very unlike his usual low-key style when investigating cases."<br/>
<br/>
"So, he likely planted some monitoring method on me or in this room. Using conventional methods to contact Sun Lingtong would be equivalent to exposing myself. Now, I can only hope that Sun Lingtong is also in the Lava Immortal Palace!"<br/>
<br/>
Since being brought into the trial by Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong had also subsequently obtained the status of a trial disciple.<br/>
<br/>
This meant he could freely enter and exit the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the puppet Ning Zhuo appeared in Room No. 1, the puppet Sun Lingtong, hiding in the corner, immediately came over.<br/>
<br/>
"What exactly happened? Why is Zhu Xuanji looking for you?" Sun Lingtong asked.<br/>
<br/>
Although he was in the underground base, he had always kept an eye on the external situation.<br/>
<br/>
Such a big event had caused a stir throughout the city, and Sun Lingtong quickly learned about it.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately realized that he could no longer use the old methods to contact Ning Zhuo. It was too dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
So, he immediately set off and entered the Lava Immortal Palace to wait.<br/>
<br/>
He believed that if Ning Zhuo wanted to contact him, he would definitely use this method.<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, he found Ning Zhuo! Ning Zhuo also contacted Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
This was the tacit understanding developed between the two brothers over the past decade!<br/>
<br/>
"This is not the place to talk." Ning Zhuo first led Sun Lingtong all the way to the depths of the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
After arranging the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng in the previous checkpoint and ensuring that there was no one else in the room, Ning Zhuo briefly explained the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's reaction was as expected by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Zhu Xuanji is investigating you and gave you three days. Why not take this time to run away? If you are found out, you will face severe punishment under the laws of the Southern Bean Kingdom! The Ning family won't be able to protect you; only the Void Sect would be relatively safe."<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been eavesdropping on their conversation and was secretly anxious upon hearing Sun Lingtong's suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo ran away, what would happen to it?<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit didn't dare to interrupt directly and could only anxiously pace around the main hall.<br/>
<br/>
It secretly prayed, hoping that Ning Zhuo would do something good and at least deal with Ning Xiaohui before running away.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo rejected Sun Lingtong's suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Sun, you know I won't give up easily! The Lava Immortal Palace is of great significance to me. And now is not the time to be truly desperate."<br/>
<br/>
"I have already thought of some countermeasures."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sighed. When he tried to persuade Ning Zhuo, he had already anticipated Ning Zhuo's response.<br/>
<br/>
"Tell me, what are your countermeasures, and how can I help you?" Ning Zhuo told him to go to the secret base and assemble the Golden Core Stage mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
By now, the manufacturing projects Ning Zhuo had assigned outside were all completed.<br/>
<br/>
With the skeleton and armor already in place, Ning Zhuo could fill in the mechanical components he had obtained from the Lava Immortal Palace and assemble them to get a Golden Core Stage mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
"Currently, we urgently need Golden Core Stage combat power to guard against unexpected events!" Sun Lingtong nodded. "I'll help you assemble it." The skeleton and armor were already in the underground secret base.<br/>
<br/>
Transferring the mechanical components from Ning Zhuo's body was a bit troublesome.<br/>
<br/>
But with the brothers' decade-long cooperation and their rich experience in black market smuggling, it was just troublesome, not difficult.<br/>
<br/>
"In addition, I need you, Brother Sun, to impersonate Yang Chanyu once more and then the Shadow Demon Cultivator." Sun Lingtong nodded. "I'm quite familiar with Yang Chanyu, no problem. But the Shadow Demon Cultivator... I've never seen him." Ning Zhuo said, "I've seen him with my own eyes."<br/>
<br/>
"Since the Fire Persimmon Mountain incident, I had a premonition that I might need to use this identity to disguise myself and facilitate my actions. So I prepared some clothes in advance and hid them in the underground secret base of the Ding-character area." Ning Zhuo then told Sun Lingtong the specific hiding place of these clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong memorized it while patting Ning Zhuo's shoulder. "Being prepared for any eventuality is indeed your style. Not bad, not bad." Ning Zhuo continued, "The true scripture has already been refined and become part of the Golden Blood Battle Ape."<br/>
<br/>
"But the true scripture can and must exist!"<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Sun, can you forge a true scripture?"<br/>
<br/>
"To gain others' trust, we can also throw in the Demonic Blood Vein Technique at the ninth level of Qi Refining." Sun Lingtong thought for a moment. "I will do my best to forge the true scripture, but I can't guarantee the actual effect."<br/>
<br/>
"After all, we are trying to deceive a Golden Core Stage figure, especially someone like Zhu Xuanji, who possesses the Heavenly Talent Ghost Eye."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded and sighed. "I understand! Given the current situation, we can only do our best and leave the rest to fate."<br/>
<br/>
"If something happens to me, Brother Sun, please take the Golden Core Stage mechanical ape and leave immediately."<br/>
<br/>
"I estimate that I will be detained by Zhu Xuanji and sent to the capital of the Southern Bean Kingdom for trial."<br/>
<br/>
"If you remain free, you might find an opportunity to rescue me."<br/>
<br/>
"If possible, take the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai with you."<br/>
<br/>
"I also have some treasure locations, and you know their specific addresses."<br/>
<br/>
"By the way, I also have a treasure seal..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was about to tell Sun Lingtong about the existence of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong quickly reached out to stop him from continuing.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was a bit angry. "Enough! Ning Zhuo, we will definitely succeed this time."<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Sun Lingtong showed strong confidence and a more determined fighting spirit than Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"In the past decade, we brothers have never failed to accomplish anything together!"<br/>
<br/>
"So, we will overcome this difficulty as well."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned, then laughed heartily three times and patted Sun Lingtong's shoulder with a firm tone. "Brother Sun, you are absolutely right!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong parted ways, each fully exploring the path of the Demonic Gate.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong left him and returned to his body.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo..." When alone, Sun Lingtong's face showed a worried expression.<br/>
<br/>
He knew that Ning Zhuo's last words were just an excuse to deceive him into escaping alone.<br/>
<br/>
This indicated that Ning Zhuo had no confidence in overcoming this difficulty!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong could fully understand.<br/>
<br/>
Because if it were him, he would be even less confident than Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
This situation was extremely dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo not only has to face Zhu Xuanji's investigation but also the life-and-death dilemma of Ning Xiaohui."<br/>
<br/>
"His method is quite risky, and the forged true scripture is the most crucial tool."<br/>
<br/>
"Can I really succeed?"<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, Sun Lingtong became even less confident.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he was only at the Foundation Establishment Stage, and it was his first time confronting someone like Zhu Xuanji in this manner.<br/>
<br/>
"There is someone more talented than me."<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps, I should seek her help?"<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Sun Lingtong thought of Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu's cultivation was higher than his, being a Golden Core true disciple of the Void Sect.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu's cultivation of the Ancient Cicada Technique was also extremely adept at disguise.<br/>
<br/>
Once this thought appeared, Sun Lingtong could no longer suppress it.<br/>
<br/>
He took a deep breath and quickly decided to secretly seek Yang Chanyu's help.<br/>
<br/>
He quietly left the underground secret base, looked up at the sky and the sun, and thought that he had been cooped up in the underground base for a long time, and now he finally saw the daylight.<br/>
<br/>
He walked quietly through the alleys, following the barely noticeable secret marks, and soon found Yang Chanyu.<br/>
