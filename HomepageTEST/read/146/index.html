<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 146: Sun Lingtong Feels Terrified

The envoy of the Gloomy Ghost Realm, Cheng Bai.

Its main body was black, with gray and white accents.

Standing at six feet five inches, it was extremely thin.

Its head seemed to wear a conical hat, but it was actually part of its body.

The skull resembled a pitch-black conical hat, spreading outwards.

Under the shadow cast by the hat, its entire gray-white head was hidden, reminiscent of a ghastly human skull.

Its eyes were a black strip across the nose bridge, with a faint gray-white line in the middle.

The surface of its body was also covered with intricate talismanic engravings, outlined by various gray-white lines, appearing and disappearing intermittently.

If not observed carefully, it seemed as if ghostly figures were entwined around its body.

“What a marvelous mechanical construct,” Ning Zhuo exclaimed excitedly as he ran forward.

Behind him, Sun Lingtong saw Ning Zhuo’s excitement and shook his head with a faint smile.

He knew that Ning Zhuo had a genuine love for all kinds of mechanical constructs.

When he was two or three years old, Ning Zhuo would linger at street vendors.

In school, he was fascinated by mechanical toys like the two-legged and three-haired ones but couldn’t afford them.

It was Sun Lingtong who, after noticing this, bought Ning Zhuo a mechanical toy for his birthday, making him ecstatic and happy for a long time.

“The skeleton seems to be made of Ghostly Blue Nether Iron, perfect for channeling yin-based power. The key parts use century-old Soul Wood, which is very flexible and can serve as a residence for spirits. The core is made of Yin Deficiency Spirit Jade, a special natural spirit stone that can store a massive amount of yin energy!” Finally, Ning Zhuo grabbed the edge of the hat and lifted it slightly to examine the eyes of the mechanical construct, Cheng Bai.

“It seems to be made of Deathlight Glass, one of the main materials. The eye components must be made of mixed materials!” Ning Zhuo concluded confidently.

“If that’s the case…” Ning Zhuo suddenly clapped his hands, “This mechanical puppet should be able to use its innate talent! The special structure of the eyes is designed for the Netherworld Death Eyes.” With this thought, Ning Zhuo turned his head sharply and looked at Sun Lingtong, “Boss Sun, what information did you get?”

Sun Lingtong was taken aback, “I didn’t get anything.”

“My fault, my fault. I got too excited!” Ning Zhuo patted his wooden head, making a thumping sound.

The next moment, he invoked the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and activated the Life-Hanging Thread.

“I got a lot of information,” Sun Lingtong said.

Ning Zhuo nodded, “That’s the same as me!”

Sun Lingtong relayed, “This mechanical puppet is called the Netherworld Envoy, Cheng Bai. Under its forehead is the Netherworld Official Seal, which can summon various ghosts and gods. The neck has the Soul-Shaking Throat Drum, which can emit sound attacks that violently shake the souls of living beings. Further down, there are the Roaring Chamber and the Sound Emission Bottle, which work in conjunction with the Soul-Shaking Throat Drum.”

“The mechanical spray holes distributed throughout its body can emit Golden Silk Ghost Gauze when activated. The gauze can instantly form a protective black robe.” Ning Zhuo nodded slightly as he listened.

The puppet Cheng Bai and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng had a significant difference: the mechanical components were numerous.

Ning Zhuo understood the reason: “Before refining, Boss Sun integrated the Netherworld Ghost God Seal, the Soul-Shaking Drum, and the broken robe into Cheng Bai’s dantian.”

“During the refining process, the Lava Immortal Palace melted these magic treasures together to create the corresponding mechanical components.”

Sun Lingtong suddenly widened his eyes, “Six parts of spirit, capable of using the Netherworld Death Eyes twelve times? Each activation will damage the eye structure, requiring timely replacement of parts for subsequent use. The Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai possesses the Nine Nether Formation and the Spirit Communication Formation. The former can mobilize yin energy to replenish itself or enhance spell effectiveness. The latter can communicate with intelligent life within a certain range. The Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai retains the Soul Devouring Golden Core. Using the Nine Revolutions Soul Devouring Technique, it can absorb the souls of enemies to enhance its state or supplement the Ghost Soul Army.”

This was within Ning Zhuo’s expectations, as the mechanical Yuan Dasheng could also use the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.

“The mechanical components include twelve Ghost Nurturing Jars, placed throughout the body. If they can store the ashes of ghosts, the effect of nurturing ghosts will be better. There are thirty-six talismanic spells in total…” Sun Lingtong gradually trailed off.

Ning Zhuo, who had been listening intently, quickly asked, “Boss Sun, what’s wrong?”

Sun Lingtong’s voice trembled, “This… is a bit terrifying.”

“What do you mean?” Ning Zhuo inquired.

Sun Lingtong scratched his head, “Little Zhuo, you know about the Burial Spirit Sect, right?”

Ning Zhuo immediately nodded, “Yes, a demonic sect, very powerful, but they killed people to sacrifice spirits, burying all things in the world just to seek spirituality. Because they were too ruthless, they were besieged and exterminated.”

Sun Lingtong nodded, “The Burial Spirit Sect buried countless lives just to seek spirituality, and they were besieged by the righteous, demonic, and evil factions. Look at the Lava Immortal Palace!”

“It not only refines spirituality but also thoughtfully arranges a mechanical body for it. Although the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai is limited by its structure and has a thin body, with just three main mechanical components, it can definitely reach Golden Core combat power if developed further. If outsiders discover that the Lava Immortal Palace has such capabilities, what do you think will happen?”

Ning Zhuo’s heart sank, and he fell silent.

Back then, the Burial Spirit Sect was targeted by almost the entire cultivation world just for seeking spirituality through sacrifices.

The entire sect was exterminated before they stopped.

Now, the Lava Immortal Palace not only seeks spirituality through sacrifices but also thoughtfully provides a mechanical body for it, giving the spirituality an immediate use.

What would happen if this were discovered?

Ning Zhuo thought about it and compared it to the Burial Spirit Sect, feeling a chill run down his spine.

Sun Lingtong sighed deeply, “The Three Sects’ experts are formidable. It seems they also participated in the extermination of the Burial Spirit Sect. They once joined the Vast Sect and practiced for a long time. Look at the mechanical constructs they refined, truly demonic!”

One of the fundamental differences between the demonic path and the righteous path is that the demonic path’s cultivation resources come from the cultivators themselves.

The Lava Immortal Palace’s practice of refining mechanical constructs using corpses as materials is undoubtedly a demonic act.

Ning Zhuo shook his head, “Boss Sun, these are just tools. If used for good, they are good. If used for evil, they are evil.”

“Just like how we took control of the black market and reorganized it, eliminating countless evils and crimes. This is an act of justice.”

Sun Lingtong laughed, “Brother, weren’t we initially doing this for revenge?”

“Later, as our influence grew, we fought many battles for convenience in gathering information and seeking profit, gradually becoming the overlords of the black market and eventually its rulers.”

Ning Zhuo coughed, “We indeed prevented a lot of bloodshed and indirectly saved many innocent lives. Boss, don’t you agree?”

“You…” Sun Lingtong chuckled, “Yes, yes, yes!”

If it were someone else being so hypocritical, Sun Lingtong would have rolled his eyes and even spat at them.

Too insincere, too hypocritical.

But since it was his good brother Ning Zhuo, he let it slide.

Sun Lingtong could only shake his head and smile indulgently, choosing to see through but not speak out.

“Actually, it’s not Ning Zhuo’s fault.”

“Think about the righteous people he encountered when he was young. Ning Ze, Wang Lan, Ning Ji, and Ning Xiaohui… weren’t they all hypocrites?”

“So, in Ning Zhuo’s initial understanding, the righteous path was supposed to be like this.”

Ning Zhuo pondered, “With only six parts of spirit, we should aim to increase it to ten parts! The spirit is the most valuable and precious part of this mechanical puppet. We need information about Cheng Bai.”

“That’s a bit difficult,” Sun Lingtong spread his hands, “I’m already wanted throughout the city, and we’ve lost the black market. Our previous information channels are mostly useless now.”

Ning Zhuo sighed, “Well, we’ll have to take it one step at a time.”

Sun Lingtong said, “With Cheng Bai dead, the Soul Devouring Sect will definitely react. We should lay low and not rush to investigate Cheng Bai’s matters, or we might get caught.”

“Alright, I’ll listen to you, Boss,” Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly.

This exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace yielded great rewards for Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.

They successfully eliminated the hidden threat of Cheng Bai, as keeping him sealed was not a long-term solution.

The previous imprisonment of Han Ming was a painful lesson.

Next, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo tested the power of the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai using the checkpoints.

The result was that Cheng Bai’s combat power was much lower than they had imagined.

The Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai was made of ordinary materials, so when it unleashed its Golden Core power, the mechanical body couldn’t withstand it.

This was quite awkward.

Cheng Bai’s two main mechanical components were the Netherworld Official Seal and the Soul-Shaking Throat Drum.

The Netherworld Official Seal could communicate with ghosts and gods.

The ghosts and gods were not controlled by Sun Lingtong but by the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai.

With only six parts of spirit, Cheng Bai couldn’t communicate with the summoned ghosts and gods.

The Soul-Shaking Throat Drum was powerful, but the mechanical puppets in the checkpoints had no souls.

It was like Cheng Bai trying to shake the soul of the Tree Martial Ape Da Sheng but finding no soul to shake.

Cheng Bai also had the innate talent of the Netherworld Death Eyes, but with only six parts of spirit, it could only be used twelve times.

Moreover, this talent was mainly for reconnaissance, so Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had no intention of trying it.

Ning Zhuo also found that Sun Lingtong’s control over the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai was much weaker than his control over Yuan Dasheng.

Sun Lingtong speculated, “The Three Sects’ experts set up the Buddha’s Three Gates to ensure that each trial disciple has a decent mechanical construct. This mechanical construct can serve as the main general. Initially, the materials are ordinary and cheap. In the subsequent checkpoints, there will be many opportunities to modify and upgrade the main general. In this process of assembling and modifying the main general, the trial disciples’ mechanical skills will also improve.”

In any case, the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai still had great potential, requiring future investment to truly realize its Golden Core power.

“It’s almost time, Little Zhuo. We should head back,” Sun Lingtong reminded.

Ning Zhuo replied, “We still have some time. We must make the most of every opportunity to explore the Lava Immortal Palace! I have a good idea now.”

“Oh? Let’s hear it.”</div>
