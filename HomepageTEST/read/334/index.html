"This little brat! When you come back, I’ll hang you up and spank you until your bottom is swollen!" Ning Jiufan gritted his teeth in anger.

A flying message, like a bird, kept knocking against the window.
With a thought, Ning Jiufan opened the window and let the flying message in.
It was a letter from Ning Zhuo.
"Ancestor, by the time you read this letter, I have probably already run away from home..."

The letter mainly contained Ning Zhuo's thoughts on the current situation with the Ning family, Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and the ongoing power struggle between the Zhu family and the Meng family.
Ning Zhuo predicted: Soon, there would be a huge conflict between the Ning family, Zhou family, against the Meng family for the positions in Lava Immortal Palace. There was also the Great Purity Palace.

The Great Purity Palace took away a group of Zheng family cultivators, many of which held positions in the Immortal Palace.

Ning Zhuo believed that this super sect had yet to give up on controlling the Lava Immortal Palace.
This could be something to take advantage of.

Ning Zhuo left behind a batch of supplies, which would be soon delivered to Ning Jiufan. This gesture was meant to compensate and repay the main branch of the family for their nurturing of him.

Finally, Ning Zhuo reminded Ning Jiufan that upon his departure, he hadn’t left behind any mechanical constructs, so Ning Jiufan would need to take good care of the branch family. Although the Fire Fusion Demon Ape could belaunch attacks through techniques and artifacts, Ning Zhuo strongly advised against it.

According to his words, fostering loyalty through relationships was the right path!
After finishing the letter, much of Ning Jiufan’s anger dissipated. He sighed, "This brat... he’s still willing to protect the family in the end."

"Not only that, but he even dares to meddle in the affairs of his ancestor! Hmph!"

"Wait a minute, could it be that this letter was also part of his calculation? Did he factor in my anger as well?"
Ning Jiufan's face clouded with uncertainty.

He couldn’t deny that during the struggle for control over Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo’s patience, cunning, and other qualities had left a lasting impression on him.
To the point that Ning Jiufan, a Golden Core cultivator, was now filled with doubt, suspecting that Ning Zhuo had tricked him again and factored him into the plan.

After pondering for a moment, Ning Jiufan exhaled deeply, resolving not to overthink.
"Overthinking is useless."
"Ning Zhuo is inherently good-hearted, loyal to the family. Though occasionally sly, he has his limits. Such talents need to be honed further."

Ning Jiufan concluded his thoughts about how to solidify Ning Zhuo’s status. Perhaps instead of posthumous titles, they could emphasize Ning Zhuo’s contributions, increasing his loyalty to the family.
"Besides, during the Yin World Ritual, when the family performs its small offerings to communicate with the underworld, you should personally seek higher blessings and protections for Ning Zhuo."
At the City Lord's Mansion...

"Ning Zhuo is gone?"
"A Nascent Soul-level mechanical construct, using secret techniques to escape... I didn’t understand the Lava Immortal Palace well."
Fei Si, reading the report, felt a wave of relief.
How could one allow another to sleep peacefully beside their own bed?
Although Ning Zhuo’s cultivation was weak, his demonstrated battle strength and cunning had left those in the know deeply wary.
Fei Si was no exception.

Zhu Xuanji departed from Fire Persimmon Immortal City the following afternoon.
As he ascended into the sky, he couldn’t help but look back.
Fire Persimmon Mountain loomed beneath him, its jagged peaks like a giant awakening from sleep.
After the violent volcanic eruption, the cooled lava at the mountain’s lower levels had formed a patch of red and white ground, covering the slopes.

The traces of the lava flow resembled massive veins, twisting and winding, recording nature’s powerful roars.
Further up the mountain was the vast complex of buildings that formed Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Although some parts were damaged, the city remained largely intact.

The threat of destruction from the demon beast tide had been averted thanks to the citizens’ unity and resolve, and the crisis was ultimately overcome.

At the base of the mountain were small patches of persimmon orchards.
Though the next Fire Persimmon Festival was still months away, the volcanic eruption had brought a surge of heat that the city’s protective arrays absorbed, converting it into an abundant persimmon harvest.

Where the tree branches were once bare, clusters of large persimmons now hung, newly formed. The red, round fruits looked like the future hope of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

However, the city’s outlook seemed as mysterious and uncertain as the heavy clouds that often shrouded the mountaintop, ambiguous and not necessarily foreboding.

Zhu Xuanji’s eyes flashed with golden light, piercing through the clouds to see the crater, where the Lava Immortal Palace floated atop the molten rock.
The palace was being rebuilt, with Meng Kui personally leading the effort. He used his magic to retrieve fallen fragments from the lava, while numerous other cultivators worked with him, fully dedicated to piecing the broken palace back together.
"The Master of the Three Sects..." Zhu Xuanjii showed a trace of fear.

These days, whenever he had a moment to reflect, his mind involuntarily replayed the scene of him, at the last critical moment, turning against Meng Kui to aid Ning Zhuo.
That moment, he had, as if guided by some unseen force, used his Golden Phoenix Mirror to target Meng Kui’s mighty magic hand.
This single action had put the Southern Bean royal family at odds with Meng Kui, directly preventing him from dealing a lethal blow to Ning Zhuo.

“At that time, was it really my own decision to assist Ning Zhuo? Or... was I already under his influence?”
After the event, Zhu Xuanji often recalled that pivotal moment, feeling uneasy, as if he had been manipulated like a puppet.
Yet, as time passed and he revisited those thoughts, his suspicions blurred, making it seem as if his actions had been instinctive—his body reacting faster than his mind.
Now, having replayed the scenario countless times, Zhu Xuanji found himself doubting everything.
As Fire Persimmon Immortal City gradually faded behind him, Zhu Xuanji couldn't help but reach up, feeling the top of his head.

“Was a Life-Hanging thread attached to me that day?”
He felt nothing.

The memory of a past scene from the royal capital floated to the surface of his mind. A line spoken by the Master of the Three Sects grew increasingly chilling as he pondered it.
At that time, the Southern Bean Empress had taken the metal mirror.
The Master of the Three Sects had said, "Fate is sealed. Since he has taken the metal mirror, let him protect the Immortal Palace’s legacy for a while."

Strangely, the further Zhu Xuanji flew from Fire Persimmon Mountain, the more peaceful and calm he felt.
It was as though a wild beast had escaped a giant trap!
A sense of danger arose.

"Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Lava Immortal Palace... something is definitely off."
A strong intuition emerged, telling Zhu Xuanji to stay as far away from these places as possible.
"And Ning Zhuo too!"

"Limit your interactions with him as much as possible. After all, he’s the chosen one of the Master of the Three Sects—the destined child for the Buddha-Demon conflict."

As Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, and the others departed, Fire Persimmon Immortal City gradually returned to its peaceful atmosphere.
With no more Crimson Flame Beasts rampaging and the Lava Immortal Palace no longer leaderless, the visiting cultivators also began leaving Fire Persimmon Mountain.

In the Flying Disc Workshop of Fire Persimmon Immortal City...
An elderly man in white robes with graying hair sat in a mechanical chair, cultivating his magic.
The chair floated a few feet off the ground.

His eyes were sunken, his breathing deep—it was Chen Cha.
Suddenly, Chen Cha’s body convulsed violently, as if struck by lightning. He abruptly opened his eyes.
His pupils were completely gone, leaving only eerie whites.
From those whites, wisps of white smoke drifted out.

Chen Cha seemed like a different person, quickly turning his head and scanning the surroundings before focusing intently on the direction of Lava Immortal Palace.

His fingers moved slowly, leaving afterimages in the air.
As he calculated, the white smoke in his eyes grew thicker, giving Chen Cha a misty, ethereal appearance, like an immortal shrouded in fog.

"Zhu Xuanji should have stayed to guard the Immortal Palace. Why did he leave?"

"And Meng Kui too! He’s gone as well!"

"This situation was orchestrated by the Master of the Three Sects. Logically, there shouldn’t have been any mistakes. The Immortal Palace used the Life Thread Divine Ability. It should’ve been completely foolproof! But now the situation has turned out like this? Who could be behind this?"

"Now that this is ruined, most of my plans in the Southern Bean Kingdom are ruined as well. What a headache. How can this be fixed?"

After completing his calculations, Chen Cha looked distressed.
"Could it have been Ning Zhuo who ruined this plan?"

"For now, the top priority is to find Zhu Xuanji and Ning Zhuo to find the root of the problem."
After this thought, Chen Cha slowly closed his eyes.
The white smoke filling the room quickly dissipated.

His breathing returned to normal as he resumed his cultivation.
After one incense stick’s time, Chen Cha opened his eyes again, his pupils restored. His magical power was fully replenished, and he began studying the mechanical texts.

These texts had been specially arranged by Ning Zhuo for delivery to Chen Cha before he left the city.
"Meeting Ning Zhuo was my good fortune," Chen Cha thought, his heart filled with gratitude as he absorbed the knowledge from the jade slip.

He seemed completely unaware of the strange incident that had just occurred, with no memory of it whatsoever!
