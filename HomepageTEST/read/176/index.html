Zhou Zeshen (Part 2)

"This sparring feels somewhat pointless," Ning Zhuo thought, as the Mechanical Thunder Silence Bird above his head was half-destroyed, feeling a sense of futility deep inside.

"Zhou Zeshen initiated this sparring to get closer to me."

"In the first round, he deliberately lost, holding back to give me an advantage and save face."

"In the second round, I should reciprocate and let him showcase his skills."

"Oh?"

At this moment, Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up as he saw Zhou Zeshen take out the White Tiger Mechanical Beast.

"So, Brother Zhou, you also find this boring and want to add some fun... Very well."

"Now is the perfect time to let it shine," Ning Zhuo thought as he touched his storage belt.

With a flash of fire, a python appeared before him.

The python was about five zhang long and one chi five cun in circumference, entirely red and made of wood.

Its eyes were crafted from red crystals, coiled like a giant log, exuding an imposing aura.

Zhou Zeshen raised an eyebrow, feeling pleased, "Excellent, now this is more like it. Show your full strength, Ning Zhuo!" Zhou Zeshen's fighting spirit surged.

Ning Zhuo transmitted his voice gently, "Brother Zhou, behold, this Fire Bamboo Snake is a new mechanical creation of mine, meant to be used as an elite."

Zhou Zeshen's pupils slightly contracted, "A new creation by Brother Ning? Interesting, you've successfully piqued my interest. But please be careful, Brother Ning."

"My White Tiger Assault Chariot is a classic creation of the Mudflow Sect, well-tested and equipped with three types of heads."

"If Brother Ning loses, don't blame me for not warning you beforehand."

Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, saying no more, and used his mana to control the Fire Bamboo Snake, sending it forward.

Zhou Zeshen's White Tiger Assault Chariot also moved its limbs, sprinting wildly through the forest.

Then, it suddenly leaped, its body gracefully stretching in mid-air, crossing over ten zhang to land on the opposite mountain.

Boom!

The mechanical tiger and snake collided solidly on the mountainside, their heads clashing with a loud explosion.

The snake's head reared high, while the tiger's head retracted into its neck.

The internal mechanism rotated, and when it extended again, the beast head had transformed into a ramming head.

Though the ramming head was carved with tiger patterns, it was a solid piece, made of sturdy material, extremely hard.

The White Tiger charged forward, raising a gust of wind.

Under Ning Zhuo's control, the Fire Bamboo Snake agilely dodged.

Suddenly, white light burst from the White Tiger, shining on the Fire Bamboo Snake, making its skin transparent and revealing its internal mechanical structure.

The Fire Bamboo Snake's skeleton had large spherical joints at regular intervals.

One side of the sphere was pitch black, the other pure white.

The black side bore the character for "death," while the white side had the character for "life."

With each movement of the Fire Bamboo Snake, the spheres rotated and paused, some stopping on the black "death" side, others on the white "life" side.

When the sphere showed the white "life" side, the joints moved freely.

When it showed the black "death" side, the joints locked.

The ingenious part was that the spheres and snake bones were arranged with formations, forming a tight, cohesive unit.

"Interesting mechanical components," Zhou Zeshen thought as he observed this scene up close through the White Tiger Assault Chariot, understanding part of the reason for the Fire Bamboo Snake's agility.

These spherical components were the Half-Dead Half-Alive Beads.

Back then, Chen Cha, feeling guilty, had given Ning Zhuo his life's work as compensation.

The Half-Dead Half-Alive Beads were Chen Cha's unique creation.

Additionally, there was a collection of formations called the "Curved Snake Elastic Formation Collection," which was an early fortuitous encounter for Chen Cha.

With these two items, combined with his own mechanical expertise and a bit of inspiration, Ning Zhuo eventually created the Fire Bamboo Snake.

The clash between the snake and tiger was fierce, breaking trees and raising dust, making it hard to determine a winner.

Zhou Zeshen's ten fingers moved like playing a zither, constantly stretching and plucking.

His main focus was on controlling the White Tiger Assault Chariot.

The remaining focus was on the Ground Drilling Mouse.

In the first round, the Ground Drilling Mouse did not return to Zhou Zeshen but burrowed underground, heading towards Ning Zhuo.

Although the Night Sky Bats in the sky were more numerous and could attack Ning Zhuo faster, Zhou Zeshen had his pride.

He thought, "Since Ning Zhuo deliberately held back in the air battle, I can't take advantage of this intentional concession."

So, he chose the Ground Drilling Mouse.

When the Ground Drilling Mouse was ten zhang away from Ning Zhuo, he noticed it.

Ning Zhuo maintained his spells for detection.

Upon discovering the Ground Drilling Mouse, Ning Zhuo didn't move but took out a new mechanical Fire Blast Monkey to guard himself.

Seeing this, Zhou Zeshen's pupils contracted.

Ning Zhuo's control ability was clearly superior.

At this moment, Ning Zhuo controlled the Fire Bamboo Snake and five Fire Blast Monkeys from the first wave to charge at Zhou Zeshen.

Simultaneously, he added five more Fire Blast Monkeys.

The second wave of Fire Blast Monkeys, under Ning Zhuo's command, moved as nimbly as real monkeys.

This was something Zhou Zeshen couldn't achieve.

His current control limit was close to thirty.

But this number had two conditions.

One was only counting simple mechanical constructs like Night Sky Bats or Ground Drilling Mice.

The second was that Zhou Zeshen had to take Mind-Splitting Powder and other pills.

The White Tiger Assault Chariot required more control to unleash its full potential.

This single construct occupied most of Zhou Zeshen's attention.

He also controlled three Ground Drilling Mice, leaving only a few reserves for critical spellcasting.

Zhou Zeshen had already pushed his control to the limit.

Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo, without breaking a sweat, took out five more Fire Blast Monkeys, controlling them effortlessly.

If Zhou Zeshen wanted to increase his control, he would need to take pills.

"Indeed, Ning Zhuo's talent lies in his mind."

"This allows him to have far superior control in normal conditions."

"Is this his full strength? Eighty percent? Or ninety percent?"

Zhou Zeshen pondered, analyzing continuously.

Ning Zhuo used five Fire Blast Monkeys to guard himself, leaving no chance for the Ground Drilling Mouse.

He also used the powerful Fire Bamboo Snake to block the White Tiger Assault Chariot.

Finally, seeing the five Fire Blast Monkeys surrounding him, Zhou Zeshen exhaled a breath, laughed loudly, and admitted defeat.

The sparring ended, and the Ning family members watching discussed animatedly, fascinated by the mechanical constructs and control techniques displayed.

The most discussed was Ning Zhuo's newly revealed Fire Bamboo Snake.

In front of everyone, Zhou Zeshen handed over the Rivet Bolt Crossbow and mechanical blueprints to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo felt a newfound respect for Zhou Zeshen.

He thought, "Zhou Zeshen proposed this sparring, deliberately held back, and admitted defeat to boost my reputation. This is his gift to me."

"He knows I am rising and need fame. So, he sacrificed his own face to achieve this."

"This level of magnanimity is extraordinary."

Zhou Zeshen, observing Ning Zhuo, felt his attitude had become much friendlier.

He thought, "A passionate battle often reveals more than words."

"Although this full-force sparring didn't reach the level of heartfelt conversation, it was enough to show our sincerity."

"The only regret is not testing Ning Zhuo's full combat strength."

"Unless I take Mind-Splitting Powder and other pills..."

But that was clearly impossible.

Taking pills would mean the sparring was no longer friendly, showing a desperate desire for victory.

Thinking this, Zhou Zeshen felt a bit unwilling.

He couldn't help but probe with words, secretly transmitting, "Brother Ning, this time was just for fun, and I lost. But next time, I'll be more serious and use at least fifty percent of my strength."

Ning Zhuo's heart stirred, "So, Zhou Zeshen didn't even use half of his strength."

He smiled slightly, responding sincerely, "Brother Zhou, if you have the interest, I'll accompany you. Next time, I'll use at least forty percent of my strength."

Zhou Zeshen patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder, laughing heartily, "You!"

At the same time, he thought, "What a braggart!"

"He knows I'm probing, so he's using this method to brush me off?"

"Haha."

"Indeed, I shouldn't have expected to easily gauge his strength with a simple sentence."

Zhou Zeshen felt a kinship with Ning Zhuo, and Ning Zhuo felt a certain understanding with Zhou Zeshen.

They exchanged a knowing smile, recognizing each other as smart individuals with unspoken mutual understanding.

Returning to the small courtyard, they continued their conversation for a while.

Zhou Zeshen took the opportunity to ask Ning Zhuo for help with the Zhou family's reformation team, aiming to climb the ranks in the Lava Immortal Palace and push some of the City Lord's cultivators out of the top ten.

"Of course, if we can surpass the entry standard, that would be even better!"

Ning Zhuo shook his head, "Brother Zhou's ambition is admirable."

"Surpassing the entry standard? That's beyond my capability. Please forgive me, I can't commit, as I'm truly unable to spare the time."

Zhou Zeshen didn't give up, "Brother Ning, why not hear the Zhou family's terms for assistance?"

He listed a long string of resources, leaving Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others stunned.

Realizing the offer, they were all breathless, attracted by the generous reward.

But Ning Zhuo shook his head, smiling warmly yet firmly, refusing to agree.

Instead, Ning Zhuo proposed a new collaboration, "The Lava Immortal Palace is a legacy of mechanical arts. We're all stuck at the third level, only able to accumulate mechanical knowledge."

"Since our three families are allied, why not establish a joint academy to teach mechanical arts?"

"The teachers can be mechanical cultivators from each family."

"In my opinion, the guest cultivator Chu Xiyao recruited by your family would be very suitable."

Zhou Zeshen's eyes twinkled as he thought, "Among the three families, the Ning family's mechanical expertise and cultivator accumulation are the weakest. A joint academy would benefit the Ning family the most."

"But it's indeed a good proposal, beneficial to the Zhou family as well."

Thinking this, Zhou Zeshen expressed his appreciation and support but noted that the decision wasn't his to make and needed to be reported to his family.

Ning Zhuo agreed.

As they parted, Zhou Zeshen transmitted a piece of information to show goodwill, "The three family heads have almost agreed to gather the elite and fully explore the Immortal Palace again, aiming to defeat the Mechanical Ape."

"Many speculate that the Mechanical Ape might be a challenge set by the Three Sects' seniors. Defeating it could bring great rewards from the seniors."

"If we can kill the Mechanical Ape, we can study its internal structure and develop countermeasures."

Ning Zhuo was surprised, "Is that so? Thank you for the information. When will this start?"

Zhou Zeshen replied, "In the next few days. Before the full exploration, there will be a secret training session for everyone."

"Brother Ning, you should prepare well."

Ning Zhuo nodded solemnly, "Indeed, I must prepare thoroughly!"</div>
