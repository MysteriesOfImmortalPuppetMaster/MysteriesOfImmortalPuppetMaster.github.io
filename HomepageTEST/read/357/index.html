<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
On the day of the duel.<br/>
<br/>
In the large training arena, Ning Zhuo and Han Zhou stood facing each other.<br/>
<br/>
The crowd was large.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the cultivators were quite familiar with Han Zhou, but for many, it was their first time seeing Ning Zhuo.<br/>
"Is he Ning Zhuo from the Fire Persimmon Immortal City?"<br/>
"He looks quite ordinary to me. How did he win the favor of the eldest lady?"<br/>
"Whether he's ordinary or not, we’ll soon see in this fight."<br/>
<br/>
Many scrutinizing eyes were fixed on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Among them was Lin Shanshan, who had come in disguise.<br/>
<br/>
Since she had promised Ning Zhuo she would watch the fight, she intended to keep her word. However, over the past few days, she'd heard some annoying rumors, so she decided to disguise herself a bit to avoid attention.<br/>
<br/>
Blending into the crowd, Lin Shanshan was not noticeable.<br/>
Little did she know, a gaze quietly descended, observing the entire training arena and pinpointing her exact location in the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
That gaze belonged to Lin Bufan, the leader of the Myriad Medicine Sect.<br/>
Despite his many responsibilities and busy schedule, Lin Bufan had been informed of this trivial matter by someone close to him, who took it upon themselves to please their master during his brief rest.<br/>
<br/>
"Shanshan has never taken this much interest in a male cultivator before. Who exactly is this Ning Zhuo? Investigate him for me."<br/>
<br/>
After giving the order, Lin Bufan remembered the date of Ning Zhuo and Han Zhou's duel.<br/>
<br/>
Now, having specifically paused his duties, he activated a spell formation. Though far away in Yuanlai Mountain, he could clearly observe the fight on Little Contention Peak, seeing everything in detail.<br/>
<br/>
“He has a good appearance...” Lin Bufan thought as he observed Ning Zhuo for the first time and nodded slightly.<br/>
<br/>
He himself had a handsome and refined appearance, and Ning Zhuo's demeanor gave him the impression that Ning Zhuo came from a prestigious cultivation family.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan’s first impression of Ning Zhuo was quite favorable.<br/>
Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, was sizing up Han Zhou.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou was thin and pale.<br/>
<br/>
His face was weathered, showing the marks of hardship and fatigue. However, his eyes were calm, reflecting a strong will and an acceptance of suffering.<br/>
<br/>
His hair was sparse and disheveled, a mix of gray and white, as if it were the remnants of melting snow. It was loosely tied at the back with a simple hemp string, in a messy fashion.<br/>
<br/>
He wore a shabby gray robe, full of patches and tears. His feet were clad in worn-out straw sandals that made a scraping sound as he walked, with the soles so worn down that his frostbitten toes poked through.<br/>
<br/>
His skin was rough, marked by frostbite and scars, and his fingers were coated with a layer of white frost.<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, even cultivators of humble means would keep themselves somewhat tidy, at least ensuring their clothes were intact.<br/>
<br/>
But Han Zhou wasn't like that. It was as if he wanted everyone to know he came from a beggar's background.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cupped his hands and saluted: "Brother Han Zhou, I’ve been looking forward to this duel for a long time. Today, I hope to experience the strength of your bitter cold techniques."<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou's voice was hoarse: "Fellow Daoist Ning, our paths have brought us to this duel. Let us both do our best."<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou was direct. As soon as he finished speaking, he rushed toward Ning Zhuo, his fists clenched, cold air radiating outward and forming frost flowers.<br/>
<br/>
White frost quickly spread, covering the surface of his body.<br/>
<br/>
Frost Fist!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face became solemn. At the moment Han Zhou launched his attack, Ning Zhuo simultaneously retreated.<br/>
As he withdrew, he cast a spell.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, green vines burst from the ground, writhing like snakes, coiling toward Han Zhou.<br/>
Han Zhou suddenly accelerated, attempting to bypass the vines.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo expanded his divine sense, continuously controlling the vines, making them grow and wrap around Han Zhou.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that he couldn't evade, Han Zhou simply stood his ground, letting out a low shout as his fists pounded the vines, freezing them instantly. Cold air spread outward, rapidly encroaching on the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, having gathered intelligence beforehand, already knew that the cold energy Han Zhou emitted contained something unique: the bitter cold energy cultivated from the Bitter Cold Sutra.<br/>
<br/>
This energy was difficult to defend against. It could easily infiltrate a cultivator’s body, gradually corroding both their physical body and spirit.<br/>
<br/>
At first, the effects of this corrosion were subtle, but over time, as the cold energy accumulated, its impact became increasingly severe.<br/>
<br/>
Many of Han Zhou’s past opponents had fallen to this very bitter cold energy.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo activated his five-element power, circulating it to refine it into fire energy.<br/>
With a gesture of his hand, a pillar of fire shot out.<br/>
<br/>
At first, the pillar was thin, but midway through, it expanded like a giant serpent. By the time it reached Han Zhou, the fire column had grown so large that it resembled the support columns of a palace.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou stood motionless, not even attempting to dodge as the flames engulfed him.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the fire burned fiercely, but the bitter cold energy seeped into the flames, weakening them almost immediately.<br/>
Despite Ning Zhuo's efforts to reinforce the fire, he couldn't make the flames grow any stronger.<br/>
<br/>
After just a few breaths, the flames on Han Zhou’s body had almost entirely died down, leaving only a few flickering embers clinging to his hair and clothes.<br/>
<br/>
“Good fire technique,” Han Zhou calmly remarked before continuing his charge toward Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and then cast a spell of the earth element.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, yellow sand swirled, covering the entire arena.<br/>
<br/>
The sand attaching itself to Han Zhou gradually accumulated until it completely encased him, forming a clay sculpture.<br/>
<br/>
Earth Technique – Clay Sculpture!<br/>
<br/>
But soon, large patches of white frost began seeping out from within the sculpture.<br/>
<br/>
The frost solidified the sand into blocks, breaking apart the structure, which crumbled and fell away.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou walked out of the clay sculpture, his expression calm, his gaze firm, and his body exuding an aura of unrelenting hardship.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face remained expressionless as he used the metal element technique next.<br/>
<br/>
His palm struck like a blade, sending out a series of golden blades that slashed toward Han Zhou.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou continued walking forward, not dodging.<br/>
The golden blades finally managed to tear his already tattered clothes and leave some wounds on his body, causing a little blood to seep out.<br/>
<br/>
“Multiple elements!”<br/>
Han Zhou’s face grew even more weathered, but his aura surged to its peak.<br/>
<br/>
Though he had only been defending, his presence felt overwhelmingly powerful, like an unstoppable force. Ning Zhuo felt the immense pressure building, as if a giant boulder weighed down on his heart.<br/>
<br/>
The spectators whispered among themselves.<br/>
<br/>
“Han Zhou has already gone all out from the start!”<br/>
“Even though I'm just watching, I can feel the respect Han Zhou has for Ning Zhuo! It's because of this respect that he’s fighting with all his strength, using his Suffering Body technique.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo’s mastery of spells is impressive, but even his gold element attack, known for its offensive power, has only caused superficial wounds. He’s in danger now!”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan, hidden in the crowd, heard the comments and silently agreed.<br/>
She grew more anxious, knowing that Han Zhou’s next assault would be even more violent and fierce.<br/>
<br/>
This was because the Suffering Body technique was similar to the Diamond Body technique, but while the latter increased defensive power, the former allowed its user to grow stronger with each hit they took.<br/>
<br/>
As long as Han Zhou could still fight, the more damage he sustained, the stronger he became.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo's metal element spells aren't enough to break the Suffering Body in one strike. What will he do now?" Lin Shanshan felt anxious and uneasy.<br/>
<br/>
She desperately wanted Ning Zhuo to win.<br/>
<br/>
Not only because she had deep feelings for Ning Zhuo, but also because she had put in a great deal of effort to help him train.<br/>
<br/>
The more effort she invested, the more she saw things from Ning Zhuo’s perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou stomped the ground, causing the tiles of the arena to crack beneath his feet. His speed surged, and he shot toward Ning Zhuo like a cannonball.<br/>
<br/>
The distance between them rapidly closed!<br/>
Ning Zhuo, racing against time, pushed both palms forward, unleashing a water element technique.<br/>
<br/>
Three waves of water surged into the air, crashing toward Han Zhou with tremendous force, attempting to push him back.<br/>
<br/>
The first wave slowed Han Zhou’s charge significantly, but by the second wave, his power had increased enough to hold his ground.<br/>
<br/>
By the third wave, he charged straight through!<br/>
<br/>
Using his body as a blade, Han Zhou sliced through the water, finally reaching Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, his eyes sharp. After days of special training, he was ready to test the results of his efforts in this real battle!<br/>
<br/>
The two clashed in close combat.<br/>
<br/>
At first, they were evenly matched, but soon, Han Zhou seized control of the rhythm.<br/>
<br/>
His fists and feet alternated in relentless attacks, like a fierce storm.</div>
