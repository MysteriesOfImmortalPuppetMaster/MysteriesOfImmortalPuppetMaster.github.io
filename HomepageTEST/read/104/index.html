<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 104: Renewing My Buddha

At the 'Spirit Growth' stage, Yuan Dasheng needs to increase his spirituality until it reaches ten full levels. Ten levels signify a qualitative change! Once achieved, spirituality will be self-restoring, continuously regenerating. Otherwise, spirituality will deplete as it is used, which is a significant disadvantage.

This is Yuan Dasheng's current situation. Originally possessing eight levels of spirituality, it has dropped to seven-point-nine and cannot self-recover. Unless one day, it reaches ten full levels and undergoes a qualitative change, it won't be able to restore itself!

After reading the jade slip, Ning Zhuo's first thought was, "Choosing Yuan Dasheng's corpse was indeed the correct decision."

"According to the information from the Lava Immortal Palace, selecting any corpse would only yield a mechanism of the Spirit Charm level. This is merely the first stage of the Dead Spirit period." "But by using Yuan Dasheng's corpse, I obtained the Golden Blood Battle Ape, which spans seven stages, reaching the Spirit Growth stage."

Previously, Ning Zhuo knew that the Golden Blood Battle Ape's quality was exceptional. Now, after reading "On Spirituality," he fully understands the extent of its superiority!

"So, how can I increase its spirituality?"

The "On Spirituality" tome did not contain this information.

"Perhaps it does, but it’s not available to me."

"As an outsider, gaining access to this tome is thanks to the alliance of the three families." Although "On Spirituality" did not detail the method, it recorded relevant history.

In the cultivation world, there once was a notorious demonic sect, infamous and dominating, known as the Spirit Burial Sect. This sect practiced a technique called the Three Lives Spirit Sacrifice Method.

The term 'three lives' does not refer to three lives but is derived from the idea of 'Three giving birth to all things.' It means sacrificing all things to gain spirituality. The Spirit Burial Sect used this technique to slaughter countless beings, obtaining vast amounts of spirituality to mass-produce spiritual treasures and expand their influence.

Seeing the threat posed by the Spirit Burial Sect, righteous sects, evil sects, and even other demonic factions united against it, ultimately eradicating this immense threat to the cultivation world.

"The Three Lives Spirit Sacrifice Method..."

Ning Zhuo recalled that among the rewards after passing the three trials of the Buddha gate was a technique named "Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra."

"This might be the secret technique to increase spirituality," Ning Zhuo thought.

His guess wasn't baseless. He had evidence.

Previously, when he was exploring the first trial of the Buddha gate, he received related information upon selecting a corpse from the coffin. The message stated, "Choose one, send it to the furnace for fire burial, and obtain a Spirit Charm mechanism."

Fire Burial

The clues of obtaining a spirit-charmed mechanism through fire burial directly relate to the "Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra."

"Next time I venture into the Lava Immortal Palace, I'll choose this reward," Ning Zhuo thought, feeling a strong intuition that this was the right choice.

However, entering the Lava Immortal Palace is not easy. Things are different now.

Ning Zhuo is currently under the protection of four Ning family cultivators, and these aren't the same four individuals all the time. They rotate shifts periodically.

If Ning Zhuo's spirit enters the palace, the chances of being discovered would greatly increase.

He also worried about what to do if he encountered the three geniuses from the allied families or Meng Chong in the palace.

He couldn't ascertain Meng Chong's situation.

The three geniuses had protective talismans from the Ning family. To enter the palace, they could simply remove these talismans. This was entirely unpredictable!

"There are two ways."

"One, I stay outside the palace and remotely control Yuan Dasheng, letting it delve deeper into the palace. Since it's my creation, it counts as part of me."

"Two, I join forces with Zheng Jian and others to explore the palace together. This depends on Zhou Zeshan's cultivation progress."

Previously, at the Tziyou Garden, Ning Zhuo and the others had agreed to explore the palace together once Zhou Zeshan reached the peak of the third layer.

Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and decided the second method was better.

Upon leaving the Zhou family's treasure hall, he inquired with a nearby cultivator, "Do you know how far along Zhou Zeshan is in his cultivation?"

"Currently, he's in the late stage of the third layer," the Zhou family cultivator replied.

Ning Zhuo frowned slightly.

The Zhou family cultivator, eager to defend his family's reputation, quickly added, "Ning Zhuo, you must understand that our Zhou Zeshan possesses a top-tier talent called 'Water Accumulation into Abyss.' As the saying goes, 'Accumulate soil into a mountain, wind and rain arise; accumulate water into an abyss, dragons are born.' This talent requires constant accumulation of water energy, eventually forming an abyssal force and displaying immense power."

"Therefore, in the early stages, Zhou Zeshan's mana accumulates slowly, needing more resources, time, and patience than others."

"But with loss comes gain! Zhou Zeshan will surely experience a significant leap in cultivation in the later stages!"

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, "So, how much longer do you estimate?"

The Zhou family cultivator smiled wryly, "Ning Zhuo, please don't put me on the spot. Why not ask Zhou Zeshan directly?"

Ning Zhuo went to find Zhou Zeshan and asked him personally.

Given Ning Zhuo's current status, reputation, and relationship with the three geniuses, he easily obtained a direct answer from Zhou Zeshan himself: "At most, I need seven more days."

"This timeframe is acceptable," Ning Zhuo thought.

If he forcibly relied solely on the Golden Blood Battle Ape, without participating himself, Yuan Dasheng would be severely damaged even if it managed to clear the challenges.

At present, Ning Zhuo's research on Yuan Dasheng's mechanical body is not thorough enough, and repairing Yuan Dasheng in the Lava Immortal Palace is also very difficult. Ning Zhuo's biggest concern is that using the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng at such high intensity will cause its spiritual energy to decline again.

Moreover, the decline is entirely predictable and will certainly be much more severe than when Yuan Dasheng fought Meng Chong!

However, upon returning home and resuming his daily cultivation, Ning Zhuo made a startling discovery. He found that the My Buddha Heart Demonic Seal in his spiritual sea had been activated again. Although it was only once, the timing coincided with his decision, made after deliberation at the Zhou family, to wait for Zhou Zeshan!

"A low fate energy can cause confusion and clouded judgment."

"But the My Buddha Heart Demonic Seal can suppress fate energy, making me clear-minded like a Buddha."

Ning Zhuo, reflecting on this, immediately realized that his decision to wait had been influenced by fate energy.

"In that case, doesn't it mean that the first option is the correct one?"

Ning Zhuo pondered deeply.

"According to 'Fate Energy Theory, Volume One,' Meng Chong and I are in a fierce struggle, and until one of us achieves a decisive victory, our fate energies will continue to clash."

"So, my fate energy is not as strong as that of the three-family alliance, which led to a moment of confusion?"

Ning Zhuo realized in shock.

"Yes, I am currently racing against time!"

"Why should I waste seven days waiting for Zhou Zeshan?"

Immediately, Ning Zhuo decided—to use the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng to break through the challenges!

He hid in the cultivation chamber within his bedroom and activated the Floating Cloud Handkerchief.

First, he took out the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng.

The transmission circle activated silently, successfully transporting Yuan Dasheng.

Then, Ning Zhuo activated the "Trial Disciple" seal, sending his soul into the palace along with the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng.

Only by doing this did he count as a new attempt at breaking through the challenges.

As before, he appeared in Room One.

Ning Zhuo did not even touch the first door; he immediately withdrew his soul and returned to his body.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng took his place, touched the first door, claimed the reward, and pushed the door open.

The next moment, Yuan Dasheng encountered Zhou Zhu, Zhou Zeshan!</div>
