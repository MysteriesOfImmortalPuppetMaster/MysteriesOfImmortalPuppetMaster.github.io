<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Wind Chime!"<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Zhu Xuanji was startled.<br/>
<br/>
Once the Fate Energy undergoes drastic changes, it will stir up winds and clouds, change the color of the heavens and earth, forming a grand Fate Energy that affects countless people and various powers. If the Fate Energy expands, it will lead to frequent wars and turbulent times.<br/>
<br/>
This Wind Chime was bestowed by the monarch, specifically used to detect drastic changes in Fate Energy and its influence.<br/>
<br/>
"The Wind Chime has sounded. Is it a natural surge of Fate Energy, or is someone using a technique?" Zhu Xuanji instinctively looked up towards the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
He had long known about Meng Kui's divine ability, the Mountain Watching Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's unreasonable behavior would not make Zhu Xuanji back down. He had many methods to punish such offenders.<br/>
<br/>
But now, he didn't want to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Before this trip, the monarch had specifically instructed him to be wary of changes in Fate Energy and to be cautious of Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji kept this in mind, knowing that he had no means to suppress the Fate Energy. Now that the Wind Chime had sounded, if he continued to be involved in this situation, he would inevitably be affected. Even if he stayed home with doors locked, the changes in Fate Energy would still bring disaster to him!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji himself had no means to interfere with Fate Energy. The only plan now was to withdraw early. Being outside the situation, he wouldn't be affected.<br/>
<br/>
"Today, I'll let you off for now. I will come for you." Zhu Xuanji released his spiritual power, pushing Sun Lingtong away.<br/>
<br/>
He disappeared from the spot, swiftly heading towards the city.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't until he was several hundred miles away from Fire Persimmon Mountain that the Wind Chime stopped its ominous ringing.<br/>
<br/>
"Such a small range of Fate Energy fluctuations, with such drastic changes in Fate Energy, makes Meng Kui even more suspicious. If the Fate Energy field does not expand later, it is most likely due to Meng Kui's Mountain Watching Technique!" Zhu Xuanji's face was gloomy, and he immediately decided to rely on the Wind Chime's detection range for verification.<br/>
<br/>
As Zhu Xuanji left, Sun Lingtong stood up.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was incredulous, thinking to himself, "Did I just scare Zhu Xuanji away so easily?"<br/>
<br/>
On the surface, he spat and wiped his face, seeing the stunned street vendors, he shouted, "Did you see that? Learn from it!" He then looked at his subordinates and urgently asked, "Did you record it?" The subordinate nodded, "It's all in the Jade Slip."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong laughed heartily three times, "Excellent! This is my greatest achievement in life. Spread the word, say that I, Sun Lingtong, with Foundation Establishment cultivation, forced Golden Core Zhu Xuanji to retreat! Hahaha, I'm going to be famous, I'm going to be famous! If anyone doubts, just throw the Jade Slip in their face."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, quickly make dozens, no, hundreds of copies of the Jade Slip, and distribute them for safekeeping to prevent confiscation!"<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Lingtong's methods are shrewd. He wants to establish his reputation first and then use it to pressure Zhu Xuanji, preparing for the future when Zhu Xuanji comes back for him.<br/>
<br/>
As Zhu Xuanji left the city, Ning Zhuo entered.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike when he left the city, Ning Zhuo's team now included Yuan Er.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er and Ning Pi sat in a carriage, their eyes occasionally glancing at the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng sitting beside Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Their conversation came to an end.<br/>
<br/>
"So that's how it is." Ning Zhuo sighed lightly.<br/>
<br/>
He understood the whole story.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that in a few days, it would be Yuan Yi's death anniversary, and as his son, Yuan Er had to visit his grave.<br/>
<br/>
The burial site had over a dozen locations, but the real grave was the one where Ai Dasheng lost control, driven by emotions, and rushed to that desolate wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
The other fake graves were deliberately set up by Ai Yi. On one hand, it was to prevent others from robbing the grave out of revenge; on the other hand, it served as bait to lure hidden enemies.<br/>
<br/>
After all, in the cultivation world, there are many methods to use corpses to curse others.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er originally didn't want to leave the Monkey Head Gang's base, but this was a ritual for his ancestor, the founder of the Monkey Head Gang, so he had to act.<br/>
<br/>
The elders of the gang were also urging him to do it. If he didn't, he would inevitably be labeled as cowardly and unfilial by those with ill intentions. This would be a fatal blow to Yuan Er's already miserable reputation!<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er had no choice but to comply. He originally wanted to contact Ning Pi to expedite the creation of Ai Dasheng's mechanical construct. However, the messengers he sent out never returned.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er did everything he could to hide his movements, deliberately setting out a few days early to secretly perform the ritual.<br/>
<br/>
Unexpectedly, he encountered an ambush on the way, and all his followers were killed, leaving him alone.<br/>
<br/>
Instinctively, he fled to the burial site he knew, and miraculously, he encountered the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
After that, Ai Dasheng, under Ning Zhuo's orders, went to rescue him.<br/>
<br/>
"Mr. Ning, this must be the Monkey Uncle mechanism you made for me, right? It must be!" Yuan Er couldn't contain his excitement, his eyes fixed on Yuan Dasheng, full of eagerness and longing.<br/>
<br/>
"It's really strong, its combat power far exceeds the peak of Foundation Establishment."<br/>
<br/>
"Mr. Ning, you are a man of your word, and I admire you greatly!" Yuan Er praised endlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Pi smiled slightly, patting the arm of the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng, "This is just the initial version, freshly made. My trip outside the city was mainly to find wild beasts to test the capabilities of the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng through actual combat."<br/>
<br/>
"Tree Martial Ape Dasheng," Yuan Er savored the name, his eyes shining, giving a thumbs up, "Mr. Ning, your expertise in Mechanism Technique is profound, and your naming skills are also extraordinary. It's very fitting, extremely fitting."<br/>
<br/>
"Can we hand it over now?" Ning Zhuo shook his head, "No rush, no rush."<br/>
<br/>
"Through battles with beasts and cultivators, I found many areas that need improvement in the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng."<br/>
<br/>
"Once I finish the improvements, I will hand it over to you."<br/>
<br/>
"My creations are always top-notch. I won't hastily hand over a crude initial version."<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er's eyes widened, anxious, "But, Mr. Ning!"<br/>
<br/>
"You see, I'm in great danger now, very dangerous."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, if I hadn't been lucky enough to run into you, I would have died, died at the hands of those despicable, insidious, ruthless, and vicious assassins!"<br/>
<br/>
"The key is, you let a few assassins go. I, I..." At this point, Yuan Er was so agitated that he stuttered and couldn't speak.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Pi sighed, spreading his hands, giving a perfect explanation, "I couldn't see the specific scene at that time. I'm only at the Qi Refining Stage, not the Foundation Establishment Stage, I don't have Divine Sense."<br/>
<br/>
"The Tree Martial Ape Dasheng is controlled by my staff head. The staff head contains my Divine Thought, and I set it to engage in unlimited combat with any hostile targets."<br/>
<br/>
"So, when some assassins lost their killing intent and fled in panic, the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng wasn't triggered and didn't pursue them."<br/>
<br/>
"If I had been there, I would have eradicated all evil!"<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er blinked repeatedly, his mouth dry, "I know about the staff head."<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest, Mr. Ning, ever since you promised to make me a Foundation Establishment-level mechanical battle puppet, I've been scouring the gang's library, studying related knowledge day and night, and practicing various Mechanism Techniques tirelessly."<br/>
<br/>
"If you hand over the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng to me now, I will definitely make good use of it! I..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Pi's face darkened, his tone displeased, "Enough, Gang Leader Yuan Er, you don't need to persuade me anymore."<br/>
<br/>
"This is my principle. I won't hand over the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng until I've finished the improvements."<br/>
<br/>
"You must understand, a shoddy product would tarnish my reputation."<br/>
<br/>
"I plan to pursue the path of Mechanism Technique in the future, and my reputation must be protected from the start!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Pi spoke righteously, completely forgetting about the shoddy Mechanical Explosive Monkey he had made before.<br/>
<br/>
If Chen Cha heard this, he would surely be gratified, thinking that Ning Zhuo had found his way back and that a prodigal son returning was indeed a fortunate thing.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er's breathing was heavy, his mouth slightly open, with many words he wanted to say, but under Ning Zhuo's stern expression, he ultimately didn't say them.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo was only at the Qi Refining Stage, his status was now different.<br/>
<br/>
The Mechanism Carriage he rode in, and the guards accompanying it, all made Yuan Er feel the difference in their statuses.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Pi continued to reassure him, "Gang Leader Yuan Er, don't be too nervous, it's fine."<br/>
<br/>
"Now that you're in the city, I'll take you directly to the gang's base later."<br/>
<br/>
"You've already performed the ritual for your father, I can testify for you."<br/>
<br/>
"You can use my connection to intimidate the traitors in the gang. I believe they won't be so reckless as to let assassins into the gang's base."<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er's face was pale, "Yes, they shouldn't be that impulsive."<br/>
<br/>
"But the enemies left behind by my father and Uncle Dasheng when they rose to power are different!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately retorted, "They can't get into the gang's base either. If they could, they would have succeeded in assassinating you long ago, wouldn't they?"<br/>
<br/>
"After all, in the past, Yuan Dasheng wasn't always guarding you, was he?"<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er's forehead was covered in a fine layer of sweat, "This, it seems like that... it should be like that."<br/>
<br/>
"If Mr. Ning could hand it over now, that would be best."<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er's face was full of sorrow, his tone pleading.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo mercilessly shook his head, refusing again.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, he followed the agreement and took Yuan Er directly back to the Monkey Head Gang's base, attracting the attention of countless gang members.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er was somewhat reluctant to get off the carriage.<br/>
<br/>
Under Ning Zhuo's urging, he reluctantly glanced at the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng one last time before getting off the carriage.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go back." Ning Zhuo waved his hand, and the team set off again.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Yuan Er standing in place, watching the Mechanism Carriage disappear from sight, he finally moved his leaden feet.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the empty inner room, his longing for Ai Dasheng intensified to the extreme, causing him to silently shed two lines of tears.<br/>
<br/>

尽真人·Author's Note: Apologies. I asked Master Dragonfly and confirmed it was an issue with the automated review system. Speechless... This is the third chapter today, specially to make up for it. Although it's not my intention, it has indeed caused inconvenience to everyone! I sincerely apologize.<br/>
<br/>
Monk Doleey (Editor): Apologies as well fellow Daoists, I didn't go back to check if a new chapter was updated and only saw it this morning. Rather than drop the additional 2 chapters in the morning, I decided to hold them back and drop all 4 together. Happy reading!</div>
