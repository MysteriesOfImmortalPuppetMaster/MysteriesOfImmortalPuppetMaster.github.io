Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Main Hall.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah!" The dragon turtle fire spirit suddenly screamed, waking up from a nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
Instinctively, it reached out to touch its head.<br/>
<br/>
"Still here!"<br/>
<br/>
It relaxed, realizing it hadn’t been destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
It survived!<br/>
<br/>
Beings like spirits inherently have no fatal weaknesses.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, being decapitated or having limbs severed is almost the same.<br/>
<br/>
The difference lies in the amount of spiritual essence remaining.<br/>
<br/>
If too much spiritual essence is lost, reaching a limit, the remaining essence will collapse and dissipate unless supplemented externally during the countdown to its demise.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the dragon turtle fire spirit’s body had shrunk by a third, leaving only about sixty to seventy percent of its original form.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, its entire body glowed with firelight, much brighter than before, ironically proving its weakness.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, it had been profound and restrained, giving a sense of solidity and weight.<br/>
<br/>
Now, although its body shone brightly, it appeared light and ethereal.<br/>
<br/>
At this time, a voice called out like distant smoke, drifting into the heart of the dragon turtle fire spirit.<br/>
<br/>
"Dragon turtle fire spirit of the Immortal Palace, my heart’s desire, only you can ignite." "The fierce flames of the fire dragon, essence of heaven and earth, burn all things, transforming into spiritual light." "With a sincere heart and solemn thoughts, I call upon you. Respond, respond..." "Whatever you seek, we can discuss. I am a member of the Meng family, please heed my call, respond to my voice."<br/>
<br/>
These were the cultivators of the Meng family, persistently trying to contact the dragon turtle fire spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s voice also quietly came through, much more straightforward: "Dragon turtle fire spirit, dragon turtle fire spirit, dragon turtle fire spirit..."<br/>
<br/>
"Ah!" The dragon turtle fire spirit shouted, shaking its head violently, "So annoying! So annoying!" It retreated its dragon head into its turtle shell on the throne’s armrest.<br/>
<br/>
It roared in its heart.<br/>
<br/>
"What Meng family, it doesn’t care. It only cares about Meng Chong!" "What Ning Zhuo, still a young master? Bah!"<br/>
<br/>
"The Historical Records Pavilion was destroyed because of me. What use are you?" "You only know how to act!"<br/>
<br/>
"Once Zhu Xuanji targeted you, you became dispirited, useless!" "I’ve seen through it, you all—are useless!" "It still has to be me. I have to rely on myself!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn’t summon the dragon turtle fire spirit.<br/>
<br/>
He followed closely behind Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan, unaccustomed to being followed so closely, stopped and turned to look at him: "Hey kid, why are you sticking so close to me?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cupped his hands, his face pale: "Ancestor, ancestor, I’m scared."<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that after he confessed his crimes to the Golden Core cultivators, he was harshly reprimanded by Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
But it was just a reprimand.<br/>
<br/>
After all, Zhu Xuanji had forgiven and accepted Ning Zhuo, allowing him to atone for his crimes.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core cultivators of the three families couldn’t say much.<br/>
<br/>
The only exception was Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
According to the rules of the righteous path, Ning Jiufan, as the head of the Ning family, naturally had the authority to deal with Ning Zhuo, a member of the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Jiufan only reprimanded him, not even hitting him, and although his tone was extremely severe, any slightly experienced righteous cultivator could hear the protective intent in Ning Jiufan’s words.<br/>
<br/>
After Zhu Xuanji left, the Golden Core cultivators discussed for a while and decided to act separately.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo followed closely behind Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, "Ancestor, I’m in great danger."<br/>
<br/>
"The death of Ning Xiaohui is right before us. She was a main branch of the family, secretly working for Lord Zhu Xuanji, and under the protection of many Golden Core cultivators..." "With such protection, she still perished!" "This Void Sect is too terrifying, too sinister."<br/>
<br/>
"Now that I’ve turned to the light, they’ve surely noticed. I don’t want to die, I beg you to have mercy, save me, save me!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan snorted coldly: "You don’t understand the situation at that time."<br/>
<br/>
"The Historical Records Pavilion was the primary target, the demon beasts surged like a tide, and defense was difficult in haste." "But if not for the bombardment of the Five Elements Tower, we would have succeeded!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo spread his hands: "The Historical Records Pavilion is in ruins, my small body can’t withstand it."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan, angered, curled his fingers and knocked on Ning Zhuo’s big head.<br/>
<br/>
"Ouch." Ning Zhuo clutched his head, crying out in pain.<br/>
<br/>
"When did our Ning family produce such a cowardly person? Where is the backbone of our northern family?" Ning Jiufan scolded, hating iron for not becoming steel.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked at Ning Jiufan pitifully: "Ancestor, look at what you’re saying! If I weren’t cowardly, I might have been killed by the Void Sect’s evil cultivators long ago." "As for the northern backbone, what is that? When I was born, our Ning family had already migrated to the Southern Bean Kingdom. Wasn’t our family driven out of the Northern Wind Kingdom?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan immediately blew his beard and glared, continuously knocking on Ning Zhuo’s big head, muttering: "We voluntarily withdrew, voluntarily withdrew!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo retreated, avoiding Ning Jiufan’s knocks: "Ancestor, ancestor, stop knocking, if you keep knocking, I’ll become stupid."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan chuckled coldly: "You’re not stupid? You’re too cunning, hiding your crimes, and with a slight trick from Zhu Xuanji, you were so scared you surrendered." "You should become a bit stupid, it would do you good."<br/>
<br/>
"You’re called Ning Zhuo, where is your simplicity?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo exclaimed, as if realizing something: "Ancestor, are you saying that Zhu Xuanji was tricking me? He only suspected me, without any evidence?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan sneered: "What do you think? Did you see him produce any evidence?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo widened his eyes, with an incredulous expression, and whispered: "Then, this Lord Zhu is too cunning!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan snorted again.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo blinked repeatedly, looking at Ning Jiufan, rubbing his hands: "Actually, I’m mainly worried that if I’m exposed, it’s fine, but I’m most afraid of bringing shame to the Ning family, causing trouble for you, ancestor."<br/>
<br/>
"Heh." Ning Jiufan’s mouth twitched.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn’t help but be amused by Ning Zhuo’s shamelessness.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo colluding with the Void Sect’s evil cultivators was actually nothing in Ning Jiufan’s mind.<br/>
<br/>
You must know, a common trick of the righteous path is to hire demonic cultivators as black gloves.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, they even play the role of demonic cultivators themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s situation was just that he was young and weak, secretly controlled by demonic cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Even if he participated in part of the plot to bomb the Immortal Palace, isn’t the Lava Immortal Palace still standing?<br/>
<br/>
No big deal!<br/>
<br/>
Now that Ning Zhuo has been exposed and freed from the Void Sect’s control, it’s a great thing.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo surrendering to Zhu Xuanji was unexpected for Ning Jiufan, indeed putting him in a passive position.<br/>
<br/>
But what can be said, one’s own child still needs to be protected.<br/>
<br/>
Even if they make mistakes, who doesn’t make mistakes when they’re young?<br/>
<br/>
Close the door and educate them, educate them well, and when the door opens, Ning Zhuo is still a member of the Ning family, the future pillar of the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui is already dead, and now the only genius in the Qi Refining Stage left in the Ning family is Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo also dies or joins the evil sect, then the Ning family will have a gap in this generation.<br/>
<br/>
This is unfavorable for the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Ning Xiaohui’s death, Ning Jiufan is deeply pained.<br/>
<br/>
Ice Jade Hand...<br/>
<br/>
This pain further prompts Ning Jiufan to protect Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji returned earlier than everyone expected.<br/>
<br/>
He gathered the Golden Core cultivators together again.<br/>
<br/>
"I have reached an alliance with City Lord Meng, and I am here to inform you of this good news." Saying this, Zhu Xuanji couldn’t help but fix his gaze on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
All present were Golden Core cultivators, making the Qi Refining Stage Ning Zhuo seem out of place.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Zhu Xuanji looking at him, Ning Zhuo quickly bowed and saluted: "Greetings, Lord Zhu!" His expression was respectful, and his etiquette was impeccable.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan spoke: "Now, Ning Zhuo has become the only genius among the younger generation of our Ning family. During this period, let him stay by Ning Jiufan’s side." "He has committed such a grave mistake, and I will enforce family law on him, punishing him severely!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly, allowing Ning Zhuo to remain present.<br/>
<br/>
The divine constable sighed inwardly.<br/>
<br/>
From Ning Jiufan<br/>
<br/>
’s response, he heard the dissatisfaction of this Ning family Golden Core.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui is dead.<br/>
<br/>
She was working for Zhu Xuanji, to some extent used as bait.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan’s pain led him to protect Ning Zhuo, which was understandable.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Zhu Xuanji became more convinced that not searching Ning Zhuo’s soul was the right decision!<br/>
<br/>
If he had searched the soul, causing Ning Zhuo, this genius, to be ruined, wouldn’t Ning Jiufan have exploded in anger?<br/>
<br/>
"The Ning family, after all, is different from the Zhou and Zheng families."<br/>
<br/>
"They wandered from the Northern Wind Kingdom. It is said that the Ning family was dissatisfied with the Northern Wind’s rigid governance and left on their own, decisively cutting off benefits and connections. Such a fierce nature cannot be easily manipulated!"<br/>
<br/>
With a flash of thought, Zhu Xuanji formally announced that the two sides would cooperate closely, and any Immortal Palace positions obtained by any family would be retained!<br/>
<br/>
This news brought joy to the three families’ Golden Core cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was secretly surprised.<br/>
<br/>
After reporting Sun Lingtong, Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui would definitely join forces.<br/>
<br/>
This was something Ning Zhuo could deduce.<br/>
<br/>
He didn’t expect Zhu and Meng to cooperate to this extent!<br/>
<br/>
"No!" Suddenly, Ning Zhuo understood, "This wasn’t Zhu Xuanji’s initiative." "He has already united the three families, there’s no need to offer future chips to win them over." "If it’s not him, then it’s Meng Kui." "Why would Meng Kui propose such a thing, to win over the three families?" "Interesting!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes flashed with brilliance: "It’s possible that among the three families’ Golden Core cultivators present, someone has already secretly contacted Meng Kui." "Then, who could it be?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo first thought of the Zheng family.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Zhu Xuanji united the three families, forming a tight alliance, which was a brilliant move.<br/>
<br/>
But afterwards, the Demonic Dao Scripture scheme set by Ning Zhuo led to a Golden Core conflict, causing the Zheng family to kill a Great Purity Palace disciple, creating a rift between Zhu Xuanji and the Zheng family.<br/>
<br/>
"The Zheng family is thus facing immense pressure from the Great Purity Palace. And the royal family has yet to make a statement." "The Zheng family might desperately seek aid due to this pressure. Aligning with the Meng family is reasonable." "Besides, the Zhou family is also a possibility."<br/>
<br/>
Previously, if the Meng family acquired the Lava Immortal Palace, the Zhou family would suffer the greatest loss.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the Zhou family was the most steadfast in opposing Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
But what if Meng Kui took the initiative to compromise, privately expressing to the Zhou family a willingness to coexist?<br/>
<br/>
Previously, it was impossible because Meng Kui looked down on the Zhou family, a mere Golden Core-level force.<br/>
<br/>
But once the three families united, gathering around Zhu Xuanji, posing a threat to Meng Kui, they gained the value of being divided and won over.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji used the three families, and the three families simultaneously used him to enhance their own value.<br/>
<br/>
The art of alliance and maneuvering, this is the subtlety of the righteous path’s game.</div>
