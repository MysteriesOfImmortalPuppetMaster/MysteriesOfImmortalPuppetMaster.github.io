<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 326: Ning Zhuo, Let Go of Your Obsession

Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and Meng Yaoyin entered the main hall together.

The others remained rooted in place, unable to move.

Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu were already dead.

Meng Chong had made it to the throne.

It was clear that a life-and-death battle had taken place before.

Ning Ze and Ning Xiaoren were lagging behind. They had fled in terror after witnessing Meng Yaoyin’s demonic power.

Like statues, they stood frozen in place.

Meng Chong was about to sit on the throne.

But even that small distance was like an impassable chasm before him.

Divine Ability—Fate Thread!

As Ning Zhuo recovered some strength, he activated this divine ability with full force.

Who among those present hadn’t been marked by his Fate Thread?

Even Meng Chong!

He had been marked back when Ning Zhuo entered the Lava Immortal Palace and fought the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Da Sheng.

Because of this, Ning Zhuo had been able to track Meng Chong's movements during critical moments and pursue him even after a large number of lower-level cultivators had stormed in.

Because of this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit understood deeply that Meng Chong would never be able to defeat Ning Zhuo.

The Fate Thread could even be used to fight those above one’s level. With his Foundation Establishment cultivation, Ning Zhuo could theoretically threaten Jindan cultivators, let alone deal with Meng Chong.

"Spare me, Ning Zhuo! I was wrong! I swear, I will never go against you again!" Ning Xiaoren, frozen in place, pleaded in panic.

"Ning Zhuo! I’m your uncle! If you kill me, won’t you fear public condemnation?" Ning Ze’s eyes widened, terror written all over his face.

Ning Zhuo ignored them, his eyes cold.

He grabbed Meng Chong by the neck and pulled out his soul.

Meng Yaoyin’s face was filled with disgust as she flicked her finger.

Two crisp explosions followed, one after the other.

Ning Xiaoren and Ning Ze’s heads exploded like watermelons hitting the ground.

Their headless bodies collapsed to the ground.

Meng Chong stared in horror.

He could only watch as Ning Zhuo and the others approached.

The envoy of the underworld, Qi Bai, took the lead, arriving behind Meng Chong first.

He captured Meng Chong’s soul, compressing it into a ball and holding it in his palm.

Then he retreated, making way for Ning Zhuo.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit remained hidden, cautiously controlling the Ten Thousand Mile Wandering Dragon from afar, still evading Zhu Zhen’s pursuit.

Everything that happened in the main hall was under its observation.

But what could it do?

Despair was pulling it into the abyss.

Boom.

A dull sound echoed, and everyone turned to look.

Zhu Xuanji, surrounded by golden light, had suppressed his injuries and rushed back into the hall.

Meng Yaoyin, scythe in hand, stepped forward to meet him.

The fierce battle resumed in an instant!

Taking advantage of the distraction, Ning Zhuo reached the throne.

His gaze swept over Meng Chong’s body, which then slumped sideways like a statue.

Ning Zhuo stepped over the body and faced the throne, slowly sitting down.

This simple action was monumental in its significance!

"The third round of the palace trials is over! The new palace master—Ning Zhuo!" A voice declared, "All others are disqualified."

Thus, the competition for the position of the Lava Immortal Palace Master came to an end.

The news spread, and Zhu Xuanji froze. "So Ning Zhuo was the true candidate for entry all along!"

At the doors of the secret pavilion, the Jindan cultivators, debating whether to storm the main hall, hesitated.

"Sigh, Zhu Xuanji lost as well."

"Who would have thought that the Lava Immortal Palace would fall into the hands of the Kongmen Sect!"

"Their plans ran deep. The entire Zheng family was tricked, and that Night Rain Demon Weapon is terrifying!"

The cultivators lost their will to fight.

The once proud Book Spirit, now reduced to just his upper body, looked toward the door in despair.

He had once faced such a door, only the requirement then had been to piece together the correct version of the Bloodstained Demonic Meridian Skill.

"I was just one step away from escaping the Secret Pavilion!"

"Bloodstained Demonic Meridian Skill! Why didn’t I obtain it?!" The Book Spirit was filled with regret.

"Little Zhuo, you did it. You’ve become the palace master!" Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo, sitting on the throne, overwhelmed with joy and relief, nearly moved to tears.

"Little Zhuo, it hasn’t been easy for you to get here," Sun Lingtong sighed.

But Ning Zhuo shook his head. "No, I haven’t succeeded yet."

He leaned back in the throne, his fingers caressing the armrests, lost in thought. He imagined the time when his mother, as an overseer, had sat in this same seat, taking partial control of the palace master’s duties. What was it like then? How did it feel?

The Lava Immortal Palace Overview had described it many times.

Sitting on the throne, Meng Yaoyin had been able to control many mechanical structures, including the medical hall and the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest.

At this moment, Ning Zhuo, now the true palace master, could feel all the mechanical structures of the Lava Immortal Palace.

But it was this deep connection that made him painfully aware of the palace's dire state. Nearly all the crucial structures were gone, leaving only the inner hall.

The outer and inner sections of the Lava Immortal Palace had been swallowed by the beast tide, with only the main hall still standing, where cultivators were holding onto the last line of defense, numb with despair.

Of the palace’s full strength, at least seventy percent had been lost!

"The damage is catastrophic!"

"Rather than repair, it would be better to build a new palace from scratch."

Restoring the palace would be a bottomless pit!

Fate had played a cruel trick on him.

After fourteen years of longing, fourteen years of scheming, all he had won was a pile of mechanical ruins.

Ning Zhuo let out a soft chuckle and activated his technique.

Funeral Pyre Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra!

Flames erupted, quickly engulfing the throne in an intense blaze.

Sun Lingtong was alarmed. "Little Zhuo, what are you doing?"

Ning Zhuo stood, continuing to feed the fire with his technique, dragging Meng Chong’s body away from the throne.

He stared at the burning throne and explained to Sun Lingtong, "The Lava Immortal Palace is nearly destroyed. Cremating the throne is my true goal."

Sun Lingtong was puzzled. He didn’t know that Meng Yaoyin had spent countless years sitting on that throne, pouring her heart and soul into it.

Just as Ning Xiaohui’s spirituality had grown from refining the Flowing Cloud Glyph, burning the throne would increase Meng Yaoyin’s spiritual energy!

"Indeed." Ning Zhuo was pleased to see the throne burning, as traces of spirituality, like fireflies, floated out of the blaze.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could no longer stay hidden!

It revealed its dragon-turtle form. "Ning Zhuo, stop! Please, stop!"

"If you destroy the throne, your mother’s recovery will only be temporary."

"Without the throne, the Lava Immortal Palace will fall to the beast tide, and the entire city will be slaughtered. You will be responsible for countless deaths!"

"The weight of those sins will crush you, hindering your cultivation. You will be cursed with misfortune for life, despised by heaven and earth. You won’t be able to take a single step forward!"

"You’ve already felt the Karmic Fire burn your body! Imagine that pain multiplied by ten thousand. Can you handle it?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit desperately tried to reason with him.

It knew that if the Lava Immortal Palace fell and countless lives were lost, it too would share the blame!

"I don’t care! As long as my mother gains more spirituality…" Ning Zhuo’s face was cold and resolute.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit screamed in frustration, flames bursting from its body.

Sun Lingtong rushed to Ning Zhuo’s side, standing guard and watching the fire spirit warily.

Zhu Xuanji was filled with rage, for the first time harboring a killing intent toward Ning Zhuo.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit pleaded, but Ning Zhuo remained unmoved.

"Ning Zhuo!" it roared like thunder, "Don’t take this step! It will ruin your life!"

"Causing the massacre of an entire city will make you a wanted criminal across the kingdom. The righteous cultivators will unite to hunt you down."

It threw itself toward Ning Zhuo, even allowing the mechanical scythe to cleave into its left arm, nearly severing it, as it grabbed hold of the scythe.

Meng Yaoyin's strength was clearly no match for Zhu Xuanji’s, and she struggled to break free.

Zhu Xuanji let out a long cry.

Divine Ability—Golden Soldiers Retreat!

Golden energy coated the mechanical scythe, freezing its surface in solid gold, sealing it.

Before the seal could fully take hold, Zhu Xuanji let go of the scythe, breaking free and lunging toward Ning Zhuo.

The underworld envoy Qi Bai, Rudi Butterfly Maiden, and the Ice Crystal Weather Sphere moved to intercept him.

But Zhu Xuanji feigned an attack and rushed toward the throne, grabbing a treasure mirror.

Meng Yaoyin swiftly transformed the scythe back into a snake, sending it after Zhu Xuanji.

The mirror he held was none other than the Golden Phoenix Mirror!

This mirror, crafted by the Lava Immortal Palace, was perfect for controlling its mechanical creations.

Meng Yaoyin, being a mechanical creation herself, was particularly vulnerable to the Golden Phoenix Mirror.

Sure enough, when Zhu Xuanji directed the mirror at her, Meng Yaoyin’s movements slowed, her actions becoming stiff.

But the mirror had no such effect on the Night Rain Demon Weapon.

"Where are Chi Dun and Zhou Nongying?!" Zhu Xuanji, entangled by the mechanical snake, was unable to stop Ning Zhuo and grew increasingly desperate.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit suddenly cried out, "Ning Zhuo, do you know what the Three Patriarchs said when they built the palace to guard Fire Persimmon Mountain?"

"‘The Golden Furnace’s red flame refines souls, the Immortal Palace’s burial redeems the people.’"

"I urge the Southern Emperor to abandon his obsession, for old feelings are as fleeting as smoke."

"All beings are burdened by suffering and desire, yet they act as masters of their puppet bodies."

"My Buddha preaches compassion, for only great love leads to the true path."

"I understand now! I’ve figured it out!"

"It’s not just a message for the Southern Emperor of the past, it’s meant for you!"

"Let go, let go of your obsession!"

"For fourteen years, hasn’t this burden made your life miserable?"

"Let go! Just let go!"

"For fourteen years, the Lava Immortal Palace has been the greatest string pulling your life!"

"Let go of your obsession, let go of your mental barriers. You must learn compassion, for compassion is great love!"</div>
