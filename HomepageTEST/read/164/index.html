<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Family War Hall.<br/>
<br/>
Branch member Ning Xiangqian wore an angry expression: "Two Elders, I refuse to accept this! Dismissing me from my position as a steward of the War Hall without any reason goes against the family rules!"<br/>
<br/>
The two Elders smiled slightly, and one of them said, "Ning Xiangqian, calm down. How could the family arbitrarily strip you of your steward position?"<br/>
<br/>
"According to family rules, the steward of the War Hall must be chosen based on combat strength. To ensure the quality of personnel, the steward positions have always been limited and follow an elimination strategy. If a newcomer wants to take on the role, they must challenge the current holder and win the position through real combat strength."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian nodded: "Of course, I know that. But no one has challenged me."<br/>
<br/>
"I haven't even had a single fight, yet my steward position was taken away. It seems the main branch holds a grudge against me for helping Ning Zhuo yesterday." The Elder smiled faintly: "Ning Xiangqian, you misunderstand us. We are actually thinking of your well-being, worried that you might get injured in a fight. Healing injuries takes too much time."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian laughed coldly: "I haven't even fought, and you assume I would lose. This is simply outrageous. Who exactly has their eyes on my steward position? I must fight to be satisfied."<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, I will not yield and will take this matter to the ancestral shrine!" Hearing the mention of the ancestral shrine, the faces of the two Elders darkened.<br/>
<br/>
One of them said coldly: "For such a trivial matter, you want to disturb the peace of the ancestral shrine? As a descendant, you disregard the tranquility of your ancestors, which is truly unfilial!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiangqian, you judge others by your own petty standards. Very well, let me tell you who your opponent is." Saying this, the Elder signaled to a subordinate nearby.<br/>
<br/>
The subordinate retreated and soon brought back a person.<br/>
<br/>
This person was quite slender, with a handsome face, flowing white hair, and a pair of white eyebrows, looking like a young man.<br/>
<br/>
But upon seeing this person, Ning Xiangqian's expression changed dramatically, and he exclaimed: "Ning Qingqiao?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Qingqiao raised his eyebrows and sneered at Ning Xiangqian: "You should thank the two Elders; this is all for your own good. Step down obediently and save everyone some time."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian clenched his fists, his face showing anger.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Qingqiao was at the Foundation Establishment stage, possessing the innate talent of Silent Frost.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Xiaohui was the only prominent Qi Refining cultivator in the Ning family, then Ning Qingqiao was one of the geniuses among the Foundation Establishment cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian gritted his teeth and said: "Fine, fine, fine, the main branch uses a genius to squeeze me out of my steward position. Truly a grand gesture!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Qingqiao sneered: "Naive! You helped Ning Zhuo yesterday and made the loudest noise, so you should have expected this. Do you think this is a game?"<br/>
<br/>
"Be quick about it and get lost!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian laughed loudly, his anger clouding his judgment: "Get lost? Impossible!"<br/>
<br/>
"Come, come, come, I want to fight you."<br/>
<br/>
"I want to see what qualifications you, a long-famous genius, have to be so arrogant!"<br/>
<br/>
The battle was decided from the start.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Qingqiao held an absolute advantage, suppressing Ning Xiangqian throughout.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't kill him," the Elder, watching from the side, couldn't help but remind when he saw Ning Xiangqian covered in blood.<br/>
<br/>
"How boring," Ning Qingqiao stopped in time, knocking Ning Xiangqian to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Qingqiao walked over to Ning Xiangqian and stepped on his head: "How does it feel now? This is really for your own good, but you don't appreciate it. You refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit."<br/>
<br/>
"Bah!" Ning Xiangqian, unable to struggle, spat a mouthful of blood at Ning Qingqiao.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Qingqiao's eyes flashed with cold light, and he exerted a little force with his foot, knocking Ning Xiangqian unconscious.<br/>
<br/>
"Someone, take this branch trash away!" Almost simultaneously, in the Talisman Hall.<br/>
<br/>
An Elder pointed at a poor-quality talisman and said to Ning Xiangguo: "This is your responsibility. You better have a perfect explanation, or else..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangguo smiled slightly: "Explanation? I don't need to explain."<br/>
<br/>
He took out a letter from his bosom and handed it to the Elder: "I resign from the steward position of the Talisman Hall."<br/>
<br/>
The Elder was stunned, then his expression softened, and he sighed deeply: "Xiangguo, who told you to be from the branch? You spoke out yesterday to help Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, I feel sorry for you."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo received an extremely generous reward, but you lost the steward position you fought for nearly ten years to obtain."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangguo shook his head: "If I had to do it again, even knowing the outcome, I would still do the same. Farewell."<br/>
<br/>
With that, he turned and left without any hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
Watching Ning Xiangguo's departing figure, the Elder's face turned extremely ugly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian, Ning Xiangguo... it wasn't just the two of them; many stewards were approached by the main branch and dismissed for various reasons.<br/>
<br/>
The news spread throughout the family.<br/>
<br/>
The branch members, who were still elated by yesterday's victory at the ancestral shrine, felt like they had been hit with a heavy blow, their newly gathered morale scattering again.<br/>
<br/>
With scattered hearts, people began to talk.<br/>
<br/>
"I told you not to go, not to go, and now look! The steward position is lost."<br/>
<br/>
"The main branch is too much! All the stewards dismissed and driven away today are from our branch, clearly a retaliation for yesterday's events."<br/>
<br/>
"The key is that they have valid reasons, acting according to family rules, leaving us unable to refute."<br/>
<br/>
"As Elder Ning Houjun often says, our branch lacks an Elder. If we had an Elder, such things wouldn't happen!"<br/>
<br/>
The dismissed stewards could have relied on the branch Elders, but now they were reduced to ordinary family members.<br/>
<br/>
Some dismissed branch members sought Ning Youfu and Ning Houjun for help.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Youfu closed his doors to visitors, while Ning Houjun received them.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Houjun said: "The young clan leader was pulled down, so this retaliation from the main branch is not entirely unexpected."<br/>
<br/>
"Can we follow Ning Zhuo's example and gather at the ancestral shrine?" someone asked.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Houjun snorted: "Do you think the ancestral shrine is a joke? Do you want to be thrown into the dungeon? The main branch brats are just waiting for you to make a fuss."<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked: "Then why could Ning Zhuo do it and succeed?"<br/>
<br/>
"He had solid evidence, both witnesses and material evidence, which even the main branch couldn't refute. Do you have any?" Ning Houjun glared, "Do you have anything?"<br/>
<br/>
He pointed at the seeking help family members: "The main branch dismissed you with valid reasons."<br/>
<br/>
"Who told you to be dishonest in your daily work? Now, caught red-handed, you lost your steward position and still have the nerve to come to me!"<br/>
<br/>
The branch members looked at each other.<br/>
<br/>
Someone complained: "Elder, you don't understand. Our branch has to live and cultivate, it's hard. We have large families to support, without using our positions for personal gain, how can we have enough resources?"<br/>
<br/>
"The main branch, even the idle ones, never lack cultivation resources."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Houjun sighed: "That's why I personally helped Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"He has talent, and if he grows, he will surely become an Elder."<br/>
<br/>
"Only with an Elder in our branch can we slightly counter the main branch."<br/>
<br/>
Someone sneered: "Elder, you persuaded me to get involved in the ancestral shrine matter yesterday. But now I think we helped the wrong person."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Houjun: "What do you mean?"<br/>
<br/>
Another person said: "Ning Zhuo received an extremely generous reward, far exceeding the previous standards. However, he is extremely stingy. Even when his cousins asked to borrow, he refused them directly."<br/>
<br/>
"Such a person is easy to share hardships with but difficult to share wealth. Are we right to pin our hopes on him?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Houjun snorted: "If not on him, then on you? Do you have talent?"<br/>
<br/>
The crowd was silent.<br/>
<br/>
A family member defended Ning Zhuo: "He is only sixteen, still young. Expecting him to have your level of understanding is unrealistic."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Houjun frowned at these words.<br/>
<br/>
He recalled yesterday's banquet, where Ning Zhuo's performance impressed him.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home, he was pleased, thinking Ning Zhuo had talent and maturity, a blessing for the branch.<br/>
<br/>
But today, Ning Zhuo's behavior disappointed Ning Houjun greatly: "Such stinginess, how can he gather people's hearts and achieve great things?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Houjun felt uneasy and decided to give Ning Zhuo a hint.<br/>
<br/>
"Someone, bring Ning Zhuo my message. I want two taels of Ice Jade Wine as thanks for yesterday's help. Go quickly and return."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Ning Houjun's instructions, the branch members decided to stay and see Ning Zhuo's reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was inspecting the family's rewards.<br/>
<br/>
The generosity of this reward surprised him slightly.<br/>
<br/>
"The Dragon Windmill must be placed close to the middle dantian. Once activated, it can create a mana tornado in the Qi Sea, increasing the speed of mana refinement and having a certain effect of purifying mana."<br/>
<br/>
"The Five Elements Ruler, when held, can quickly divide spiritual power and mana into the five elements. Originally a crafting tool, but now I practice the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, using it to separate the five elements of mana will greatly facilitate spell practice."<br/>
<br/>
"The Meditation Bell, each ring can quickly induce meditation. Continuous ringing can deepen a cultivator's meditation."<br/>
<br/>
"The Profound Ice Waist Token is an identity token, but wearing it can constantly gather spiritual energy, helping Ning family members refine mana."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully inspected these four Magical Artifacts and found no issues.<br/>
<br/>
To be safe, he planned to show them to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
With her spiritual eyes and experience as a disciple of a major sect and former black market overseer, her insight was broad.<br/>
<br/>
Not only Magical Artifacts, but pills and talismans also needed to be checked.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's conflict with the main branch was irreconcilable after he brought down Ning Xiaoren.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't afford to be careless with anything given by the main branch.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Houjun's servant arrived with his request.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed lightly: "The Elder is reminding me to distribute wealth to retain people. The main branch's differential treatment aims to undermine my reputation."<br/>
<br/>
"Convey my greetings and thanks to Elder Ning Houjun."<br/>
<br/>
"I understand the Elder's intention to use Ice Jade Wine to show everyone that they didn't help the wrong person and that I'm not stingy."<br/>
<br/>
"But I have my own plans."<br/>
<br/>
"No need for the Ice Jade Wine, take this letter back to the Elder."<br/>
<br/>
The servant took the letter back.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Houjun frowned as he opened the letter.<br/>
<br/>
After reading it, his frown disappeared, and he laughed heartily: "Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo, outwardly clumsy but inwardly wise! I worried for nothing. Look at this letter."<br/>
<br/>
The former stewards quickly read the letter, some smiling, others still hesitant: "This... will it work?"</div>
