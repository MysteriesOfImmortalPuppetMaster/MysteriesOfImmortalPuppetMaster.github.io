<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 264: Ning Zhuo, You're Finished!

Zhu Xuanji did not make an appearance, but his divine sense penetrated the room, observing the stage.

No one knew Zhu Xuanji's true intentions for arranging this for Ning Zhuo.

He had at least three layers of thoughts.

One was to verify what was mentioned in the diary, to see Ning Zhuo's skill in manipulating the puppets in the play "Seeking Justice." Another was to use this event to awaken and inspire Ning Zhuo.

The last was to use the play itself to admonish Ning Zhuo, giving him a final ultimatum—the opportunity to abandon darkness for light was right in front of him, right now!

"These are the mechanical puppets Li Leifeng used in his performances when he was alive," Zhu Hou personally took the stage, handing Ning Zhuo a set of puppet props.

"Thank you," Ning Zhuo expressed his gratitude.

Zhu Hou, at close range, scrutinized Ning Zhuo deeply, filled with curiosity, and wore a gentle smile: "Young man, do your best!" Zhu Hou stepped down from the stage, and Ning Zhuo began to study the puppets in his hands.

The puppets were simple in structure, mainly controlled by strings.

As Ning Zhuo familiarized himself with them, the Life-Hanging Thread shot out from the Lava Immortal Palace, connecting to the top of Ning Zhuo's head, linking to his soul.

The voice of the dragon turtle fire spirit transmitted through the Life-Hanging Thread, anxious and urgent: "Young master, young master!" "It's terrible, Ning Xiaohui has presented the Golden Phoenix Mirror, we're finished, we're finished!" "Once she achieves significant merit, she will immediately be able to take charge of the Historical Records Pavilion." "By then, no secrets can remain hidden."

Ning Zhuo sighed, responding secretly through the Life-Hanging Thread: "Dragon turtle fire spirit, I can't leave now, I can't escape!" "Look, this stage is a cage." "That constable is watching me like a hawk."

The dragon turtle fire spirit's voice was sharp, its heart burning with anxiety: "What should we do, what should we do?" "You must think of a way!" "I told you long ago to deal with Ning Xiaohui!" "Now look, she's about to succeed, and you're outside the Immortal Palace!!"

The dragon turtle fire spirit was almost cursing loudly; at this critical moment of life and death, Ning Zhuo was actually going to perform a puppet show.

Wasn't he always resourceful? Why had he become so foolish now?

With Zhu Xuanji staring at him, he couldn't move, reduced to a useless state! "If I had known, how could I have bet on you?" "Alas!" "I was truly blind, blind!"

In the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace, the dragon turtle fire spirit paced in circles, occasionally spewing fire upwards.

Ning Zhuo no longer paid attention to the dragon turtle fire spirit.

On the stage, there were three layers of steps.

He ascended the steps, reaching the highest point, and sat on a round stool.

This was where Li Leifeng often sat when he was alive.

The round stool was unremarkable, but Ning Zhuo's back was already sweating, as if sitting on pins and needles.

His mind was racing, very clear that Zhu Xuanji was pressuring him, but at the same time, giving him a chance to turn back! As long as Ning Zhuo finished this puppet show and then met Zhu Xuanji, he could kneel and weep, confessing that he was too young, misled by evil cultivators who befriended, supported, and aided him, leading him astray.

Now, moved by Zhu Xuanji, and feeling guilty recalling Li Leifeng, he decided to confess and reform.

By then, Zhu Xuanji would surely help him up, allowing him to atone for his crimes.

Ning Zhuo could also reconnect with Sun Lingtong, framing the Void Sect, and play his part well in this drama.

"Zhu Xuanji letting me on stage is actually giving me a step down. I just need to follow his lead, step down from the stage, and it's like a prodigal son returning home." "I can clear my name!" "In the future, with Zhu Xuanji's backing, I can achieve something in the righteous path, and when people mention this period, it will become a legendary story." "Just like the classic plays that have been passed down!"

Ning Zhuo squinted his eyes, his thoughts surging.

In his conversation with Song Fuli, he saw a second path in life.

That path led to the Flying Cloud Kingdom.

And at this moment, he saw a third path.

This path led to the Southern Bean Kingdom, to the court.

Life, it seemed, was not just one path.

According to Ning Zhuo's plan, his ambition to seize the Lava Immortal Palace was undoubtedly opposing Meng Kui, Zhu Xuanji, and the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family.

"Could my former path in life... really succeed?" "Could I really become the master of the Immortal Palace?" "Even if I became the master of the Immortal Palace, how would I deal with enemies like Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji?" "Could I just leave, fly away with the Lava Immortal Palace?"

Ning Zhuo couldn't guarantee for himself, he couldn't predict the future.

His former path in life was fraught with danger, like plunging into endless magma, like committing suicide! However, if he relied on Zhu Xuanji, it would be different.

Zhu Xuanji appreciated him! Ning Zhuo could fully feel this.

Talented individuals are common, but a discerning mentor is rare.

By relying on Zhu Xuanji, Ning Zhuo could likely achieve great success.

Ning Zhuo understood well Zhu Xuanji's status in the royal family.

The Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family was not lacking in golden core cultivators, but Zhu Xuanji was the most outstanding among them.

Cultivation level does not represent everything; temperament, talent, and innate ability are the keys that determine the gap between cultivators.

Ning Zhuo believed that Zhu Xuanji had a bright future and would surely become a key figure in the Southern Bean Kingdom's court! "A wise man adapts to circumstances. The King of the Southern Bean Kingdom has also issued a decree to recruit talents."

"If I rely on Zhu Xuanji, perhaps I can continue to compete for the position of the Immortal Palace's master. Then, following the decree, offer the Immortal Palace, become a court official of the Southern Bean Kingdom, and rise to prominence with Zhu Xuanji!" "Such a future..."

This was a future Ning Zhuo had never imagined.

Perhaps, as Zhu Xuanji had just hinted to him—he was already different.

He was no longer the little thief below the stage; he had already become the young master on the stage!

Boom.

The musicians on both sides of the stage began to play.

A drum sounded, breaking Ning Zhuo's contemplation.

Then.

Boom boom boom.

The jinghu began to accompany, creating a solemn atmosphere.

The stage creaked, the platform sank, then rose, revealing a large array of small mechanical structures, forming a scene.

The puppets stood within, their limbs extending with dozens of strings.

The strings were faintly visible, but after Ning Zhuo infused his mana, they disappeared, becoming completely transparent, invisible to the naked eye.

Ning Zhuo extended his ten fingers, all hidden within his sleeves, beginning a series of manipulative movements.

The tips of his fingers connected to the strings, controlling each puppet, starting the first act of the play "Seeking Justice."

In the main hall, the puppet of the judge sat upright.

On the desk before him were files, a wooden gavel, a token, and writing materials.

The prosecutor puppet spoke with a stern demeanor: "Bring the criminal to the court!" Two constables, one on each side, escorted a criminal to the front of the hall.

The criminal knelt, his face full of fear, yet he forced himself to remain calm.

This simple entrance alone amazed the audience.

The puppets, unlike regular combat mechanical puppets, had many control strings, allowing for more subtle movements and expressions, even changing tone with the varying intensity of mana infusion.

Ning Zhuo's control of these puppets was highly skilled, making them appear quite natural, as if they were real.

The judge puppet continued to speak, detailing the criminal's charges, with thorough evidence, very rigorous.

The criminal sang urgently, his tone filled with indignation: "I am but a commoner, yet you, the judge, press me with such force!" "In this world, everyone is like this, why only accuse me?"

The judge puppet sang: "The net of justice is wide, yet none escape. Regardless of status, all will be punished." "Heaven's justice is clear, how dare you argue?" "You are but an accomplice, do not harbor any illusions." Snap.

The judge puppet precisely grabbed the wooden gavel on the desk and struck it, producing a crisp sound.

Then he shouted: "The evidence is conclusive, quickly confess the true culprit!" The criminal puppet lowered his head, refusing to speak.

The constables took him away again, heading towards the prison.

As the door opened.

Ning Xiaohui entered the Historical Records Pavilion! Her face was full of excitement and exhilaration, not expecting to enter here so quickly, completing the mission Zhu Xuanji had entrusted to her.

"I succeeded!" "Though it was with the help of the Golden Phoenix Mirror, I finally did it." "Hahaha!"

Ning Xiaohui laughed, feeling triumphant at this moment.

The Historical Records Pavilion was filled with countless jade slips.

Ning Xiaohui walked among them, reaching out to touch these jade slips, a smile on her lips, her eyes shining with satisfaction.

"From now on, I can also catch the eye of Lord Zhu Xuanji." "Wonderful, entering the Immortal Palace is the path most suitable for me." "I seized this opportunity in life!"

Ning Xiaohui suppressed her excitement, beginning to use her position to investigate past records in the Lava Immortal Palace.

She first pondered, then suddenly widened her eyes, discovering an extremely shocking secret.

"A great discovery!" "The mechanical black snake of the Zheng family actually originated here?" Ning Xiaohui was full of surprise, continuing her investigation.

Soon, she opened her mouth, extremely shocked. "Dragon turtle fire spirit! This dragon turtle fire spirit has a huge problem!" Ning Xiaohui became extremely excited, finally understanding why Zhu Xuanji wanted her to investigate the Historical Records Pavilion.

This step was truly crucial! "As expected of Lord Zhu Xuanji! He must have suspected, but lacked evidence." "Now I have all the evidence in my hands, I have made a great contribution!" Ning Xiaohui was so excited her face flushed, continuing to examine.

But soon, the flush on her face quickly faded, her eyes widened, excitement and exhilaration turned to fear and paleness. "Ning Zhuo, Ning..." "It's actually you!!!" "A conspiracy, a huge conspiracy."

"Too terrifying, you actually started acting from the age of two." "Qi Refining Stage, you're only at the Qi Refining Stage, yet you plot to seize the Lava Immortal Palace! It's simply audacious, unforgivable!!" Ning Xiaohui scolded in her heart.

The truth was terrifying, chilling her to the core.

But soon, she became extremely excited. "Ning Zhuo, you criminal, I've caught you!" "Hahaha, you are the biggest culprit!" "You're finished, you're completely finished."

"I will use you to establish my great merit. How delightful, how delightful!" Boom!

The next moment, a loud noise came, and the Lava Immortal Palace shook violently.

Ning Xiaohui lost her balance, her body staggering, almost falling headfirst.

She was filled with uncertainty: "What's going on? What happened?"</div>
