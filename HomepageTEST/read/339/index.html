<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 339: Deceptive Blade Technique
Although the pangolin and yellow weasel both only had Foundation Establishment level battle strength, they showed no signs using their transformation abilities yet.
The pangolin had tough skin and thick flesh, but Sun Lingtong's blade technique sent blade light fluttering like butterfly wings, directly shattering the pangolin's eyeballs.
The pangolin howled in pain, curling into a ball and rolling back into the mountain mist.
In just a dozen breaths, Sun Lingtong had defeated two generals and was now attacking the Scorpion Spearman.
The Scorpion Spearman's spear technique was not bad, and he fought with Sun Lingtong for five or six rounds before he could no longer hold on. Finally, Sun Lingtong broke into his inner circle.
A flash of cold light rose, cutting off the scorpion's fingers, causing the long spear to fall to the ground.
The Scorpion Spearman quickly retracted his hands, rolled on the ground, and changed back to his original form.
With his scorpion tail raised high, he launched an attack with all his strength. It was so fast that it became a blur in mid-air.
Sun Lingtong sneered. He could see his opponent's attack extremely clearly thanks to his Spirit Eyes. However, at the critical moment, the Fox God suddenly used a divine technique, greatly interfering with Sun Lingtong’s innate talent.
Unable to dodge in time, Sun Lingtong could only barely turn his body sideways.
The scorpion tail grazed his left arm, and intense poison immediately began to corrode it.
Sun Lingtong's left arm became powerless. His dagger fell to the floor as he quickly retreated back into the formation, quickly using his power to lock down the poison and prevent its spread. He also swallowed several pills in succession to control his injuries.
"Boss!" Seeing Sun Lingtong injured, Ning Zhuo's face was instantly filled with anger.
He patted his storage belt, releasing more than thirty mechanical fire explosive monkeys.
These fire explosive monkeys were all connected by strings. After landing on the ground, they leaped out of the formation and pounced on the black scorpion outside.
Boom boom boom!
A round of self-detonations blasted the black scorpion's skin open, even blowing off one of its claws, leaving it severely injured and on the brink of death.
The Fox God used the same trick again, using the mountain mist to retrieve the black scorpion.
Ning Zhuo sneered and urged the mechanical fire explosive monkeys to pursue.
The fire explosive monkeys were about to surround and kill the Centipede Axeman, frightening him into wailing loudly. He dropped his axes and crawled on the ground using both hands and feet, like a centipede, swiftly fleeing into the thick mountain mist.
Ning Zhuo drove the fire explosive monkeys to pursue relentlessly.
The Fox God cut the strings on the Fire Monkeys, isolating Ning Zhuo's divine sense. Though she confirmed there were no puppet heads inside the fire explosive monkeys, she still saw them lively and extraordinarily agile, leaving her deeply puzzled.
Innate Talent - Cloud and Mist Confusion!
The Fox God activated her innate talent, immediately causing strange changes in the vast mountain mist.
"Hm?!" Just as Ning Zhuo was about to control the mechanical fire explosive monkeys to self-detonate, the ring on his finger suddenly tightened slightly.
Ning Zhuo stopped his action, and the next moment he saw the mechanical fire explosive monkeys rush out of the mountain mist and crash into the formation.
Ning Zhuo's pupils contracted slightly.
If he had been half a beat slower just now and let the fire explosive monkeys self-detonate, he would have been lifting a rock, only for it to drop on his own foot, causing his own formation to suffer critical damage.
Ning Zhuo's Buddha Heart Demon Seal activated, once again controlling the mechanical fire explosive monkeys charge into the mountain mist.
But as soon as they entered the mist, the mechanical fire explosive monkeys immediately lost their sense of direction, not knowing east from west. They thought they were walking in a straight line, but in reality, they were circling in place.
Ning Zhuo tried to control the fire explosive monkeys to return, but in his perception, although it seemed like a straight line back, the fire explosive monkeys just couldn't find their way out.
Ning Zhuo made a quick decision to temporarily abandon these fire explosive monkeys and released mechanical floating hands to cast spells.
Spell after spell was released - raging fire, rolling stones, leaf darts, water arrows, golden needles - all shooting straight into the mountain mist, then disappearing without a trace. No sound could be heard, no light or shadow could be seen.
"What a thick mist!" After another failed attempt, Ning Zhuo immediately stopped his spells and released a mechanical sphere.
It was the Ice Snow Weather Sphere.
The Ice Snow Weather Sphere emitted a strong cold current, dispersing into the mountain mist. Wherever it went, the mist water condensed into patches of frost flowers, scattering in all directions.
The mountain mist rapidly weakened.
The Fox God smiled lightly: "Interesting. Then I'll use thirty percent of my power."
The next moment, the mountain mist suddenly thickened again, returning to its previous state.
Ning Zhuo sneered: "It's not over yet."
With a thought, he grabbed a ghost soul from his storage belt and threw it to the Ice Snow Weather Sphere.
Innate Talent - Snow Soul Ice Essence!
The spirit in the Ice Snow Weather Sphere inherently possessed the Snow Soul Ice Essence innate talent from the Ning family ghost.
The ghost soul was used as fuel for the innate talent, quickly dissipating. The cold current emitted by the Ice Snow Weather Sphere surged several times over, once again causing the mountain mist to condense into ice and continuously fall.
The Fox God snorted coldly and continued to increase her power.
Seeing that the mountain mist was about to recover, Ning Zhuo patted his belt and released a cloud.
The cloud had a white base with blue hues, exuding cold air. As it flew in the air, snowflakes fell along its path.
It was the Cold Snow Cloud.
Ning Zhuo had purchased five Flowing Clouds from the Cloud City, and this was one of them.
The Cold Snow Cloud enveloped the Ice Snow Weather Sphere. Although it was only at the artifact level, it complemented the Ice Snow Weather Sphere perfectly.
In this way, the cold current was further amplified, causing the mountain mist to continue condensing into frost flowers and slowly clear away.
"Mere Foundation Establishment level mechanisms think they have hope in dissolving my mist?" The Fox God's fighting spirit was aroused, and she howled, exerting her full power.
The next moment, the mountain mist surged violently, rolling in waves.
Bang!
A shock wave exploded, and a blue light flashed brightly in the mist.
"Hahaha, got you!" Sun Lingtong laughed joyfully, "You really took my dagger away. Did you really think stealing my stuff would be so easy? Hahaha."
He had already healed himself, though his face was a bit swollen.
Blade Technique - Deception of Gods!
He had lost the dagger in the mountain mist, and it was picked up by the Fox God. As a result, the latter was caught off guard and was hit by Sun Lingtong's powerful technique.
The Deception of Gods blade technique specifically counters divine beings, echoing the Curse the Immortals sword technique.
These two techniques are extremely classic. Any cultivator practicing blade or sword techniques would yearn to learn them. Unfortunately, these two techniques are extremely difficult, and only those with extraordinary comprehension abilities have a chance of mastering them.
Clearly, Sun Lingtong was one of them.
"I must have injured her. Ah, this mist is really annoying." Sun Lingtong had long since activated his Spirit Eyes innate talent, but the mountain mist was so thick that he could only see through three feet of it.
"You... have... thoroughly... angered... me!" The Fox God let out a sharp cry, no longer maintaining her previous composure.
From her reaction, it was clear that Sun Lingtong had indeed dealt her a heavy blow.
Sun Lingtong's face was solemn as he prepared for battle.
Ning Zhuo took out a mechanical flying blade and held it in his hand, ready to fight with all his might.
The mountain mist rose high, blotting out the sky. Suddenly it stopped, and from within came a low exclamation from the Fox God: "The Great Snake Dart?!"
The mountain mist froze.
The battlefield suddenly fell silent.
After a moment of silence, the Fox God spoke in a gentle tone: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, so your mother even entrusted you with the Great Snake Dart. No wonder she felt at ease letting you travel outside."
Then, the mountain mist rapidly dispersed like a receding tide.
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong saw daylight again and were surprised to find that they were no longer at the Fox God's temple, but somewhere on the mountainside.
The mountain mist had enveloped the formation and actually moved them out!
The Fox God revealed her true form, walking out of the mountain mist suspended in the air.
Her hair was like snow, falling to her shoulders, and she wore a white robe, floating like a banished immortal. Her figure was graceful and charming, with a fox tail swaying behind her, like clouds and smoke, naturally elegant in both stillness and motion.
The only flaw was that the dagger was stuck in her high, protruding chest.
The dagger radiated blue light, like lightning, sizzling and crackling.
The Fox God reached out and forcefully covered the blade handle, pulling the blade outward. During this process the blade light was like streams of electricity, connecting to the wound, fiercely absorbing the dagger, forming a huge attractive force.
The Fox God snorted coldly and exerted force suddenly, breaking the electric blade light.
She threw the dagger back to Sun Lingtong, and the knife wound on her chest was quickly enveloped by mountain mist, vanishing without a trace.
Sun Lingtong fell silent.
Obviously, the Fox God possessed Golden Core level combat power. The Deception of Gods blade technique was one of Sun Lingtong's strongest moves, yet it had achieved zero results.
The Fox God looked at Ning Zhuo, her gaze lingering on the mechanical flying blade in his hand, and a smile appeared on her face: "As expected of Sister Meng Yaoyin's child. Just now, this god was itching to test you a bit, but it wasn't truly meant to trouble you two."
"Oh?" Ning Zhuo opened his mouth and spat out the Cloud Concealment petal, "Does the great Fox God not want this reward anymore?"
The Fox God's smile became a bit forced: "Young master, you're still taking it seriously. Hehehe."
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong exchanged a glance. Neither of them had expected that the Great Snake Dart would have such a great deterrent effect on the Fox God.
"If that's the case, then we'll take our leave," Ning Zhuo said.
The Fox God nodded, watching wistfully as Ning Zhuo swallowed the petal again. She forcibly held back: "Go on, go on."
As the two were walking further and further away, the Fox God suddenly said: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, wait a moment."
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong immediately stopped and quickly turned around, fully on guard.
The Fox God laughed: "Don't worry, you two. This god just wants to inform you of the truth."
"This god has searched almost the entire Mist Concealment Mountain, but there is a valley in the west of the mountain where this god is powerless."
"If you still haven't found your target object, it's likely to be in that valley."
Ning Zhuo felt curious and asked for more information.
The Fox God shook her head slightly, waved her sleeve, and her entire body turned into mountain mist, dispersing into nothingness on the spot.
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong both took out Flying Clouds and flew directly away from the Cloud Fox Mountain God Temple.
Only when they were far away did Ning Zhuo put away the mechanical scythe.
He held his breath and concentrated, expelling the anger and killing intent from his heart.
"This Night Rain Demon Weapon is really sinister, with too much killing intent. I haven't even used it to truly fight an enemy, but just holding it for a moment has affected my state of mind."
Ning Zhuo was secretly alarmed.
Sun Lingtong sent a mental message asking: "Little Zhuo, what should we do next? Should we go to the valley in the west of the mountain? I have a feeling that the Fox God has some other plan."
Ning Zhuo had the same feeling as Sun Lingtong.
It seemed impossible that a deputy mountain god would be unable to investigate a certain area of Mist Concealment Mountain.
When Ning Zhuo asked further, the Fox God also had a secretive manner, which seemed very suspicious, as if intentionally trying to lure them.
But since it concerned his mother, even though Ning Zhuo knew he might be falling into the other party's scheme, he had to investigate.
