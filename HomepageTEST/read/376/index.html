<div id="chapterContent">Late at night.<br/>
<br/>
Dense clouds temporarily obscured the moonlight.<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju walked hurriedly along the mountain path. She was cautious and anxious, frequently looking around. The lantern she carried was an artifact, serving the purpose of reconnaissance and warning.<br/>
<br/>
The trees on both sides of the mountain path rustled in the gentle breeze. Besides the wind, Xiao Ju could only hear her own footsteps and heartbeat.<br/>
<br/>
The sound of the waterfall grew louder, drowning out other noises.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, a deep pool appeared before her eyes. Xiao Ju quickened her pace, trying not to linger by the water.<br/>
<br/>
After passing the waterfall, she ascended the mountain path. The roar of the waterfall echoed in her ears, seeming particularly deafening in the night.<br/>
<br/>
Mist permeated the air, and the moss and vines on the rock face were very damp.<br/>
<br/>
The light from the lantern cast flickering shadows on the stone walls.<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju continued on her way, and her heart lifted slightly when she saw the entrance to the Cave of Ten Thousand Demons.<br/>
<br/>
But then, remembering the mission entrusted to her by Lin Shanshan, she felt an extremely heavy pressure.<br/>
<br/>
She had arrived at the cave entrance but hesitated, lingering at the mouth, afraid to enter.<br/>
<br/>
Just then, Linghu Jiu's voice came from inside the cave:<br/>
<br/>
"Drunk, I lie on a stone bed, the wind gently warm,<br/>
<br/>
In the depths of the mountain cave, dreams are hard to guess.<br/>
<br/>
Awake, moonlight casts shadows of pine and cypress,<br/>
<br/>
Footsteps approach, who comes to inquire?"<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju knew she had been detected and had no choice but to announce herself.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu, of course, knew that Xiao Ju was Lin Shanshan's personal maid and immediately invited her in.<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju entered the cave with trepidation.<br/>
<br/>
The light inside the cave was dim and yellow, and the cave walls were covered with mottled moss, as if narrating the passage of time and vicissitudes.<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju soon saw the stone bed.<br/>
<br/>
On the stone bed lay a thin cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
He was half-reclining, his posture graceful, reeking of alcohol, with drowsy eyes, exuding an air of otherworldly detachment, as if all worldly troubles were irrelevant to him.<br/>
<br/>
It was Linghu Jiu.<br/>
<br/>
He smiled gently and asked Xiao Ju, "So late at night, coming to find me in the cave, is it perhaps that my little junior sister needs my help?"<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju took a deep breath, first bowed, then steeled herself and informed Linghu Jiu of Lin Shanshan's request.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu: ......<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju looked at Linghu Jiu anxiously.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu furrowed his brow, sighed deeply, got off the stone bed, and paced the cave with his hands behind his back.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, Xiao Ju suddenly felt that Linghu Jiu's transcendent aura had been dragged down by worldly matters, tainted by mortal dust. His immortal nature dissipated, replaced with humanity.<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju felt much sympathy for Linghu Jiu as he frowned in contemplation.<br/>
<br/>
She made up her mind that if Linghu Jiu showed even the slightest refusal to Lin Shanshan's request, she would turn and leave immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Although she was a girl, she felt that this matter was too distressing and cruel for Linghu Jiu.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu stopped his pacing and sighed, "I've been in this cave for so long, I'm unaware of the changes outside.<br/>
<br/>
"This time, even if my junior sister didn't come to ask for my help, I should intervene.<br/>
<br/>
"Xiao Ju, take my waist token and go to the library to collect the enlightenment diagrams for the Gold and Fire elements. Get all that can be given to visiting cultivators and give them to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"When you hand them over, tell him that the senior disciples are perhaps a bit overprotective of their junior sister, and ask Young Master Ning Zhuo not to take offense.<br/>
<br/>
"Consider these borrowed enlightenment diagrams as an apology from the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect."<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju looked puzzled, not understanding why Linghu Jiu said this.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu smiled at her and waved his hand, "When you go back, tell my little junior sister that she doesn't need to spend anything this time, I'll take care of it as her senior brother.<br/>
<br/>
"Go early tomorrow morning, this must be done. After you return, please report to me first."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, Xiao Ju understands." Xiao Ju left with the waist token and returned to Origin Mountain, carrying various doubts.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing Lin Shanshan, she relayed everything about Linghu Jiu's reception to her mistress.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan was slightly puzzled at first, but then her furrowed brow relaxed as she understood the key point, "I see."<br/>
<br/>
"Miss, what do you see?" Xiao Ju couldn't understand this riddle.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan explained to her, "It must be that senior brothers like Lao De have been stirring things up behind the scenes, causing public opinion against Young Master Ning Zhuo, which has prompted many cultivators to challenge him.<br/>
<br/>
"Big senior brother knows about this, so he instructed you to do this as an apology to Young Master Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"Ah? Why should our esteemed Ten Thousand Medicines Sect apologize to an outsider?" Xiao Ju found it unbelievable and felt indignant on Linghu Jiu's behalf.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan shook her head.<br/>
<br/>
She had been groomed from a young age, so her perspective and understanding were naturally different from those of a maid.<br/>
<br/>
"What senior brother is doing is correct.<br/>
<br/>
"Visiting cultivators are a special feature of our sect and one of our main political strategies.<br/>
<br/>
"If this matter were exposed, the harm to the entire Ten Thousand Medicines Sect would be intangible but enormous.<br/>
<br/>
"Since senior brother wants to bear this expense, let him do it. As the senior brother of the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, he indeed needs to do this."<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju finally understood somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
The next day, she started her mission early in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
First, using Linghu Jiu's waist token, she spent a large amount of sect merit to obtain the enlightenment diagrams for the Fire and Gold elements.<br/>
<br/>
Then, she took these diagrams and entered the teleportation array, appearing directly on Small Dispute Peak.<br/>
<br/>
She slightly concealed her appearance, disguised herself as a stranger, and went straight to Ning Zhuo's current cave dwelling. She released a flying message to express her identity and intention to visit.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was practicing the Three Sects Supreme Techniques in his cave when he received the message. He immediately invited Xiao Ju in through voice transmission.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Xiao Ju sat down in the reception area, she heard footsteps and saw a young man appear from behind a screen.<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju's eyes brightened as she saw Ning Zhuo in a white long-sleeved robe, as pure as clouds.<br/>
<br/>
His features were handsome and refined, his eyes clear and distinct like a lake, radiating sincerity.<br/>
<br/>
He wore a smile as gentle and warm as a spring breeze, naturally endearing himself to others.<br/>
<br/>
"No wonder Miss is so fond of him, going to great lengths for him!" Xiao Ju marveled inwardly.<br/>
<br/>
Before seeing Ning Zhuo in person, she didn't quite understand Lin Shanshan's actions and felt indignant for Senior Brother Linghu Jiu.<br/>
<br/>
But now, upon meeting Ning Zhuo, she suddenly understood Lin Shanshan much better.<br/>
<br/>
"I thought, being a young master from a cultivation family, his status would be similar to our young miss, but I didn't expect him to dress so simply and plainly.<br/>
<br/>
"So this is the type Miss likes!<br/>
<br/>
"Actually, in my opinion, Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu are completely on par with each other."<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju secretly compared the two in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
She felt that Linghu Jiu was like a gentle breeze, carefree and unrestrained, free and soft. Ning Zhuo was like the morning light, pure and clean, sincere and warm.<br/>
<br/>
A white-robed youth, graceful and elegant, with clear features like the full moon.<br/>
<br/>
Gentle breeze and bright moon, both equally pleasing, truly good fellows of this world.<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju stood up and bowed to Ning Zhuo, her voice becoming much more gentle and obedient.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled, sat in the host's seat, and gestured for Xiao Ju to sit as well.<br/>
<br/>
But Xiao Ju didn't sit: "I'm just Miss's maid, how dare I sit as an equal with Young Master Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"This servant has come to bring treasures to you, Young Master!"<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju took out all the Metal and Fire element enlightenment diagrams and handed them to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Curious, Ning Zhuo asked, "Miss Lin has been confined, how could she borrow so many enlightenment diagrams for me?"<br/>
<br/>
After all, when he previously borrowed Wood element diagrams, it was only three, and he had lent out his own Frost and Snow diagrams in exchange.<br/>
<br/>
This gesture was much grander than before.<br/>
<br/>
It didn't make sense that Lin Shanshan's influence and means would increase after being confined.<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju smiled, "I was just about to explain this to you, Young Master."<br/>
<br/>
She then detailed the circumstances regarding the enlightenment diagrams and conveyed Linghu Jiu's apology to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo exclaimed in surprise, "There was such a matter?<br/>
<br/>
"So you're saying that the challenges I've faced today were stirred up by disciples of the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect?<br/>
<br/>
"I see, haha."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pretended to have just learned this and laughed heartily.<br/>
<br/>
He stood up and pushed the enlightenment diagrams back into Xiao Ju's hands, "If that's the case, then I cannot accept these diagrams."<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju was greatly astonished, "This lowly servant dares to ask, why is that, Young Master?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo earnestly replied, "Previously, thanks to Miss Lin's great kindness and support, she helped me, an outsider, quickly integrate into the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect and Little Contention Peak.<br/>
<br/>
"I have always remembered this kindness deeply, etched in my bones and heart, never forgetting, and pondering that if I have a chance in the future, I must repay it.<br/>
<br/>
"How could I not know the great extent of Miss Lin's efforts to help me?<br/>
<br/>
"Hearing that she has been confined worries me greatly. I go to Origin Mountain daily but am always turned away. I fear that none of the flying messages I've sent have reached Miss Lin's hands."<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju nodded. She knew about Ning Zhuo coming to Origin Mountain almost every day and his messages being intercepted by Lao De and others.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued, "I've asked myself, if I had known beforehand that Miss Lin would be confined for helping me, would I still have accepted her help?<br/>
<br/>
"I would have."<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju couldn't help but gasp. She thought Ning Zhuo would deny it, but he affirmed it directly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gazed into Xiao Ju's eyes, "Because I understand that Miss Lin's help comes entirely from the bottom of her heart!<br/>
<br/>
"Such sentiment, like the Mist Embroidered Orchid I gave her, is a treasure of heaven and earth, something to be cherished.<br/>
<br/>
"Tell me, where else in the world can one find such friendship, where people can feel like old friends at first sight, and offer wholehearted assistance in such a short time?<br/>
<br/>
"If I were to refuse Miss Lin's help, it would be like watching such a treasure dissipate.<br/>
<br/>
"That would be a waste of heaven's gifts.<br/>
<br/>
"Her helping me now, and me helping her in the future, this is the true symbol of friendship, the best way to preserve this worldly treasure!"<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju was dumbfounded.<br/>
<br/>
She hadn't expected Ning Zhuo to express such sentiments.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the white-robed youth before her, as clear as the morning sun, and his transparent eyes, Xiao Ju could feel his sincere heart.<br/>
<br/>
"I see." She was convinced.<br/>
<br/>
She vaguely understood why Ning Zhuo was now refusing these enlightenment diagrams.<br/>
<br/>
"But... just friendship?"</div>
