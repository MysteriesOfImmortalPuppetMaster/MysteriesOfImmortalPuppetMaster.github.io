Chapter 685: Cloud Talisman Flowing City

Ning Zhuo sighed, "Just the other day, I was discussing Yu Xiaoman and the Luoshu with Shen Xi. I never imagined we'd actually encounter it in reality."

Sun Lingtong's eyes burned as he stared at the swirling vortex. "The most valuable treasure in the Jade Cleansing Pavilion is the Luoshu Page. It's a Dao Artifact, even if it's incomplete."

"If I activate my Innate Talent and glimpse the page, its influence will grant me a tremendous boost in mathematics and logic!"

Sun Lingtong carefully relived his recent experience. Under the Luoshu's influence, he had become a mathematical genius.

The sensation was utterly addictive.

"It's like the Spirit Hidden Willow... Boss, I understand how you feel," Ning Zhuo said, his voice tinged with empathy. He and Sun Lingtong shared a life-bond, making him acutely aware of the other's emotions.

The Luoshu Page did resemble the Spirit Hidden Willow in its specialized focus, but the similarities were superficial.

The key difference lay in their nature. The Spirit Hidden Willow enhanced comprehension, while the Luoshu Page recorded the fundamental mathematical and logical principles of the universe, guaranteeing absolute accuracy. Thus, the Luoshu's insights inevitably led to correct understanding!

The Spirit Hidden Willow's assistance might have yielded incorrect results, but its creativity was undeniable.

The Luoshu's creativity, on the other hand, was zero. It provided correct answers, but the extent to which cultivators could create and understand depended entirely on their own abilities.

There was no need to doubt Sun Lingtong's comprehension skills; in this regard, he even surpassed Ning Zhuo.

"Little Zhuo, I'm going to continue probing the Luoshu. Try using Life Hanging by a Thread and focus all your senses at the same time!" Sun Lingtong suggested.

"Great idea!" Ning Zhuo immediately agreed.

Sun Lingtong activated his Innate Spirit Eyes again. As his gaze touched the Luoshu Page's true form, he was immediately affected by the Dao Artifact's influence.

"That's it!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed excitedly. "Little Zhuo, how do you feel?"

At Vine-Clasping Cliff, Ning Zhuo's eyes were tightly closed, his brow furrowed slightly, showing signs of strain. He transmitted mentally, "Elder Brother, I'm also being affected."

"This is absolutely fantastic!" Sun Lingtong replied.

Using the Luoshu Page, he began rapidly studying the swirling vortex before him. Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment before retrieving the Jade Slip given to him by Shen Xi.

The originally profound concepts gradually became easier to understand and more accessible to Ning Zhuo as he studied them.

Sun Lingtong only sustained his Innate Talent for sixteen breaths before stopping, closing his eyes.

This time, blood flowed not only from his nose but also from his ears, leaving him in a dazed state.

Sun Lingtong immediately sat cross-legged, took a Medicinal Pill, and began circulating his Cultivation Art to regulate his breathing.

It took him the time it takes to brew half a cup of tea to fully recover.

Ning Zhuo also adjusted his condition.

"Again!" Sun Lingtong called out, activating his Spirit Eye Innate Talent once more.

Ning Zhuo once again benefited from this process.

After several repetitions, Sun Lingtong gained a deeper understanding of the water vortex before them. "This natural Formation doesn't just utilize the Magic Artifacts and magic treasures placed in the divination chamber. It also draws upon the Water Vein Spiritual Qi here, and even the surrounding Void!"

Ning Zhuo's expression turned serious, recognizing the gravity of the situation.

Sun Lingtong sighed. "So, we can't forcibly take the Luoshu. It's the core of this Formation and the heart of the whirlpool. The Formation is unstable, constantly shifting, and it's precisely the Luoshu's principles that maintain its equilibrium."

"If we suddenly remove the Luoshu, the Formation will collapse without its computational core. The contained power and surrounding Void will erupt, annihilating everything around it."

"At that point, not only would my body be obliterated, but the entire Cave Mansion would be destroyed!"

This was, of course, unacceptable to Ning Zhuo and Sun Ning.

Ning Zhuo had methods to rescue Sun Lingtong, but the whirlpool Formation's entanglement with the surrounding Void rendered those methods ineffective.

Ning Zhuo would never risk Sun Lingtong's life for a mere Dao Artifact.

"How soon can we dismantle this Formation and retrieve the Luoshu Page?" Ning Zhuo asked.

Sun Lingtong forced a bitter smile. "It's hard to estimate. The challenge lies in it being a natural Formation, constantly evolving. If it were one of the Ten Grand Formations, we'd have a much easier time."

"Let me try to decipher the Formation. That would be equivalent to contending with this Dao Artifact. Unless my computational abilities surpass those of the Luoshu Page, I won't be able to calculate ahead of it and resolve the crisis in time."

Ning Zhuo assessed the situation and shook his head. "The risk is too great."

"There's no need to forcibly extract the Luoshu Page. We have plenty of time."

Sun Lingtong nodded. "First, let me use the Luoshu to comprehend the Cave Mansion Formation within the Formation Core and gain control of this place."

This task would be far less challenging than resolving the water vortex Formation.

Though the Cave Mansion Formation was ever-changing, its fundamental principles remained constant, leaving traces to follow.

Ning Zhuo continued, "Once we control the Cave Mansion Formation, we'll evacuate everything here and temporarily relocate it to the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon."

Sun Lingtong nodded. "That's feasible. But we still need to keep an eye on the outside world."

Ning Zhuo understood what he meant. "Don't worry, Boss. I've already sent people to investigate. We'll act immediately once we confirm the intelligence."

Sun Lingtong was referring to none other than Niu Cheng.

Niu Cheng's situation was dire.

He was surrounded by a mob of furious cultivators demanding answers.

Niu Cheng had a square jaw, a wide mouth, broad shoulders, a thick back, and skin tanned to a bronze hue.

His gaze lacked sharpness, and surrounded by the crowd of cultivators, his expression was one of panic and unease. He repeatedly bowed and clasped his hands in apology, stammering his excuses.

He wore indigo coarse cloth short-sleeved robes, with the sleeves and pant legs rolled up to his elbows and knees, revealing sturdy forearms and calves. A worn, polished oxhide belt encircled his waist, from which a foot-long brass skewer hung diagonally.

His feet were shod in thousand-layered cloth shoes, their uppers and soles stained with fresh mud.

"I... I never imagined it would turn out like this," he stammered.

"I thought I'd get an Array Dao Magical Treasure."

"It was truly unintentional!"

Niu Cheng's apologies failed to appease the cultivators; instead, they grew even more relentless.

"Make way!" Yu Heye suddenly appeared, flying before the crowd.

He glared at Niu Cheng and roared, demanding to know what kind of mess he'd made, causing his pill refinement to fail and resulting in catastrophic losses!

To convince the crowd, Yu Heye produced a handful of discarded materials, immediately eliciting gasps of shock and regret. The cultivators recognized Nascent Soul-level precious materials among the waste.

Comparing their own losses to Yu Heye's, the cultivators' anger and resentment diminished significantly. Yu Heye's losses far surpassed their own.

"He's the true victim here!" the cultivators unanimously concluded, unaware that Yu Heye had been ordered to stage this scene. The discarded pill refinement materials had been deliberately arranged before his arrival.

"Put all these losses on my account," Ning Zhuo declared magnanimously in his Flying Message to Yu Heye.

Yu Heye, of course, refused. He insisted on taking full responsibility, personally paying to destroy Nascent Soul-level precious materials and staging a fake alchemy failure.

This elaborate deception granted him immense leverage the moment he stepped onto the scene.

Yu Heye confronted Niu Cheng: "Speak. How will you compensate me?"

Niu Cheng, ever honest, spread his hands, admitting he couldn't afford to pay but vowing to work tirelessly to make amends, no matter how long it took.

"What if you try to run?" Yu Heye pressed, feigning contemplation before declaring, "Fine, you'll stay on my mountain peak under my supervision!"

"You want Xie Tang's Array Dao Magical Treasure? Go ahead. Maybe you'll impress Heavy Array Peak and use their reward to repay our debts."

"What do you all think? Is this acceptable?"

The cultivators exchanged glances, and after a moment of silence, they unanimously agreed to the proposal.

Their losses were minimal compared to Yu Heye's. In truth, many didn't even require compensation; the amount was so trivial it was inconsequential to them.

Some, however, genuinely needed restitution.

Yu Heye had suffered the greatest losses, and none of them were willing to waste their time and energy guarding Niu Cheng, a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

After a moment's consideration, they all agreed.

Yu Heye, however, wasn't finished. He produced a contract and had all the aggrieved parties sign it.

The cultivators examined the contract text thoroughly, found no issues, and signed their names.

Finally, Yu Heye handed the contract to Niu Cheng.

Under the intense scrutiny of countless eyes, Niu Cheng had no choice but to read it and sign.

Yu Heye then grabbed Niu Cheng by the collar and dragged him back to Vine-Clasping Cliff.

"You'll stay in the front chamber and cultivate by my side for now," Yu Heye sternly instructed. "No wandering off."

Niu Cheng hung his head and mumbled his assent.

Having settled the matter, Yu Heye immediately sent a Flying Message to Ning Zhuo to report.

Ning Zhuo received the message, nodded slightly, and dismissed Niu Cheng from his thoughts.

This was the best course of action for now.

While Ning Zhuo certainly had the power to prevent Niu Cheng from seeking the Array Dao Magical Treasure, doing so would have several negative consequences. It would draw unwanted attention, be difficult to explain, and damage his reputation, making him appear like a bully who preyed on the weak.

If he were to be labeled with such a reputation, it would severely damage his public image.

Ning Zhuo operated through Yu Heye, ensuring no one suspected him as the mastermind pulling the strings from behind the scenes.

Moreover, deliberately sacrificing a Nascent Soul-level treasure to coordinate the other victims and force Niu Cheng to submit was a profitable move.

Now that Niu Cheng was under Yu Heye's watchful eye, Ning Zhuo could secretly control his progress in exploring the Nine Palaces Formation.

With just a few Flying Messages and a Nascent Soul-level treasure, Ning Zhuo had eliminated a potential future threat while successfully maintaining his reputation.

The Luoshu Page truly lived up to its extraordinary reputation!

Leveraging the influence of the Dao Artifact's shadow cast upon Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo spent only two and a half days deciphering nearly half of Shen Xi's Jade Slip.

He gained a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the Mountain-Protecting Grand Formations of Vine-Clasping Cliff and Cloud-Scraping Peak.

Sun Lingtong also grasped the intricacies of the Formations within the Formation Cores.

But this wasn't enough.

While Sun Lingtong studied the Formations using the Luoshu Page, Ning Zhuo quietly left Vine-Clasping Cliff and teleported to another mountain peak via a small teleportation array.

This was White Willow Peak.

The entire mountain was planted with white willow trees, a spirit plant naturally capable of absorbing surrounding Cloud Qi, which clung to its leaves. As the Cloud Qi accumulated and blanketed the green foliage, the trees turned a pristine white, giving the peak its name.

The summit of White Willow Peak had been carved into a smooth jade platform by cultivators.

Upon this jade platform stood a cluster of interconnected buildings, their layout meticulously arranged as integral components of the Cloud Talisman Flowing City.

The Cloud Talisman Flowing City was an enterprise personally established by Meng Yaoyin.

The entire workshop resembled a massive green jade paperweight, firmly anchored at the peak's center. All structures were constructed from iron pine wood, their overhanging eaves extending into the Void, while colorful light shimmered across the glazed tiles.

Ning Zhuo surveyed the workshop from above.

At the heart of the complex lay an open space, forming the Radiant Talisman Drying Field. The Material Intake Courtyard housed cultivators responsible for transporting, sorting, and performing preliminary processing of raw materials.

Two towering structures dominated the skyline. The Flowing Cloud Transformation Tower mass-produced Cloud Talismans, while the Thunder-Drawing Tower refined talismans through lightning tempering.

Three pavilions stood nearby. The Firming Talisman Pavilion, shaped like a turtle shell, specialized in solidifying talismans. The Star-Pointing Terrace enhanced talisman quality, and the Sand-Melting Pavilion was dedicated to crafting high-grade and even top-grade talisman ink.

The front courtyard was used for selling talismans, while the rear hall housed the Jade Slip containing the Cloud Talisman Heavenly Tome. Combined with the Grand Formation, this setup not only protected the entire workshop but also aided in the production of talismans.

Ning Zhuo descended from his cloud head, stepped through the workshop gate archway, and entered the front courtyard.

A cacophony of voices surged toward him like a heatwave.

Cultivators crowded around the talismans, haggling over prices. One vendor shouted, "Invisibility Talismans - minimum order of a hundred! Buy a thousand and get a hundred free!" Another cultivator tossed a bulging storage pouch onto the counter, declaring, "I'll take all the Cloud Soaring Talismans on the counter today!"

After a brief stroll, Ning Zhuo noticed that Cloud Talismans were the most prevalent and popular type.

A quick calculation revealed that this place was practically minting gold daily!

Suddenly, a heated argument erupted nearby.

"We agreed on the 'Cold Plum Welcoming Snow' discount - 20% off! Thirty Ice Armor Talismans at 720 Spirit Stones after the discount! Cash on delivery! Why are you backing out now?"

The cultivator behind the counter hastily retorted, "That promotion ended yesterday! Pay the remaining 180 Spirit Stones immediately!"

The buyer sneered. "That's your mistake, not mine. I've already paid. You're obligated to deliver the goods."

The argument drew the attention of many onlookers.

Ning Zhuo watched with keen interest.

As the dispute escalated, a Golden Core cultivator entered the front courtyard, abacus in hand.

Along the way, numerous cultivators bowed respectfully, demonstrating his prestige.

It was Deputy Pavilion Master Jin Zi!

Jin Zi approached the quarreling pair, clarified the situation, and nodded amiably to the buyer. "Rest assured, customer. The mistake lies with us. The talismans will be delivered according to the agreed-upon price."

Under his command, the selling cultivator reluctantly handed over the talismans to the buyer, though clearly unwilling.

The buyer cupped his hands in a respectful bow, offered a flattering remark to Jin Zi, and strode away triumphantly.

Jin Zi turned to the selling cultivator. "These losses will be deducted from your salary."

The cultivator's face paled, and he could only nod meekly in agreement.

Jin Zi cupped his hands in a greeting to the crowd, then departed the front courtyard, mounting a cloud to leave Cloud Talisman Flowing City. Clearly, his intervention had been a mere detour.

Ning Zhuo watched his receding figure, his eyes flickering with contemplation.
