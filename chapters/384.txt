Chapter 384: You Still Say You Didn't Cause Trouble?

Faced with Ning Jiufan's doubts and concerns, Ning Zhuo immediately put on a bitter expression.

He said in an aggrieved tone: "Ancestor, how deep of a misunderstanding do you have of me?!"

"Since establishing the branch family, leaving my hometown, and venturing out on adventures, it has all been for the sake of our familiesâ€™ plans."

"The Jade Steel Mountain business was obtained through my careful deliberation, maneuvering in all directions, thinking it over many times, and exerting both mental and physical effort in a series of negotiations."

"Although I have traveled far from home, I have never forgotten the family or my responsibilities as the head of the branch family."

Ning Jiufan couldn't help but nod slightly.

Facts speak louder than words!

Ning Jiufan had witnessed firsthand how the Ning family branch in Fire Persimmon Immortal City had made the jade-infused dark steel business flourish like wildfire. To the extent that many people from the main family line were envious of this and said many sour words about it.

Ning Zhuo had already sent a letter to Ning Jiufan when he left Cloud Concealment Mountain, informing him of roughly what had happened on the mountain.

When Ning Jiufan received the letter at that time, after reading it once, he couldn't help but smile. He was very satisfied with Ning Zhuo's performance on Cloud Concealment Mountain.

Ning Jiufan nodded: "You did indeed do well with the matters on Cloud Concealment Mountain."

Ning Zhuo smiled: "Ancestor, this time, I want to emulate what we did on Cloud Concealment Mountain and seek more cooperation with the Myriad Medicine Sect."

Ning Jiufan stroked his beard and pondered: "Fire Persimmon Mountain and Ten Thousand Medicines Valley are quite far apart. Setting up a teleportation array would be very costly. But relying on post stations and trade routes carries even more risks."

"The Myriad Medicine Sect's business is thriving, they don't necessarily need us."

"These two factors are major obstacles to our cooperation with the Myriad Medicine Sect."

Clearly, since reading Ning Zhuo's letter, Ning Jiufan had also been contemplating this cooperation.

Ning Zhuo nodded: "Ancestor, your words hit the nail on the head. To the Myriad Medicine Sect, our Ning family is dispensable."

"But our Ning family also doesn't have anything particularly impressive to offer that would make the Myriad Medicine Sect eager to cooperate."

"After much thought, I figured if we have nothing to trade, then we'll sell our services!"

"Ancestor, the Myriad Medicine Sect is weak in combat strength, which is why they specifically arranged for Little Contention Peak to gain support from external cultivators. Some of their Golden Core level elders are also recruited from outside."

"These are not their own people, so while these outsiders are used, they are also guarded against."

"If our Ning family becomes a close ally of the Myriad Medicine Sect, we could gain more trust than these external cultivators."

Ning Jiufan: "How so?"

Ning Zhuo explained: "Firstly, our Ning family has a foundation. You can run away from the monk but not the temple. From this point, we are naturally more trustworthy than scattered cultivators or demonic cultivators."

"Secondly, we are quite far from the Myriad Medicine Sect, so we won't have friction in daily operations."

"Thirdly, our Ning family once received help from the Myriad Medicine Sect during our migration. Such old friendship is also worthy of more mutual trust."

Ning Jiufan nodded slightly, acknowledging Ning Zhuo's analysis.

"But even so, negotiating with Lin Bufan might not go too well."

"I've met this person a few times. He's very deep and quite shrewd, a practical talent among Nascent Soul cultivators."

"We are now the ones seeking out the Myriad Medicine Sect, taking the initiative to negotiate. Lin Bu Fan will surely drive a hard bargain."

Ning Jiufan understood Lin Bufan much better than Ning Zhuo did.

Ning Zhuo pondered: "Perhaps we could spread rumors proclaiming that the Myriad Medicine Sect is in a dangerous situation'?"

Ning Jiufan immediately shook his head: "That won't do."

"Lin Bufan lives up to his name, he's very capable. He's much older than you, and this is his territory that he has carefully managed for many years."

"He would easily see through the rumors and trace them back to the source."

"If we really did that, it would backfire."

Ning Zhuo nodded, immediately abandoning his previous idea. After all, he hadn't even met Lin Bufan once, while Ning Jiufan had interacted with Lin Bufan many more times than he had.

Ning Jiufan stared at Ning Zhuo with a smile: "Little Zhuo, do you still have the Ice Heart Jade Gourd? How much longer do you need to borrow it?"

Ning Zhuo just chuckled and took out the Ice Heart Jade Gourd, offering it with both hands.

Without any explanation.

Instead, after taking back the Ice Heart Jade Gourd, Ning Jiufan explained to Ning Zhuo: "This gourd is an important inherited treasure of our Ning clan, benefiting the entire clan. Keeping it to yourself doesn't allow it to reach its full potential."

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "To be precise, it is of extraordinary significance to the Ning family's main branch who have cultivated the Ice Heart Technique."

When the Ice Heart Technique is successfully cultivated, the foundation of the upper dantian in the spirit sea often far exceeds the other two dantians. In this case, drinking the ice jade wine produced by the Ice Heart Jade Gourd can save cultivators a lot of hard work, allowing the cultivation of the upper dantian to drive the other two dantians.

Since Ning Zhuo had sent a letter summoning the Ning family ancestor, he naturally had mental preparation for this matter.

To be honest, after the Ice Heart Jade Gourd fell into his hands, he also found that it wasn't of much use to him.

Its greatest uses were two: one was to produce ice jade wine, and the other was to enhance healing effects.

For the former, Ning Zhuo had already emptied out the ice jade wine when exchanging the gourd. For the latter, in terms of healing, Ning Zhuo had the Floating Ice White Jade Hand as a perfect substitute.

"Empty?" The Ning family ancestor swept his divine sense across the empty Ice Heart Jade Gourd. He couldn't help but be surprised: "What did you need so much ice jade wine for?"

"Even if sold, it's only suitable for cultivators who practice frost techniques and have outstanding spirit sea cultivation."

"This wine has never sold well."

Ning Jiufan reminded.

A treasure suitable for the Ning family is not necessarily suitable for others.

Especially in the Southern Bean Kingdom located in the south, where the air is humid and warm, the number of cultivators practicing ice attribute techniques is scarce, far fewer than those practicing wood or earth techniques.

"I have my own use for this wine." At this moment, Ning Zhuo showed his stubbornness.

Ning Jiufan nodded, not pursuing the matter further.

Are you kidding?

Pursue the matter with Ning Zhuo?!

Ning Jiufan was clear in his heart that although Ning Zhuo was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage, his combat power had reached the Golden Core level, and even peaked among Golden Core cultivators!

Those few mechanical creations, especially the Night Rain Demon Weapon... Ning Jiufan had witnessed them personally.

So, ever since the dispute over the Lava Immortal Palace temporarily concluded, Ning Jiufan's attitude towards Ning Zhuo had undergone a major change.

Before, he completely regarded Ning Zhuo as an outstanding younger generation of his family. But now, in his heart, Ning Zhuo deserved to be treated as an equal.

"Ancestor, take a look at this." Ning Zhuo took out a jade slip and handed it to Ning Jiufan.

"Poison Flame Chrysanthemum?" Ning Jiufan swept his divine sense over it, and the smile on his face grew, "This is a good thing, I will stand up for the branch family."

However, Ning Zhuo said: "At present, my branch family has limited manpower. The main focus is on the operation of jade-infused dark steel, and a small part of the people rely on the Lava Immortal Palace to guard their own positions."

"So, for this Poison Flame Chrysanthemum business, I'm willing to cooperate with the main branch to operate it together!"

"Oh? You're willing to share?" Ning Jiufan was surprised.

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "The cultivation of mere flowers, compared to future prospects, is just a small profit."

"If we only use the manpower of my branch family, it's not enough. Forget about a few months, even in two or three years, there wouldn't be much progress."

"Ancestor, my cultivation now requires more and more funds. I urgently need capital. The more capital, the better!"

"So, we should expand the scale of the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum as much as possible!"

"However, if the main branch wants to participate, it must be under the lead of my branch family. In terms of profit, my branch family gets eight, the main branch gets two."

Ning Jiufan glared: "An 80-20 split?"

Ning Zhuo waved his hand: "Non-negotiable! If the Ning family's main branch doesn't agree, then I'll cooperate with the Zhou family."

Ning Jiufan snorted coldly: "We share the Ning surname, Little Zhuo, you seem a bit harsh on your own family."

Ning Zhuo then sneered, directly giving Ning Jiufan attitude: "Since I became aware, the Ning family main branch has always treated me like this. An eye for an eye, karma is just heavenly principle."

Ning Jiufan sighed and changed the subject: "You used the black market and the Lava Immortal Palace to amass wealth on a large scale, how come in just a few months, your resources are already tight?"

Ning Zhuo then untied the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon from his waist and showed it to Ning Jiufan.

"A Nascent Soul level mechanism! This is... Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon? Good stuff!" Ning Jiufan recognized it and marveled.

He had early guesses in his heart, and now seeing the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, he wasn't too surprised.

At the same time, he also understood the reason for Ning Zhuo's financial strain.

Ning Zhuo then told him that this Ten Thousand Li Dragon mechanism should originally be driven by a Nascent Soul. Now, it could only be substituted with fire essence, and each use consumed a huge amount. By now, he was almost unable to sustain it.

Ning Jiufan reprimanded him: "For ordinary travel, why use the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon? This behavior is too extravagant. The real scenario to use it should be when you're in danger and need the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to escape."

Ning Zhuo didn't tell Ning Jiufan that for the sake of his mother, in his urgency, he directly traveled at maximum speed.

"With the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to protect you, I can be at ease. As for fire essence, I have some news on my side that might be useful." Ning Jiufan then told him about a ten-thousand-year fire essence that had appeared in Fire Persimmon Mountain.

Meng Kui was gathering Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou family and Ning family, and had already taken Ning Jiufan's Fire Core Pomegranate to set up a trap.

"This ten-thousand-year fire essence already has a strong spirituality. If you, Little Zhuo, had this, it should greatly reduce the consumption of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon."

"As long as the ten-thousand-year fire essence doesn't completely perish, it can quickly recover by absorbing spirit energy from the outside world."

Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up, but then he looked worried.

This was indeed good news, but how could he get the ten-thousand-year fire essence from under Meng Kuiâ€™s nose?

After careful communication with the ancestor, Ning Zhuo also learned: Aunt Xi's injuries persisted, and if she participated in the struggle for the ten-thousand-year fire essence, she might be outmaneuvered by Meng Kui.

If anything untoward happened to Aunt Xi, then Ning Jiufan and the Ning family would truly have lost both the wife and the army.

"Given the current situation, we must let Aunt Xi fully recover before we have a chance of self-preservation."

"On the basis of ensuring self-preservation, perhaps we can rely on Aunt Xi to get the ten-thousand-year fire essence!"

Ning Zhuo and Ning Jiufan reached an agreement on this.

Ning Jiufan inquired about Ning Zhuo's recent situation.

Ning Zhuo handed over all the intelligence he had collected about the Myriad Medicine Sect to Ning Jiufan.

He also told the truth about his own experiences to prevent Ning Jiufan from misjudging.

After listening, he was silent for a moment, then glared and said: "Even Lin Bufan's precious daughter was confined because of you. You still say you didn't cause trouble?"

Ning Zhuo defended himself: "Miss Lin and I hit it off immediately. Friends helping each other is a testament to friendship."

Ning Jiufan snorted, then suddenly said: "So, this Poison Flame Chrysanthemum cultivation method was also secretly given to you by Lin Shanshan?"

Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head: "Of course not. This cultivation method came from Hua Guzi."
