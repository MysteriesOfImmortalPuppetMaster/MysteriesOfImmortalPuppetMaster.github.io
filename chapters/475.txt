Chapter 475: Enlisting Ma Liangcai (Two-in-One)

By the imperial decree of the monarch who bears the mandate of the land, it is said:

Mulan, you are loyal, brave, and value martial prowess, your illustrious name renowned. From the moment you donned armor and entered the battlefield, you repeatedly rendered outstanding achievements. During the ambush battle in the Thousand Peaks Forest, you were heroic and fearless, providing timely reinforcements and rendering meritorious service.

Recalling the past: when the front line was in dire peril, old General Mu took the initiative to request command. He passed the test of verifying generals, gathered the remaining troops, regrouped, and fought bravely to kill the enemy.

Afterwards, as the force gradually expanded, its military might spread far and wide. Eventually, he was able to lead a force independently, known as the Red Flower Camp.

Later, General Mu personally handled matters, repeatedly achieving distinguished military successes that terrified enemy troops and assured the people’s peace. Truly, he was a pillar of the nation and an exemplary model for the populace.

Upon hearing that General Mulan is grievously injured, I, the solitary ruler, feel deep sorrow. You have dedicated your heart to the nation, fulfilling both loyalty and filial piety. Indeed, you are a pillar of my Twin Rivers Kingdom, which greatly gratifies me.

National affairs are difficult; the situation in the Thousand Peaks Forest battlefield especially demands attention. Now that your wounds have not yet healed, you cannot personally command the Red Flower Camp. To ease your mind, and also to leave a successor for the Grand Marshal’s mansion, I hereby appoint General Ma Liangcai as a staff officer of the Red Flower Camp, to preside over the major affairs of the camp.

You must rest and recover. Once healed, you shall return to your position and assist. The affairs of the Red Flower Camp are entrusted to General Ma, so you may rest assured.

Thus decreed.

After the messenger finished reading the imperial edict, he looked around and frowned: “Where is General Mulan? Why does she not accept the decree?”

Zhang Zhongyi hurriedly said, “General Mulan is still unconscious and not in her right mind.”

The messenger nodded: “If that is so, General Ma Liangcai, please quickly gain control of the Red Flower Camp and go forth to serve the nation.”

Ma Liangcai nodded, opened his mouth, and gave a light shout. His voice swiftly spread throughout the entire Red Flower Camp.

The soldiers of the Red Flower Camp swiftly assembled, yet they did not heed Ma Liangcai’s command. Instead, they gathered around Mulan’s main commander’s tent. They were united, hostile toward Ma Liangcai.

This scene shocked Ning Zhuo and Liu Er!

Without their main general, Ma Liangcai was of Nascent Soul level and carried the King’s mandate, yet the Red Flower Camp’s soldiers still behaved thus. This showed where their hearts and loyalty lay.

Ma Liangcai’s face was as calm as still water. The messenger also berated them: “What is the meaning of this? The imperial decree is here! Do you intend to defy orders and commit treason?”

Some soldiers were expressionless, while others sneered. All wore resolute expressions.

“A mere imperial decree, and you want to remove our general? That will not do!”

“Changing generals on the eve of battle is a great taboo. When a general is in the field, he may not always obey the ruler’s commands —this is common sense. Please, Messenger, do not blame us.”

“We of the Red Flower Camp were established single-handedly by old General Mu, and General Mulan is his only daughter. Ma Liangcai, though you are Nascent Soul-level, you are merely one of the three generals under the royal court. How can you compare with the dignified Grand Marshal’s mansion?”

The Red Flower Camp’s soldiers spoke one after another, openly defying the decree, enraging the messenger greatly.

Ma Liangcai’s expression was icy, his gaze under a pair of white eyebrows deep and piercing.

As he looked at these soldiers who were united in purpose, he could not help recalling the scene when the monarch issued the order—

In the splendid royal hall, draperies gently swayed, and a rich fragrance filled the place.

The Twin Rivers monarch reclined on the throne, holding the Hu Concubine.

The Hu Concubine was enchanting and charming, dressed in magnificent palace attire, like a blossoming flower, incomparably beautiful.

“Your Majesty, have a taste of these grapes,” the Hu Concubine said with a lovely laugh, using her slender jade-like fingers to hold a peeled grape and bring it to the monarch’s lips.

The monarch opened his mouth, taking both the grape and the Hu Concubine’s finger inside, savoring them carefully, showing an expression of enjoyment.

“This subject, Ma Liangcai, pays respects to Your Majesty.” Ma Liangcai half-knelt on the ground, his head lowered, seeing his reflection on the mirror-like jade floor.

The monarch gave a small “hm,” still holding the Hu Concubine, glancing sideways at Ma Liangcai: “Rise and speak.”

“This subject thanks Your Majesty for your grace.” Ma Liangcai stood up, still with head lowered.

The monarch said: “I summoned you here because of the Red Flower Camp.”

“The current main general of the Red Flower Camp, Mulan, is severely injured and unconscious, unable to continue leading that army. You shall go and take it over.”

Ma Liangcai’s heart jolted; he could not help looking up: “Your Majesty, what virtue or ability do I have to take over and lead the Red Flower Camp? It is…”

The monarch impatiently interrupted: “They are the Grand Marshal’s personal troops.”

“How long has old Mu been bedridden? The position of Grand Marshal consumes much of the nation’s resources each year! It should be passed on to someone younger.”

“Taking over this army will certainly be difficult. That is exactly why I summoned you to handle it.”

“Remember, the Red Flower Camp is this nation’s army. Even though you are a Nascent Soul cultivator, you must not slaughter them arbitrarily.”

“Here.”

The monarch lightly tapped the armrest of the throne, and a beam of radiant light shot out.

Ma Liangcai hurriedly reached out with both hands and caught the light.

“You should know of the Red Flower Camp’s old affairs. This treasure will help you succeed. Use it well.”

“If you take over the Red Flower Camp, bring it back. If you fail, then go submit to the Grand General, obey his commands, and earn merits to redeem yourself.”

Ma Liangcai cupped his hands: “This subordinate obeys the command!”

The monarch waved impatiently, and Ma Liangcai swiftly withdrew from the great hall.

The monarch looked at the Hu Concubine in his arms: “My beloved concubine, this time I am following your plan. Now you should know how deeply I cherish you, right?”

The Hu Concubine smiled charmingly, pressing her soft, flower-like cheek to the Twin Rivers monarch’s chest: “My king cherishes this concubine most dearly, I know that.”

“Hahaha.” The Twin Rivers monarch laughed, holding the Hu Concubine tightly. “It is good that my beloved understands my intentions!”

Back at the Red Flower Camp.

Ma Liangcai’s eyes flashed as he withdrew from his memories, reassessing the situation at hand.

He gave a cold smile. Unlike the messenger, he did not become angry. Instead, he spoke slowly and deliberately: “Worthy of the Red Flower Camp. Even though it’s a defeated army, it still has a proud and fierce spirit. Very good, very good.”

“Do you know that by behaving this way, you place your general in an unjust position?”

“If you refuse to heed a formal transfer, outsiders will believe that the Grand Marshal’s mansion harbors ulterior motives. You should know well that the Grand Marshal’s mansion has no shortage of enemies at court, correct?”

“If these people exploit this matter, causing the monarch to misunderstand and become enraged, removing the Grand Marshal from office, then all of you would be sinners!”

Upon hearing these words, the soldiers grew restless, uneasy, and uncertain.

Ma Liangcai continued: “Your Grand Marshal’s mansion has declined to this point. You should strive to rebuild its reputation through merits and achievements!”

“General Mulan has fallen due to long-term hardship. As her subordinates, do you not know her aspirations?”

“Without a main general, will you all go into battle on your own? If you suffer another defeat, would that not bring disgrace to the Grand Marshal’s mansion?”

“Only under my leadership, by achieving military feats, can you stabilize the situation, waiting for General Mulan to awaken in the future. Wouldn’t your accomplishments at that time bring her comfort?”

The Red Flower Camp’s soldiers became even more shaken.

Shuang Jing descended from the skies: “What General Ma says is very reasonable.”

“I also agree,” Sun Gan said as he descended.

“However,” Sun Gan suddenly changed his tone, “compared to General Ma, I, Sun Gan, have spent more time with General Mulan and know the Red Flower Camp better. I am more suitable to lead this army!”

Shuang Jing said: “Before this, General Mulan had instructed me that should anything go amiss, I would take charge of the Red Flower Camp.”

Everyone was stunned.

Ning Zhuo suddenly elbowed Liu Er.

Liu Er jolted and, struck with inspiration, shouted: “How strange, General Mulan also said the same thing to me before!”

Everyone was stunned again.

Ma Liangcai’s expression grew darker. He looked at Shuang Jing and Sun Gan, then glanced at Liu Er, his gaze lingering on Liu Er’s demonic-blood traits, showing undisguised loathing and disdain.

Ma Liangcai looked to the messenger, transmitting thoughts telepathically.

The messenger shouted: “What are you three up to? General Ma Liangcai was personally appointed by the monarch to receive the Red Flower Camp! Do you have the Royal’s decree?”

Liu Er gnashed his teeth.

Sun Gan immediately said: “The imperial decree states that Ma Liangcai is appointed as a staff officer to join the Red Flower Camp, nothing more. How does that mean taking it over?”

Shuang Jing also said: “Although the Red Flower Camp is a regular army of our nation, it was created single-handedly by old General Mu and belongs to the Grand Marshal’s mansion. You, Ma Liangcai, are merely an outsider. How can you take it over?”

Ning Zhuo transmitted his thoughts telepathically, guiding Liu Er.

Liu Er gritted his teeth: “You may not know, but General Mulan and I have mutual affection, almost to the point of discussing marriage. In terms of closeness, I can be considered half a member of the Grand Marshal’s mansion.”

“The monarch is wise and cares for loyal officials. If he knew the details, he certainly would not have sent you here, Lord Ma.”

When these words emerged, everyone glared at Liu Er.

Countless gazes burned with shock and fury, as if spitting fire.

Ning Zhuo quietly moved a few steps away, distancing himself from Liu Er.

Liu Er’s breathing paused slightly. He felt an incomparably heavy pressure in the air.

Whether Ma Liangcai, the royal messenger, Shuang Jing, Sun Gan, Zhang Zhongyi, or the Red Flower Camp soldiers, all wanted to grind this outspoken Liu Er to dust.

What sort of creature are you?

A mere human-demon hybrid dares to sully General Mulan’s purity?! Dares to meddle in this political struggle? Dares to attempt to claim the Grand Marshal’s seal?

This is simply outrageous!

Who gave you such confidence?

In the tense atmosphere, Sun Gan suddenly raised his head and let out a hearty laugh: “General Liu Er has keen insight. I understand now. To be frank, General Mulan has admired me since childhood, wanting to marry me to ensure I would join the Grand Marshal’s mansion and restore its glory.”

Shuang Jing was not to be outdone: “You speak only of recent events. In fact, I have long exchanged letters with Mulan. Initially, she sought my advice on cultivation matters. Gradually, we exchanged our deepest feelings. The closeness of our relationship is difficult for the outside world to comprehend.”

“Now that Mulan is unconscious, I, as the one dearest to her heart and half a member of the Grand Marshal’s mansion, should take charge of the Red Flower Camp.”

“Ma Liangcai, you came by the monarch’s order. I won’t make it hard for you; just obediently serve as a staff officer.”

As the situation evolved to this point, only now did the Red Flower Camp’s soldiers and Zhang Zhongyi realize what was happening.

Ma Liangcai held the monarch’s order to take over the Red Flower Camp, which gave him the advantage in principle. The monarch’s reasons stated in the decree—winning the war, serving the greater good —were perfectly just.

Anyone who defied this order would be on weak ground and punished severely.

In the righteous path, one must follow the rules.

But if Liu Er, Sun Gan, Shuang Jing, and the others had private relationships with Mulan, making them effectively half-members of the Grand Marshal’s mansion…

According to the order —family first, then country, then the world —Ma Liangcai would rank behind those three.

The Red Flower Camp’s soldiers understood this and began to believe that these three generals wanted to help them, forced to fabricate secret relationships with Mulan.

They now viewed the three generals without hostility, unaware that these three each had their own designs.

They indeed intended to gain control of the Grand Marshal’s mansion!

While Ning Zhuo surveyed the entire scene, he thought: “The Twin Rivers monarch gave the order to take over the Red Flower Camp so ‘promptly.’ Mulan was only recently ambushed and fell into a coma, and Ma Liangcai immediately came.”

“In that case, it is not Shuang Jing and Sun Gan who acted against Mulan, but the upper echelons of Twin Rivers Kingdom.”

“What is the Twin Rivers monarch’s true intention? Is he the leader of this plot, or just a collaborator?”

Ning Zhuo pondered secretly.

He tried to see it from the Twin Rivers monarch’s perspective.

Taking over the Red Flower Camp and abolishing the Grand Marshal’s mansion would serve the monarch’s interests.

The monarch had strong motives.

Ning Zhuo observed Sun Gan and Shuang Jing again: “They must have gotten wind of this, known some inside information, and acted early to pressure Mulan.”

“They wanted to snatch the Red Flower Camp and the Grand Marshal’s mansion before the monarch made his move.”

“That’s why, when Ma Liangcai came, they stepped forward to block him.”

While Ning Zhuo calculated the situation, Sun Gan and Shuang Jing secretly felt relieved and looked at Liu Er with newfound respect.

They were fortunate that Liu Er reacted quickly and thought of this idea!

Liu Er, in turn, looked at Ning Zhuo, praising him in his heart: “Having a strategist by my side is truly wonderful. I have gained so much! Now that Mulan is unconscious, we three can claim whatever connections, standing in front of Ma Liangcai.”

“The brilliance lies in that if Ma Liangcai wants to expose us, he must awaken Mulan, forcing her to personally deny the secret relationships.”

“However, once Mulan awakens, it will be extremely difficult for Ma Liangcai to take over the Red Flower Camp. He would remain only a staff officer, with Mulan above him, leaving him not a shred of real power!”

As for why the Twin Rivers monarch did not simply appoint Ma Liangcai as the main general of the Red Flower Camp in the decree?

Obviously, that would violate righteous customs.

If the Twin Rivers monarch did so, it would certainly raise alarm among many families and cause severe disappointment, triggering countless pleas and remonstrations from old retainers.

And if he truly did that, he certainly would not succeed. One could confirm this by the Red Flower Camp’s reaction.

The scene was at a stalemate.

Ma Liangcai stared fixedly at Liu Er. Faced with this human-demon hybrid of Golden Core level, his hatred soared by several times.

Liu Er, seeing how far things had gone, simply met Ma Liangcai’s gaze without fear.

Shuang Jing and Sun Gan, seeing this, esteemed Liu Er more highly, feeling that this hybrid indeed had the courage of a bold warrior.

They both stared at Ma Liangcai, secretly exerting pressure.

Neither side backed down, and just when a deadlock was about to form, the tent’s curtain was suddenly lifted.

Mulan stepped out!

Both sides stared again. This time, even Ning Zhuo’s expression changed, feeling intense surprise. In an instant, he understood: “So Mulan was pretending to be unconscious!”

Mulan smiled slightly at the crowd, whose expressions had drastically changed: “Everyone, please enter the tent to talk.”
