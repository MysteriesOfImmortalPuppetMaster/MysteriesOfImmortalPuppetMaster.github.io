Chapter 814: The Illusionary True Pill Demon

A Nascent Soul-level soul!

Seeing this, Sun Lingtong was immediately startled.

Cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage were essentially the leaders or pillars of a faction. For instance, the City Lord of White Paper Immortal City and the City Lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City were both at the Nascent Soul level.

Above the Nascent Soul was the Soul Formation level. These figures generally remained in seclusion and rarely took action. Once they did, it would inevitably cause great waves and produce widespread consequences. The Lord of Forgetful River Prefecture was one such example.

A bit of life returned to the grey-robed cultivator's face. "Getting his soul wasn't easy."

"I wonder if Elder Sun knows of the 'Illusionary True Pill Demon'?"

Sun Lingtong had never heard of him. He wasn't from the Flying Cloud Kingdom originally, and to avoid leaking his background, he nodded faintly. "I’ve heard a little."

Then, he pointed at the clay jar. "Is his soul inside?"

The grey-robed cultivator sighed lightly. "It is only a remnant soul."

The Illusionary True Pill Demon had been imprisoned in the Demon Subjugation Hall for too long, barely hanging onto his last breath for a great while. He had thoroughly perished recently, and the grey-robed cultivator had spent considerable effort to acquire just this remnant soul.

Sun Lingtong nodded again. "Although it is a remnant soul, it is ultimately a Nascent Soul. I'll take it! Not bad, I look forward to you having a better quality Nascent Soul demonic soul next time."

Having already learned a harsh lesson, the grey-robed cultivator jumped in fright. He waved his hands frantically and communicated urgently via divine sense, "Elder Sun, demonic souls at the Nascent Soul level are rare. I can't guarantee I'll have one every time! No, there might only be one in ten times."

Sun Lingtong chuckled, patted the grey-robed cultivator on the shoulder, and comforted him, "Don't be so nervous, I don't eat people."

Comforted like this, the grey-robed cultivator became even more nervous.

"Alright. Let's conclude this transaction here." Sun Lingtong packed up the demonic souls, completed the payment, and left in a leisurely manner.

-----
Blue Stone Cave Abode.

Seeing the transaction was complete, Ning Zhuo withdrew most of his attention from Sun Lingtong's side.

He stroked the cave abode's jade token, activating the formation to send a message: "Old Chef, I must trouble you to make a trip to the commerce hall..."

Ning Zhuo didn't have intelligence on the Illusionary True Pill Demon either, so he immediately set about having the Old Chef buy it.

Of course, he wouldn't buy intelligence on just one person exclusively. Instead, he would acquire a batch broadly to prevent this action from becoming an obvious clue.

Sun Lingtong concealed his tracks and soon returned to the Blue Stone Cave Abode, handing the acquired cultivation resources to Ning Zhuo.

"It's a pity this Illusionary True Pill Demon is only a remnant soul; he should be skilled in alchemy. If only there were someone skilled in formations among this batch of demonic souls." Sun Lingtong was still concerned about breaking the water formation to retrieve the Luo Shu.

After a series of efforts and research, he was now only one step away.

Ning Zhuo gave a bitter laugh. "Based on my previous two experiences, it's unlikely. The quality of this batch of demonic souls is highlighted by the Nascent Soul remnant, but excluding him, the average cultivation level of the rest is actually lower than the first two times."

Speaking of which, compared to the Righteous Path, Demonic Cultivators spent significantly less energy and time on the Hundred Arts of Cultivation.

Demonic Cultivators were more adept at murder and arson.

The Hundred Arts of Cultivation were often used for business and management.

Sun Lingtong sighed. "Then let's look at the Dao-Bearing Jade Page angle."

"Wen Ruanyu is indeed reliable; he can handle pressure quite well."

"I'm actually looking forward to the moment your identity is exposed now, Little Zhuo."
Ning Zhuo nodded, understanding the implication behind Sun Lingtong's words.

Ning Zhuo's identity as the son of Meng Yaoyin and the hidden Vice City Lord of White Paper Immortal City was a secret. Once exposed, he would inevitably be sucked into a massive vortex.

Previously, Wen Ruanyu had always covered for Ning Zhuo, fearing that Ning Zhuo would lose his freedom or even his life because of it. After all, the interests involved were truly enormous.

But times had changed.

Ning Zhuo was now in the limelight, suppressing Ban Ji, Gu Qing, and others. He had gained the appreciation of the Confucian cultivator community and Zhong Dao, the Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall. His fame had already moved the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate.

To move against Ning Zhuo now, the cost would be too high, and the risk was more than a hundred times greater than when he was unknown.

Now, if Ning Zhuo's identity were exposed, his situation wouldn't be as passive as before.

In fact, if managed well, it could become an opportunity for Ning Zhuo to rise even further! At the very least, there would be more factions and mountain peaks extending olive branches than there were now.

The current situation was that everyone knew Ning Zhuo walked the Righteous Path, could emit astonishing Noble Spirit, and was deeply appreciated by Zhong Dao. He was almost destined to become a member of the Demon Subjugation Hall in the future.

Therefore, even if some factions and mountain peaks thought highly of Ning Zhuo and felt he had a bright future, they held back and wouldn't contact him privately.

After all, Zhong Dao held real power in the Demon Subjugation Hall, and his cultivation and seniority were stronger than some of the Eight Peak Masters.

Ning Zhuo publicly returning the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone was also a calculated move to improve his own standing.

The big-headed youth pondered, "Exposing my identity now should be safe, but actually, it still lacks a little spark."

Sun Lingtong grinned. "In this aspect, you are much stronger than me. Handle it well. I won't chat anymore; I'm going to the Jade Cleansing Pavilion to ponder the Luo Shu matter some more."

"Hurry up and absorb these demonic souls, see if there are any gains regarding formations."

"Also, regarding the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages, see if others can make them? At this critical juncture, spending a bit more money is fine."

Saying this, he waved his hand and slipped away.

Ning Zhuo nodded. "Mhmm. I've already sent Gongsun Yan to negotiate about the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages."

The two parted ways.

Ning Zhuo opened the clay jar and began to absorb the demonic soul's experience.

Elsewhere.

-----
Gongsun Yan arrived at a cave abode, bringing a meager gift to visit, and was received by the cave's master.

Xiao Juxia stroked his beard. "You are Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo's retainer, here to order Dao-Bearing Jade Pages? I competed on the same stage as Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, but I failed then. I witnessed Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo take the top spot with my own eyes; his elegance was striking."

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo's ability to craft Dao-Bearing Jade Pages is stronger than mine. Why entrust this to me?"

Gongsun Yan couldn't help but feel bitterness in his heart.

After accepting Ning Zhuo's task, he first sought out the few people who had successfully made paper back then. Gu Qing was naturally the first to be excluded, followed by Zhu Fenxiang.

Ning Zhuo had contacted her in advance through the statue of the True Lord of Wutu Prison, confirming that she had no intention of making Dao-Bearing Jade Pages.

Ning Zhuo wasn't surprised in the slightest.

Zhu Fenxiang didn't lack money, and she shouldered the heavy burden of the Zhu Family's Foundation Establishment prospects. Spending precious time making paper for others was almost impossible.

Ning Zhuo simply didn't want to give up on any possibility.

Gongsun Yan acted on orders and hit walls continuously.

The cultivators who had successfully made paper rejected him almost without hesitation, no matter how high a price Ning Zhuo offered.

They were willing to be friends with Ning Zhuo, but at this critical time of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, with opportunities everywhere, no one was willing to waste such a chance making paper just for some remuneration.

At this moment, facing Xiao Juxia's question, Gongsun Yan naturally knew he couldn't speak the truth.

He was actually already discouraged in his heart, treating Xiao Juxia's question as a way to ease the atmosphere in preparation for the rejection that would follow. He said, "This was instructed by my Young Master. He asked his subordinate to specifically seek out Fellow Daoist Xiao."

"Oh?" Xiao Juxia's eyes lit up. He stroked his beard again, revealing a smug smile. "Hehehe, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo has eyes like torches; he knows me."

Gongsun Yan: ?

He didn't know that Xiao Juxia had hidden his clumsiness back then. If he had shown his true strength, he would inevitably have taken first place. He had intentionally yielded, ultimately allowing Ning Zhuo to become the head of the three Confucian trials.

This secret had been pointed out by Zhao Hansheng.

Xiao Juxia thought that Ning Zhuo actually knew this too and had deliberately sent Gongsun Yan to express gratitude.

But Ning Zhuo wouldn't admit that Xiao Juxia had intentionally let him win, so he came up with the excuse of ordering Dao-Bearing Jade Pages. He used this excuse to reveal his sentiments.

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo is thoughtful." Xiao Juxia stroked his beard, beaming with a smile.

Gongsun Yan: ??

How did he have eyes like torches?

How was he thoughtful?

Gongsun Yan couldn't help but think, "What did Young Master Ning Zhuo do? Did he make arrangements in advance?!"

Thinking of this, Gongsun Yan's spirit suddenly lifted.

The next moment, Xiao Juxia took out a stack of Dao-Bearing Jade Pages. "These were hastily crafted by me. The quality is not great, so I dare not sell them. Just consider them a meager gift for Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo."

He excelled in artifact refining. Having intentionally yielded before, his hands had long been itching.

Upon returning to his cave abode, he had started working immediately, making over a dozen sheets in one go, thoroughly satisfying his craving.

Gongsun Yan: "Ah?!"

He subconsciously extended both hands, receiving the dozen or so Dao-Bearing Jade Pages, sudden realization dawning in his heart: "I understand now. No wonder the Young Master gave me this task. It turns out he had foreseen or arranged all of this long ago!"

-----
Blue Stone Cave Abode.

Ning Zhuo had a splitting headache.

The life experiences of the [Illusionary True Pill Demon] Jia Luanzhen flashed rapidly before his eyes.

Tenth birthday.

In the Jia family ancestral hall, where candlelight flickered, twelve carved red candles had just been lit. Little Jia Luanzhen, wearing a brand-new pill-patterned brocade robe, was kneeling to worship the ancestral tablets. The air was filled with the scent of century-old medicine and the sweetness of birthday cakes.

Suddenly, a miserable scream came from outside the door!

The mysterious powerful enemies came too fast, too fiercely, and in great numbers.

The Jia family had no power to fight back.

"Quick, Little Zhen, hide inside, and don't make a sound!" His mother tore off the talisman jade she wore close to her body, stuffed it into Jia Luanzhen's arms, and then closed the medicine cabinet.

The inside of the medicine cabinet was dim, carved with many talismans beneficial for preserving medicinal herbs.

Jia Luanzhen was hiding in a secret compartment, where the talismans were mostly for concealment and hiding.

Sounds from the outside became blurred. Jia Luanzhen was scared silly, his whole body trembling, a bone-piercing cold making even his soul shiver.

Through the cabinet door's ventilation hole, he saw his mother pierced through the throat by a sword. The masked leader walked past, carrying his father's severed head.

The enemies rummaged through chests and cabinets.

"Search quickly!"

"Found it, found it. It's the Hundred Grass Truth Manual!"

"I found this too, it's the Pill Vein Growth Secret, hahaha."

Jia Luanzhen suffered in terror, listening to the sounds of his enemies ransacking, the arguments over dividing the loot, and the crackling of the fire they set to burn everything before leaving.

It wasn't until late at night on the seventh day, when all was silent, that he dared to push open the cabinet door.

The medicine cabinet, having reached its limit, completely fell apart the next moment.

Before his eyes lay the ruins of scorched black houses and the corpses of his kin strewn everywhere. Ten-year-old Jia Luanzhen walked through it all like a mechanical puppet. His tears had long since run dry, leaving only numbness.

...

On a nameless deserted island, the Phantom Sea Old Man coughed blood, stuffing an oilcloth packet into the youth's arms. The sea breeze blew the old man's white hair, revealing three eerie black pill poison veins on his neck.

"Remember," the old man spat blood with every word, "pills have no righteousness or evil, only the human heart has good and evil. True pills can kill, and fake pills... can also save people."

After speaking, he breathed his last.

The youth, Jia Luanzhen, stood dazed for a moment before letting out a mournful wail: "Master!!"

He knelt on the ground, throwing himself onto the old man's not-yet-cold body. The rough oilcloth packet fell open, and the jade slip recording the Fake Pill Nine Essentials inside reflected a cold glint in the sunlight.

...

Medicine King Valley.

Jia Luanzhen, who had joined and become an entry-level disciple, searched quickly in the pharmacy.

Suddenly, his movements froze.

The magic technique he secretly maintained proved to him: the batch of medicinal herbs before his eyes belonged to his Jia family.

He clutched a pill, a silent roar in his heart: "How absurd!"

"So, the power that slandered my Jia family for making fake pills and medicine was actually the orthodox faction, Medicine King Valley!"

"My father merely exposed the truth of their fake pills, and unexpectedly, the Medicine King Valley came to exterminate us in secret."

"Hehehe, good, good, good!"

Jia Luanzhen laughed wildly in the depths of his heart.

Amidst the laughter, his resolve for revenge became as solid as a mountain of iron.

...

A cultivator knelt on the ground, begging bitterly for Jia Luanzhen's pill.

"Senior, I have a token, I have a token!" the cultivator shouted, his face full of panic and urgency.

Jia Luanzhen took the token. "This is the healing pill you want."

After the cultivator took it, his injuries healed visibly, and his aura returned to its peak. He bowed in ecstasy: "Thank you, Senior, for bestowing the pill! I will definitely repay this kindness!"

Three days later, the cultivator's injuries relapsed, and he died bleeding from his seven orifices.

Jia Luanzhen squatted beside the corpse, observing the death process carefully with a calm face, pondering in his heart: "Still missing a little something. to deceive the Valley Master of Medicine King Valley, it still lacks a bit of realism."

"But, it's only missing that little bit."

...

The Myriad Pill Assembly was the largest pill trading event in the cultivation world.

On the Medicine King Valley's display stand, a "Nine Revolutions Nascent Soul Pill" floated inside a crystal cover. Nine golden veins flowed across the pill's body, emitting a Dao rhyme that made Nascent Soul cultivators' hearts palpitate.

Many cultivators rushed towards it like ducks, competing to bid.

The auction price rose with the tide, just about to reach its climax.

Suddenly, someone screamed sharply: "Wait, everyone, this is a fake pill, it's fake!"

...

Ning Zhuo opened his eyes exhaustedly, finding his whole body soaked in cold sweat.

"Illusionary True Pill Demon, Jia Luanzhen..." the big-headed youth murmured.

This procurement of demonic souls had yielded Jia Luanzhen as the greatest harvest. The other demonic souls were lackluster.

Combining this with the purchased intelligence, Ning Zhuo now had a comprehensive and profound understanding of Jia Luanzhen.

Born into the Hundred Grass Jia Family, his family had made a living distinguishing the authenticity of medicinal herbs for generations. His father exposed Medicine King Valley's fake pill business, inviting the calamity of extermination from Medicine King Valley. Jia Luanzhen narrowly escaped, became a beggar, wandered for three thousand li, and was trafficked overseas.

There, he was taken in as a pill boy by the "Phantom Sea Old Man". The latter saw Jia Luanzhen's talent and taught him the basic arts of phantom pills.

The Phantom Sea Old Man was hunted by enemies and passed his life's research, the Fake Pill Nine Essentials, to Jia Luanzhen before dying.

After Jia Luanzhen mastered it, he returned to the mainland, obtained clues, and infiltrated Medicine King Valley to confirm the identity of his enemies. Through various means, not only did he succeed in his revenge, but he also learned all of Medicine King Valley's pill arts.

After that, he traveled the cultivation world under different identities, selling fake pills to seventeen Super Sects successively, accumulating resources.

He frequently brought forth new ideas. The fake pills he made and sold caused suffering to countless cultivators, gradually inciting public outrage.

Jia Luanzhen was constantly hunted and pursued. eventually defeated and injured, he ended up in the cages of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

In the absolute end, his remnant soul was absorbed by Ning Zhuo, becoming nourishment for another's cultivation.

"I didn't expect such an alchemy technique." Ning Zhuo felt quite surprised.

Jia Luanzhen excelled at creating fake pills, which opened Ning Zhuo's eyes.

"To create outstanding fake pills, one must research real pills in exhaustive detail. Therefore, Jia Luanzhen's knowledge is extremely broad, dabbling in countless pill recipes."

"Once I digest all this, my alchemy ability will inevitably improve by leaps and bounds!"

At this moment, Gongsun Yan returned to report, carrying over a dozen Dao-Bearing Jade Pages.

"Good! Truly a double blessing." Ning Zhuo was pleasantly surprised.
