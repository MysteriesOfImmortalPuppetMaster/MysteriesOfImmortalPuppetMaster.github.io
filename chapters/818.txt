Chapter 818: The Ruined Temple

Hearing Gu Huaijiu’s response - that he was determined to exact revenge even at the cost of death - Ning Zhuo was slightly shaken.

In this moment, his understanding of Gu Huaijiu suddenly deepened significantly. The man before him appeared to be living in the present, but his heart and soul were still immersed in the past. He would not hesitate to burn himself to ash if it meant slaughtering his enemies. And without a doubt, this act of vengeance was also killing him.

Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly. "Among the hundred arts of cultivation, there may not be a lack of methods that can resolve the threat of the Demonic Seed within you, Fellow Daoist Gu, while still preserving your combat strength."

Gu Huaijiu replied, "Perhaps there are."

He didn't care.

As long as he killed all his enemies, it didn't matter how he ended up.

It was just that his current strength was insufficient. Relying solely on himself, he could not eradicate the remaining few enemies. That was why he had joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect - to gain new power.

Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment. "Perhaps my proposal is a bit abrupt, but could Fellow Daoist Gu show me the Demonic Seed?"

Gu Huaijiu was slightly stunned.

The proposal was indeed abrupt, even presumptuous.

But seeing Ning Zhuo's sincere gaze, Gu Huaijiu did not immediately refuse. Instead, he fell into hesitation.

What surfaced in his mind was another scene - that soaring Noble Spirit, shooting straight into the clouds and deeply imprinted between heaven and earth.

How could a Righteous Path cultivator with such Noble Spirit harbor malicious intent toward me?

If I cannot even trust a figure like this, then there are likely very few people in this world worthy of trust.

Moreover...

Moreover, Gu Huaijiu had just asked Ning Zhuo to assist in ending his life should it become necessary.

He was the one asking for a favor first.

Ning Zhuo’s proposal was likely just a genuine desire to help him.

He definitely wants to help me! Gu Huaijiu convinced himself.

He decided to reveal his Demonic Seed.

"Since Fellow Daoist Ning is offering his wholehearted assistance, how could I, Gu, fail to appreciate it? It would be more direct for Fellow Daoist Ning to inspect it personally."

After saying this, he actually withdrew his defensive measures, opened his arms slightly, and allowed Ning Zhuo to investigate freely.

This display of openness caused Ning Zhuo to pause, followed by a wave of emotion.

He and Gu Huaijiu were meeting for the first time and collaborating for the first time, yet Gu Huaijiu trusted him this much.

Ning Zhuo knew Gu Huaijiu’s intelligence reports well. He was very clear that with Gu Huaijiu’s life experiences, he was absolutely not a fool who trusted others lightly. The only reason was that Gu Huaijiu viewed Ning Zhuo in a special light.

Ning Zhuo took this heavy trust to heart. His expression became solemn as he immediately extended his Divine Sense and spiritual energy to investigate the state of Gu Huaijiu’s body.

Very quickly, Ning Zhuo’s brows knit together, furrowing deeper and deeper.

A moment later, Ning Zhuo withdrew his Divine Sense and retracted his spiritual energy. He looked at Gu Huaijiu with a grave expression. "Fellow Daoist Gu, your condition is extremely serious. The Demonic Seed has infringed upon your entire body. It is practically bound to your life, inseparable."

"I am ashamed to say that, as I am now, I am completely helpless."

Ning Zhuo gave a bitter smile.

Gu Huaijiu patted his shoulder, about to comfort him.

However, Ning Zhuo changed the subject. "Unless I become familiar with the roots of this Demonic Art. Only then can I understand it thoroughly and prescribe the right remedy."

Gu Huaijiu said, "Fellow Daoist Ning specializes in the Qi Sea Middle Dantian. There is no need to waste your precious time and energy researching an irrelevant Demonic Art for my sake."

"Gu thanks you here and now!"

"But if, due to Gu's personal affairs, a genius like Fellow Daoist Ning were to delay his cultivation steps, it would truly be a loss to the Myriad Manifestations Sect and a detriment to the Righteous Path of the world."

"This is something Gu is extremely unwilling to see."

Gu Huaijiu wanted to avenge his grievances, but at the same time, he did not want to owe favors. He didn't even care about his own life, so he truly didn't want Ning Zhuo to go to such lengths to help him.

In the depths of Ning Zhuo's heart, however, there were other thoughts. Figuring out this Demonic Art isn't actually hard.

Finding a demonic cultivator who practices this art, seizing their soul, and obtaining their cultivation experience and insights wouldn't be hard either.

That way, I could gain insight into the roots of the Demonic Art extremely quickly. If I'm lucky and encounter an expert practicing this art, I could even improve upon it.

The only obstacle lies in the 'prescribing the right remedy' stage.

This stage required Ning Zhuo’s medical skills.

Medicine was also one of the hundred arts of cultivation.

It was different from alchemy. Often, healing a cultivator required the use of different methods; concocting pills and taking medicine was only one of them. Using sword qi to perform surgery was also quite common. Sometimes one had to treat illnesses of the heart/mind, which usually required Divine Arts.

For a moment, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel an interest in learning medicine.

This wasn't the first time.

Back when he met Zhang Zhongyi in the Two Note Kingdom, he had the idea of learning medicine to treat the Buddhist Doctor, Meng Yaoyin.

Cultivation techniques are as vast as the open sea, broad and profound.

Medicine... I have to learn it too!

He continued to challenge the trial.

Mist drifted, brushing his face and obscuring his vision. Ning Zhuo was alone once more.

He continued to step forward, but his mind was still on Gu Huaijiu.

This cultivator gave Ning Zhuo a different perspective.

This was exactly the purpose of his travels through the world - to see different cultivators and different ways of living, thereby verifying his own path.

Ning Zhuo thought of the Demonic Seed again. The Demon Subjugation Hall definitely knows Gu Huaijiu harbors a Demonic Seed, yet they didn't mind it and directly accepted him, giving him a chance at the trial.

So, even a Demonic Seed can be righteous if used for righteousness. Gu Huaijiu's past actions have verified his alignment. Even though he is determined to take revenge, he has never implicated the innocent.

Gu Huaijiu joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect must be for the sake of revenge. His remaining mortal enemies must be powerful, not people he can handle alone at this stage.

He would likely face difficulties joining other sects. But the Myriad Manifestations Sect is not like that; its gates are always open. This spirit of embracing all rivers like the ocean is truly impressive, worthy of the position of the number one sect in the Flying Cloud Kingdom!

Ning Zhuo put away his wandering thoughts. As he walked, he focused on the current trial.
The Blood Village was the first level. For a cultivator to uphold justice, they must overcome the arrogance in their heart and treat mortals with caution.

The Demonic Seed was the second level. To succeed, a cultivator needs to resist the pressure of competition and the selfishness of striving for victory.

Calculating this way, the Demon Subjugation Hall's second test isn't just to test whether a cultivator's many methods can uphold the Righteous Path. It is simultaneously testing the cultivator's character.

These two trials seem to be telling me - often, to execute justice, one must first defeat oneself.

Carrying this realization, Ning Zhuo formally entered the third level.

Before him was a ruined temple. The dark red mist was thicker here than in the first level, the Blood Village. Blood-colored dewdrops, almost condensed into substance, hung in the air. With every breath, one could feel a sticky, blood-like warmth.

"Brother Ning Zhuo!" A crisp call made Ning Zhuo turn around.

In the next moment, he saw Yun Niaoniao walking out from the mist on the other side.

There was a clear light in Yun Niaoniao’s eyes as she walked up quickly. Her plain white dress had been stained with mottled dark red by the blood mist, yet it did not diminish her gentle and peaceful temperament in the slightest.

"I've finally run into Brother Ning." There was a hint of relief and anticipation in Yun Niaoniao’s tone. "With you by my side for this trial, Niaoniao's heart feels much more settled."

"Fellow Daoist Niaoniao." Just as Ning Zhuo was about to speak further, another figure emerged from the smoke and clouds.

The newcomer wore a green shirt washed pale with age. Hanging at his waist was a scabbardless long sword; the blade was dim, yet a faint suggestion of Noble Spirit flowed within it.

His face was lean, appearing about forty years old. His temples were slightly gray, but his eyes were as clear as a spring. As he walked, he carried an air of openness, and the surrounding blood mist could not approach within three inches of him.

"Lu Xu'an greets the two Fellow Daoists." The newcomer cupped his hands, his voice peaceful yet carrying a clarity like the ringing of a sword.

Ning Zhuo returned the greeting, understanding dawning in his heart - this was the "Upright Sword" Lu Xu'an mentioned in the pre-trial intelligence. He was a former True Disciple of the Azure Cloud Sword Sect who had damaged his own Dao foundation by severing a spirit vein to protect mortals.

The three of them already knew each other's background information. After a simple exchange, they reached an agreement to cooperate.

With Ning Zhuo in front and Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu'an on the flanks, they entered the ruined temple together.

The interior of the ruined temple was cramped, crowded with seven people - no, six living people, and one whose aura was already faint.

The most conspicuous was a Foundation Establishment cultivator lying in the corner. Dressed in the Demon Subjugation Hall's uniform, he had a wound on his chest so deep the bone was visible. Although simply bandaged, dark red blood was still seeping out. His face was pale, and he was unconscious, with only a thread of breath remaining. His condition was extremely critical.

Three children huddled in another corner. The oldest was no more than seven or eight, the youngest only four or five. Their eyes were frantic, and meaningless roars escaped their mouths. Their hands clawed incessantly at their own skin, which was already marked with bloody scratches. A female cultivator was casting a calming spell, but she could barely maintain it. The slightest lapse in concentration would cause the three children to have a total outbreak, losing their minds completely, beyond recovery.

Two able-bodied villagers had collapsed in the center. Their faces were greenish-black, their breathing rapid. The blood vessels on their chests bulged and throbbed like earthworms; clearly, the blood mist had eroded them deeply, and they could undergo full demonization at any moment.

Finally, leaning against the stone wall was a middle-aged man in black clothes. His eyes were half-closed, and his hands were bound by specially made restrictive chains. A faint, almost imperceptible sneer hung on the corner of his mouth. Although his face was pale, the blood mist seemed to affect him the least; instead, it formed a faint halo around him.

Information transmitted via Divine Sense arrived simultaneously in the Divine Seas of Ning Zhuo, Yun Niaoniao, and Lu Xu'an, informing them of the details.

The man bound by chains was an evil cultivator, an informant developed by the Demon Subjugation Hall's cultivators. He held key clues regarding the original body of the Blood Mist Demonic Seed.

The unconscious Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator, cooperating with a passing female cultivator righteous volunteer, had accidentally discovered the Demonic Seed Original Body, but it had managed to flee. In the end, the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator had barely managed to rescue a few mortals, paying a heavy price and falling into a dying state.

There was a strict restriction for this level: Ning Zhuo and the others were not allowed to use their own items, spells, or other methods.

Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes slightly, suspicion rising in his heart. "In the previous Demonic Seed level, the Divine Sense transmission had clear requirements. But this level has none. Are we supposed to act freely?"

Yun Niaoniao frowned. "If we cannot use our own power, how are we different from mortals?"

Lu Xu'an pondered, "This likely requires us to pool our wisdom and efforts. As for the restriction, in my view, it implies we must make full use of the existing resources. There should be clues or key items on their bodies, right?"

Ning Zhuo nodded; Lu Xu'an's view aligned with his own.

Hearing this analysis, Yun Niaoniao’s eyes lit up. She stepped forward first to speak with the female cultivator.

The female cultivator didn't know much, but she was willing to actively cooperate with the trio.

Eventually, Ning Zhuo and the others scavenged three items from the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator, the evil cultivator informant, and the mortals.

An emerald-green medicinal pill emitting an aura of vitality; a pale gold protective talisman with complex patterns; and a flask of clear spirit liquid, enough to fill about three small cups.

Lu Xu'an fell into a dilemma. "The colleague from the Demon Subjugation Hall is heavily injured and needs the medicinal pill to sustain his life. The three children have had their minds eroded by the blood mist; if the spirit liquid isn't used to cleanse their divine souls, they will go completely mad within an hour at most. Those two villagers... the blood mist has already invaded their heart meridians. Fortunately, the protective talisman can help them delay for a period of time, buying a chance for treatment."

He paused, looking at the black-clothed middle-aged man. "This person is the evil cultivator informant. He has some kind of protective secret technique in his body, so the blood mist affects him the least..."

The black-clothed middle-aged man looked at Lu Xu'an. "Let me go! And I'll give you the information on the Demonic Seed Original Body. I know where it ran off to!"

Ning Zhuo and the other two looked at each other.

This was the first time the black-clothed man had spoken. Just now, when Lu Xu'an searched his entire body, he hadn't said a word, nor had he struggled.

The black-clothed man's gaze fixed on the pale gold protective talisman. "That is my talisman! Without it, I couldn't have made it through such thick blood mist. Give it back to me, let me go, and I will tell you the clue immediately."

"Heh, you don't have much time."

"In a little while, the Demonic Seed Original Body is going to run away. Your Demon Subjugation Hall has spent so many years and so much manpower, and you're on the verge of catching the Original Body."

"The Original Body has been heavily wounded; it will definitely go into hiding. If you want to catch it in the future, it will be difficult beyond measure!"

Ning Zhuo remained silent and deep in thought.

The black-clothed man's words made the situation even more complex.

The resources for treatment were limited.

If they let the black-clothed man go, the resources would be even more limited - clearly insufficient to save everyone.

This was forcing Ning Zhuo and the other two to make a difficult choice - who to sacrifice, and who to save.

At the same time, the matter of the Demonic Seed Original Body had to be taken seriously.

Ning Zhuo sent a Divine Sense transmission to the two of them: "This level only has restrictions, no standards for passing. But I feel we had best obtain this key clue."

Lu Xu'an immediately agreed. "This is a trial of the Demon Subjugation Hall. On the surface, there are no passing standards, but in reality, it is already clear. We must exercise the Righteous Path and uphold justice!"

"The matter of the Demonic Seed Original Body is of grave importance; it is the source of calamity and sin. If we let it go, we are disregarding the bigger picture."

"But..."

Lu Xu'an looked at the two unconscious middle-aged villagers, the three frantic children, the dying Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator, and the female cultivator barely maintaining her spell. For a moment, he fell into extreme difficulty.

He was hailed as the Upright Sword. He once couldn't bear to see mortals suffer in their lives and lives due to the battles of immortal cultivators. Knowing that the fighting was hard to quell, he severed the spirit vein with a single strike, leaving nothing for the various parties to fight over. However, his own cultivation was greatly damaged, his Dao foundation injured, and he was ultimately expelled from his sect.

Without a doubt, Lu Xu'an possessed a spirit of self-sacrifice.

Similarly, Yun Niaoniao was the same; she held deep sympathy for mortals.

If not for this, the two of them would not have passed the first level, the Blood Village.

But at this moment, their qualities of sacrifice, benevolence, and sympathy had become obstacles and weaknesses.
