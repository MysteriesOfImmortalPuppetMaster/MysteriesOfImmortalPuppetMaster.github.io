Chapter 648: Storming the Altar Battlefield

At that moment, Ning Zhuo recalled Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's parting words.

She had told him that her decision to gather these spoils before leaving stemmed from a sudden spiritual intuition, a premonition that these items might prove crucial to him.

"My mother was also a master of divination."

"I fear her earlier predictions are coming true here!"

This realization bolstered Ning Zhuo's confidence.

He commanded the Light Goose to retrieve half of the Return to Silence Path Candle.

This was easily accomplished, but the candle remained unlit, rendering it as useful as a stone.

"The Light Goose's power seems to be about disintegration, not ignition."

"I need a candlewick and a flame."

"Do I even have a candlewick?"

Ning Zhuo scanned the pile of spoils given to him by Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin, but found no trace of a candlewick.

"Did I fail to collect it? Or..."

The candlewick of the Return to Silence Path Candle was made from a yellowish-brown shroud, intertwined with strands of a woman's black hair in a spiral pattern.

After being subjected to the power of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, it had been separated into shroud and hair.

Ning Zhuo had gathered many fragmented materials, including these two.

But he wasn't the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, and thus didn't know which of these fragments were originally part of the Candlewick.

"Even if I knew, it would be of no use."

"These materials must have been refined through some spell."

"And I have no way of knowing that refining method. Even if I did, do I have the time to re-refine them at this stage?"

For a moment, Ning Zhuo was stumped.

"Could I plant the Fire Seed?"

Ning Zhuo possessed the Fire Seed Fire Within Wood, a major spoil of war he had acquired during his campaign against the Ten-Li Burning Forest in the Thousand Peaks Forest of the Two Note Kingdom.

With a Fire Seed, he could undoubtedly ignite the candle body.

But any Fire Seed was extraordinarily rare, and Fire Within Wood was even more precious as a component of the Samadhi Divine Fire.

Ning Zhuo was a man of resolve, never hesitant to make sacrifices in critical moments.

"But the problem is, Fire Within Wood is a fire from wood, a human fire. In the Ten-Li Burning Forest, they used human fire as a seed. On the surface, they refined various magic artifacts, but in reality, they were collecting the collective incense offerings to refine the Fire Crown Divine Cedar."

"The body of the Return to Silence Path Candle clearly leans towards yin and ghostly attributes, fundamentally different from human fire, and may even conflict with it."

Ning Zhuo was faced with a critical decision.

Choosing incorrectly would mean that adding the Fire Seed wouldn't activate the candle's effects; instead, the Fire Seed and the candle's body would consume each other in a mutual depletion, causing both to be lost. This would cost Ning Zhuo his last chance to disrupt the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's grand scheme.

Noticing Ning Zhuo's hesitation, Qing Chi asked with concern, "Little Ma, do you want to light this candle?"

"I can help. You can use my fire."

Ning Zhuo looked at Qing Chi, a thought stirring within him. Her Azure Flame was indeed immensely powerful, containing a profound vitality. This vitality was mysterious because this flame could heal Ghostmen cultivators—a fact that had been proven repeatedly on the Altar Battlefield.

Ghostmen bodies coexisted with both vital and death qi. Conventional healing spells, which simply stimulated vital qi, were harmful to them. Intense vital qi could suppress and expel death qi, disrupting the fundamental composition of their bodies and leading to worse results.

The Azure Flame, however, avoided this problem.

Ning Zhuo was still unaware of Azure Flame's true nature. He had asked Qing Chi about it before.

Qing Chi, being completely honest with Ning Zhuo, revealed that she herself knew almost nothing about Azure Flame, except that it manifested from her innate talent.

As for what kind of innate talent it was, she had no idea.

She told Ning Zhuo that after her innate talent was revealed, her father, Qing Yan, had secretly investigated it extensively but found nothing conclusive. It was highly likely that it represented a completely new type of innate talent.

This was entirely possible.

In the early days of the Cultivation World, innate talents were virtually unheard of. It wasn't until a certain stage of development that they began to appear in large numbers. As various innate talents became widely known, new ones would inevitably emerge.

Qing Chi might well be an example of this phenomenon.

"Qing Chi is a Ghostman, and her innate talent, at its core, is compatible with the Ghostmen's nature, able to coexist harmoniously with it."

"The bodies of Ghostmen contain Death Qi, and in fact, Death Qi makes up half of their composition. This is precisely why Ghostmen can naturally survive in both the Living Realm and the Underworld."

"In contrast, Humans, under normal circumstances, are filled only with Life Qi. Only those suffering from severe illness, grave injuries, or near death possess significant amounts of Death Qi."

Ning Zhuo silently pondered, concluding that the Azure Flame might be more suitable than the Fire Within Wood.

"Which one is truly correct?"

"Or could there be another option?"

Ning Zhuo unconsciously touched the mechanism ring on his index finger.

Regardless of which option he silently willed, the ring remained unresponsive.

"Are both options viable? Or..." Ning Zhuo instinctively looked up at the sky, his brow furrowing with worry.

"Young Master," Luo Si gently reminded him from the side.

Ning Zhuo startled, realizing he had been delaying his decision for too long.

Delay invites change!

"Jiao Ma, let my girl come," Qing Yan suddenly said.

Ning Zhuo focused his gaze on him. Qing Yan met his stare without flinching, his eyes brimming with confidence.

A realization struck Ning Zhuo. He turned to Qing Chi. "You come."

Qing Chi giggled and leaped forward, landing before Ning Zhuo. Without hesitation, she channeled the Azure Flame onto the candle body.

The Azure Flame burned brilliantly, initially a deep azure hue. But as the candle body melted, it transformed into a frosty white fire, radiating a biting chill.

"It worked!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed, overjoyed.

The others cheered as well. They would never forget this candle flame.

As expected, the pervasive chill gave rise to drifting white frost, beginning to distort the surrounding space.

Ning Zhuo dared not delay. With decisive control over the Light Goose, he plunged headlong into the impenetrable wall of turbid qi.

The Light Goose's power shattered the turbid qi barrier, while the burning of the Return to Silence Path Candle formed a temporary passage upon its foundation.

This was a pitch-black, winding path. On either side, countless overlapping ghostly figures gathered, resembling a procession of hundreds of ghosts carrying a coffin.

A Lone Wild Goose Carries a Candle to Pierce the Heavens—it had succeeded!

The Qing-Jiao Army erupted in cheers, their voices shaking the heavens.

"Indeed! He is the savior of White Paper Immortal City, my lifelong sovereign!" Luo Si's heart trembled violently, though his expression remained stoic.

Jiao Ma's biological father was so overcome with emotion that his entire body went numb.

Qing Chi cheered, "Amazing! Little Ma, you're incredible!"

Ning Zhuo turned to her, his smile radiant. "Qingqing, you've been a tremendous help."

Having been acknowledged by her beloved, Qing Chi thrust her hands on her hips and burst into hearty laughter.

Qing Yan hesitated, his gaze complex.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God was dumbfounded!

What... what kind of thing is this?

He had never imagined that his most cautious defensive strategy would backfire, becoming a fatal blow to himself.

Had they known this would happen, they would have been better off relying on the protective barrier of the Grand Formation.

"Qingqing, we need to incorporate Luo Si into our command structure," Ning Zhuo ordered immediately.

Qing Chi nodded emphatically.

"Luo Si, you're in command," Ning Zhuo said, showing unwavering trust in his subordinate.

A wave of gratitude washed over Luo Si at this trust. Maintaining his composure, he promptly ordered the entire army to advance.

The Qing-Jiao Army surged down the Curved Path, charging toward the Core of the Altar.

"That's... the Sacrificial Altar!"

"We've reached the heart of the matter!"

"Hahaha! Follow Young Master Jiao Ma and secure this decisive victory!"

The sight of the colossal Altar galvanized the Qing-Jiao Army's morale.

"Damn it!" The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God nearly gnashed his teeth in fury.

Forced by circumstances, he had no choice but to temporarily abandon his efforts to erode the Ice Coffin and confront the Qing-Jiao Army head-on.

Soul Formation-level!

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God made no attempt to conceal his overwhelming aura, sending a shudder through the entire Qing-Jiao Army.

We didn't expect such a formidable opponent!

How are we going to fight this?

Even with a Cultivation army, their opponent was a Soul Formation-level entity!

The cultivation gap was simply too vast.

A force like the Qing-Jiao Army alone could never hope to bridge such a divide.

"Stay in the passage and channel all your military might to me!" Luo Si, realizing the gravity of the situation, gritted his teeth and charged forward to confront the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and the others were still far from reaching the Soul Formation-level.

Even with the leverage of military might, they couldn't bridge this gap. After all, the Qing-Jiao Army was still a new force!

In truth, even if they commanded the world's most powerful army, with enough military might to potentially propel someone to the Soul Formation-level, Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi would still be unable to withstand such overwhelming external power.

Their physical bodies, souls, dantians, and all their foundational reserves were still constrained by their cultivation levels, unable to bear such immense external force.

Luo Si shot forward like lightning, meeting the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God head-on in mid-air!

Boom!

A thunderous explosion shook the air. The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God remained in place, retreating only a single step, while Luo Si was sent flying backward.

Luo Si's entire body trembled with numbness, his clashing fist completely numb and devoid of sensation.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God stood nearly ten meters tall, his body a pitch-black mass, resembling a mountain carved from the most ancient Profound Iron.

The massive, sinewy muscles resembled a dried-up riverbed cracked after millennia, each groove deep and profound, radiating an overwhelming sense of weight and power.

Thick, dark-red veins, like streams of molten lava trapped deep beneath the earth, were faintly visible.

Even this appearance alone was enough to instill awe and intimidation in onlookers.

"Divided Spirit!"

Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and the others widened their eyes.

Even geniuses like them were witnessing a Soul Formation-level existence for the first time.

Luo Si's expression turned unprecedentedly grave. A single direct clash had made him acutely aware of the vast gap between them.

"Young Master, I can't hold out much longer," he transmitted telepathically to Ning Zhuo while summoning a bronze war chariot.

Climbing onto the chariot, Luo Si charged toward the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Their fierce clashes sent shockwaves through the air, each impact like a meteor striking the earth, generating terrifying sonic booms that shook the surroundings.

With the assistance of the war chariot, a magic treasure, Luo Si compensated for the disparity in physical strength.

However, the Qing-Jiao Army's faces darkened as their Qi began to wane.

This war chariot consumed military might rather than spiritual energy, making it a weapon. While spiritual energy could amplify its power, military might had the opposite effect.

Fighting against a Soul Formation-level opponent drained military might at a terrifying rate.

The Qing-Jiao Army, though rested and in good condition, could barely hold out after a few rounds of combat.

This forced Qing Chi to prematurely reveal her trump card and mobilize the Military Seed's stored Military Logistics.

With supplies already dwindling, they were now being rapidly depleted to compensate for the massive drain on military might, preventing the entire army from collapsing immediately.

Luo Si drove the bronze war chariot, circling the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

After another collision, the chariot retreated over a dozen paces, its surface riddled with cracks.

On the chariot, Luo Si staggered, nearly falling.

Seizing the opportunity, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God abruptly raised his Profound Iron giant arm.

Martial Art—Mountain-Crushing Fist!

There was no flashy spell glow, only the simplest, most direct punch.

The filthy air before him compressed into a surging wall of qi.

Space groaned under the unbearable strain.

Dark crimson lava veins surged across the surface of the Turbid Filth God's fist, accelerating rapidly and infusing the punch with terrifying heat.

Luo Si felt a chill in his heart. His combat experience told him at a glance that he must avoid this strike at all costs.

Military Tactic: Covertly Advance While Appearing to Retreat!

He feigned turning the chariot toward his allies, then abruptly retreated.

Thud.

The Turbid Filth God's punch, though formidable, struck empty air.

Luo Si had escaped disaster, but his brow furrowed with grave concern. The bronze chariot, now heavily damaged, had lost much of its speed and defense, making it increasingly difficult to engage the Turbid Filth God in prolonged combat.

Amidst the chaos, Luo Si glanced at the corridor and noticed the dire state of the Qing-Jiao Army.

"This New Army is still too weak. Their combined strength barely suffices to operate this chariot."

Had he commanded a fully manned Imperial Guard, he was confident he could have leveraged their collective military might to amplify his own combat power, allowing him to exchange blows with the Turbid Filth God for multiple rounds.

But now, he understood he could only rely on himself.

With a fierce shout, Luo Si channeled a massive surge of Nascent Soul spiritual energy into the chariot beneath him.

Buzz!

The war chariot radiated bronze light, runes across its body shimmering with flowing halos. Suddenly, it executed an extreme sideways drift, carrying Luo Si as it smoothly evaded the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's punch.

Boom!

The Mountain-Crushing Fist grazed the rear of the war chariot, crashing down with a thunderous impact.

Crack!

The mere brush of the fist's pressure caused the war chariot's rear to emit a heart-stopping crack of shattering metal!

The bronze radiance instantly dimmed.

Luo Si felt as if he'd been struck by a hammer, a suffocating pressure crushing his chest.

In this situation, I can only take the offensive and fight for time, he thought, suppressing the shock. A fierce glint flashed in his eyes; he knew that passive evasion would only lead to death!

He cast out his fishing rod, adorned with the Netherworld Ferrying Line and the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook.

Activating his fishing technique, the fish hook moved with extraordinary agility, the fishing line darting lightning-fast around the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

In the next instant, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God was bound tightly by the fishing line.

Luo Si poured every ounce of his spiritual energy into the line, which suddenly contracted, driving the hooks deep into the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's body.

The fish hook soared through the air, plummeting straight toward the forehead of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

The god writhed in place, thick black smoke billowing from the holes in his skull.

The smoke coalesced into a cloud, intercepting the fish hook.

Crack... Crack...

Luo Si's expression shifted slightly.

The fish hook and line remained intact, but fine cracks spiderwebbed across the fishing rod.

"Luo Si isn't a match for this Divided Spirit!"

"I must seize every moment to reach the Sacrificial Altar and utterly destroy the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme."

Ning Zhuo had already begun to move.

But though the altar stood plainly before him, he was forced to halt.

The river surged.

He was blocked by a tributary of the Forgetful River.

This tributary, shimmering like a jade ribbon, encircled the altar. Whenever Ning Zhuo attempted to breach it from any angle, the water flowed to that point, creating an obstacle.

"This is water from the Forgetful River. How can I cross it?" Forced to stop, Ning Zhuo racked his brain for a solution.
