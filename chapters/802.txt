Chapter 802: Starry Sky Stationery

The Mountain and River Page in front of Ning Zhuo erupted with brilliant light, illuminating every corner of the square.

Air currents surged, blowing Ning Zhuo's long hair back and making his robes flutter. At the nearby stalls, countless sheets of paper rustled and flapped in the wind.

After a few breaths, the light and the air currents dissipated, revealing the true form of the top-grade Mountain and River Page.

It was no longer a piece of white paper; instead, it resembled a polished jade tablet. Faint shadows of mountains and rivers flickered across its surface, and upon closer inspection, these shadows seemed like dragons stretching out in all directions.

"It really is a top-grade Mountain and River Page!"

"It's the first time in my life I've ever seen one."

"Who refined it?"

"I recognize him - that’s Ning Zhuo!" 

"So that’s Ning Zhuo..."

"This person is truly capable. He isn't even a Confucian cultivator, yet he managed to create top-grade spirit paper. No wonder he took first place in the previous two Confucian trials!"

"Could it be that he’ll take first place in this trial as well?"

"Hmph, impossible!"

"You can't become the top scorer just with one top-grade page. This round tests not only quality but also quantity."

The crowd broke into a flurry of discussion, everyone feeling a massive sense of competitive pressure emanating from Ning Zhuo.

Gu Qing’s pupils constricted as he stared at Ning Zhuo from a distance. His heart was shaken; he had never expected Ning Zhuo to refine top-grade spirit paper. However, having happened to be watching Ning Zhuo just now, he knew exactly how the other had achieved such a result.

He added Dragon Qi to the pulp?! 

Is he trying to snatch my first place by consuming such a precious treasure?

Gu Qing couldn't help but feel nervous, his previous composure and certainty vanishing.

Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, looked down at the jade pendant in his hand. It was a Dragon Qi jade pendant, and its surface was now covered in cracks.

Back in the White Paper Immortal City, the demon cultivator Li Xiangshang had given him this pendant as a thank-you gift for Ning Zhuo lending him the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat for cultivation.

Ning Zhuo thought to himself, This pendant seals the Dragon Qi of Li Xiangshang’s lord. 

Previously in the Underworld, when I was fighting the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord to seize my Innate Talent, it also played a crucial role. 

I didn't expect it to help me again this time.

Realizing the value of the Dragon Qi jade pendant, Ning Zhuo quickly stowed it away in his Storage Belt, no longer willing to take it out casually.

When he had first stopped at the stall, he noticed that the materials for the Mountain and River Page included Royal Earth and Territory. He realized that if official power and military power were involved, national power would likely be even better. He had scanned the area but found no materials containing national power, which he found strange.

After learning Lu Zai’s refining method, his confusion grew because the method explicitly stated the importance of incorporating national power. Although national power wasn't among the provided materials, the trial rules were quite open and did not restrict the cultivators in that regard.

In other words, the Confucian cultivators are happy to see participants dig into their own pockets and use their personal reserves to improve their scores.

Ning Zhuo sensed the subtlety of the situation. Having participated in several "Rising Cloud" trials, he understood the mindset of the Confucian organizers - they held these trials primarily to expand their influence. The more people used their own resources to achieve great results, the more spectacular the trial would appear and the broader its impact would be.

Thinking of this, the first thing Ning Zhuo had considered was the Lord of Fogetful River Seal. That seal was the core component of a nation’s power, containing the terrifying national power of the Forgetful River Prefecture. However, despite multiple attempts, it had shown no reaction. Even now, he had tried one more time in secret, but there was still no response. Even if the seal was lost, it wasn't something an ordinary person could utilize.

But as Ning Zhuo’s paper pulp reached a certain stage of refinement, he felt the Dragon Qi jade pendant vibrate slightly. He valued this pendant greatly and had even thought of returning it to Li Xiangshang if they ever met again. Seeing the pendant react, he had taken it out to check.

This treasure wasn't sensitive, unlike the Lord of Fogetful River Seal, which Ning Zhuo would never dare to take out in public. As a result, the Dragon Qi inside the pendant surged, releasing a wisp that took the initiative to pour into the pulp. That was what had triggered the soul-stirring scene from before.

Lu Zai personally descended and approached Ning Zhuo. "It is indeed of the top-grade rank! Use this to cut it."

He took out a small knife - the Cicada Wing Spirit-Shaving Knife. It looked like a jade ruler, about 1.2 feet long and two fingers wide. The blade was extremely thin, made from the discarded wing membranes of a thousand-year-old spirit cicada mixed with ice-silk and jade marrow through a special water-refining process. When light passed through it, it refracted into tiny, seven-colored glimmers like those found on actual cicada wings.

Under Lu Zai’s guidance, Ning Zhuo used the treasure knife and his divine sense to cut the jade tablet into twelve Mountain and River Pages.

"Thank you, Senior, for lending me the knife," Ning Zhuo said afterward in gratitude.

Lu Zai smiled slightly and sent a divine sense transmission to Ning Zhuo. "It’s a small matter. If you wish to sell these twelve top-grade spirit papers, come find me first. I will certainly offer a higher price than the Commerce Hall."

After a brief exchange, Lu Zai flew back up to oversee the proceedings.

Under the envious gazes of the crowd, Ning Zhuo pocketed the twelve pages and resumed papermaking.

Several hours later, the bell signaling the end of the round rang.

Lu Zai presided over the announcement. "The top scorer for this round is - Gu Qing."

Many eyes fixed on him. Gu Qing wore a smile, frequently clasping his hands in greeting with an elegant air. However, the murmurs of the crowd and the way people instinctively glanced toward Ning Zhuo made Gu Qing’s mood less than ideal.

After Ning Zhuo produced the top-grade paper, Gu Qing had gone all out, digging into his own stores for superior materials and working with every ounce of his focus and time. In the end, the quantity of spirit paper he produced was massive and the quality was high-grade. Based on the overall evaluation, he was the undisputed first place.

As for Ning Zhuo, after refining those twelve top-grade pages, he hadn't used the Dragon Qi jade pendant again.

Lu Zai announced the other names; they, along with Gu Qing, were the top ten of the first round. Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran did not make the list. Neither did Ning Zhuo.

However, as Lu Zai declared the official end and the participants began to leave the formation space, many people crowded around Ning Zhuo. They all wore smiles, taking the initiative to befriending him with the goal of purchasing the top-grade spirit paper.

From the edge of the crowd, Kong Ran watched Ning Zhuo’s social success with envy. Mountain and River Pages are used for making books like geographical records, travelogues, fortress construction plans, and resource maps.

Top-grade pages can give a cultivator a sense of being there when recording famous mountains, dangerous lands, or secret realms. If used to mark resource points like ore veins or spirit herbs, they can simulate the specific environment of the site.

When used for military manuals regarding terrain, sieges, or defense, they can dynamically demonstrate offensive and defensive postures - they are the ultimate substitute for military sand tables.

Kong Ran paused for a moment, then came to a sudden realization. I see Brother Ning’s strategy now.

He knew he couldn't defeat Brother Gu Qing, so he took the initiative to create this shocking result to minimize the impact of his loss as much as possible.

From the look of things, he has been very successful!

Once this round is over, almost everyone will be talking about the top-grade pages. A lot of the glory from Gu Qing's first-place win has been snatched away.

Gu Qing shared this exact thought.

"Ning Zhuo!" He gritted his teeth slightly, watching Ning Zhuo in the crowd. "Using these little tricks only proves your weakness."

"The second round is Starry Sky Stationery, and the core test is calculation. Even if you bring out more precious materials, it will be useless!"

"I’ll see how you try to be clever then. Hmph!"

The first round was Mountain and River Page, and the second was Starry Sky Stationery!

The trial site was set in an open area of the valley, but it was now late at night. The night sky was as clear as if it had been washed, with starlight scattering across the ground.

Nangong Zhi stood in the center, her azure skirt fluttering gently in the night breeze. Her gaze was as clear as the stars as she scanned every cultivator present. She had just finished teaching the refining method for Starry Sky Stationery in full - three times over.

Worried that some might not have grasped the key points, she continued to advise them: "Now that you know the refining method, you should all understand one thing - Starry Sky Stationery cannot be achieved through brute force. Its core lies in 'calculation.'"

"You need to calculate the celestial timing, the stellar positions, and the exact impact points of the starlight. Finally, you must calculate the pathways for the flow of star power."

"Begin now!"

Gu Qing was already prepared. As soon as Nangong Zhi finished speaking, he immediately entered his state. The main materials for Starry Sky Stationery were moon-laurel bark and star-patterned cocoons, while the auxiliary materials were star-dew water, star-patterned grass, and star-attracting sand.

There was no need to dwell on the processing of the materials. Soon, Gu Qing had produced a mass of pulp. He looked up at the sky, the starlight reflected in his eyes. Simultaneously, in the sea of his upper Dantian, his Literary Palace seemed to transform into a precise calculating mechanism, rapidly deducing based on the astrological parameters given by Nangong Zhi.

As the calculations deepened, the corners of Gu Qing’s mouth curled into a confident smile. "Now!"

He mobilized his divine sense, using his spiritual energy to draw down the starlight from the heavens. The starlight fell onto the pulp and quickly permeated it, creating deep blue star-trails. Various nodes within the trails gradually became distinct.

A short while later, the pulp was spread out to form a massive sheet of spirit paper. The paper was smooth, the star-points bright and evenly distributed. The sheet was nearly square, but there were many burrs on the edges. Gu Qing then took out a spirit blade and trimmed off the unusable edges. He then cut the sheet evenly, producing a total of nineteen and a half sheets of Starry Sky Stationery.

Similar to the first round, Gu Qing was among the first group of cultivators to finish. He immediately turned his head, his divine sense sweeping over Ning Zhuo, and saw that the latter was still calculating. He couldn't help but sneer inwardly.

A sense of superiority as a Confucian cultivator welled up within him. Our Confucian methods might primarily focus on one dantian, but we can care for the other two as well. 

The Literary Palace was in the upper Dantian's sea of consciousness, the Literary Qi was in the middle Dantian's sea of qi, and the Literary Heart was in the lower Dantian's sea of essence.

Confucians must know astronomy above and geography below. We have a natural advantage in refining Starry Sky Stationery. You, Ning Zhuo, might be a master of mechanics and thus not weak in calculation, but you focus on your middle Dantian; how can you compare to me?

When Ning Zhuo had received his stone tablet, he had voluntarily disclosed his cultivation and cultivation art.

Ning Zhuo completed the first round step-by-step. His divine sense scanned the surroundings, finding that he was roughly in the third group.

The Dao of Stars...

I am indeed not adept at astronomical calculations.

And with so many people drawing down starlight, the frequent interference between us is slowing down my papermaking progress even more.

There was another reason: this was Ning Zhuo’s first time encountering the refining method for Starry Sky Stationery, whereas Gu Qing and others were already familiar with it.

In that case...

A sharp light flashed in Ning Zhuo’s eyes. He sent a divine sense transmission: "Big brother, help me!" 

"I'm here, little brother." Inside the Blue Stone Grotto, Sun Lingtong chuckled and activated his innate spirit eyes. He pierced through the water formation and triggered the empowerment of the Luo Shu Pages for Ning Zhuo.

With the empowerment of the Dao Treasure, Ning Zhuo’s calculation speed soared, pointing strictly toward the correct answers. The massive amount of complex calculations that had just been so difficult were now completed in a matter of seconds.

This caused his papermaking efficiency to skyrocket, achieving a staggering effect.

Nangong Zhi, who had been overseeing the entire field, was the first to notice. She observed for a moment, then her gaze locked onto Ning Zhuo, her expression turning slightly surprised. How is Ning Zhuo calculating so fast?

No, it's not just fast. It's fast and perfectly correct!

She was deeply shocked. Ning Zhuo’s calculating ability had already reached her own level. The reason they were neck-and-neck wasn't because their skills were identical, but because the calculation load for the Starry Sky Stationery refining method was only so large - the ceiling was only so high, and there was only so much room for calculating ability to be displayed!

The second to notice Ning Zhuo’s anomaly was Liu Fushu. During a break for recovery, he saw Ning Zhuo drawing down starlight in rapid succession and was completely stunned. He was drawing down starlight strand by strand, but the starlight Ning Zhuo drew was coming down in torrents, almost like flowing water.

"What's going on?!" Gu Qing had just finished a round of papermaking when he instinctively glanced at his biggest rival. His pupils instantly shrank.

That fellow Ning Zhuo was causing trouble again!

Is... is this his true strength?

Or did he take some pill and this is just a temporary boost?

No, if this continues, he’ll overtake me and might very well snatch the top spot for this round!

Gu Qing realized things were looking very bad. Being decisive, he immediately pulled out a medicine bottle. "If you can take medicine, so can I!"

The pill was called the Heart-Burning Wisdom Pill. It was specifically for Confucian cultivators; it could burn the Literary Heart to temporarily boost intelligence by a significant margin. The pill was dark red with twisted silver patterns on the surface. Gu Qing swallowed one without hesitation.

Instantly, an indescribable bitterness and pungency exploded, as if a fire had been lit in his mouth. He suppressed the urge to gag and forced it down. His spiritual energy surged, quickly dissolving the medicinal power.

Gu Qing felt a cool sensation rush to the top of his head, which then turned into a burning heat. His Literary Palace felt as if it had been thrown into a furnace, and his calculation speed suddenly soared! This, in turn, caused his papermaking speed to skyrocket as well.

Ning Zhuo used the Dao Treasure Luo Shu, while Gu Qing continuously consumed Heart-Burning Wisdom Pills. The two competed fiercely, drawing the attention of more and more cultivators as the competition continued until time ran out.

After a careful inspection, Nangong Zhi announced publicly: "The top scorer for this round is Gu Qing!"

"Second place... Ning Zhuo."
