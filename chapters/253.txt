Chapter 253: Rudie Niang

After a brief exchange due to limited time, Sun Lingtong began to hand over to Ning Zhuo.

He first took out a slender jade bottle and handed it over.

Ning Zhuo accepted it, uncorked the bottle, and glanced inside, his face immediately lighting up with joy.

This was Supreme virtuous water, a treasure of the water element!

"Three drops are enough to cleanse all the surveillance methods on me," Ning Zhuo murmured softly.

Sun Lingtong advised him, "When to cleanse the surveillance is something that needs careful consideration. You can't be too reckless or optimistic. Even though you have means to conceal yourself from Zhu Xuanji's detection, preventing your true cultivation from being exposed, once you remove the surveillance, Golden Core cultivators will definitely swarm to investigate and question you. You need to think about how to explain this matter!"

"I'm more worried that they might become suspicious and secretly apply more surveillance methods on you. In that case, your efforts would be in vain. There won't be another three drops of Supreme virtuous water available for you. So, choosing when to use these three drops is crucial and requires utmost caution!" Ning Zhuo nodded heavily, "I understand!"

Next, Sun Lingtong handed over some Thunder Beetles, Mist Rust Orchids, Heavenly Dew, and premium Cloud Tea to Ning Zhuo. "You might need these materials to create mechanical constructs while wandering in the Lava Immortal Palace, so I'm giving you some in advance." Ning Zhuo couldn't help but show a look of greed.

He hadn't expected Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu's theft to yield such a bounty.

"It seems that Song Fuli and his Cloud Merchants aren't that formidable after all, losing so much... Or perhaps Yang Chanyu played a crucial role in this," Ning Zhuo speculated silently.

He knew Sun Lingtong well, understanding his limits.

Over the years, he had personally assisted and even saved Sun Lingtong.

"If my guess is correct, it's no wonder Brother Sun sought Yang Chanyu's help," Ning Zhuo realized the significance of Yang Chanyu.

He thought for a moment and then praised Yang Chanyu with a few words.

Yang Chanyu squinted her eyes, scrutinizing his face, "Little brother, you sure know how to talk sweetly. But sweet talk alone is useless!"

"This time, Brother Sun and I risked our lives to steal from within the Cloud Whale. You stayed in the rear, taking no risks, yet you get such a large share. Hehe, I hope you'll perform well in the future."

"If you don't show your worth and make me feel you're not deserving of such a share, I won't let you off!" Yang Chanyu warned Ning Zhuo.

Sun Lingtong chuckled, interrupting Yang Chanyu.

Ning Zhuo quickly assured that he would do his utmost to prove his value.

Finally, Sun Lingtong took out the mechanical puppet Rudie Niang, "Little brother, look what I've brought for you. You'll definitely like this!" Ning Zhuo was initially stunned upon seeing Rudie Niang, then his eyes widened, sparkling with excitement.

"What kind of mechanical puppet is this?" Ning Zhuo couldn't help but get excited. "Quick, put her down so I can take a good look!" Ning Zhuo's reaction was just as Sun Lingtong had anticipated.

Whenever Ning Zhuo saw exquisite mechanical constructs, he would react with genuine excitement and joy.

Sun Lingtong, with a grin, placed Rudie Niang on the long medical table.

Rudie Niang remained motionless, eyes closed, in a dormant state.

Ning Zhuo approached the table, reaching out to touch her long skirt and inspect her jade belt.

Rudie Niang's long skirt and jade belt were both artifacts.

The skirt had some defensive capabilities, while the jade belt was for storage.

Sun Lingtong timely explained, "Her waist and jade bottle both have storage capabilities, but I've checked, and there's nothing inside. The jade bottle's function, which I've researched, is specifically for collecting sky clouds, with little offensive capability."

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, speculating, "Could this mechanical puppet's purpose be similar to my Mechanical Fire Monkey, specifically designed to harvest certain cultivation resources?" Ning Zhuo continued his inspection.

His gaze paused at the top of Rudie Niang's head, where there was a butterfly-shaped silver crown.

The silver crown was adorned with tiny jewels, sparkling from every angle, quite dazzling.

"What is this silver crown for?" Ning Zhuo inquired.

Sun Lingtong replied, "I haven't studied it in detail. So far, I've only explored her silk clothes, belt, and jade bottle." Immediately, Ning Zhuo focused his thoughts, pressing on the surgical table and channeling magical power into a talisman on the table.

The table glowed, revealing numerous mechanical tools.

These tools emerged from the table and floated in mid-air, surrounding Ning Zhuo.

With just a thought, these tools would automatically fly into his hands, making it very convenient.

They were currently in the intensive care room, the highest-grade treatment area in the Medical Pavilion.

Ning Zhuo selected a tool from the many available and placed it above the silver crown.

After activating the tool and conducting a brief examination, he obtained preliminary results. "This silver crown can be used for reconnaissance and also has control capabilities, but what it controls is still unclear."

Ning Zhuo didn't delve further.

His gaze shifted downwards, quickly scanning Rudie Niang's entire body.

He reached out, grasping Rudie Niang's delicate hand, examining it, and gently pinching her arm. "Her skin is made from a composite material, with high cloud cotton as the main component."

"This material's characteristic is its ability to automatically absorb spiritual energy from the air, and it's as soft and elastic as a cloud." Ning Zhuo opened a lamp-like mechanical tool, shining it on Rudie Niang's arm.

The light revealed previously unseen details.

Beneath Rudie Niang's skin, a layer of extremely fine silver array patterns was faintly visible.

These silver patterns interwove, forming dense mesh-like structures.

Ning Zhuo pondered for a while, murmuring, "Her entire skin can automatically gather external spiritual energy. This design indicates that this mechanical construct has a high demand for spiritual energy."

"The skin appears soft and fragile, but it's not. Beneath the surface, there's a defensive array specifically arranged. The array master's technique is extremely advanced. I can see the array patterns but can't deduce the array's core."

"This array technique is at least at the master level, allowing for relative changes in the array's base and core, transforming the entire array. Here, the array was specifically altered for Rudie Niang's form."

"I can only discern that when she truly fights, this array will activate, forming a protective spiritual light, providing comprehensive defense." After examining the skin, Ning Zhuo began investigating Rudie Niang's hands and feet.

Although Rudie Niang resembled a living person, her body temperature was low, feeling cold to the touch.

He discovered that Rudie Niang's hands and feet were very flexible, intricately constructed, resembling human hands and feet but scaled down several times.

The Mechanical Fire Monkey's hands could also perform delicate actions, with several nested arrays arranged by Ning Zhuo to facilitate harvesting Fire Persimmons.

However, compared to Rudie Niang's hands, the difference was stark.

After a rough inspection, Ning Zhuo donned a headband.

The tools provided by the Medical Pavilion were of excellent quality.

With the headband on, Ning Zhuo's spiritual sense could intertwine, forming a temporary divine sense.

His temporary divine sense enveloped Rudie Niang, penetrating her entire body.

The next moment, a faint white light emanated from Rudie Niang, enveloping her completely.

Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu's expressions tensed, quickly becoming vigilant.

Ning Zhuo's brow furrowed slightly.

He hadn't expected that just a slight probe with his divine sense would trigger Rudie Niang's protective spiritual light.

Although he couldn't determine her defensive strength, it was clear that her defense was highly sensitive.

Most of Ning Zhuo's divine sense was blocked, allowing him to barely see some parts.

For instance, he found that Rudie Niang's hands lacked overlapping arrays and didn't have the bone structure of human hands.

Instead, they were supported by a network of fine threads.

Rudie Niang's feet had a similar structure, but each sole contained a talisman.

These two talismans were identical, and Ning Zhuo couldn't fully understand them, only recognizing them as some form of martial art talisman.

This piqued his curiosity: when Rudie Niang used the talisman, what kind of abilities would manifest? Through his temporary divine sense, Ning Zhuo also discovered that Rudie Niang's body contained "blood."

Her blood was milky white, semi-transparent, reminiscent of high-quality stalactites.

Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, and with a thought, a fine hollow needle flew into his hand.

He inserted the needle into Rudie Niang's arm vein.

The next moment, the protective spiritual light surged, snapping the hollow needle and expelling it.

However, in that brief time, Ning Zhuo achieved his goal.

He collected Rudie Niang's milky white blood from the broken needle.

After testing, Ning Zhuo confirmed that it was a composite material.

The liquid was rich in life force, providing strong repair capabilities for her skin, bones, and other mechanical components.

Moreover, this liquid could carry a considerable amount of magical power.

Its capacity was so strong that it could rival top-grade blank spirit stones! Clearly, this was a result deliberately pursued by the designer of her mechanical structure.
