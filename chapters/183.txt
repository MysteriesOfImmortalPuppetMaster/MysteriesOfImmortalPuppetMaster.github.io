Chapter 183: Refining the Mechanism

In the secret chamber, five Golden Core Stage Patriarchs from three families gathered together.

"The alliance of the three families... has failed," Zhou Nuying sighed.

Zheng Danlian looked towards the Ning family patriarch.

The jade slip clearly stated that the key reason for the failure of this joint exploration of the Immortal Palace was Ning Xiaohui's internal conflict in public!

This behavior was extremely egregious.

The Ning family patriarch seemed completely unaware of the gaze directed at him: "Even if we had won this battle, it would still show the difficulty of exploring the Lava Immortal Palace. The path of soul entry into the Immortal Palace is not that easy." This analysis resonated deeply with the others.

Even though it was a regretful defeat, the Golden Core Stage Patriarchs of the three families all noticed the improvement in the combat power of Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai.

In this battle, the materials of the two mechanical constructs were clearly of a higher grade than before.

Moreover, they used various novel mechanical components.

The self-destructing ape mechanism, the wind fire wheel, the capturing rope mechanism that captured Ning Xie, all achieved significant combat results and were not to be underestimated.

Naturally, the Golden Core Stage Patriarchs attributed such improvements to the Lava Immortal Palace and the deliberate arrangements of the three sects.

They would never have thought that there was a mastermind behind all this!

"Even if the Qi Refining Stage juniors of the three families regroup and achieve good results, it is impossible to break through like a hot knife through butter. The path of soul entry into the Immortal Palace remains difficult."

"With Meng Kui possessing immortal potential, the reformation team of the City Lord's Mansion dominating the ranking list, it is difficult for our reformation team to defeat such opponents..." The Golden Core Stage Patriarchs exchanged thoughts secretly through divine sense and gradually reached a consensus.

That was: to set off together, cooperate with Zhu Xuanji, and delve into Fire Persimmon Mountain to reclaim the demonic general mechanism!

From the perspective of the three families, they would rather see Zhu Xuanji ultimately obtain the Immortal Palace than Meng Kui.

If Meng Kui obtained the Immortal Palace, the Meng family would move into the Immortal City in large numbers, greatly squeezing the living space of the three families.

On the other hand, if Zhu Xuanji won, the three families would have contributed to the royal family, which would undoubtedly be more beneficial for the three families' status in Fire Persimmon Immortal City!

Zheng Shuangjun said, "Fellow Daoists, delving into the volcano is life-threatening. Before taking action, our family urgently needs to forge that mechanical weapon!" The other Golden Core Stage Patriarchs were slightly taken aback, then nodded simultaneously.

The Zheng family had obtained a mechanical blueprint from the Lava Immortal Palace in the early years.

According to the blueprint, the Zheng family spent a great deal of resources to secretly forge a mechanical weapon.

This weapon was extremely powerful and had already brought great benefits to the Zheng family even before it was completed.

Previously, in a bet between the four Golden Core Stage Patriarchs of the Zheng and Zhou families, the Zheng family's two immortals entered the Night Star Silk Formation, relying on the advantage of this weapon to successfully break through the formation.

The Golden Core Stage Patriarchs of the Zhou family thus learned about this weapon.

The Zheng family proactively traded Nine Yang Yellow Ox Balm to gain the approval of the Zhou family's dual cultivators, who agreed to help the Zheng family complete the subsequent forging of the mechanical weapon.

But relying solely on the Zhou family's formation techniques was not enough.

Subsequently, the Zheng family intentionally approached the Ning family, hoping that the Ning family would provide powerful Extreme Cold Tempering techniques to help forge this mechanical weapon.

As a result, the Zheng and Ning families grew closer, secretly exchanging many benefits.

For example, Zheng Jian obtained the Ice Heart Talisman, and Ning Xiaohui, under the personal guidance of Zheng family cultivators, refined Ghost Weapon.

Therefore, the Ning family patriarch was also aware of this mechanical weapon and had seen the blueprint.

"If this weapon is forged, it will indeed be very helpful!" Zhou Nuying had a deep impression of the mechanical weapon.

The Ning family patriarch frowned secretly.

To be honest, he did not want to see the Zheng family master such a powerful weapon.

In his interactions with the Golden Core Stage Patriarchs of the Zheng family, he had seized upon this ambition of the Zheng family to secure many benefits for the Ning family.

The Ning family patriarch's plan was to use this mechanical weapon to keep the Zheng family on tenterhooks.

But now, with the exploration of Fire Persimmon Mountain imminent, the Ning family patriarch also felt a sense of crisis.

If the Zheng family forged this weapon, it would indeed help ensure everyone's survival.

The Ning family patriarch furrowed his brows tightly, shook his head, and sighed, indicating that using Extreme Cold techniques would harm himself and greatly affect his combat power.

He was unwilling to assist in tempering before delving into Fire Persimmon Mountain.

He preferred to find an opportunity to help the Zheng family after the trip to Fire Persimmon Mountain.

Zheng Danlian and Zheng Shuangjun exchanged glances, seeing the determination in each other's eyes.

The Ning family patriarch's refusal was within their expectations.

It didn't matter!

The dual cultivators of the Zheng family had their own methods to force the Ning family patriarch to comply.

That method was - Zhu Xuanji.

The dual cultivators of the Zheng family found Zhu Xuanji and expressed that they had changed their minds and needed to forge a mechanical weapon before entering Fire Persimmon Mountain.

And this mechanical weapon required the Extreme Cold techniques of the Ning family patriarch for tempering.

Upon hearing this, Zhu Xuanji immediately expressed his willingness to help.

He quickly found the Ning family patriarch.

After a secret conversation, the Ning family patriarch, under pressure from the royal family, had no choice but to agree.

Ning Zhuo arrived at the clan leader's residence and met the Ning family clan leader.

"Clan branch member Ning Zhuo, greets the clan leader!" Ning Zhuo cupped his hands, his manners impeccable, but his tone was indifferent and distant.

The Ning family clan leader, however, wore a smile and beckoned Ning Zhuo: "Come, Zhuo, sit here. Don't just stand there." Ning Zhuo remained expressionless: "Clan leader, if you have something to say, please say it directly. I still have some black market matters to attend to."

"Haha, I know, I know you're a busy person." The Ning family clan leader laughed a few times, his tone gentle, "I called you here mainly for Ning Xiaohui's matter. You know..."

Ning Zhuo immediately interrupted: "Ning Xiaohui harmed me! Is the clan leader here to speak for her?!"

"It's not a setup, not a setup." The Ning family clan leader quickly denied, "We're all family, how could it be a setup?! Ning Xiaohui is just too young and made a mistake under pressure at a critical moment."

The Ning family clan leader emphasized in the end: "It was a mistake, indeed a mistake!" Ning Zhuo sneered coldly: "If the clan leader thinks so, I have nothing more to say. But..."

"Do you really think so? Are you deceiving yourself?"

"Do all the clan leaders of the Ning family think so? Or do most people think so?"

The smile on the Ning family clan leader's face grew even more pronounced: "That's why I specially invited you here, Zhuo, to clear up this matter. All rewards are negotiable!" Ning Zhuo was slightly taken aback, then his eyes lit up: "Oh?" Moments later, he left the clan leader's study, satisfied.

Once Ning Zhuo was confirmed to have left, the sound of things being smashed immediately echoed in the study.

The noise continued for a long time before gradually subsiding.

Ning Zhuo secretly went to the underground base to meet Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong was very happy to see Ning Zhuo, jumping up and hugging Ning Zhuo's shoulders, patting him vigorously.

"Brother, you're here!"

Although the two had met many times in the Lava Immortal Palace, the actual number of meetings recently had been few.

Sun Lingtong stayed in the underground secret base all day, not seeing anyone, which made him quite bored.

Seeing his dear brother, Sun Lingtong was naturally very happy.

What made him even happier was that the two brothers were checking the biggest spoils of this battle - a ghost cultivator Ning Xie!

Ning Xie was sealed tightly with dozens of talismans stuck all over his body, unable to move.

"Boss, how should we deal with him? Do you have any good ideas?" Ning Zhuo asked.

Sun Lingtong shook his head: "If Cheng Bai had soul refining techniques, we could let him refine it. But now, his spirituality has dropped to fifty-six percent, it's impossible." Sun Lingtong sighed.

Before the battle, Sun Lingtong had risked unsealing Cheng Bai's storage bag and used the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra to burn Cheng Bai's personal items, helping the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai regain a large amount of spirituality.

His spirituality had once reached ninety-two percent.

But after the recent battle, Cheng Bai's spirituality had dropped significantly, now down to fifty-six percent.

Originally, Ning Xie, with his innate Snow Soul Ice Essence and being a ghost cultivator, was very suitable to be transformed into a ghost general.

Cheng Bai's ghost generals had once suppressed Ning Zhuo, leaving a deep impression on the latter.

But for the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai to regain soul refining abilities, he would need to pass the Spirit Movement Stage and develop strong spirituality.

This process was too slow!

Sun Lingtong preferred to use him now to enhance his own strength.

Ning Zhuo understood: "So, we will refine him into a mechanical component?"

"Yes, yes!" Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly.

The Ning family was not like the Soul Devouring Sect or the Void Sect, large sects that could mark the culprits with the imprints of their disciples.

This allowed Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong to deal with Ning Xie as they pleased.

Without hesitation, they opened the furnace and threw Ning Xie into it.

Then, they both used the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra together, igniting the furnace and giving Ning Xie true peace in death.

"It's too hot, too hot." Sun Lingtong finished the technique, letting the furnace cool down.

He used his small palm as a fan, fanning his flushed, sweaty face.

Suddenly, his eyes lit up, and he took out the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, calling Ning Zhuo over: "Zhuo, come here." Cheng Bai had used the Soul Devouring Technique multiple times in the recent battle, eliminating several members of the reformation team.

"Boss, you go first!" Ning Zhuo quickly came to Sun Lingtong's side.

Sun Lingtong didn't stand on ceremony, controlling Cheng Bai to infuse himself with a large amount of soul essence.

"Comfortable, so comfortable!" Sun Lingtong closed his eyes, overjoyed.

"Zhuo, your turn." He absorbed half of the soul essence and then gave the position to Ning Zhuo.

Subsequently, Ning Zhuo also received the nourishment of the soul essence.

Their soul foundations, which were over a hundred times stronger, were now making great strides towards the two hundred mark!

After absorbing all the soul essence, both of them felt invigorated.

The furnace had completely cooled down, and they opened it to take out a millstone-sized mechanical sphere.

The surface of the sphere was covered with a layer of glazed casing, with a blue strip running around the middle like a blue belt.

There were circular blue crystals at the poles of the sphere.

Inside the casing, white mist constantly churned, sometimes expanding, sometimes contracting.

The mechanical sphere floated in mid-air, emitting a faint chill.

Spirituality: thirty-six percent.

Mechanism - Ice Snow Weather Sphere!
