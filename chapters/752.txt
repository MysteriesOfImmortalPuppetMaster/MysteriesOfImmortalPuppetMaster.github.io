Chapter 752: Bronze Swords

Ning Zhuo differed from geniuses like Situ Xing and Ban Ji in one key aspect.

Situ Xing, Ban Ji, and others had long been renowned within the Flying Cloud Kingdom, serving as the public faces of their respective factions during the Foundation Establishment Stage. Consequently, extensive information about them was widely known.

In contrast, Ning Zhuo was a newcomer from abroad, having burst onto the scene with astonishing speed. While information about him sold briskly in the Trading Hall, it was always priced at the lowest tier.

This was because the available intelligence only covered Ning Zhuo's activities after arriving at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, making its overall value limited.

As a result, people knew very little about Ning Zhuo.

His true strengths, precise age, and country of origin remained largely unknown.

Although Ning Zhuo had stated his name, main cultivation art (the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual), and mid-Foundation Establishment cultivation level during the wooden and stone tablet registration stages, all of this could easily be falsified.

The Myriad Manifestations Sect's regulations lacked strict verification procedures at these early stages.

However, during the later registration phases, the sect would employ rigorous detection methods to uncover lies, disguises, and other deceptions. Only at that point would the cultivators' information become truly reliable.

Therefore, the cultivators overseeing the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor trials focused much of their attention on Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's initial performance against the Bronze Sword left everyone stunned and deeply disappointed. However, his astonishing comprehension and subsequent mastery of the situation left the hidden observers in awe.

"His physical body's foundation is remarkably strong. The Bronze Sword is a Profound Armament Armor, exceptionally sharp, yet even after inflicting severe wounds, they heal rapidly."

"He could easily overpower the Bronze Sword, so why is he stalling?"

"He's learning, isn't he?"

As they watched, it became clear that Ning Zhuo's close combat skills were improving rapidly in the heat of battle.

"What cultivation art does Ning Zhuo specialize in? The intelligence reports claim he focuses on a Five Elements technique, but judging by his physical body's foundation, he likely specializes in the Essence Sea."

"If he specializes in the Essence Sea, akin to a Body Cultivator, why is his close combat so weak? It doesn't make sense."

"Perhaps he's focused his efforts on other areas and neglected martial arts entirely."

"That's unlikely! How old is he? Forty or fifty? How could he have spent so many years without even dabbling in close combat or martial arts? How did he cultivate during the Qi Refining Stage? His background must be formidable, with powerful backing. If he were carefully nurtured, how could such a glaring weakness have been allowed to persist?"

Cultivators in the Qi Refining Stage had lifespans only slightly longer than ordinary humans, typically living to around a hundred years old.

Upon reaching the Foundation Establishment Stage, a cultivator's lifespan doubled, extending to approximately two to three hundred years. For someone in their forties or fifties at this stage, it was equivalent to being a teenager between ten and twenty years old.

Some middle-aged or elderly Qi Refining Stage cultivators who advanced to Foundation Establishment experienced a qualitative change in their life force, rejuvenating to a younger appearance to varying degrees.

In the lifespan of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the forties and fifties represented their adolescent phase. Achieving Foundation Establishment at this age was undoubtedly a sign of exceptional talent.

Therefore, despite their youthful appearances, individuals like Situ Xing, Lin Jinglong, and Shen Xi were all around forty years old.

Ning Zhuo, though appearing as a teenager, possessed an extraordinary and mature demeanor. His rich experiences, from enduring hardship since the age of two to plotting grand schemes, traveling the world after leaving Fire Persimmon Immortal City, participating in wars, and confronting the Soul Formation Level Underworld Monarch, were evident in his calm and composed bearing. Any discerning observer would recognize his true worth.

As a result, the assembled cultivators vastly overestimated his actual age.

"After forty or fifty years of cultivation, his Martial Technique shouldn't be this poor, right?"

"Regardless of any special circumstances, this alone suggests he's not a Martial Cultivator. Whether he's a Body Cultivator is another matter."

"He's fought too few times in the Martial Arts Hall - only a handful of times, really. Some of those matches were even closed to the public."

"In his battle against the Tiger Demon, he used a Golden Core-level ice-attribute Mechanical Puppet. But that doesn't tell us much; he specializes in Mechanical Arts, after all."

Everyone assumed Ning Zhuo came from a major power, comparable to the Ban Clan or Pi Clan.

They categorized him as similar to Ban Ji or Situ Xing - the public face of a major power during the Foundation Establishment Stage.

In such cases, it would be perfectly normal for a major power to provide Ning Zhuo with a Golden Core-level Mechanical Puppet for protection.

"Actually, once he fights a few more times in the Martial Arts Hall, his true capabilities will inevitably be revealed."

Just as the Demon Subjugation Hall had the Rising Cloud Trials, the Martial Arts Hall had its own version.

In fact, during the early stages of each Grand Assembly, the Martial Arts Hall's trials were considered the most crucial of all the Rising Cloud Trials.

Countless ambitious cultivators chose this grand stage to showcase their talents.

Geniuses never shied away from battle. Within the Martial Arts Hall, they clashed fiercely, suppressing their rivals while enhancing their own reputations and reaping the rewards that followed.

In the Martial Arts Hall's trials, the more impressive one's performance, the greater the rewards.

The top spot in these trials held immense prestige.

Many believed Ning Zhuo was being too modest and would undoubtedly become a regular at the Martial Arts Hall in the future.

Of course, this was understandable.

For now, newcomers were actively participating in the Rising Cloud Trials across various venues, and the Martial Arts Hall hadn't yet reached its peak activity.

"I'm really looking forward to Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji's clash in the Martial Arts Hall. It's bound to be spectacular!"

"What's there to look forward to? If that fight happens, too much of his information will be leaked. How much can we sell what we've gathered so far?"

Many of the cultivators overseeing the trials held Jade Slips, recording the performances of cultivators across different venues.

Ning Zhuo's actions from the beginning until now had been meticulously recorded on numerous Jade Slips.

Cultivators often earned substantial profits by selling these Jade Slips.

The battle on Ning Zhuo's side had calmed, gradually becoming peaceful. The cultivators' attention shifted to the other participants.

Tie Zheng strode forward, his expression impassive, carrying a massive blade with a qilin-headed hilt on his back. He already wielded a sword and a saber, having decisively defeated two sets of Profound Armament Armor.

Lu Zeng, wielding a bronze hammer, was locked in a fierce clash with a bronze spear, now completely dominating the exchange. The ruler emblem on his chest occasionally flashed faintly, a constant reminder that he was being observed.

Lu Zeng understood perfectly: "My current battle is likely being recorded in multiple Jade Slips."

"The Rising Cloud Trials attract countless cultivators, and the more participants there are, the more information leaks out."

"This process is also how the Myriad Manifestations Sect assesses its new recruits."

This was the price they had to pay.

Meanwhile, Ao Pan cracked his Bronze Whip with a resounding snap. His opponent, a bronze staff, retreated step by step despite its frantic attempts to defend itself.

The whip, as agile as a serpent, suddenly coiled around the staff. With a sharp tug, Ao Pan pulled the staff toward himself, seized it, and channeled his surging energy into forcibly refining it.

The staff struggled violently, but its resistance gradually weakened until it fell completely still, claimed by Ao Pan.

Among the cultivators watching from the shadows, someone whispered, "Ao Pan has already claimed three sets of Ninefold Profound Armament Armor. Even in the past, such speed was rare."

Someone who had been closely observing Ao Pan introduced him: "His whip technique is extraordinary. In the first match against the Bronze Whip, he had to rely on his fists and feet. But in the second and third matches, he remained rooted to the spot from start to finish, never taking a single step."

Clearly, the previous Profound Armament Armor had posed no challenge to Ao Pan.

An elder murmured thoughtfully, "His mastery of the whip is at least at the level of a renowned master, and it's possible he's even reached the grandmaster level."

A cultivator beside the elder interjected, "He introduced himself as being from the Subduing Waves Kingdom. Following that lead should allow us to uncover more information about him."

Ao Pan sheathed the Bronze Whip and twirled the Bronze Sword a few times. This brief display revealed his profound skill with the sword as well.

After a moment's consideration, Ao Pan stowed the battered Bronze Whip and continued onward, carrying the Bronze Sword.

As a Golden Core-level Body Cultivator, he excelled in whip techniques but was also proficient with other weapons.

In truth, Ao Pan had risen from humble beginnings as a fisherman who joined a ship gang. Even as a mortal, he had relied on knives, spears, and harpoons - these were the tools that had paved his path to success. For him, the Rising Cloud Trials of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor were perfectly suited to his strengths.

This was the second trial within the Profound Armor Cave. Even with his cultivation suppressed, Ao Pan maintained his lead thanks to his deep martial arts foundation.

Some cultivators turned their attention back to Ning Zhuo.

"Why is he still struggling with that Bronze Sword?"

"Hurry up and refine it! You need to move on to the next round. If you keep dragging this out, you'll be eliminated!"

Some secretly worried for Ning Zhuo.

On one hand, they preferred Ning Zhuo, who walked the Righteous Path, over Ban Ji. On the other hand, they hoped he would advance further, revealing more personal information that they could profit from by selling intelligence.

Having a clear overview of the situation, they knew Ning Zhuo was falling far behind the main group.

Ban Ji, Zhang Wangxing, and the Rust Disaster Craftsman had already claimed their first bronze weapon and were now vying for their second, having gained the upper hand in their current battles.

Ning Zhuo was still struggling with his first.

"What's he wasting time on?"

"He's learning! His close-combat skills are improving rapidly, you can see it with the naked eye."

"Studying while taking the exam? He's too confident."

"He must have immense faith in his learning ability. Perhaps that's what makes him a genius. We can't judge him by ordinary standards!"

More and more cultivators shifted their attention away from Ning Zhuo. After all, observing others was far more interesting than watching him.

A moment later, Ning Zhuo suddenly stepped forward, his body twisting slightly to evade the Bronze Sword's thrust.

Seizing the opportunity, he gripped the sword's hilt firmly.

The Bronze Sword struggled violently, but its resistance quickly waned as Ning Zhuo completely refined it.

A cultivator who witnessed this blinked in disbelief, a suspicious expression crossing his face. "What did I just see? Did Ning Zhuo refine that Profound Armament Armor at an abnormally fast pace?"

Divine Refinement! Qi Refinement!

Ning Zhuo employed both methods simultaneously, subduing the Bronze Sword in a mere three breaths.

He could have been even faster. The Three Sects' Supreme Methods allowed him to cultivate his Three Dantian concurrently, enabling simultaneous Divine Refinement, Qi Refinement, and Essence Refinement!

But there was no need to reveal his full capabilities under observation. Ning Zhuo had no intention of exposing his cultivation level in the Essence Sea.

Restraint and concealing his true abilities had always been fundamental aspects of his character.

"This is the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor," he murmured.

"No, to be precise, it's just the first layer of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor."

Ning Zhuo examined the Bronze Sword closely.

With a gentle thought, the sword flowed like liquid in his hand, transforming into a sheet of bronze armor that hovered in mid-air.

The bronze armor was covered in countless markings, their intricate patterns depicting a fundamental sword technique.

"The Ninefold Profound Armament Armor is crafted using a unique method," Ning Zhuo recalled.

"They forge Azure Flow Copper as the sole material. Then, through Divine Refinement, they imprint Martial Techniques and Martial Arts onto it. Once refined, each armor plate can transform into two forms: the plate itself and a weapon corresponding to the imprinted Martial Technique or Martial Art."

Ning Zhuo gripped the sword hilt and swung it a few times, discovering that each strike was perfectly executed. Even when he deliberately deviated from the proper form, the Bronze Sword automatically corrected his movements.

He channeled spiritual energy into the sword and hurled it forward.

The Bronze Sword soared into the air, hovered, and, at Ning Zhuo's command, began to swing its blade repeatedly, executing basic sword techniques and slashing through the air, just as it had when battling him moments earlier.

This was how the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor was used.

When restored, the fragments could be used as armor plates, providing close-fitting defense. As weapons, they could either be deployed to fight independently or wielded directly by the cultivator, allowing for precise control and perfect synchronization between man and weapon, amplifying their power.

"In the second stage of the Rising Cloud Trials, you can encounter up to nine bronze artifacts, meaning nine sets of Profound Armament Armor."

"According to the rules, collecting all nine sets here eliminates the need to participate in the third stage, guaranteeing first place. However, this is extremely rare. Throughout history, fewer than ten people have ever achieved this feat!"

"I definitely won't be able to do it."

Ning Zhuo had always been keenly aware of his limitations.

"I'm weaker in this area than others."

"Therefore, I need to make the most of the second stage, seizing every learning opportunity to prepare for my final showdown with Ban Ji in the third stage!"

"In the end, my score might still be lower than his."

"But that doesn't matter. As long as I can disrupt him and prevent him from collecting all nine sets in the third stage, I'll have achieved my goal."

Ning Zhuo knew that Ban Ji was skilled in close combat, proficient with swords and blades, and had mastered coordinated attack techniques.

He had been meticulously gathering intelligence on Ban Ji, placing great emphasis on this aspect of his preparations.

As Ning Zhuo pondered, he continued forward, still relying on his divine sense to clear the path. The second trial, like the first, tested the depth of one's divine sense.

Soon, the second bronze artifact appeared before him - a bronze saber.

Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo drew his sword to face the saber, beginning a new round of learning.

Ban Ji gripped a bronze throwing knife in one hand and a bronze flail in the other, moving with urgent haste.

"Damn it!"

"Among all weapons, my specialties are swords and blades. My dual-wielding technique, combining sword and blade, is one of my trump cards, having defeated many formidable foes."

"Why haven't I encountered a single sword or blade?"

"I know these artifacts appear randomly, relying solely on luck. But swords and blades are the most common weapons! Yet I've encountered two consecutive rare items - a throwing knife and a flail!"

Ban Ji's steps faltered as he spotted the third bronze artifact - a bronze mace.

"Aaaaargh! Where are the swords? Where are the blades? I need swords!"
