Chapter 796: Gu Qing Doesn't Understand

Zhu Guizhi knew it was impossible to continue fighting Ning Zhuo.

Her reason for meeting him in secret was to scout for intelligence. Before arriving at the Bluestone Grotto-Manor, she hadn't intended to spar with him at all. After all, she was a Golden Core-level cultivator, while Ning Zhuo was only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.

However, during the negotiation, Ning Zhuo had seized control of the conversation's rhythm and invited her to spar. Zhu Guizhi had accepted, hoping to use the results of a physical confrontation to intimidate him. But as they fought, she realized the reality was far from what she had anticipated.

Even after summoning two gods, she had failed to take him down.

"The mechanical puppet he brought out first possesses characteristics similar to Eternal Ice. It can absorb external attacks, continuously accumulating power within its body before suddenly detonating with terrifying might".

"If it were just one explosion, that would be fine".

"The trouble is, Ning Zhuo can rapidly repair it. Given his proficiency, he likely manufactured this mechanical puppet himself".

Through this exchange, Zhu Guizhi had gained something: she had confirmed that Ning Zhuo’s primary path was indeed Mechanical Arts.

She decisively stopped the fight. She still had deeper reserves and a trump card - she could summon a third god. But if she did that, what would be the point?

She had already established that Ning Zhuo possessed Golden Core-level combat strength. What use was there in forcibly suppressing him?

"Based on his tone just now, he likely has a third Golden Core-level mechanism".

Even if he didn’t, Zhu Guizhi wouldn't continue. Everything required the right "heat" or timing. Continuing would make her look desperate, overstepping the bounds of the Righteous Path.

She looked at the big-headed youth before her, her mind filled with complex emotions.

Ning Zhuo likely possessed three Golden Core-level mechanical puppets and over a dozen Ghost Path Golden Cores. For a mere mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, this was an absurd amount of resources, even for a top-tier genius.

She suspected that Ning Zhuo’s status within his backing organization was quite high - perhaps the eldest legitimate son of a powerful family leader.

"This distribution of resources is abnormal".

"Even as the Foundation Establishment face of the Zhu Clan, Fanxiang doesn't have nearly this much support".

Restraining her emotions, Zhu Guizhi smiled at Ning Zhuo, suggesting they consider the spar a draw. She praised his strength, stating he could certainly compete to be a top-tier genius at this Flying Cloud Assembly.

Once he reached that status, his treatment would improve significantly - a crucial advantage for an outsider like him.

Ning Zhuo nodded. "That is precisely my goal".

He was blunt. Ever since he decided to stand out during the Demon Subjugation Hall's trials, this had been his objective. To achieve it, he had to participate in the Martial Arts Hall's trials and secure an impressive record.

What constituted an "impressive" record? One that made the public recognize him as one of the most unique existences among the first-rate geniuses. In every Flying Cloud Assembly, there were usually no more than five top-tier geniuses - often only one or two.

Ning Zhuo stared at Zhu Guizhi, noting that this encounter allowed him to witness the power of the Divine Summoning Art. He admitted his interest in the Zhu Clan's technique but reiterated that he had no intention of becoming a matrilocal son-in-law. He asked if there were other ways to acquire the art.

Zhu Guizhi could only offer a bitter smile.

Ning Zhuo was acting aggressively, which was the correct response. The greatest responsibility for this mess lay with Zhu Fanxiang. As a member of the Zhu Clan, she had failed to grasp the significance of the first layer of the Divine Summoning Art and had taught it away too easily.

This isn't my trouble, Ning Zhuo’s attitude suggested. It’s a problem for you and Zhu Fanxiang to solve.

He wasn't close enough to Fanxiang to bear this burden for her. He was willing to cooperate, but everything had a price.

His stance was clear: I won't simply help you solve your problem. If you try to treat me as part of the problem to be "resolved," then I will become a much bigger headache!

He handled the situation so maturely that Zhu Guizhi wondered if she was dealing with an old fox who had spent a lifetime in politics. She grew even more curious about the faction capable of raising such an outstanding junior.

Had she known he possessed such political acumen, she would have prepared more thoroughly before contacting him. Now, she was the one on the defensive.

However, the trip wasn't a total loss. She now knew exactly what kind of person Ning Zhuo was.

"It's no wonder Gu Qing was outmaneuvered by him".

Actually, Ning Zhuo’s proposal was viable. Zhu Guizhi knew that trading the Divine Summoning Art wasn't unprecedented in their history. Since the first layer was already used as a reward for sons-in-law, the clan was already prepared for it to leak. Why would they mind a trade? 

It all depended on the person - or rather, their strength.

Ning Zhuo’s personal cultivation was weak, but possessing Golden Core combat strength at the Foundation Establishment stage only proved how powerful he and his backers truly were.

Zhu Guizhi was tempted. If she facilitated a trade, Zhu Fanxiang’s mistake might be viewed as a contribution rather than a lapse in judgment.

It was a solution. However, she didn't agree immediately. Instead, she frowned, acting as though the matter was extremely difficult. She claimed she needed to return, consider it, and contact Fanxiang.

Ning Zhuo did not mind. Zhu Guizhi’s visit was just an interlude; he had plenty of other matters to attend to.

Zhu Guizhi left with complex emotions and headed to Zhu Fanxiang’s residence. A maid stopped her and went inside to report.

When Fanxiang heard her mother had arrived, she felt no joy. "A person like her always puts profit first. She's busy day and night; why would she suddenly come here?" 

Being clever, Fanxiang immediately suspected the truth: "Is it because I taught the first layer of the Divine Summoning Art to an outsider?" 

"I won't see her," Zhu Fanxiang muttered, her brow furrowing. She knew she only needed to explain herself to the official clan envoys; Zhu Guizhi, despite being her mother, had no authority to interrogate her.

The maid returned to Zhu Guizhi, informing her that Fanxiang was in secluded cultivation to heal her injuries and could not be disturbed.

Zhu Guizhi smiled bitterly but maintained an outward appearance of a "caring mother". "Arrange a room for me. I’ll stay here until Fanxiang finishes her session".

She was the biological mother; the maid had no choice but to obey. If she refused and word got out about their strained relationship, it would damage Fanxiang’s prestige and interests.

"This way, Madam," the maid guided her.

Along the way, Zhu Guizhi kept probing for information and quickly caught a critical piece of news.

"What? Fanxiang is going to battle Gu Qing?!" 

The maid confirmed she had seen the invitation and the reply. Zhu Guizhi, fresh from her encounter with Ning Zhuo, found the situation absurd.

"Given Gu Qing’s current predicament, he must have hand-picked his second opponent. From that perspective, it makes sense he would choose Fanxiang".

"But the problem is, Fanxiang and Ning Zhuo are secret allies. Isn't Gu Qing walking right into a trap?" 

"What was he thinking? Why pick the one person he absolutely shouldn't?" 

She offered a moment of silence for Gu Qing before considering whether she should warn her daughter to hold back and "leave some room for future meetings". There was no need to provoke a "crossing dragon" like Gu Qing.

But she quickly dismissed the thought. She knew she had zero influence over Fanxiang. If she had any sway over her daughter, she wouldn't have gone to see Ning Zhuo first.

-----
The Martial Arts Hall
On the vast gray-stone floor, two figures stood facing each other.

On one side was Gu Qing, dressed in moon-white scholar's robes, looking elegant and refined. On the other was Zhu Fanxiang in her hunting silks, her expression calm.

"Fellow Daoist Zhu," Gu Qing greeted with a smile, his voice as warm as jade. He did his best to project sincerity. "It is my honor to spar with you today. Let us use this match to foster friendship and mutual growth".

He glanced at the crowd of cultivators below, his words laden with meaning: "This encounter is for mutual improvement. Being able to witness this Flying Cloud Assembly at the Myriad Manifestations Sect is truly a privilege!" 

He couldn't use divine sense or speak too plainly; that would leave a trail or a weakness for others to exploit his "Righteous Path" reputation.

He stared at Zhu Fanxiang, his eyes practically screaming: Look at my clear, sincere gaze, Fellow Daoist! We are both of the Righteous Path. I am not your competitor. I’m just here for a while, then I’ll leave. Tacit understanding! Righteous Path understanding! 

Zhu Fanxiang looked at his flawless smile and snorted inwardly.

The next moment, her spiritual energy surged as she threw out a divine statue, drawing down a pillar of divine light.

"In the nine heavens and ten earths, Abundant Earth is supreme! Within the eight desolations and six directions, the prison is suppressed! Your believer, Fanxiang, respectfully invites the Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Monarch - descend upon this world!" 

Zhu Fanxiang had used her trump card from the very start! 

The light formed a massive pillar and then dissipated, revealing a deity three zhang tall. It was clad in dark-yellow rock armor, with molten gold flowing through the cracks - the avatar of the Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Monarch.

Gu Qing’s expression froze.

Zhu Fanxiang finally spoke: "Fellow Daoist Gu Qing, show me the full power of your avatar!" 

The Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Monarch struck! 

It raised a massive palm and pressed down. In an instant, the air in the Martial Arts Hall solidified. A phantom of a colossal rock hand descended with the world-suppressing aura of ages! 

BOOM!!

Dust filled the air as the gray-stone platform cracked and debris flew everywhere. Gu Qing’s painted avatar flew into the air, injured and looking disheveled.

"Zhu Fanxiang is actually going all out against me... Is this necessary?!" Gu Qing’s avatar took a deep breath, his hands moving rapidly to form complex mudras.

"Benevolence protects the body, virtue shines in all directions!" 

Literary Qi erupted from his body, forming a solid semi-transparent shield.

A moment later, the phantom palm of the True Monarch slammed into the shield.

CRASH!

Amidst the deafening roar, the shield - and Gu Qing’s painted avatar - were slammed into the ground.

Pfft.

The avatar coughed up blood, which turned into colored ink upon hitting the ground.

"Righteousness exists between heaven and earth, taking many forms!" 

The avatar chanted loudly, and each word transformed into solid golden characters that circled him, radiating a warm, healing aura.

The True Monarch’s attacks came again and again.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Divine light clashed with Literary Qi. Both sides were fighting with everything they had - a truly desperate struggle.

The cultivators below were dumbfounded. They had never seen a match turn so violent and white-hot right from the beginning. It was thrilling and terrifying.

Soon after...

BOOM!!!

Gu Qing’s final shield was shattered by the divine palm. The avatar inside was crushed, dissipating into countless specks of colored ink across the ruined ground.

Gu Qing’s main body stood at the edge of the battlefield, his face ashen. He had lost!

As the avatar of the Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Monarch slowly faded, Zhu Fanxiang looked at the ink stains on the ground and sighed softly.

"It still took twenty-nine breaths of time?" 

In that instant, Gu Qing’s pupils shrank to the size of needles!

"I..."

"ZHU FANXIANG!!!" 

There was no "tacit understanding," only a brutal, all-out war. Zhu Fanxiang’s soft whisper rang in Gu Qing’s ears louder than a dragon's roar.

She had actually used his painted avatar as a mere benchmark for comparison! 

Why treat me like this?! 

Aren't you and Situ Xing mortal enemies?! 

You should have teamed up with me against Ning Zhuo! We were potential allies! 

Gu Qing didn't understand. And it hurt.
