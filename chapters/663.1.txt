The Same Kind of Persistence

Greetings, everyone. Happy August.

The story arc in the Immortal City of White Paper was intentionally designed. The contrasting actions of Qing Chi and Ning Zhuo in the tributary of the River of Forgetfulness - one giving up, the other holding fast - may seem like opposites on the surface, but in truth, they resonate with the same persistent nature.

There’s still a significant hidden thread in this story, which will be revealed later. This change came about due to a mid-way restructuring of the plot.

By this point in the book, some of my intentions as a writer may have become apparent - namely, that this is a story about growth. This growth focuses on the inner self. Ning Zhuo's active pursuit of growth, his journey out of the mountains to see the world and seek redemption, also reflects my own attitude toward life and personal trajectory.

Sigh…

It’s been a long time since I’ve had a chat with you like this. In fact, over the past three or four months, I’ve barely spoken even with the operations team.

I’ve just been too exhausted!

When I launched the new book in 2024, I was basically writing all day. Staying up until 3 or 4 a.m. was routine. The only time I got any fresh air was around 5 p.m., when I’d go out for a 30-minute walk and soak up some sunlight.

(What can I say? I’m not the fastest writer. I’ve embarrassed the industry - my bad! Haha.)

At the time, I thought that was already an incredibly demanding lifestyle.

But in 2025, I realized I was wrong - things can get even more tiring, more hectic, more stressful!

During this period, I’ve been immersing myself in real-world experiences, connecting with talents from various industries, and working to find and plan out a way to “save the tree” (revive the series/world/project).

It’s like being a lump of iron, forged and hammered in a furnace - trying to adapt, constantly shaken both physically and mentally.

I’ve been leveling up my skills in business, management, and social interaction.

Some of you might have seen the related video on Bilibili titled “The Most Accurate Restoration of the Great Love Immortal Lord.” At its peak, it ranked ninth site-wide and has garnered over 3 million views. That’s just a small part of what I’ve been working on behind the scenes - a rare visible result.

There are times I collapse in my chair too exhausted to move a finger. Other times I’m so anxious I can’t sleep all night. Along the way, I’ve met all kinds of people and even made friends with some like-minded individuals.

Of course, all of this came with a cost! (I’ll share more fun stories in a livestream when I get the chance.)

One big flaw I’ve discovered about myself: I’m too optimistic when it comes to predicting progress. (That same optimism, though, has also helped me slog through a lot of tough mud.)

Right now, I’m still in the thick of adjusting. I can only do my best to keep updating.

Thankfully, as I continue leveling up, I’ve been adapting better. For example, I’ve recently been able to update more consistently.

At this point, I must be honest - there will still be times when I need to take breaks.

I fully accept all the criticism and misunderstandings from everyone.

After all, since I chose to “save the tree,” it’s my responsibility to carry that burden.

Thank you all for your support and feedback!

Things are slowly improving now. As certain systems and structures begin to stabilize, I’ll gradually have more time. That’s the current trend.

As for the missed updates, there’s a chance I can make them up in Q4.

(I’ll be more cautious with future promises to avoid over-optimism.)

We’re still in the middle of the second major arc, and the upcoming chapters should align more with the style of modern web novels - in other words, more straightforwardly satisfying.

Please don’t set your expectations too high for the update volume, though!

Thank you for sticking with me through it all.

Oh, right - 

Some readers mentioned that it’s been several months since we had any merchandise giveaways.

That’s true - I’ve just been too drained to put energy into that.

Thankfully, we’ve got the operations team!

...The rest is about the giveaways.
