Chapter 762: The contest of strength and weakness

The sparring match between Tie Zheng and Ao Pan drew the attention of nearly everyone present.

Both were Golden Core-level cultivators, though the Formation here suppressed their cultivation, reducing their displayed power to the peak of Foundation Establishment.

Yet their actual combat prowess remained among the highest of all participants.

One was a Martial Cultivator, the other a Body Cultivator, making them naturally suited for the Profound Armor Cave's Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

Including Lu Zeng, all three Golden Core cultivators were potential victors. Perhaps this clash between Tie Zheng and Ao Pan would foreshadow the final winner!

Tie Zheng and Ao Pan stood facing each other.

Tie Zheng's bronze beast-head mask glinted sharply, his eyes blazing with intensity. The twelve beast-head bronze bells at his waist trembled slightly.

Ao Pan, hunched over with a face as sharp as a blade, possessed mismatched eyes - one large, one small - hinting at some peculiar ability.

Ao Pan's gaze swept over Tie Zheng, then abruptly fixed on the joints of his opponent's body.

With a low growl, his hunched frame coiled like a compressed spring, suddenly unleashing a burst of explosive force.

Ao Pan lunged forward, initiating the attack.

As he moved, a Profound Armament Armor flew from his sleeve, rapidly transforming into a bronze sword.

The sword tip trembled slightly, like a viper poised to strike. Its blade radiated an eerie green glow, carrying a bone-chilling aura that pierced straight toward Tie Zheng's heart!

A chorus of gasps erupted.

This bronze weapon not only possessed energy but also radiated an artistic aura, unmistakably the seventh Profound Armament Armor.

Ban Ji watched, his breath catching in his throat, consumed by envy.

"If I had a sword like that, my chances of victory would skyrocket!"

But he didn't.

His final acquisition was a bronze saber, his fifth Profound Armament Armor.

By the sixth, he had indeed obtained a sword. However, having exhausted too much energy, he was forced into a stalemate, unable to secure it before the third trial began.

A bitter disappointment!

Beneath the Iron Ferocious Beast's mask, Tie Zheng's gaze sharpened. He clenched his fist in the Void, and his own Profound Armament Armor flew forth, transforming into... a cleaver.

The cleaver was heavy, its blade gleaming with a cold, hard, profound light.

Tie Zheng raised the cleaver high, meeting the sword's radiance with a ferocious downward chop!

His technique was simple and direct, the blade's glow restrained, yet radiating an aura of unwavering strength and sharpness, capable of cleaving through any material.

Another wave of gasps swept through the crowd.

For this cleaver, too, was the seventh Profound Armament Armor!

"A cleaver!" Ban Ji's pupils dilated instantly, greed surging within him.

"Even a cleaver is still a blade!"

"Such a fine blade... if only I had one like that..."

Clang!

In the next instant, blade met blade. A piercing, metallic shriek tore through the cavern air, shredding the eardrums of the spectators.

The air exploded, unleashing a shockwave of golden light and blade energy.

Ao Pan and Tie Zheng both retreated, their feet digging into the cavern floor, cracking the stone inch by inch.

Their gazes locked with even greater intensity as they lunged at each other.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

A rapid series of blade clashes erupted like popping beans, sparks flying in all directions.

The battle reached a stalemate.

Both combatants wielded seventh-grade Profound Armament Armor, their durability roughly equal.

During the fierce exchange, Ao Pan's eyes narrowed slightly. He noticed fine chips and cracks appearing on his bronze sword.

In contrast, Tie Zheng's cleaver remained gleaming and pristine, showing almost no signs of wear.

"We both have the same Profound Armament Armor, forged from Azure Flow Copper. Why is his weapon so much more durable?"

"Is it enhanced by his Innate Talent? Or is it due to the inherent toughness of his martial arts?"

Realizing he was at a disadvantage in direct clashes, Ao Pan shook his body, unleashing three more Profound Armament Armor pieces. Each transformed into a weapon and attacked Tie Zheng.

Tie Zheng responded in kind, launching three Profound Armament Armor pieces of his own, using offense as defense.

Though taciturn, once engaged in combat, he displayed a savage, bestial aggression.

The watching cultivators were riveted.

Ning Zhuo was no exception.

Concentrating intently, he secretly assessed: Tie Zheng and Ao Pan's martial arts realms both exhibit characteristics of master-level practitioners, surpassing my own.

"In close combat, I can't match them. This aligns with my expectations."

"As for their control over the armaments, it leaves much to be desired."

Tie Zheng is a Martial Cultivator, while Ao Pan is a Body Cultivator, neither of whom specializes in Mechanism Art. Ning Zhuo's mastery of Mechanism Art has reached the level of a renowned master, surpassing both of them. He immediately recognized numerous flaws in their techniques.

Ban Ji snorted coldly. His understanding of Mechanism Art far exceeded Ning Zhuo's, so he naturally saw the shortcomings of Tie Zheng and Ao Pan as well.

The sparring continued.

Gradually, Ao Pan gained the upper hand.

While his weapon couldn't match Tie Zheng's cleaver in direct clashes, his skill in commanding the Profound Armament Armor far surpassed Tie Zheng's.

The more the Profound Armament Armor was utilized, the more Ao Pan's advantage became apparent.

Ning Zhuo quickly assessed the situation: "Both of them have acquired the seventh Profound Armament Armor. There likely isn't an eighth one."

According to the intelligence he had gathered, the sixth Profound Armament Armor consumed spiritual energy, the seventh emanated an aura of intent, and the eighth would allow the user to manipulate momentum, creating a battlefield perfectly suited to their strengths.

The Profound Armament Armor grew increasingly powerful with each successive piece.

"Based on historical records, very few cultivators have ever managed to subdue the eighth Profound Armament Armor."

"If Tie Zheng and Ao Pan possessed the eighth Profound Armament Armor, they would have revealed it during this crucial sparring match."

The eighth Profound Armament Armor possessed immense combat power, making it unnecessary to conceal. Deploying it immediately could very well determine the outcome of the battle.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Six or seven weapons orbited Tie Zheng and Ao Pan, swords clashing against blades, staffs parrying spears, the chaotic battle dazzling the eye.

Using divine sense, the two secretly agreed to retreat simultaneously, abruptly ceasing their combat.

Both maintained their composure, avoiding a deadly clash from the outset.

As Tie Zheng had stated, this was merely a "sparring match."

The arena wasn't empty; other Foundation Establishment cultivators and a Golden Core cultivator were present.

If the two fought to the death, wouldn't Lu Zeng simply reap the benefits as the victor?

Neither Tie Zheng nor Ao Pan was foolish.

They approached Lu Zeng together.

Lu Zeng's expression turned grave, sensing something ominous.

Tie Zheng spoke first, his tone stiff: "Fellow Daoist, have you obtained the seventh weapon? If so, you might as well reveal it now."

Ao Pan nodded in agreement. "Indeed, there's no need for further sparring."

After their brief exchange, they realized the Profound Armament Armor was surprisingly fragile against cultivators of their level, already riddled with dents and scratches.

They had just used their only opportunity to repair and maintain their Profound Armament Armor during the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

With the third round barely underway, they couldn't afford to be the first to find themselves without usable armor.

Lu Zeng frowned deeply at their question. "Fellow Daoists, who will strike first? Whoever attacks first will be my primary target!"

Lu Zeng couldn't produce a seventh set of Profound Armament Armor because he had failed to create it.

In this desperate situation, he could only maintain his position by projecting a fierce demeanor.

But in the next moment, Tie Zheng and Ao Pan exchanged glances, both recognizing the other's intention.

"If that's the case..." Ao Pan smiled faintly and bowed slightly to Lu Zeng.

Tie Zheng added, "Forgive us, Fellow Daoist."

After agreeing on a plan, they attacked simultaneously!

Lu Zeng sighed helplessly and braced himself for the fight.

From the start, Tie Zheng and Ao Pan gained the upper hand. Not only did they have a numerical advantage, but as Body Cultivators and Martial Cultivators, they excelled in close combat. Lu Zeng, a true Mechanism Cultivator, could only retreat again and again.

Ning Zhuo watched the back-and-forth clash, his eyes reflecting the trio's movements. He analyzed inwardly, "Tie Zheng and Ao Pan's combat prowess here is likely among the very best."

"For the strongest and second strongest to join forces against the third strongest is a wise decision."

"If I were in their position, I would do the same."

As he watched the sparks fly from the three-way battle, the cave walls crumble under their shifting movements, and stone fragments rain down, Ning Zhuo assessed his own combat capabilities.

"Lu Zeng's mastery of Mechanism Art is at least at the Grandmaster level! If he also possesses a seventh piece of Profound Armament Armor, the situation will become far more complex. It could even lead to the three Golden Core cultivators uniting to eliminate the other cultivators first."

"Each of them is stronger than me. This current situation is actually advantageous to me."

The three Golden Core cultivators were each hundreds of years old, while Ning Zhuo was barely in his teens - a mere fraction of their age.

Close-quarters combat had never been Ning Zhuo's specialty, so it was only natural that he couldn't match them.

"Lu Zeng's defeat seems inevitable."

"Once he's eliminated, will the remaining two Golden Core cultivators join forces against us, or will they turn on each other?"

Ning Zhuo tried to analyze Tie Zheng and Ao Pan's personalities.

"Tie Zheng is a solitary figure, hunting and living alone in the mountains. Ao Pan favors a long whip, his fighting style emphasizing evasion and using flexibility to counter brute force."

"Neither of them are the type to care about saving face. There's a very high chance they'll team up against us Foundation Establishment cultivators!"

Ning Zhuo's mind raced as he swiftly scanned his surroundings.

The Foundation Establishment cultivators exchanged glances, already restless and eager to act.

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth. "The best strategy right now would be for us Foundation Establishment cultivators to unite and fight the two Golden Core cultivators together."

"But... that's unlikely."

His gaze locked onto Ban Ji, who glared back fiercely.

"Kill him!"

"Let's attack together and take him down first!"

"Whoever hesitates is a coward! If you join the Myriad Manifestations Sect later as a Fellow Sect Member, I'll despise you for life!"

Many cultivators shouted at each other, forming a makeshift alliance and charging toward... Zhang Wangxing!

Zhang Wangxing: ???!!

Relying on his primary cultivation technique, the Flesh Transformation Sutra, Zhang Wangxing had achieved early victories. However, by the fourth Profound Armament Armor, he had suffered severe losses.

By the sixth armor, he could only barely defend himself, passively enduring attacks until the third trial began.

When he arrived at the cavern, he was nothing more than a pool of mud-like flesh, barely concealing a few bronze artifacts.

Fortunately, this period was specifically designated for rest and weapon repairs, prohibiting cultivators from attacking each other.

Zhang Wangxing seized the opportunity to reshape his body and take a deep, ragged breath.

He hadn't anticipated that when the free-for-all began, he would become the first target of concentrated fire.

"No... I got beaten up in the second round, and now I'm getting beaten up again in the third?!"

"In the second round, only one weapon attacked me. Now, five or six cultivators and twenty or thirty weapons are all targeting me?!"

"Do you really think I'm that easy to bully?!"

Zhang Wangxing's eyes turned bloodshot as he roared in fury, activating his five pieces of Profound Armament Armor to retaliate.

The crowd grew excited.

"Look, he only has five pieces!"

Zhang Wangxing roared: "You only have five pieces too!"

"He's the weakest one here!"

Zhang Wangxing bellowed: "You're the weak one! You're the weakest!"

"Take him down first! Take him down first!"

Zhang Wangxing bluffed: "Come on, come on! Whoever attacks first will get a beating they won't forget!"

"Fellow Daoist Zhang, why don't you just concede? I hate ganging up on you."

Zhang Wangxing, enraged: "Hypocrite! You're the one hitting the hardest!"

Several heavy bronze battle axes crashed down, while razor-sharp bronze swords struck with cunning precision. A bronze hammer swung in a wide arc, carrying a violent gust of wind as it aimed for Zhang Wangxing's head.

None of the cultivators held back. The Profound Armor Cave's Grand Formation effectively prevented serious injuries and fatalities, a fact repeatedly proven throughout countless Rising Cloud Minor Trials.

In moments, Zhang Wangxing's newly donned, wide-sleeved gray robe was pierced and slashed into tattered rags, barely clinging to his body like scraps of cloth.

Forced to bare his smooth, muscular legs, Zhang Wangxing sprinted frantically through the cavern.

He darted from left to right, then back again, a swarm of Cultivators hot on his heels.

Thwack!

A bronze longsword pierced his left chest with brutal precision, but Zhang Wangxing's heart wasn't there.

Two bronze battle-axes fell almost simultaneously! One aimed for his exposed nape, revealed by a cave-in, while the other targeted his abdomen. With no escape, Zhang Wangxing violently bent his upper body to the right at the last possible moment.

His spine cracked with a sickening snap, as if crushed by an invisible giant hand.

The axe aimed at his nape merely shaved off a few strands of hair. But the axe targeting his abdomen buried itself deep into his left ribs.

Zhang Wangxing struggled to maintain his desperate sprint, but a bronze hammer slammed into his back.

Pfft!

Zhang Wangxing coughed violently, spewing a mouthful of blood mixed with fragments of his internal organs.

Just then, he stumbled near Ban Ji.

"Young Master Ban Ji, help me! Help me just this once! I'll repay you, I swear I will!" Zhang Wangxing pleaded.

Ban Ji retreated without hesitation.

Undeterred, Zhang Wangxing tried to close the distance, but the Rust Disaster Craftsman ruthlessly forced him back.

Cornered, Zhang Wangxing had no choice but to change direction and continue his desperate flight.

He barely escaped with his life, fleeing to Ning Zhuo's vicinity and crying out in a gravely wounded voice, "Young Master Ning Zhuo! Young Master! Save me, please save me! I'll be your slave, I'll help you deal with Ban Ji for free!"

"Just lend me a hand, just one hand!"

"I can't accept defeat now, I refuse to accept it!!"

Ning Zhuo shook his head silently and immediately moved aside.

He remembered their first encounter outside Profound Armor Cave, when Zhang Wangxing had demanded a high price and even threatened Ning Zhuo, implying that Ban Ji might hire him instead.

Now the situation had devolved into this.

It was truly awkward!

Zhang Wangxing's reputation was poor, and Ning Zhuo certainly wouldn't risk public outrage to defend a cultivator he'd only just met.

However, just as Ning Zhuo began to retreat, Zhang Wangxing suddenly unleashed a burst of spiritual energy and flung a chain toward him.

"Ning Zhuo, where do you think you're going?!"

Simultaneously, several of the cultivators pursuing him from behind also attacked Ning Zhuo.

It was a trap!
