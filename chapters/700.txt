Chapter 700: Three-Person Joint Cultivation

To rent a cave abode, one had to go to the Hall of Internal Affairs.

Ning Zhuo already had an acquaintance there: Cao Gui.

He had previously collaborated with Cao Gui to deal with Yu Heye.

After some deliberation, Ning Zhuo decided to seek him out again.

When Cao Gui saw Ning Zhuo, he narrowed his eyes and asked directly, "Fellow Daoist Ning, are you friend or foe?"

Ning Zhuo smiled. "Naturally, we are allies."

Cao Gui shook his head. "If that's the case, why have you repeatedly accepted Yu Heye's invitations to banquets?"

Yu Heye had offended the Cao Clan years ago.

As a member of the Cao Clan, one of Cao Gui's reasons for agreeing to cooperate with Ning Zhuo was to make trouble for Yu Heye.

Another reason was Cao Gui's relative poverty; Ning Zhuo's offered compensation was substantial.

Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in a respectful bow and said sincerely, "My conflict with Yu Heye was merely a minor misunderstanding, now resolved. As a newcomer, making peace with a Golden Core cultivator is the proper course of action."

"I believe this shouldn't affect our friendship, Fellow Daoist Cao Gui."

"After all, the Cao Clan is the Cao Clan, and you are you. Given your current circumstances, how much support does your family truly provide?"

Cao Gui sighed deeply. "Though I'm considered an outsider in the clan, I secured this position through family connections."

"How could I forget my roots?"

With that, he waved his sleeve. "I understand your choice, Fellow Daoist Ning. From now on, we shall be strangers."

Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, clasped his hands in a formal salute, and said, "Fellow Daoist, your righteousness is admirable. It is my misfortune that I am unworthy of being your friend. Farewell!"

Cao Gui watched Ning Zhuo depart before turning back to his work.

Ning Zhuo rode a cloud away from the Hall of Internal Affairs to another location.

His expression remained impassive. Cao Gui's change in attitude was one of the scenarios he had anticipated.

Originally, Ning Zhuo's plan had been to use the opportunity of dealing with Yu Heye to cultivate closer ties with the Cao Clan. Despite their decline, the Cao Clan remained a significant power among the old Four Peaks.

But then an unexpected event occurred: Yu Heye voluntarily submitted.

As a Golden Core cultivator, his submission carried far greater value, and Ning Zhuo naturally chose the latter.

This meant the breakdown of his relationship with Cao Gui. Today's meeting confirmed this.

"Becoming strangers... this outcome is neither good nor bad."

At least they hadn't become enemies.

Having confirmed this new dynamic, Ning Zhuo put the Cao Clan matter out of his mind.

It's impossible to please everyone. In other words, maintaining good relations with every faction and individual is impossible, especially in a competitive environment where one must vie for cultivation resources.

Between the Cao Clan and Yu Heye, Ning Zhuo had chosen the latter.

Between Shen Xi and Pi Fujie, Ning Zhuo chose the former.

When the time came, he had to pick a side.

In politics, neutrality was often the most dangerous position. Loyalty that wasn't absolute was considered absolute disloyalty.

Only by aligning himself with a faction could he deepen his relationships.

Ning Zhuo's political acumen was more than sufficient for this.

Half an hour later, Ning Zhuo stood inside the Azure Stone Cave Mansion, his newly rented abode.

The cave mansion comprised five rooms and a main hall.

The moss-covered stone hall served as a reception area. The cultivation chamber was paved with azure jade bricks engraved with a Qi Gathering Formation. The Pill and Artifact Chamber featured an Earthfire Formation, sufficient for basic alchemy and artifact crafting. The two living quarters were sparsely furnished.

The final room was the Martial Training Chamber, equipped with a Martial Training Formation - the primary reason Ning Zhuo had chosen this cave mansion.

His affairs at the Jade Cleansing Pavilion were settled, leaving only the Luoshu Page unresolved - a task that would take time.

Moreover, Yu Heye had become a hidden asset for Ning Zhuo. Lingering there would only draw unwanted attention.

Having recently made an enemy of Pi Fujie, Ning Zhuo knew he would inevitably make more. Withdrawing now was the wisest course.

Gongsun Yan's arrival made the original cave abode too cramped.

Ning Zhuo assigned the two living quarters in the Azure Stone Cave Mansion to Old Chef and Qing Chi, respectively. The rooms were virtually empty, allowing them to furnish them as they pleased.

As for Gongsun Yan, he would reside in the Pill and Artifact Chamber.

Ning Zhuo didn't even have his own living quarters; the Martial Training Chamber would have to suffice.

His requirements in this regard were minimal.

After settling the arrangements, Ning Zhuo activated the Formation within the Martial Training Chamber and entered the Formation Space.

The Martial Arts Hall's fees were actually quite reasonable, but Ning Zhuo dared not risk exposing Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's spiritual energy.

Within the Formation Space, he unleashed several rounds of Five Elements Spells, causing ripples to spread across the transparent barrier of the Formation Space, effectively probing its defensive strength.

Instead of immediately releasing Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, Ning Zhuo left the Azure Stone Cave Mansion alone.

He returned to Yu Heye's mountain peak and, using the mountain's teleportation stone chamber, conducted a secret exchange with Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong returned to the Azure Stone Cave Mansion, while Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged before the Water Vortex Formation.

During this time, Sun Lingtong had made significant progress in his research of the Water Vortex Formation. He had constructed a small auxiliary Formation outside the main one.

Through this auxiliary Formation, Ning Zhuo could now communicate with the core of the Water Vortex Formation - the Luoshu Page. This spared Sun Lingtong from having to constantly rely on his Innate Talent, which was exhausting.

By using the auxiliary Formation, Ning Zhuo was influenced by the Dao Artifact. Through the Life Hanging by a Thread technique, Sun Lingtong also managed to tap into the Luoshu Page's influence.

Carrying this influence, Sun Lingtong meticulously inspected the Azure Stone Cave Mansion's Formations, confirming their security before quietly departing.

Throughout the entire process, Old Chef, Qing Chi, and Gongsun Yan remained completely unaware.

There was no need to inform them.

Sun Lingtong's mastery of formations far surpassed Ning Zhuo's. Moreover, with the aid of the Luoshu Page, the results of this inspection were highly likely to be accurate.

Crucially, the Mechanism Ring had shown no reaction when Ning Zhuo chose this cave abode.

Cave abodes of this caliber typically catered to wealthy Foundation Establishment cultivators, a demographic abundant within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

Unless Ning Zhuo was extraordinarily unlucky and had chosen one exceptional cave abode out of millions, why would anyone specifically target him?

But when it came to luck, Ning Zhuo was no slouch.

After the White Paper Immortal City incident, he had earned the favor of Yang Heaven, ensuring his fortune would never be poor. However, at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main headquarters, this Qi Luck manifested less conspicuously. Every super-faction possessed unique treasures to suppress and regulate Qi Luck.

Considering all these factors, Ning Zhuo was virtually certain the Azure Stone Cave Mansion was safe.

Only after secretly exchanging information with Sun Lingtong did he retrieve Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom from within the Martial Training Formation.

Using the Life Hanging by a Thread technique, he covertly established a connection with the Mechanical Puppet. Concealing his own form, he then unleashed a swarm of Mechanism Beasts to besiege Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui found herself surrounded by Mechanism Beasts, but she retaliated fiercely, tearing wave after wave of the mechanical creatures to shreds.

During each battle, Ning Zhuo deliberately left openings, allowing Snow-Colored Maiden Hui moments to rest. After all, her spiritual energy was the primary driver of the Puppet, and controlling it consumed her reserves.

After each victory, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui would tilt her head slightly upward, standing proudly amidst the wreckage.

Through Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo could clearly sense her spiritual energy naturally expressing emotions with each triumph. His connection to Snow-Colored Maiden Hui grew increasingly clear.

"My guess must be correct," he mused.

"Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's defining trait is pride."

"By continuously satisfying this aspect of her nature, I can help her express her emotions and accelerate her passage through the Spirit Activation Stage."

But the good times wouldn't last.

As Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's victories mounted, the pride she derived from each battle diminished.

Even when Ning Zhuo deliberately increased the difficulty - by deploying more ordinary Mechanism Beasts or enhancing his control over them - the pride she expressed after each victory noticeably waned.

When the returns dwindled to a certain point, Ning Zhuo decisively halted the exercise.

"The joy derived from repeating the same task inevitably diminishes. Even ordinary people would grow numb after doing something too many times."

"Then it's time to switch to something else."

Ning Zhuo, well-acquainted with Ning Xiaohui, naturally associated this with talisman crafting.

During her lifetime, Ning Xiaohui had been remarkably skilled in talisman crafting.

Ning Zhuo summoned Qing Chi to the Martial Training Chamber.

This time, he manifested himself and instructed Qing Chi and Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom to sit cross-legged before him.

Qing Chi first observed the Mechanical Puppet with curiosity, marveling at her beauty, before her gaze fixed on Ning Zhuo. Even with her memory loss, a deep sense of attachment was evident.

Qing Chi always responded enthusiastically to Ning Zhuo's summons.

Ning Zhuo said, "Today, I've called you here to teach you the fundamentals of talisman crafting. Watch closely!"

With that, Ning Zhuo demonstrated by crafting a Light Body Talisman right before them.

The talisman's effect was to reduce the target's weight. When affixed to a mortal and activated, it allowed them to tread snow without leaving a trace and dart across grass with lightning speed, instantly transforming them into masters of light body techniques.

After demonstrating once, Ning Zhuo instructed Qing Chi and Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom to attempt crafting the talisman themselves.

Qing Chi blushed, realizing she had been too absorbed in gazing at Ning Zhuo's face to clearly observe the crafting process.

In contrast, Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom, whose spiritual energy originated from Ning Xiaohui, was utterly captivated by Ning Zhuo's demonstration. She stared intently at his every movement, motionless and completely focused.

Ning Zhuo instructed both women to begin their attempts at talisman crafting.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui remained motionless for a long while before finally beginning. Her movements were stiff and mechanical, and she quickly failed.

Failing to create a talisman could result in minor consequences like draining spiritual energy and mental focus, or severe repercussions like backlash.

Fortunately, the Light Body Talisman was a low-level, simple technique. Both Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Qing Chi possessed sufficient reserves to withstand the negative effects of repeated failures.

After each failure, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui endured the consequences.

Qing Chi faced similar setbacks, but her movements grew increasingly swift, her progress rapid, and her success drew ever closer.

Ning Zhuo was secretly astonished. "When I first learned this talisman, my progress was even slower than hers. I never imagined she had such innate talent in this Cultivation art!"

He glanced at Snow-Colored Maiden Hui. Connected by Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo could clearly sense her growing anxiety.

Clearly, she was deeply interested in talisman creation and had noticed Qing Chi's rapid progress. She refused to be outdone.

Turning his gaze to Qing Chi, Ning Zhuo saw her brow furrowed in concentration, her expression utterly focused.

Even without the Life Hanging by a Thread connection, he could easily guess her thoughts: "I must give this my all! If I can't even surpass a Mechanical Puppet, Young Master Ning Zhuo will surely be deeply disappointed in me."

Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly. "I'm sorry, Qing Chi."

He used Life Hanging by a Thread to connect with Qing Chi, subtly influencing her fingertips.

Qing Chi was crafting a talisman when her movements suddenly distorted, drawing an absurdly curved line that immediately ruined her work.

Her brow furrowed deeply. Assuming her technique was flawed, she immediately started again.

With Ning Zhuo's deliberate interference, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui gradually surpassed Qing Chi's progress and ultimately completed her talisman first.

She threw her head back, her posture even more exaggerated than when she had defeated the tiger demon!

Ning Zhuo felt a surge of satisfaction. Through Life Hanging by a Thread, he could sense Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom's overwhelming pride, the strongest he had ever witnessed.

"This path is the right one!"

Qing Chi, on the other hand, was on the verge of tears.

Why am I so useless? Every time it matters, my fingers betray me, twisting into these distorted movements!

I can't even beat a Mechanical Puppet! How can I bear this humiliation?

As for why the Mechanical Puppet moved with such agility, Qing Chi, having lost her memories and lacking common sense, didn't find it strange at all.

Ning Zhuo nodded, praising Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom, which triggered another wave of her smug pride. Then, he comforted and encouraged Qing Chi.

The young girl bit her tiger tooth, deeply moved, and vowed to work even harder.

Ning Zhuo then instructed both sides to compete again.

This time, Qing Chi poured all her effort into the task, and Ning Zhuo refrained from interfering. As expected, she made significant progress. However, just as she was halfway through crafting her talisman, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui successfully completed another one.

"Since it's a mechanism, does that mean once it's made successfully once, every subsequent attempt will succeed?" Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with insight as he keenly observed that Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's talisman-crafting motions were identical to her previous attempts.

Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin didn't count as his creation, but Ning Zhuo had crafted the Puppet bodies for Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu. However, both of those were combat-oriented, and he hadn't taught them any cultivation techniques.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's situation was entirely new to him.

He felt he had guessed the truth.

Next, he began experimenting.

Sure enough, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui successfully crafted a talisman every time, her movements perfectly consistent.

With Ning Zhuo's covert interference removed, Qing Chi's speed also increased rapidly after crafting her first Light Body Talisman. Given the talisman's basic and simple nature, she never failed.

Yet each time, she still couldn't surpass Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.

"Once Little Hui masters talisman crafting, her speed will naturally be the fastest."

"Qing Chi's potential is far from exhausted. If they compete another ten times, her speed will likely surpass Little Hui's."

"Each successful talisman creation fills her with far greater pride than any battle against a Mechanical Beast."

"It seems Snow-Colored Maiden Hui has inherited some of Ning Xiaohui's traits from her past life. She's more inclined toward talisman crafting than combat!"

With this realization, Ning Zhuo immediately reclassified the Mechanical Puppet from a combat-oriented model to a production-oriented one.

"She should still possess some combat capabilities to fill the power gap while Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu are repairing the Void."

"But in truth, she's better suited for crafting talismans."

"Once her spiritual energy matures, I should equip her with a Cultivation Art specifically for talisman creation!"

"Of course, before that, I'll have her try all the Hundred Crafts of Cultivation to fully assess her true potential."

Ning Zhuo had a strong feeling that talisman crafting was Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's true calling. But to be certain, he still needed to test her in all the Cultivation arts.

Seeing Qing Chi about to surpass Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, Ning Zhuo decisively announced, "Alright, next I'll teach you the second type of talisman."

Qing Chi let out a small sound of disappointment, but Ning Zhuo had already begun demonstrating. She had no choice but to set aside her regret and focus on observing intently.

Having learned from her previous mistakes, Qing Chi observed this time with meticulous care.

Yet when she tried crafting the talisman herself, she still made frequent errors.

"What am I doing wrong?"

"It shouldn't be this difficult! Why am I so nervous?"

"Am I... trying too hard to impress the Young Master?"

Qing Chi grew increasingly anxious, and her doubts began to surface.

Meanwhile, Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom's learning progress naturally lagged far behind Qing Chi's. After all, she was still at the Life Spirit Stage, not yet having advanced to the Wisdom Spirit Stage.

Ning Zhuo wouldn't let Qing Chi's doubts fester. He decisively rose, approached her, and took her hand. "Let me help you. Don't be nervous. Try to keep your fingers steady and avoid trembling."

Whoosh!

Qing Chi felt as if she could hear the sound of hot steam rushing from the top of her head.

In that moment, she felt like she was about to explode, her heart pounding wildly.

She stared blankly at Ning Zhuo's hand, which was holding hers, feeling as if she had fallen into a beautiful dream.

Ning Zhuo patiently guided her, explaining her mistakes with meticulous care, even more patiently than he would teach a young child.

Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo secretly observed Snow Maiden Hui, noting her progress as she repeatedly failed but gradually improved. He nodded in approval.

Qing Chi's expression stiffened, her entire body tensing. Her heart was no longer focused on crafting the talisman but remained fixed on Ning Zhuo, constantly sensing the warmth of his palm against hers.

She lost all track of time, feeling as if everything was indescribably wonderful!

It wasn't until Snow Maiden Hui successfully crafted another talisman and Ning Zhuo released her hand that Qing Chi snapped back to reality.

The Mechanical Puppet tilted its head back again, this time with an even greater arc.

The reason was simple: despite receiving more guidance, her opponent had still lost to her.

A wave of intense pride washed over her, radiating from her expression.

Ning Zhuo then instructed them to craft the second type of talisman, and Qing Chi quickly caught up again.

Awakened from her shock, Qing Chi began to focus all her energy and effort on creating talismans.

Yi Fu, relying on her talent, which surpassed even Ning Zhuo's, achieved a perfect success rate after her first successful talisman, and her speed continued to increase.

But just as she showed signs of surpassing Snow Maiden Hui again, Ning Zhuo decisively began teaching them both a third type of talisman.

After demonstrating once, Ning Zhuo instructed them to try it themselves.

Qing Chi's first stroke went crooked!

Overwhelmed with embarrassment, she mustered her courage and looked at Ning Zhuo with longing and anticipation. "Young Master, my talent for talisman creation is too poor. Please help me."

Ning Zhuo: ......

This time, he hadn't used Life Hanging by a Thread to influence her.

Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly, feigning ignorance, and once again guided Qing Chi's hand.

In this way, all three parties achieved their goals.

After most of the day had passed, Snow Maiden Hui still needed to continuously vent her emotions and hadn't directly advanced past the Spirit Transformation Stage.

Comparing her to Yuan Dasheng, Ning Zhuo secretly speculated, "Yuan Dasheng previously broke free from control and acted independently, venting his emotions with extreme intensity."

"Ning Xiaohui, however, is different. Her pride flows like a steady stream. Perhaps this determines that her progress will be a slow and steady grind."
