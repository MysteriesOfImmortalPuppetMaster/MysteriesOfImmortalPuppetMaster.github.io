Chapter 305: Prophetic Poem

In truth, such an excuse was rather flimsy. 

But having one was better than having none, and significantly so. 

Everyone could recognize this thin veil of pretense. Yet, under this veil, the Meng family's situation would fare considerably better. At the very least, they wouldn't become the target of public ire and widespread condemnation.

"Alright." Meng Hu was not unaware of the seriousness of the matter, he only hoped Meng Kui had some good ideas. 

Meng Kui informed Meng Hu in detail, explaining the situation and including his past actions and future plans.

Meng Hu felt puzzled, "Brother, if it were me, I would have acted directly long ago. Yet you remain stationed at the mountaintop, rarely making a move. You, a dignified Nascent Soul stage cultivator, are the sky of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. If you had acted continuously, the internal strife would have been quelled long ago."

Meng Kui smiled faintly, shaking his head slowly, "Not long after I emerged from the Immortal Palace, I used the Divine Calculation Incense, employing divine abilities to divine a prophetic poem. According to the prophecy, although I am at the Nascent Soul stage, the strongest in the city, frequent actions would not significantly affect the fate of the Lava Immortal Palace." 

Meng Hu extended his hand, "Brother, what is the prophecy? Let me take a good look." 

Meng Kui stroked his beard, "Just listen carefully." With that, he began to recite aloud:

"The Immortal Palace has a spirit leaning towards the Purple Gate,
True and false, friend and foe are hard to discern. 
The changing winds and clouds are all illusions, 
Only with immortal resources in hand is it real. 
Golden Core falls with empty sighs, 
When the volcano moves, the body remains unharmed.
Adults pursue objects in the water, 
Young ones contend to determine the world. 
Benefiting from all sides, patience reveals, 
Wait for the enemy's fatigue, then leap to ascend.
Right and wrong, gain and loss, all in a thought, 
The new master pacifies the people, filling old pits."

Upon hearing this prophetic poem, Meng Hu suddenly understood Meng Kui's actions. He was somewhat dissatisfied, muttering, "Brother, are you sure about this? I remember that the secret strategy of the Heavenly Bureau clearly stating â€” 'Those always relying on fate will surely be confused by it.'"

"I hear this prophecy is ambiguous in many places; it can be interpreted in any way. Only the last line is somewhat interesting."

"The new master pacifies the people, filling old pits... Pacifying the people... I've seen the intelligence, isn't Zhu Xuanji known as the 'Observer of Hidden Peace'? Could it be that he will be the master of the Immortal Palace? So, he is the enemy we need to watch the most?" 

"But the first line of the prophecy says the Immortal Palace leans towards our family, I'm confused." 

Meng Kui smiled faintly, "You don't need to understand it, just follow my orders. Watch." 

With that, Meng Kui pointed.

A small, exquisite flying stone of magical artifact level, barely noticeable, shot through the clouds and smoke with lightning speed. It pierced through the lava and continued downward, finally striking an old slumbering ape in the Demon Ape King's court, injuring and awakening it.

The old ape looked at its pierced hand and was immediately enraged. Erupting with Nascent Soul level aura, it rushed out of the court, heading towards the volcano's mouth.

Hearing the commotion of the old ape, the two Nascent Soul level fire snakes and flame lizards also became restless.

Roars thundered like explosions. 

The Nascent Soul level demon ape made a fierce entrance, punching directly at the spherical light shield.

Simultaneously, the fire snake and flame lizard appeared from two other locations, joining forces to attack the Lava Immortal Palace!

Meng Kui once again moved around, displaying his great hand seal.

With the addition of a Nascent Soul level demon beast, his previous strength was clearly insufficient, falling short by a large margin.

The remaining spherical light shield of the Lava Immortal Palace was quickly riddled with countless cracks by the demon ape's fists.

[...]

Zhou Nongying, having been eliminated, was in a room actively healing.

"The Sage of the Three Sects, merciful and compassionate, timely transported me out, preventing my death. But with my departure, the Zhou family has no hope of victory." Zhou Nongying was sighing when he heard the commotion of the Nascent Soul battle.

He walked out of the house, looked up, and was instantly shocked.

He happened to see the scene of the Fire Fusion Demon Ape's fist shadows flying and the spherical light shield shattering.

"It's over, the Nascent Soul level demon beast is about to invade the city!" Zhou Nongying's face showed a look of despair.

The next moment, a magical artifact level seal flew out, smashed down, and knocked back the Fire Fusion Demon Ape.

Meng Kui roared, "Don't even think about touching the Lava Immortal Palace! I, Meng Kui, am here! To succeed, you'll have to step over my corpse." His roar immediately stabilized some people's hearts, but it was not enough.

The Nascent Soul level fire snake opened its mouth, spewing out a river of flames. The river of fire spread, burning everything in its path.

The flame lizard lowered its head, ramming fiercely into the Lava Immortal Palace.

The Lava Immortal Palace tilted violently, like an iceberg lifting a corner. The raised part of the Lava Immortal Palace fell heavily back, stirring up a monstrous wave of lava.

The giant wave crashed down, immediately collapsing a large portion of the Immortal Palace's foundation and burying the remaining blood-stained mechanical constructs in the lava.

Following closely were the tens of thousands of Scarlet Flame Beasts that had landed from the fully breached outer perimeter of the Lava Immortal Palace, charging towards the inner circle.

The Command Platform, Five Elements Tower, and the army of mechanical constructs all operated at full capacity, trying to intercept more Scarlet Flame Beasts.

Fortunately, a large number of Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators had previously relocated from Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

These people filled the lines and formed small formations. These formations, like fortresses, blocked the tide of Scarlet Flame Beasts.

A fierce battle of attack and defense ensued!

Zhu Zhen's heart was pounding as he fought desperately. Then he noticed the ruins of the golden furnace.

Zhu Xuanji had previously instructed him on his task and at that moment the difficulty of the matter suddenly dropped, giving Zhu Zhen great hope in successfully completing it.

[...]

Outside, the Lava Immortal Palace was in intense turmoil, but in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, it remained calm.

Ning Zhuo used spirit stones. Surrounded by a mechanical battle team, he explored several Secret Pavilion rooms.

Bang.

After pushing open a door, he encountered the second cultivator that crossed his path.

It was Zheng Danlian!

Zheng Danlian was dodging a giant wooden hammer. He wanted to approach the center area to disable the mechanical traps and retrieve the pills deep within.

Seeing Ning Zhuo appear, Zheng Danlian showed a look of joy, "Ning Zhuo! You came just in time..." 

Bang.

Ning Zhuo closed the door again.

Zheng Danlian's words were stuck in his throat, his face instantly darkened.

"Due to the major opportunity shift, the possibility of encountering other cultivators has greatly increased." 

"Taking advantage of this opportunity, it would be best to meet up with Boss Sun!"

Zheng Danlian was not the best option, and he didn't have to pass through the Secret Pavilion room in front of him. He had many routes to choose from.

Thus, Ning Zhuo decisively withdrew, choosing another door and slipping through.

Not long after.

Three cultivators entered that Secret Pavilion room.

They were the Book Master, Song Fuli, and the Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple trio.

The Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core maintained a tracking spell. He scanned the area, then frowned, "Why are there two paths? He opened one door, then retreated, leaving through another door."

Song Fuli followed with a frown, "Could it be that he sensed our tracking and deliberately set up a maze?"

The Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple snorted coldly, "Simple! We'll open both doors and take a look, won't we?"

Thus, the Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core and Song Fuli each opened a door.

They successfully discovered the traces of Ning Zhuo's departure, as well as...

Zheng Danlian, still navigating the mechanical traps!

Of course, as they opened the door, Zheng Danlian also noticed them.

"Forget about Ning Zhuo, let's take him down first!" The Book Master made a decisive decision, charging into the Secret Pavilion first.

The Purple Dawn Pavilion's true disciple was somewhat reluctant, but knowing this was the best choice, he snorted coldly and followed.

Song Fuli was the third to follow.

Zheng Danlian's face changed.

Just one Book Master was enough to make him quite apprehensive. Now, there were also the Purple Dawn Pavilion's true disciple and Song Fuli. What chance of victory was there if a fight broke out?

Zheng Danlian immediately had the thought of retreating.

But the awkward part was, he was in the middle of mechanical traps, unable to move freely, with no way to withdraw in time.

By the time he reached the perimeter of the mechanical traps, the Book Master and the other two had already surrounded him.

"If you want to eliminate me, I'll take one of you with me!" Zheng Danlian shouted, issuing a threat.

The Book Master smiled slightly, "I don't believe you. Attack!" 

The three-on-one battle unfolded.

Zheng Danlian immediately fell into a disadvantage.

Forced into a corner, he had to completely abandon his retreat plan, continuously retreating into the depths of the mechanical traps.

He had been here for quite some time, nearing success in overcoming the traps, able to disable them.

In contrast, the Book Master and the other two had just arrived and were unfamiliar.

Zheng Danlian, relying on some geographical advantage, managed to temporarily stabilize his position.

But clearly, his situation remained precarious.

[...]

Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu ran side by side.

Yang Chanyu occasionally turned her head, looking at Sun Lingtong, "This serious and earnest expression of yours is rare."

Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes at her, "We've worked hard up to this point and now we're just one step away. Please give it your all. Once we seize the Immortal Palace, you won't be treated poorly."

Yang Chanyu, "I'm curious, even if we obtain the Immortal Palace, how will we face Meng Kui and the blockade formation, not to mention the surrounding beast tide?"

"We have a plan!" Sun Lingtong didn't want to say more.

If he could replace Yang Chanyu with Ning Zhuo, he wouldn't hesitate for a moment.

"Under the major opportunity shift, I managed to meet up with Yang Chanyu successfully." 

"But if Ning Zhuo is still alone, it would be quite dangerous."

"Sigh, if I could have returned the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng to him during the second palace examination stage, I'd feel more at ease at this moment."

"Someone!"

Sun Lingtong pushed open a door, discovering a figure sitting cross-legged and in the middle of a breathing technique.

After his initial disappointment, his eyes lit up again.

Yang Chanyu followed over the threshold, also showing a hint of interest, "Oh? It's Meng Chong."

Meng Chong, having defeated Zhou Nongying, paid a huge price himself.

Fortunately, he had previously obtained healing pills, and after taking them, his injuries were mostly healed, though his face remained pale.

What troubled him was that, unlike Ning Zhuo, he hadn't acquired any spirit stones. This forced him to rely on breathing techniques to accelerate the recovery of his Five Elements magical power.
