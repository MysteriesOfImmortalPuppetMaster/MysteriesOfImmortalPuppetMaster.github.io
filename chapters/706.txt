Chapter 706: Imitation and Comprehension

Ning Zhuo held the Intent Comprehension Brush, examining it closely.

The brush handle was made of yellow-green River Luo Jade, its natural patterns intertwining to form faint trigrams.

The brush cap was Kai Wood, scorched with lightning marks.

The brush tip was crafted from Autumn Frost White Yak Hair, shimmering with silver glints when held up to the light.

The entire brush radiated the aura of a magic treasure.

Ning Zhuo, Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran had discussed the brush extensively during their banquet, uncovering much about its history.

"Crafting an Intent Comprehension Brush inevitably invites calamity."

"This Golden Core-level brush must have endured at least three tribulations."

"The most fundamental is the Heart Demon Tribulation, which tests the Confucian cultivator's Literary Heart. Additionally, River Luo Jade, when extracted from water, often attracts Thunder Tribulation."

"The Thunderstruck Kai Wood used for the brush cap suggests that the River Luo Jade suffered Thunder Tribulation during extraction, lacking proper protection and becoming tainted by thunder Qi. The thunderstruck wood was likely used to compensate for this material flaw."

"As for the nature of the third tribulation..."

Given Ning Zhuo's current mastery of Confucian cultivation and artifact refinement, he couldn't discern it.

During the banquet, Ning Zhuo showed the treasured brush to Bai Liu Kong and the other two cultivators, but none of them could discern any peculiarities.

This lack of understanding didn't deter Ning Zhuo from using it.

He immediately channeled his Five Elements Spiritual Power into the Intent Comprehension Brush.

As a non-Confucian cultivator, Ning Zhuo's Five Elements Spiritual Power wasn't perfectly compatible with the brush. While this might affect its effectiveness, it was still usable.

As spiritual energy flowed into the brush, its seven-inch, two-fen shaft quickly emitted a soft, jade-like glow - warm, clear, and luminous.

Tiny sparks of electricity flickered around the brush's ferrule.

The silver light at the brush's tip intensified.

Ning Zhuo had already reached a preliminary agreement with Bai Jiyun and Kong Ran, which included a requirement for authentic calligraphy.

Now eager to test the brush, he considered his options and first retrieved a tiger skin.

The tiger skin was heavy, thick, and exceptionally large, adorned with two massive, tattoo-like talismans.

This was the trophy he had claimed after slaying a Tiger Demon during his conflict with the Pi Family cultivators.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had both studied the two talismans on the tiger skin, but their efforts yielded little insight.

"Let's see if using the Treasure Brush will work this time."

Ning Zhuo began by copying the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman.

The talisman was nearly perfectly circular, as large as a millstone, and appeared to have been written in blood. Its surface now resembled dried blood, a dark crimson hue.

Upon closer inspection, flame-like patterns could be discerned within the dark crimson lines.

Having studied this Demonic Talisman once before, Ning Zhuo was already familiar with its structure.

He started copying the talisman, beginning with the Talisman Core. The upper half of the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman's core resembled a drop of blood, while the lower half resembled a burning flame.

As Ning Zhuo copied the core, he immediately felt an eerie impulse and blurted out, "Blood burns fire, fire boils blood."

From the Talisman Core extended the main veins of the talisman.

The Blood-Burning Surge Talisman's main veins consisted of three thick, deep crimson Cinnabar lines that radiated outward from the center, twisting slightly as they spread toward the periphery.

While copying these veins, Ning Zhuo felt as if he were tracing three boiling blood vessels, pulsing rhythmically with a heartbeat.

"Twisting, boiling, like magma surging within..."

Finally came the auxiliary patterns. Between the three main veins, intricate, closely packed lines filled the spaces.

As Ning Zhuo copied the patterns, he experienced two distinct sensations.

One felt like a strong wind brushing against his face, leaving a tingling, numbing sensation. The other felt like the very fabric of space cracking, shattering its limits.

From this, he immediately understood: "There must be two types of talismanic patterns here. One is the Wind-Thunder Pattern, and the other is the Space-Rending Pattern."

This was a depth of understanding he had never reached in his previous studies of talismans.

After a moment, Ning Zhuo glanced at the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman on the Talisman Paper, making his final assessment.

The talismanic structure was identical to the one on the tiger hide, at least in appearance.

Ning Zhuo lightly traced his fingers across the talisman's surface. He could sense a volatile energy about to explode from the bold, powerful lines, along with the resolve and demonic intent behind the blood sacrifice required to achieve extreme speed.

He channeled spiritual energy into the paper and ignited it.

The paper burned directly, showing no reaction whatsoever.

The talisman had failed.

Ning Zhuo wasn't surprised in the slightest.

He had only copied it once, gaining a deeper understanding of its Intent and slightly enhancing his foundational knowledge of talisman crafting. This also included the Paper Art Technique, though his gains in that area were even more meager.

Ning Zhuo continued to copy the Thousand-Layered Scale Skin Talisman.

This Demonic Talisman was about the size of a washbasin, not perfectly circular like the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman, but octagonal with sharp, distinct edges.

The runes weren't dark red but a deep, earthy yellow.

It was immediately clear that this talisman would be difficult to copy. The primary veins were too prominent, almost overshadowing the core. The Talisman Core itself was tiny yet intricately connected to its surroundings by countless thread-like patterns.

To copy this talisman, one had to work from the outside in.

Ning Zhuo began to copy it.

The main body of the Thousand-Layered Scale Skin Talisman consisted of countless meticulously arranged rhomboid talismanic patterns, each layer stacked upon the previous one.

As he copied, wisps of Intent seeped into Ning Zhuo's mind, making him feel as if he were touching actual gemstone scales.

As these rhomboid patterns spiraled inward, Ning Zhuo gradually reached the Talisman Core.

Surrounding the core were three distinct talismanic patterns, each forming a concentric ring.

The rings appeared nearly identical, differing only in size.

Yet as Ning Zhuo copied them, he sensed three distinct Intents.

The outer ring felt like swirling waves, the middle ring like a towering mountain peak, and the inner ring like a slowly moving land turtle.

The final patterns filled the gaps between the scales and the triple concentric rings.

As Ning Zhuo meticulously copied the design, he felt the surrounding space ripple with faint vibrations.

"It seems these are all variations of the Void Ripple Pattern," he murmured. "These patterns enhance resistance to spells."

In the final analysis, Ning Zhuo gazed at the completed Thousand-Layered Scale Skin Talisman on the talisman paper.

Unlike the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman he had previously attempted, this Demonic Talisman's patterns were intricate, precise, and complex, exuding an aura of order and solidity.

The overlapping layers of rhomboid patterns, combined with the triple concentric rings at the Talisman Core, conveyed an Intent of "a thousand layers of force deflection, impervious to myriad methods." This aspect had completely eluded Ning Zhuo during his earlier studies.

He ignited the talisman paper with spiritual energy, and as expected, he suffered a second failure.

Yet he experienced no backlash.

This was the advantage of using talismans.

The talisman itself absorbed the consequences of failed spellcasting, sparing the cultivator from harm.

After copying two Demonic Talismans in succession, Ning Zhuo closed his eyes, sat cross-legged, and began to recuperate.

His head throbbed, his spiritual essence and mental energy were severely depleted, and his body and mind felt utterly exhausted.

"Using the Intent Comprehension Brush for imitation consumes far more energy than I imagined."

"My Physical Body and Soul's foundation surpass those of most Foundation Establishment cultivators. If I can barely sustain it, others might only be able to imitate one Demonic Talisman before needing to rest."

"Still, the imitation effect is truly remarkable!"

"My understanding of Demonic Talismans now surpasses the combined knowledge I gained from all my previous research with Big Brother."

Yet when Ning Zhuo tried to articulate this, he struggled to find the words.

This was Intent - information that defied complete expression through language or writing.

It can only be comprehended through intuition, not conveyed through words!

True masters could explain it simply, but the subtle nuances were invariably lost in translation.

After a brief rest, Ning Zhuo returned to his peak condition.

He attempted another imitation.

This time, instead of tiger skin, he retrieved a Jade Slip from his Storage Belt: the Ice Sculpture Secret Manual.

This classic text on mechanisms, personally gifted to Ning Zhuo by Ning Jiufan, detailed the art of ice sculpture mechanisms - Ning Jiufan's primary field of study.

Ning Zhuo had read the Ice Sculpture Mechanism Manual several times before, recognizing its unique and ingenious design.

All the ice sculptures were carved from a single massive block of ice, formed as a unified whole rather than assembled from separate mechanical components.

Therefore, to sculpt the desired forms, one needed to master the art of carving, one of the Hundred Crafts of Cultivation.

The Inner Carving Technique, in particular, required etching array patterns and talismans onto the inner surfaces of the ice sculptures.

Ning Zhuo's carving skills were relatively weak.

As a result, he had only treated the Classic Text as a reference book, never delving deeply into its intricacies.

During his travels, he simply hadn't had the time to focus on such minor details.

This time, his primary goal in copying the manual was to test his limits and observe how pushing himself to the brink affected his comprehension of Intent.

Ning Zhuo continued copying until he could barely endure it any longer. His Soul grew weak, his divine sea felt utterly empty, and each subsequent thought struggled to form.

He had only managed to copy slightly more than ten percent of the entire Classic Text.

Yet Ning Zhuo felt he had gained a profound understanding of carving techniques, mechanism arts, and the ice element itself!

However, he found it difficult to assess the precise extent of these gains.

After their second rest stop, Ning Zhuo proactively contacted Sun Lingtong: "Big Brother, great news!"

He shared Wen Ruanyu's letter, his participation in Chu Xuangui's Flying Cloud Minor Trial, and his subsequent discussions with Kong Ran and Bai Jiyun regarding potential trades.

Sun Lingtong was genuinely delighted and immediately began strategizing with Ning Zhuo.

"Little Zhuo, you're on the right track. The Confucian school excels at learning."

"To maximize your gains, leverage the Luo Shu Page and Spirit Hidden Willow."

"You should also acquire medicinal pills and talismans to support your cultivation. Consider Wisdom Spring Surge Powder, Enlightenment Spirit Tea, Heart Mirror Dustless Talisman, and Sudden Enlightenment Bodhi Incense."

"If your trade with Kong Ran succeeds, perhaps you can use the Early Wisdom Innate Talent Method to accelerate your comprehension and learning!"

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel excited by the prospects Sun Lingtong outlined. "Big Brother, those medicinal pills and talismans are all rare treasures, and they come at a steep price."

"There are only tens of thousands of Intent Comprehension Brushes in the entire cultivation world. Each one requires enduring a calamity during its creation."

"The Spirit Hidden Willow is also an exceptionally rare spirit plant, found in only one percent of such flora."

"Early Wisdom's innate talent goes without saying - one in ten thousand!"

"Even an incomplete Luo Shu Page is still a Dao Artifact."

"With all these factors combined, my learning speed should skyrocket! But I can't predict exactly how much it will improve."

In short, the future looks bright!

Ning Zhuo retrieved his brush rest box.

This was the Cloud Han Brush Rest Box, about twelve inches long, four inches wide, and two inches thick, rectangular and flat.

Its rounded corners flowed like Stellar Tracks, radiating warmth and inclusiveness without a hint of sharpness.

A gentle push would slide the lid open smoothly in the opposite direction, without a sound. When closed, it fit seamlessly, leaving only a faint, luminous gap like a sliver of the Heavenly River.

The Intent Comprehension Brush's jade-like glow had faded to a dull, dark luster.

Ning Zhuo placed the brush in the box to rest and recover.

He then began his daily cultivation routine.

As usual, the core components were physical body training and comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.

His physical body's foundation continued to steadily improve with the aid of the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.

However, his progress in comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art remained slow.

"If only I could obtain the original True Scripture of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art, I wouldn't have this problem," Ning Zhuo sighed bitterly.

Within the Lava Immortal Palace, the three sect elders had left behind original True Scriptures for each Cultivation Art.

The Intent contained within these True Scriptures was True Intent! Thus, the three original True Scriptures were three True Scriptures.

Even without the Intent Comprehension Brush, ordinary cultivators who came into contact with them would receive an infusion of True Intent, causing their mastery of the three Cultivation Arts to skyrocket!

"These three True Scriptures were originally hidden within the bodies of the Buddha Physician, Demon General, and Dao Master."

"By a twist of fate, Yuan Dasheng mistakenly used the True Scripture of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art as a refining material."

"My mother is residing within the Buddha Physician. Yet I haven't found the True Scripture of the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual there either."

"As for the True Scripture of the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art within the Dao Master... I don't really need it."

Ning Zhuo's mastery of the Five Elements realm was already exceptionally profound.

His bottleneck lay with the Demonic Art!

"I'm truly not suited for cultivating Demonic Arts."

"When will I break through the Red Flower Dharma Aspect? Perhaps I can interrogate Lin You for the Demonic Heart Method as a crucial reference."

Time flowed onward, and night deepened.

Having finished his comprehension of the Cultivation Art, Ning Zhuo felt restless and couldn't fall asleep.

He decided to create some ice blocks and try his hand at sculpting.

Failure, failure, failure...

A string of failures plunged him into deep thought. "Though I've grasped the Intent, the actual execution falls far short of the standard I envisioned!"

"My vision is too lofty, but my skills are too crude. I need extensive practice and hands-on experience to make real progress in my craft."

As this realization struck him, a sudden flash of spiritual light sparked in Ning Zhuo's mind.

There's a crucial point here...

But just then, the Cave Residence Token vibrated slightly, signaling an attack.

Ning Zhuo's train of thought was abruptly interrupted, leaving him startled and suspicious. "How could my rented cave residence within the Myriad Manifestations Sect be under attack?"

Upon inspection, he found the attack was minimal - a Mechanical Puppet.

Hidden within the puppet's body was a letter from Ban Ji.

In the letter, Ban Ji bluntly challenged Ning Zhuo to a sparring match. The victor would claim a trophy from the loser as a reward.

"Who is Ban Ji?" Ning Zhuo wondered, puzzled.

"Someone, investigate his background," Ning Zhuo instructed Old Chef, summoning him with a wave.

As he pondered further, Ning Zhuo couldn't recapture that fleeting spiritual light from before.

"Ban Ji has misled me!"

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, a flicker of resentment rising in his heart. Yet, he also felt a growing premonition: Ban Ji seemed to hold significant importance for him.

If left unchecked, this matter could severely hinder his progress within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.
