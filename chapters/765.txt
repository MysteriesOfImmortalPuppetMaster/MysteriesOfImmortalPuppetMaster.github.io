Chapter 765: The Eloquence of the Righteous Path

The Rust Disaster Craftsman was startled by Ban Ji's sudden outburst.

Before this mission, Ban Jie had secretly spoken with him, giving him specific instructions.

That was close... I almost couldn't stop Ban Ji!

If he had gone through with that, I would have lost a significant portion of my payment.

Humans die for wealth, just as birds die for food.

Having been "invited" by Ban Ji before, the Rust Disaster Craftsman was now easily hired by Ban Jie. With the Ban Clan's vast financial resources, far exceeding Ban Ji's, he couldn't resist the overwhelming temptation.

In his eyes, he had already offended Ning Zhuo once, so a second time made little difference. After all, he planned to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect anyway. While Ning Zhuo possessed exceptional talent, he lacked the political clout of Ban Ji.

Worst-case scenario: if his attempt to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect failed, as a solitary Demonic Cultivator with no ties, he could simply retreat. If things got truly dire, he could leave the Flying Cloud Kingdom altogether and seek his fortune in another Cultivation nation.

Unlike Ning Zhuo, who had a Clan estate as a branch family head, the Rust Disaster Craftsman belonged to no faction and had no established base of operations.

Without assets, there's no fixed income, and without fixed income, there's no stability.

For the Rust Disaster Craftsman, this meant fewer cultivation resources, but it also granted him greater freedom.

It was precisely this scarcity of resources that made him unable to resist Ban Jie's generous offer.

The situation the Rust Disaster Craftsman found himself in was actually typical of the cultivation and lifestyle of Demonic Cultivators.

Of course, there were powerful factions within the Demonic Path and exceptionally formidable individual cultivators, but these were exceptions, not the norm.

When the Rust Disaster Craftsman saw Ban Ji regain his composure, his heart skipped a beat. He felt an even deeper loathing for Ning Zhuo, who had provoked him with his words.

How dare you sabotage my livelihood?!

The Rust Disaster Craftsman immediately retorted, shouting at Ning Zhuo, "Bullshit! Stop slandering us! We have nothing to do with Zhang Wangxing and his ilk!"

"If we were working together, we would have attacked long ago! Do you think we'd let you prance around here like this?!"

"Stop throwing accusations around! We're innocent!"

"If you're going to smear us with lies, show us the evidence!"

The Rust Disaster Craftsman continued his tirade, sounding righteous and indignant.

He didn't notice Ban Ji beside him, frowning deeply as he watched him.

The Rust Disaster Craftsman, a practitioner of the Demonic Path, was completely unaware that his outburst had severed all ties with Zhang Wangxing and the others, falling precisely into Ning Zhuo's trap.

Ban Ji hesitated to speak, unsure how to intervene.

Ning Zhuo immediately retaliated with a hearty laugh. "How ironic! Rust Disaster Craftsman, you, a Demonic Cultivator with a long history of evil deeds and mountains of evidence against you, dare claim innocence?!"

The Rust Disaster Craftsman cursed vehemently, his fierce demeanor masking his utter lack of argumentative skill. He appeared cornered, reduced to blustering and resorting to baseless accusations.

Having learned from Lady Spiderweb that the Rust Disaster Craftsman had promised Ban Ji to target Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo had swiftly investigated him.

Ning Zhuo vividly recalled the Rust Disaster Craftsman's past misdeeds and recounted them one by one, each accusation meticulously detailed, logically sound, and undeniably true.

Caught red-handed, the Rust Disaster Craftsman was utterly unable to refute the charges. Ning Zhuo's accusations were irrefutable facts.

In this verbal clash, Ning Zhuo thoroughly humiliated him, leaving him utterly powerless to retaliate. The Rust Disaster Craftsman gnashed his teeth in impotent rage.

In normal circumstances, he would have been consumed by murderous intent, screaming inwardly, "I'll shut that mouth of yours!" and charging forward for a swift, brutal end.

But here, within the Profound Armor Cave, he couldn't act so recklessly.

Especially after loudly declaring his independence from Zhang Wangxing and the others. Joining the attack now would be a complete betrayal of his own words.

"That little brat is infuriating! I want to tear his mouth apart!" The Rust Disaster Craftsman's face flushed crimson with rage as he turned to Ban Ji. "Say something!"

Ban Ji couldn't help but roll his eyes.

The Rust Disaster Craftsman had made a mess of things, ruining their position, yet he acted self-righteous, feeling wronged that his comrades weren't pulling their weight.

His political acumen was so abysmal that Ban Ji had no desire to engage with him further.

"Continuing this argument is pointless. Let's move! Our priority is to defeat the others, seize more Profound Armor, and secure the top spot!" Ban Ji decisively withdrew.

The Rust Disaster Craftsman opened his mouth to protest, but despite his frustration, he knew Ban Ji was right.

"Fine, you're the one paying the bills. You're the boss this time!" The Rust Disaster Craftsman reluctantly followed, temporarily abandoning his vendetta against Ning Zhuo.

Ban Ji had completely calmed down by now. As he walked, he used his divine sense to communicate, "Have you seen Ban Jie? What else did she arrange for me? Did she give you any special instructions?"

Ban Ji and Ban Jie were the same age, having grown up together and shared a close, childhood-friendship.

As a result, Ban Ji was intimately familiar with Ban Jie's methods.

The Rust Disaster Craftsman immediately responded, "Ban Jie said you don't need to worry about anything right now. Since she was ordered by the Clan to assist you, she will do everything in her power to support your plans."

"She told you to ignore everything else and focus solely on your own tasks, giving it your all."

Ban Ji scoffed, a familiar feeling washing over him. "Did Ban Jie tell you to say that too?"

Rust Disaster Craftsman: "Of course."

Ban Ji had been about to ask if Ban Jie had any other arrangements in place. If there were hidden reinforcements, he at least wanted to switch to the Bronze Sword first, which would allow him to execute his combined sword and saber techniques more effectively.

But Ban Jie had anticipated this question. She had instructed the Rust Disaster Craftsman to preemptively block any further inquiries from Ban Ji.

This was also Ban Jie's usual approach.

She was remarkably perceptive, often answering questions before they were even voiced.

Ban Ji snorted coldly, his gaze hardening as he lunged toward his chosen target.

The unfortunate cultivator was wielding a Bronze Sword.

As Ning Zhuo watched Ban Ji and the Rust Disaster Craftsman depart, a glint flashed in his eyes.

His verbal provocation of Ban Ji was actually a strategic retreat disguised as aggression. While he appeared to be forcing Ban Ji into the fray, his true aim was to compel him to sever ties.

The Ban Clan valued its reputation, and Ban Ji, as the clan's representative among Foundation Establishment cultivators, naturally had to uphold the family's honor.

Even if Ban Ji impulsively joined the battle, Ning Zhuo had contingency plans in place.

What he needed was a definitive answer. Otherwise, constantly worrying about interference from Ban Ji and the Rust Disaster Craftsman would distract him, making it impossible to focus on defending against the surrounding attackers.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Bronze weapons flew through the air, blades clashing against spears and swords in a cacophony of sparks and deafening crashes.

With his shield, Ning Zhuo maintained a steady defense, no longer struggling as before.

Yet in mere moments, the shield was already riddled with damage.

Ning Zhuo, ever observant, noticed this immediately. "The Profound Armament Armor - Old Cold Leg was just repaired! Now it's even more battered than it was after the second trial!"

In the chaotic third trial, the Profound Armor were controlled by cultivators, infused with spiritual energy, and unleashed with unrestrained ferocity, making the battles far more intense.

At this rate, all five of my Profound Armor will be rendered beyond repair and claimed by the Grand Formation! Ning Zhuo realized grimly. He knew that Zhang Wangxing and his group, having failed their initial ambush, were now resorting to a relentless assault with this very outcome in mind.

The Grand Formation of the Profound Armor Cave prohibited nearly all other methods, allowing cultivators to engage only through Profound Armor combat and martial techniques. Innate Talents related to these skills were also permitted.

Ultimately, Ning Zhuo was at a disadvantage due to his solitary position. He had only deployed five Profound Armor, while his four opponents, including Zhang Wangxing, each wielded at least five, totaling twenty. This overwhelming numerical superiority in armor further amplified their advantage in weaponry.

Ning Zhuo naturally had trump cards, but he was reluctant to reveal them so early. Here, his most frequently used Five Elements Techniques were forbidden, and his most reliable Mechanisms couldn't be deployed, severely limiting his options. Had it not been for these restrictions, he wouldn't have been forced to seize every opportunity to learn during the initial stages.

I have few trump cards left, and this chaotic battle has only just begun.

With this thought, Ning Zhuo extended his divine sense, secretly transmitting messages to the other cultivators.

Thanks to his earlier preliminary conversations outside the cave entrance, Ning Zhuo was able to communicate with the cultivators in secret, accurately addressing each of them by name. He openly admitted that he had come seeking their assistance, promising rewards regardless of victory or defeat.

"Anyone who bothers to inquire even slightly will know what kind of scum the Rust Disaster Craftsman is!"

"I just exposed his true colors, all based on intelligence I specifically purchased from the Trading Hall."

"These claims are easily verifiable. I, Ning Zhuo, act with integrity and swear on my honor that there's no need for me to deceive you!"

"So, don't listen to the Rust Disaster Craftsman's denials. Ban Ji's silence alone is an admission of guilt."

Ning Zhuo first enticed the other cultivators with promises of rewards, sparking their interest in further communication. Then, he began to exaggerate the enemy's strength.

He couldn't provide concrete evidence that Zhang Wangxing and the others were orchestrated by the Ban Clan. But he cleverly used truths that could be verified.

Next, Ning Zhuo emphasized: "I'm a thorn in Ban Ji's side, which is why he targeted me first."

"Soon, you'll all become his enemies too. Even if you refuse to surrender, Ban Ji will likely try to eliminate you."

"If it were just individual battles or alliances, that would be one thing. But the Ban Clan is cheating! To boost the reputation of their clan's genius, they've been colluding in advance!"

"Tell me, would you be content to lose to these people?!"

Ning Zhuo's words bloomed like lotus flowers as he parried the relentless assault while secretly persuading the cultivators. His words stirred their hearts, but mere intention was not action.

Still trapped in the encirclement, Ning Zhuo's Bronze Sword finally reached its breaking point. Once it was deemed damaged beyond repair, the Grand Formation immediately teleported it away.

These Profound Armament Armor were only temporarily rented; only the Empty Profound Armament Armor refined by cultivators during the third stage's rest period became their permanent property.

Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly. "It's a pity Zhang Dadan was eliminated. If he had struck first, he could have broken the deadlock and inspired more to join our cause."

Ning Zhuo knew exactly what he needed: a catalyst!

With the loss of his Bronze Sword, Ning Zhuo was now down to just four weapons, his situation immediately becoming more precarious.

Seeing this, Zhang Wangxing's spirits soared, his morale surging. "Keep attacking! Let's see how long his weapons can hold out!"

Clang! Clang! Clang!

In the next instant, over a dozen Bronze Weapons joined the fray.

The pressure on Ning Zhuo plummeted. His persuasion had worked wonders!

The four cultivators who had been besieging him were now surrounded by eight others.

Moments earlier, the cultivators had been communicating telepathically using their divine sense.

"What do you say? Should we help Ning Zhuo?"

"If we help him, the reward will be substantial. We definitely won't get first place, or even make the top ten. But by helping Ning Zhuo, our own gains will be far greater."

No one doubted Ning Zhuo would honor his debts.

This was the advantage of the Righteous Path.

People naturally trusted you, and that trust fostered cooperation, even between strangers meeting for the first time.

Earlier, Ning Zhuo's initial conversation in Profound Armor Cave had left these cultivators with a favorable impression of his approachability.

Just recently, Ning Zhuo had cornered the Rust Disaster Craftsman with irrefutable logic, reducing the latter to nothing but curses and insults - a clear sign of having his weaknesses exposed and his rage ignited.

During his persuasion, Ning Zhuo had skillfully emphasized the Ban Clan's dominance, painting a picture of overwhelming external pressure.

"Compared to Ban Ji, I like Ning Zhuo much better!"

"Hmph, the Ban Clan may be part of the Righteous Path, but Ban Ji is a degenerate of the Demonic Path. The Ban Clan values his talent but ignores his character - a grave mistake."

"Cheaters are especially despicable!"

"The fact that Ning Zhuo has earned the approval of the Confucian cultivator community is already remarkable. More importantly, he passed the Three Heart-Searching Questions at the Demon Subjugation Hall! Let's help him!"

Ning Zhuo's exceptional performance on the Demon Subjugation Hall's Three Heart-Searching Questions became a heavy weight, tipping the scales in the hearts of the crowd.

Zhang Wangxing and his group paled in shock.

Just moments ago, they had been besieging Ning Zhuo, seeing a glimmer of hope. Now, they found themselves surrounded instead.

A sharp glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes. "The Bronze Sword's breaking was a catalyst, stirring the unease in their hearts. That's why they attacked as a group!"

Seizing the momentum, Ning Zhuo counterattacked, shouting, "Zhang Wangxing! You despicable cowards! You colluded beforehand, openly cheated, and used the Ban Clan's backing to bully us rogue cultivators!"

"Those who resort to such crooked methods deserve punishment!"

"Do you think this is the outside world?"

"No! This is the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Profound Armor Cave - the domain of the Righteous Path!"

"Fellow Daoists, let them taste the might of our Righteous Path!"

Ning Zhuo's rallying cry was met with a thunderous response.

A storm of bronze weapons rained down, forcing Zhang Wangxing and his group to huddle together, their injuries mounting rapidly and their situation growing increasingly perilous.

Zhang Wangxing roared, "You're all just Ning Zhuo's lapdogs, blindly following his orders!"

Ning Zhuo immediately retorted, "Heavenly Dao is above, justice is clear! You demonic scoundrels were hired by the Ban Clan to openly cheat and now you dare to sow discord?!"

Zhang Wangxing shouted back, "We have no connection to the Ban Clan! You slander us with baseless accusations! Are you even on the Righteous Path anymore?"

Ning Zhuo laughed coldly. "Shameless villains! Still trying to deny your crimes? Prepare to face my wrath!"

Seeing Zhang Wangxing as the linchpin of their formation, Ning Zhuo summoned his Profound Armament Armor.

The Azure Flow Copper materialized into a calf in mid-air, exploiting a gap in Zhang Wangxing's defenses. The sole of the armored foot slammed directly into Zhang Wangxing's face.

Profound Armament Armor - Old Cold Leg!

Zhang Wangxing's face caved inward, and an icy chill pierced his flesh, further weakening his defenses.

In the next instant, a barrage of bronze weapons rained down, piercing his body with countless holes.

Zhang Wangxing roared in agony, unable to withstand the accumulated injuries. As his wounds reached their limit, the Grand Formation teleported him away.

Without his support, the remaining cultivators were swiftly defeated, succumbing to severe injuries and elimination.

Ning Zhuo showed no mercy. Seizing the momentum, he charged toward Ban Ji, shouting, "Fellow Daoists! Crush evil completely! Let's take down the mastermind behind this!"

Ban Ji was on the verge of defeating his opponent and seizing the Bronze Sword when he heard Ning Zhuo's shout. Turning around, he saw Ning Zhuo leading a massive group of nearly ten people charging toward him!

Ban Ji's expression froze. "......"

At the edge of the cliff, incense smoke curled upward, mingling with the swirling mist.

Ban Jie had already brewed tea, poured it out, and now held the empty cup beneath her nose, gently inhaling the refreshing aroma.

At this moment, she mused, Ning Zhuo should be on the verge of elimination, surrounded and overwhelmed.

Though his background is shrouded in mystery and power, he remains a lone wolf, lacking allies and resources.

Ban Ji should seize this opportunity to defeat his rivals, claim the Profound Armament Armor, and gather the swords and blades he needs.

Just then, a subordinate rushed over, breathless, with the latest intelligence.

Seeing the subordinate's panicked expression, Ban Jie's heart sank. After hearing the report, her own complexion paled slightly.

The scenario she had anticipated had materialized - only to vanish again.

Now, Ban Ji and the Rust Disaster Craftsman were the ones under siege, their situation dire!
