Chapter 634: Ning Zhuo's Mother Reforms the Army

In the Underworld, Ning Zhuo slowly descended from the sky. Beside him was Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, while Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu and Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng flanked him on either side.

Netherworld Envoy - Qi Bai, having insufficient spiritual intelligence, had been retracted by Ning Zhuo once again. With Ning Zhuo's Mother now awake, the combat power Qi Bai provided was no longer as valuable.

"Little Ma, are you alright?" Qing Chi shouted, then barked, "Qing-Jiao Army, annihilate this batch of Underworld Army cavalry!"

Riding her Black Blood Paper Horse, wreathed in azure flames, she watched over Ning Zhuo with deep concern.

Ning Zhuo knew she had misunderstood and quickly sent an explanation through his divine sense: "He's one of us, my informant. Much of the intelligence we've received came from him."

Qing Chi's eyes widened as she scrutinized Sun Lingtong and his ox cavalry. Trusting Ning Zhuo completely, she immediately reversed her command without hesitation.

Sun Lingtong, his soul temporarily residing in a Paper Puppet, led over a dozen ox cavalrymen charging toward them. As the third wave to enter, they had ended up behind the Qing-Jiao Army.

Noticing the Qing-Jiao Army's agitation, Sun Lingtong quickly restrained his ox, slowing his advance and maintaining distance. This subtle maneuver showcased his remarkable progress in horsemanship and his growing ability to command a cavalry squadron.

After all, Sun Lingtong had been hiding within the Underworld Army for most of this time. In the Two Note Kingdom, he had remained concealed within the Mechanical Dragon, rarely participating personally. This time, however, he was not only joining the fray but also leading a squadron of ox cavalry, which had greatly deepened his understanding and honed his skills as a Military Strategist.

Seeing the Qing-Jiao Army lower their guard, Sun Lingtong finally increased his speed, successfully merging with Ning Zhuo and the Qing-Jiao Army.

They faced away from the motionless Paper Person army, turning toward the approaching forces.

The first wave consisted of several Golden Core-level Ghost Generals. The second wave was a vast horde of Headless Ghost Riders. The third and final wave contained only one figure: the severely wounded Bone Tomb Daoist.

Sun Lingtong, Qing Chi, and the others stood ready in battle formation. But Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin spoke up: "I'll handle this. Conserve your strength and rest. There's a more critical task that needs your attention."

Qing Chi noticed the Mechanical Puppet beside Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo) and couldn't help but ask curiously, "Eh? Little Ma, where did you get this Mechanical Puppet? It can actually talk like a real person!"

Sun Lingtong, however, clasped his hands in a respectful salute. "This junior pays his respects to Aunt!"

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were closer than blood brothers, and Sun Lingtong, being well-informed about the situation, naturally didn't dare to be presumptuous upon seeing Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin awaken.

Moreover, whenever Sun Lingtong looked at Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, he felt inexplicably weak, and there was a faint ache at the back of his head. He couldn't figure out why.

Qing Chi's curiosity was piqued by someone addressing a Mechanical Puppet so deferentially. "Little Ma, who is he? How do you know him? You're hiding so much from me," she said.

Ning Zhuo cleared his throat and evaded the question. "With the enemy closing in, I'll explain everything later."

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin chuckled, her words carrying a profound meaning. "Later, there will be no need for explanations."

By now, the Ghost Generals had closed the distance.

The Paper Giant had been destroyed, and though this place held many mysteries, it was no longer the White Paper Immortal City.

The Ghost Generals, their lingering fear replaced by renewed killing intent, regained much of their morale.

"Attack together! Slaughter them all!"

"This is the Underworld, our home turf!"

"No, keep a few alive. They seem to know this place well."

Several Golden Core-level Ghost Generals shouted loudly, their apparent conversation a deliberate attempt to intimidate Ning Zhuo and his companions.

Seeing the enemy's fierce charge, Qing Chi gritted her teeth and shouted, "All troops, listen..."

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin reached out to stop her. "Listen to me, girl."

In the next moment, she gently raised her long-handled scythe toward the charging Golden Core Ghost Generals.

The Ghost Generals continued their charge.

?!!

But soon, they sensed something amiss.

"The legs running ahead seem strangely familiar..."

"Strange... why is my field of vision widening?"

"Why has the world suddenly flipped upside down?!"

Their ghostly bodies shattered like fragile porcelain - split in half horizontally or vertically, or their heads simply detached and fell to the ground.

Without even a scream, the Golden Core Ghost Generals perished, their ghostly forms dissipating, leaving only their Golden Cores floating in the air.

Hiss...

In that instant, countless people gasped simultaneously.

How on earth did she do that?!

Shock quickly gave way to terror.

Countless eyes focused on Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, her figure radiating shock, fervor, reverence, curiosity, and a myriad of other intense emotions.

Behind the Ghost Generals, the Headless Cavalry erupted into chaos.

Even for these headless specters, the scene was unbearably terrifying!

So many Ghost Generals, annihilated in an instant.

What was even more horrifying was that these fierce Ghost Generals hadn't even managed a single move before being completely obliterated. A single, effortless strike from the enemy had wiped them out.

How could they possibly fight?

How could they even continue?!

Though headless, the Ghost Cavalry possessed intelligence and weren't incapable of thought.

In the next moment, the charging cavalrymen abruptly scattered, fleeing in all directions.

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's overwhelming might had frightened off most of the Headless Ghost Riders with a single move.

Of course, a few stubborn fools continued their charge.

Meng Yaoyin murmured softly, "It's convenient when you all come to die together."

"Now, this is a bit troublesome."

She shifted her stance, no longer standing upright but crouched slightly.

She rotated her wrist, holding the Great Serpent Scythe horizontally across her chest, its long handle parallel to the ground.

Her expression remained calm, her eyes devoid of joy or sorrow. Under the watchful gaze of the assembled masses, she made an imperceptibly gentle motion - like brushing dust from a scripture table - sweeping the bizarre scythe across the air.

The Strange Path - its compassion was profound.

Silent and invisible.

Where the scythe passed, space remained unbroken, without a sound, light, or shockwave.

Yet the charge continued. The Ghost Cavalry closest to her froze instantly, riders and horses alike. In the next instant, their bodies disintegrated into dust, fluttering into the air and dispersing with the wind.

This sign rapidly spread, engulfing the entire Ghost Rider Legion.

Regardless of their dispersion, speed, or protective measures, their fate remained the same.

A deathly silence fell.

The Bone Tomb Daoist's pupils contracted to pinpoints.

"Where... where did this peerless fiend emerge from?!"

"Why did Military Intelligence fail to detect this?!"

"With such a being, what hope is there of capturing White Paper Immortal City?!"

Run! Run! Run!

The Bone Tomb Daoist was the farthest away. Seeing his side's overwhelming numbers, he had positioned himself near Ning Zhuo and the others, hoping to reap the rewards of their efforts.

But the situation had changed too quickly!

With a single, swift strike, the entire cavalry battalion was annihilated. The previously fierce Ghost Generals were reduced to floating Ghost Path Golden Cores.

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin had single-handedly overturned the entire battlefield!

Already injured, the Bone Tomb Daoist turned and fled immediately.

In truth, even at his peak, he would never have dared to confront Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin.

"So powerful! So powerful! Mother's combat strength is definitely Nascent Soul-level. Even ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't block her."

"No wonder..."

Ning Zhuo was deeply shaken.

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin straightened up again, holding her Great Serpent Scythe vertically, her gaze fixed on the fleeing Bone Tomb Daoist.

The Bone Tomb Daoist's speed was astonishing!

To Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi, he had already shrunk to a tiny dot on the horizon.

It was remarkable that, even with his injuries, he could flee so swiftly!

Even the Bone Tomb Daoist was astonished by how effortlessly he had escaped.

Just as everyone assumed Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin was too far away to reach him, and the Bone Tomb Daoist began to feel a flicker of relief, Meng Yaoyin raised the Great Serpent Scythe higher and slammed its pommel into the ground.

There was no sound.

Yet the swiftly fleeing Bone Tomb Daoist collapsed as if struck by a sudden, invisible blow. His eyes rolled back in his head, and he fell unconscious.

His momentum carried him hundreds of paces across the Underworld's earth, his body tumbling relentlessly like a ragdoll. Only after a violent struggle did he finally come to a stop.

The crowd: ...

Meng Yaoyin spoke softly, "Alright, go retrieve that Daoist."

"U-understood," Qing Chi stammered. At her glance, her subordinate spurred their Mad Strategy Black Steed into a gallop.

Through divine sense, Meng Yaoyin conveyed her thoughts gently, "Little Zhuo, I deliberately spared this Daoist's life for your use."

"There's a calamity upon you, involving the Soul Devouring Sect. A karmic debt must be settled."

"This is a Super Sect, possessing magic treasures that suppress Qi Luck. You mustn't underestimate them. The sooner you resolve this, the better."

"Otherwise, the clash of Qi Luck will lead to a covert, yet devastating mutual depletion."

Ning Zhuo quickly replied, "Mother, did you divine this? The Heaven and Earth Ghosts of the Soul Devouring Sect indeed hold a deep grudge against me."

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin nodded slightly, continuing to communicate telepathically with Ning Zhuo: "Use this captive to negotiate with the Soul Devouring Sect. Tell them that if they don't resolve this matter, you'll send this Daoist to the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

"This alliance between the Soul Devouring Sect and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord to ambush the White Paper Immortal City and the Myriad Manifestations Sect has already escalated into a major friction between Super Sects."

"The Soul Devouring Sect doesn't fear you, but they do fear the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Moreover, this time, they truly broke the rules."

"If the Bone Tomb Daoist falls into the hands of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, it will provide both witness testimony and physical evidence, severely damaging the Soul Devouring Sect's position."

"Therefore, this matter is of critical importance to them."

"Use this bargaining chip to negotiate with the Soul Devouring Sect. What you can achieve and how much you gain will depend entirely on your own efforts."

Ning Zhuo's spirits soared. "Understood!"

He then stroked his chin, pondering. "So, there's a hidden mutual depletion of Qi Luck between entities."

"The longevity of Super Sects stems from their possession of treasures that suppress Qi Luck."

"In that case, I'll do my best to avoid karmic entanglements with them in the future."

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin shook her head slightly. "This is precisely why it's important to treat others with kindness."

"However, you needn't worry too much. The Buddha Heart Demon Seal on you also possesses the miraculous ability to suppress Qi Luck."

"Take this."

Having communicated through divine sense, Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin handed Ning Zhuo a collection of miscellaneous treasures.

These were all valuable items, but they were haphazardly gathered.

They had been scattered by the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale earlier.

Before the Paper Giant leaped into the black hole path, it casually scooped them up.

"Before leaving, my Inspiration touched these items, and I sensed something among them that is crucial for you."

"But I couldn't discern exactly what it is," Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin explained with concern.

Ning Zhuo eagerly accepted the treasures, nodding vigorously with a charmingly obedient expression. "Mother, I'll cherish and protect these with utmost care."

Their conversation paused. Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin raised her head, her voice soft yet carrying throughout the hall: "Very well. From now on, everyone will follow my commands."

No one objected.

The hall fell silent.

Didn't you see Ning Zhuo obediently nodding?

The primary reason for this was the overwhelming combat prowess displayed by Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin.

Everyone listened intently to her instructions.

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin lowered her head, focusing on her left hand.

She continuously counted on her fingers, performing divinations. Soon, she made her arrangements.

The assembled forces would split into two groups.

One group, led by her and the Paper Person army, would escort Sun Lingtong to Forgetful River Immortal City.

The other group, consisting of the Qing-Jiao Army and Ning Zhuo, would charge toward the Sacrificial Altar.

"This plan has been brewing for years, leveraging the power of the Mystic Ink Scholar," Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin said, glancing at the Paper Person army behind her.

She sighed. "If we fail this time, the power of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord will surge, and he will inevitably invade White Paper Immortal City again."

"When that happens, the Immortal Cities of the Living Realm will suffer untold horrors."

"I have divined it: though the Sacrificial Altar is far from Forgetful River Immortal City, their secret connection remains strong."

"To disrupt the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's grand scheme, we must attack on two fronts simultaneously and coordinate our efforts precisely."

She transmitted her thoughts telepathically, addressing only Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.

Ning Zhuo worried, "Mother, according to your plan, we have to split up?"

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin nodded. "Trust me, this is the best arrangement."

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth and looked at Sun Lingtong. "Boss, I'm entrusting Mother to your care!"

Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes. "Me? You're asking me to take care of Aunt?"

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin reassured him. "There's no need to worry. I've absorbed the spiritual energy from the Paper Giant, along with the baleful energy of countless fallen soldiers. This will be sufficient to sustain us through the coming battle."

"I've just divined that there's a secret method of communication between you two. What is it?"

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong exchanged a glance. The former said, "Mother, are you referring to the Divine Ability: Life Hanging by a Thread?"

After his explanation, Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin said approvingly, "Excellent, Little Zhuo. You've actually mastered this Divine Ability."

"And you've deliberately restrained its use, avoiding abuse. This shows remarkable self-discipline and moral character. I'm proud of you, my son."

She counted on her fingers again, then suddenly turned serious. "You must maintain this good habit!"

"This habit will be of tremendous benefit to you in the future."

Being praised by his mother, Ning Zhuo felt a genuine joy. "Mother, whenever I use the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, I always retract it immediately after use."

Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin cast a meaningful glance at Qing Chi. "Especially with her, you must remain steadfast in this practice."
