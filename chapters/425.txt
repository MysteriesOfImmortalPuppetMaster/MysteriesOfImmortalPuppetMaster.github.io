Chapter 425: Military Expenses

It was evident that the three generals were calculating accounts; some were sighing, others wore worried expressions.

Hearing movement, the three looked up and were overjoyed to see Ning Zhuo return.

"Military Advisor, the Military Advisor is here!" Liu Er immediately ran down, spreading his arms to welcome Ning Zhuo.

Zhang Hei laughed heartily, pushing the account books to the center of the table. "Let the Military Advisor handle everything; my eyes are going blurry!"

Guan Hong was even more straightforward, standing up directly: "I'm going to drill the troops."

Liu Er warmly embraced Ning Zhuo, pressing him into the main general's seat.

Ning Zhuo hurriedly declined modestly, "How can I, a youngster, sit in the main general's position?"

Liu Er replied, "These account books all depend on you, Military Advisor. If you can complete them, it would be a great merit; it wouldn't be too much to make you the Minister of Revenue!"

Although Liu Er was just saying polite words, he also revealed some genuine sincerity.

Ning Zhuo sat on the chair, reluctantly saluting, indicating he would do his utmost.

Liu and Zhang then left Ning Zhuo in the main tent, closely following Guan Hong.

Ning Zhuo was quite skilled at accounting. During his more than ten years in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he was not well-regarded, and cultivation resources required meticulous calculation.

Even when playing the role of Chui Ji Ke, selling the "Up-and-Down Ruyi Rope" externally and earning large sums, he spent a lot on acquiring mechanical creations. One could say he earned a lot and spent a lot.

Moreover, having been self-reliant since childhood, he knew the cost of daily necessities.

Ning Zhuo was quite confident about this, but when he truly delved into calculating the accounts of the Three Generals' Camp, he felt a headache.

He immediately understood the previous pain of Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang.

On one hand, the accounts were extremely complicated; on the other, the expenses were too large, so much so that even Ning Zhuo felt alarmed.

The bulk of military expenses lay in salaries.

Currently, the camp had gathered over three hundred cultivators, among whom about fifty or sixty were at the Foundation Establishment stage, and the remaining two hundred-plus were Qi Refining stage cultivators.

For Qi Refining cultivators, depending on their specific cultivation level and combat power, the monthly salary ranged from three thousand to eight thousand low-grade spirit stones.

For cultivators at the Foundation Establishment level, the monthly salary was between thirty thousand to eighty thousand low-grade spirit stones.

This meant that just the monthly salaries of the Qi Refining stage cultivators required at least 1.3 million low-grade spirit stones.

Although there were fewer Foundation Establishment cultivators, their salaries amounted to over three million low-grade spirit stones.

Just the monthly salary expenditure alone required at least 4.3 million low-grade spirit stones.

And even with this salary standard, it was considered low. The Three Generals' Camp had maximized the distribution of spoils to attract these cultivators.

Among all the current armies in Celestial City of Green Forest, the Three Generals' Camp's salary was the second lowest; the lowest was the Red Flower Camp.

Next, they needed to uniformly purchase magical artifacts.

Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators generally used magical artifacts.

According to market prices, offensive magical artifacts ranged from one thousand to one hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones each. Defensive military magical artifacts cost between two hundred to four thousand low-grade spirit stones per piece.

Ning Zhuo carefully researched the market in Celestial City of Green Forest. Based on the two offensive and defensive magical artifacts selected by the three generals, the total procurement cost was about six million spirit stones.

Next, there were also talismans and pills (Fasting Pills) for daily use.

The talismans included commonly used ones like Speed Talisman, Protection Talisman, Sharp Blade Talisman, etc., which could be purchased from the military channels of Two Notes Kingdom at about one and a half to three low-grade spirit stones per piece.

According to the minimal plan, each cultivator consumed about twenty talismans per month, and various pills consumed averaged one hundred to two hundred low-grade spirit stones per person per month.

In this way, this part of the expenditure was also about fifty-seven thousand low-grade spirit stones.

"Rather than distributing pills, it's better to procure a medicinal pool."

"Calculating the cost, if the army is maintained for more than three months, procuring a medicinal pool is more cost-effective."

"Similarly, it's best to procure a magical power pool."

These two important military instruments, purchased at the smallest specifications, each required four million low-grade spirit stones, totaling eight million.

Then, there were magical artifact maintenance, unexpected losses, camp construction, emergencies, etc.; this part required a budget allocation.

According to the standard of ten percent of the total normal expenditure, that was nearly five hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones.

"But these are not enough."

"We also need to equip battle flags and preferably have mounts."

Battle flags are extremely important.

Battle flags are often the carriers of military morale, the core of battle formations, providing qualitative improvement to the entire army's combat capabilities.

This aspect must be procured but cannot be rushed for now —we need to see what kind of battle formations Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei can train during drills.

Selecting the appropriate battle flag through the battle formation is most appropriate.

Mounts seem non-essential, but that's not the case.

Qi Refining cultivators cannot ride swords to fly; although Foundation Establishment cultivators can, they can only do so for short distances and cannot sustain long durations.

On the battlefield, an army must consider the whole picture.

This means that an army without mounts has very weak mobility, often being outmaneuvered by the enemy, putting them in an extremely passive disadvantageous situation.

Many past battle examples warn future generations that the mobility of an army is extremely important.

Sometimes, the army that reaches the battlefield first, occupies advantageous terrain, and sets up their battle formation in advance often has a huge advantage.

Because of this, in military strategy, the principle of "speed is the essence of war" is always prioritized.

This is acknowledged by many military strategists.

"Monthly salaries are over 4.3 million."

"Equipping the entire army with offensive and defensive magical artifacts costs around six million."

"Consumption of talismans and pills is fifty-seven thousand. This is the minimal standard, but in actual drills, it often exceeds this by a lot."

"Purchasing medicinal and magical power pools requires an investment of eight million."

"Magical artifact maintenance, unexpected losses, etc., need a reserve of five hundred thousand."

Adding it up, military expenses will reach 18.9 million low-grade spirit stones.

"And that doesn't include future purchases of battle flags and mounts."

Calculating up to here, Ning Zhuo was parched and felt very uneasy.

Having truly calculated the accounts, the military expenses were higher than he had expected. And these were still purchased according to the lowest standards, adhering to the principle of saving wherever possible.

"If it were the wars of ancient times, how great that would be."

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but yearn for times past in history.

At that time, the hundred arts of cultivation were not developed, far from flourishing. When there were major wars in the cultivation world, they were organized and conducted in the form of mercenaries.

Every cultivator was self-sufficient, receiving military tasks, and after completion, received rewards, either material or military merits.

Such battles emphasized the individual cultivation and combat power of the cultivators.

But as formations became more profound, the standardization of magical artifacts was established, spiritual energy became more abundant, and the vigorous development of military strategy and officialdom made the use of fate and national power increasingly sophisticated.

The former mercenary forms became increasingly outdated and were gradually swept into the corners of history.

Not to mention now —even in the later period of the Blood Remnant Dynasty, the warfare form of cultivator armies had already taken the historical stage.

After the subsequent two dynasties, multiple empires, countless kingdoms, wars involving cultivators became very professional, emphasizing all aspects.

There had to be standardized offensive and defensive magical artifacts to leverage the advantage of numbers!

There had to be military strategies to better unify forces and create practical effects of fighting above one's level!

In truely elite armies, every cultivator in the army had to practice the same cultivation method! For example, the Golden Radiance Army was recruited by Two Notes Kingdom from good families across the country and cultivated from the beginning. Their weapons, armor, mounts, etc., were all standardized.

Such an army, once engaged in battle, would burst forth with terrifying power. A fledgling army like the Three Generals' Camp wouldn't be able to withstand even one round; they would inevitably collapse at the slightest touch!

"Burning money —forming an army is burning money all the time!"

After calculating everything, a thin layer of cold sweat had formed on Ning Zhuo's back.

Currently, the spirit stones on the Three Generals' Camp's books could only sustain them for three months at most.

Ning Zhuo wished they could march immediately to the front lines. The daily consumption of over three hundred people was suffocating.

But he was very clear in his heart: they had to practice diligently; the troops had to reach a certain standard in training before they could step onto the battlefield.

Otherwise, they would be cannon fodder!

And to practice diligently, the daily expenditure would increase again.

"If it doesn't work, I'll have to help out a bit." Ning Zhuo left the main tent and observed from a distance as Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang drilled the troops.

Ning Zhuo had limited experience, having just left the mountain to travel this year, but his knowledge was solid; at least the basics were quite comprehensive.

He watched for a moment and recognized that this was the Triangular Arrow Formation.

From a bird's-eye view, this formation was an equilateral triangle.

The three Golden Core-level generals were positioned at the three corners. At the forefront was Liu Er; on the left was Guan Hong; on the right was Zhang Hei.

This Triangular Arrow Formation was the most classic assault formation, with the strongest cultivators at the three corners, the center filled with many Qi Refining cultivators, and Foundation Establishment cultivators distributed along the two leading edges.

Formations were divided into dynamic formations and static formations.

The history of static formations was much longer than that of dynamic formations; the most classic static formation was the Spirit Gathering Formation, which allowed cultivators to condense the surrounding spiritual energy for their own cultivation, increasing the efficiency of absorbing spiritual energy.

The history of dynamic formations was probably less than half that of static formations, but once developed, they were extremely vigorous, especially widely used on the battlefield, with rapid improvements.

The Triangular Arrow Formation was a typical dynamic formation.

Watching for a while, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but worry: "Dynamic formations are difficult to drill; how long will it take to reach the minimum formation standards? It's burning money every day!"

Every drill of a dynamic formation required a lot of time, material, and manpower.

Ning Zhuo increasingly felt that forming an army was like a big gamble.

Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang had already staked their entire fortunes!

And for Ning Zhuo to plot for his mother's relics in the hands of the Six Caves Sect, such as the mechanical carriage, leveraging Two Notes Kingdom and the Three Generals' Camp was undoubtedly the most effortless method.

"If the funds are insufficient, I'm afraid I'll have to step in and help a bit."

Ning Zhuo had to seize the time and also follow closely.

When the great war would break out out, his mother's mechanical carriage and other items may very likely vanish in the war. He needed to participate personally, be on the scene, and adapt as needed to possibly capture the target items.

If he misses this great war, it wiould be countless times more difficult for him to find these things later.

Ning Zhuo returned to the Mechanical Dragon to inventory his assets.

He had many spirit stones.

Last time at Misty Hidden Mountain, the Mountain God gave him ten thousand medium-grade spirit stones, which, converted to low-grade spirit stones, was one million.

He also had many precious materials.

For example, Misty Orchid, Heavy Thunder Beetle, Heavenly Dew, Floating Clouds, Walnut Mountain Essence, Misty Rainbow Stone, and Ghost Shadow Bamboo, etc.

If these were sold, they would fetch a considerable amount of spirit stones.

Among the precious materials, the most valuable were undoubtedly the Nascent Soul-level materials produced by the Old Stone Monster.

But these materials all had hidden dangers.

Previously, Ning Zhuo had taken out quite a few pieces; now, if he wants to use them to cultivate the Dao, these materials could not be casually sold.

It was worth mentioning that each time the Dragon traverses the void, the starting price was five hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones.

These assets were more than enough to satisfy the cultivation of Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo.

But on the battlefield, to maintain an army, they immediately become much less significant.

Ning Zhuo came to the cultivation cabin and knocked on the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat.

Sun Lingtong, who was cultivating inside, opened her eyes and walked out of the spirit boat: "Little Zhuo, what's the matter?"

If there was nothing, Ning Zhuo wouldn't interrupt his cultivation.

So Ning Zhuo informed Sun Lingtong of the details: "I plan to increase income and reduce expenditure."

"On one hand, contact the Thousand Medicines Sect to bulk purchase basic pills like Fasting Pills from them. According to my relationship with them, we can get a low price."

"On the other hand, I can have the Ning Clan branch increase the refining of Jade Run Profound Steel. Boss, do you remember that battle beside Misty Hidden Mountain?"

"At that time, Cai Zizhong's soldiers wore Jade Steel Heavy Armor, which was quite effective against those demon cultivators and demon beasts."

"If I can sell these armors to the Three Generals' Camp, perhaps I can open up a new market for the family."

"Alas... time is still too short."

"I really wish that the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum could be harvested right now."

"Don't know if the old ancestor has returned to Fire Persimmon Mountain now."

Sun Lingtong pondered: "Even if these can be done, distant water can't quench immediate thirst, and the relief is quite limited."

Ning Zhuo nodded: "So I'm thinking about that Old Stone Monster. If we steal him back, it would be overnight wealth; the current financial gap would be completely insignificant!"

Speaking of this, Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up: "Yes, yes, Little Zhuo, your idea is great."

"To be honest, these days when I calmed down, I've been pondering this matter!"

"Now that we can handle Dao injuries, that stone sphere is a complete treasure!"

"This matter needs to be expedited."

"Once others discover that the Old Stone Monster is already dead, it's all over."

Ning Zhuo pondered: "To enter the Thousand Peaks Forest again, we need to first repair the Wandering Dragon, resolve the blood shadows on the dragon body, and also have more fire essence reserves."

Because they've been there before, the Mechanical Wandering Dragon has precise waypoints; it can make one traversal directly to the destination.

Very convenient.

Sun Lingtong frowned, feeling troubled: "The Blood Shadow Cave Master is at the Nascent Soul level; the methods he planted are very difficult for us to remove."

"If only we had 'Shang Shan Ruo Shui,' we could wash these away."

"Relying solely on ourselves, it's hard to achieve this step; we need external assistance."

Ning Zhuo: "What about Zhang Zhongyi?"

Sun Lingtong thought for a moment: "His medical skills are strong; he can even heal Dao injuries. After all, he was once a Nascent Soul-level cultivator; the Blood Shadow spell probably won't stump him."

"However, in that case, we would be exposing the existence of the Wandering Dragon."

"Is this appropriate?"

"In other words, can Zhang Zhongyi be trusted?"

Ning Zhuo thought: "Zhang Zhongyi upholds the righteous path, like me, he has a righteous heart."

"Whether it was his previous conviction or this time enlisting to help General Mu Lan, it shows his life philosophy of repaying kindness."

"This time in healing, we also relied on his help. Without him, it wouldn't have worked."

"I still trust him."

"Alas..." Ning Zhuo sighed deeply at this point, "I didn't want to treat a good person this way, but for our safety, I've decided to use 'Life Hanging by a Thread' and 'My Buddha's Heart Demon Seal' on him!"

Sun Lingtong patted Ning Zhuo's forearm: "Little Zhuo, I know you are kind-hearted, but don't feel burdened."

"We're not going to harm him."

"It's just that the heart of guarding against others is indispensable."

"Just have a good talk with him!"

Ning Zhuo sighed; at this time, he didn't yet know that Zhang Zhongyi also wanted to talk to him.
