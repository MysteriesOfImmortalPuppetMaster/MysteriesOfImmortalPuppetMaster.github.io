Chapter 403: The Supreme Demon's Lair

Within the nested formations, everyone wore different expressions.

Lin Shanshan felt quite regretful, realizing she had misjudged Linghu Jiu!

"Senior Brother has already mastered the Heavenly Sky Lone Snow sword technique, displaying perfect control."

She also discovered that she had greatly underestimated Ning Zhuo.

"Even without my interference, with the power of Ning Zhuo's last strike, he could have won in one move."

"I was being presumptuous!"

"Miss Lin." Ning Zhuo's call made Lin Shanshan's heart flutter.

She turned around to see Ning Zhuo giving her a sincere smile, his eyes full of gratitude: "Miss Lin, thank you for your help!"

"Brother Linghu and I were just sparring, but I was too hasty earlier, lacking thought, and used too much force."

"Thanks to Miss Lin's timely intervention, I was prevented from making a grave mistake."

These words of comfort brought warmth to Lin Shanshan's heart.

Linghu Jiu slowly sheathed his sword and smiled: "I am but a reflection of my true self, a legal body created by the Mirror Wall."

But Ning Zhuo shook his head, his eyes clear as water: "Brother, I have always treated you as if you were your true self."

"If I didn't, wouldn't that be disrespectful?"

"I know you must be considerate of my flesh and blood body, so you've never used full force. How could I then fight without restraint? Wouldn't that be taking advantage of you?"

"I wanted this sparring match to be fairer."

Linghu Jiu laughed heartily: "Dear brother, dear brother."

Lin Shanshan clapped her hands and smiled: "This match should be considered a draw. Yes, I think this is the best outcome."

As they chatted, the previous misunderstandings in her heart largely dissolved.

Lin Bufan: "......"

"Shanshan and Jiu'er still need more training."

"Could this Ning Zhuo have deliberately sought a draw?"

Lin Bufan's gaze toward Ning Zhuo had subtly changed.

Previously, he had purely viewed him as an elder looking at a junior, from above. But after seeing that scythe strike, he began to take Ning Zhuo more seriously.

"Ning Zhuo actually possesses immortal potential! And with such character, who knows what level he could reach in the future."

The Five Elements Divine Lord was still studying that purple blade mark.

The Lonely Sword Lord appeared.

His gaze was as deep as autumn waters, carrying a hint of desolation, as if he had seen through all worldly prosperity. His skin was slightly pale, as if soaked in frost and snow for many years.

He wore a plain cyan robe, elegant as water, with a tall and straight figure. Now holding a sheathed sword, he emanated an aura that made people feel a faint sadness and loneliness.

"This is an external path," he spoke softly, then turned his gaze toward Ning Zhuo.

Though his tone and gaze were both calm, Ning Zhuo felt as if he were placed in ice and snow under his gaze, thoroughly seen through.

The Lonely Sword Lord said: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, may I ask about the origin of the scythe in your hand, does it come from the Night Rain Dynasty?"

Ning Zhuo quickly bowed respectfully and said: "Lord Sword's eyes are keen, it is indeed a demon weapon from the Night Rain Dynasty."

The Blood-Treading Dynasty, the Forbidden Dynasty, and the Night Rain Dynasty, these three dynasties respectively represented three important historical periods.

The Five Elements Divine Lord looked up and sighed: "It's a pity my true self has passed, and this legal body is confined within the Mirror Wall. If I could roam the world and meet all the heroes under heaven, what an exhilarating thing that would be!"

The Lonely Sword Lord also nodded slightly, showing a look of yearning: "The old waves roll on, new waves surge forth. If I could test my sword against the world once more, even if I were to perish, I would be happy."

During the Sword Lord's era, he was also one of the strongest in the world, having once tested his sword against heroes and champions across the land with just himself and his blade.

Zhu Xuanji spoke: "The scythe in Ning Zhuo's hand is not an ordinary Night Rain demon weapon, it's quite special."

"Respected elders, I am quite curious."

"The Linlang Mirror Wall originated from after the Blood Remnant Dynasty during the Martial Emperor era, and also experienced the subsequent two great dynasties, three imperial dynasties, and countless kingdoms."

"But hearing what you two just said and did, you seem unaware of these later events..."

As the Five Elements Divine Lord was about to explain, another legal body appeared.

He had thick black hair, deep eyes, and long powerful hands with distinct knuckles.

His robes were embroidered with patterns of writing brushes and green grass.

His movements were like a gentle breeze through willows, carrying an innate elegance.

Seeing him, Lin Bufan immediately bowed: "Lord Grass Saint, this junior finally gets to see you again!"

The newcomer was indeed the reflection of Grass Saint Zhang Huaixu.

Zhang Huaixu glanced at Lin Bufan, swept his gaze around, and then paused on the purple blade mark.

"The Fairy Consort knows of your arrival and requests your presence inside for a chat," Zhang Huaixu said.

Lin Bufan's face immediately showed excitement: "That the Fairy Consort Jingyue would grant us an audience is truly a blessing of three lifetimes!"

Zhang Huaixu shook his head lightly: "Any talented young heroe of later generations might be granted an audience by the Fairy Consort. Today is a good day, first with Linghu Jiu, then Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, and Sun Lingtong. Everyone, follow me."

Lin Bufan's face darkened somewhat.

Zhang Huaixu's meaning was simple – you all are only able to enter because of Linghu Jiu and Ning Zhuo.

Zhu Xuanji's expression remained unchanged.

Ning Zhuo's heart tightened, knowing that their secret had long been exposed in Fairy Consort Jingyue's eyes.

Lin Shanshan looked around asking: "Who is Sun Lingtong?"

Ning Zhuo smiled: "Miss Lin, allow me to explain later."

Lin Shanshan immediately snorted and transmitted: "You big-headed fool, just how many things are you hiding from me?"

Zhang Huaixu led the way directly.

Ning Zhuo felt grateful to Zhang Huaixu and said to Lin Shanshan: "Miss Lin, right now the Linlang Mirror Wall takes priority."

Lin Shanshan's attention was immediately drawn away.

"Little one, see you later," the Five Elements Divine Lord waved to Ning Zhuo and disappeared on the spot.

The Lonely Sword Lord nodded slightly before also vanishing.

Everyone followed Grass Saint Zhang Huaixu forward.

They passed from one formation space into another, one after another...

After going through more than ten nested formations, the group experienced curiosity, shock, and finally numbness.

Sun Lingtong held his forehead and shouted: "Heavens, look at this level of protection! It's simply outrageous – even a national capital wouldn't have security at this level!"

"These formations are interconnected and nested – is there anywhere else under heaven with stronger defenses?"

"I admire Lin Bufan's persistence in targeting the Mirror Wall!"

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but turn to look at Lin Bufan.

This Nascent Soul level master of the Myriad Medicine Sect now had an unmistakably pale face.

He had never ventured this deep before, and this was his first time truly witnessing that the Linlang Mirror Wall originally had more than twenty layers of defensive formations, each comparable to formations like the Jade Hour-Glass.

Lin Bufan had spent over a hundred years having the mountain spirit gradually erode just two of the outermost defensive formations.

At this moment, he was shocked to discover that his hundred years of effort amounted to less than one-tenth of the whole!

Grass Saint Zhang Huaixu spoke leisurely: "These formations were created by the legal bodies reflected in the mirror."

"Such as Chen Xuantu, Wang Jiu, Zhao Yuanji, Zhou Qingcheng, Li Tianye, and others."

Lin Bufan's face grew even paler.

The people Zhang Huaixu named were all historically famous formation masters.

For Lin Bufan to try to erode these formations was equivalent to one person simultaneously fighting against the combined forces of all these historical sages.

What hope was there?

For a moment, Lin Bufan felt somewhat dispirited.

This was an underground cave, its depth unknown.

The originally dark and damp cave, having housed the Linlang Mirror Wall for so long, had been gradually transformed.

The hanging stone stalactites had transformed into jade, becoming crystal clear with flowing light.

The cave walls were also like carved jade and worked crystal, smooth as mirrors, emanating soft golden and silver radiance.

The cave pillars stood tall like a forest, all with a jade-like quality, resembling jade towers and halls, magnificent to behold.

At the bottom of the cave was a clear spring. The water sparkled, and with the Mirror Wall's light cast upon it, its waves shimmered with interweaving gold and silver, like a dragon palace's treasure pool, brilliant and beautiful.

In the spring was a school of fish, their bodies completely transparent. As they swam, light and shadows intertwined, creating a spectacular display of colors.

"Wait, are those ten-thousand-year water spirits?" Zhu Xuanji's eyes flashed with golden light as he exclaimed softly.

Everyone's attention was immediately drawn to the fish school, their gazes intense.

Startled by everyone's burning gazes, the fish school quickly sank to the bottom, transformed into clear water, and vanished.

But that fleeting glimpse was enough to shock Ning Zhuo: "This fish school had at least two or three hundred members. Two or three hundred ten-thousand-year water spirits?"

"No, those slightly larger ones were far beyond ten thousand years!"

The air in the cave wasn't stuffy at all, but fresh and lively, refreshing to the spirit.

The spiritual energy was dense yet only ethereal, not forming mists that would obstruct vision.

In such an environment, the true form of the Linlang Mirror Wall appeared before everyone.

It stood about three zhang <i style="font-size: 0.5em;">(11 meters)</i>.</p> tall and over two zhang <i style="font-size: 0.5em;">(7.5 meters)</i>.</p> wide, shaped like a giant mirror, but with a slightly curved surface.

It appeared semi-transparent, with its main body being a huge piece of glazed gold crystal. The light halos shimmering on its surface were quite marvelous – sometimes like dawn's first light, warm and gentle; sometimes like sunset's remaining glow, brilliant and magnificent. As the light and shadows changed, the cave's scenery changed with them.

Sometimes it seemed like spring with a hundred flowers blooming, sometimes like an autumn night with stars sparkling...

This scene was like a realm of immortals, a world of jade, gold, and silver, brilliant with light.

Those present felt like ordinary mortals, exclaiming in wonder and lingering in admiration.

"So this is the Linlang Mirror Wall?" After a hundred years of yearning for this spiritual treasure now before his eyes, Lin Bufan's expression was quite complex.

"Where is my Senior Brother?" Lin Shanshan asked after her amazement.

"He is currently engaging a demon beast within the wall," a female cultivator's legal body walked out from the Mirror Wall.

Her beauty seemed heaven-sent, with brows like distant mountains, eyes like autumn waters, a refined nose bridge, and cherry-like lips.

Her skin was snow-white, emanating a faint jade-like glow.

She wore a light green silk robe with exquisite white magnolia flowers embroidered on the hem, perfectly matching her temperament.

As she walked out, her long dress moved gracefully like flowing clouds and running water.

At her waist was a jade belt adorned with pure white pearls, each one full and crystalline.

In her hair were several delicate jade ornaments, each carved lifelike. From her earlobes hung two small and exquisite white jade earrings that swayed gently as she moved. On her wrists were a pair of crystal-clear jade bracelets that made clear, melodious sounds when they lightly touched.

Her temperament was elegant and gentle, with every movement emanating tranquility and grace, like a piece of warm jade.

Her voice was as soft as flowing water, always carrying care and consideration in her words, making people feel as if in a spring breeze.

This was Fairy Consort Jingyue!

When the Fairy Consort appeared, everyone's eyes were filled with splendor, and they couldn't help but hold their breath, feeling as if the underground cave had instantly transformed into a magnificent dragon palace.

Such a figure truly inspired heartfelt admiration.

Everyone bowed down, and when they rose, heaven and earth had changed, and they had been drawn into the Linlang Mirror Wall.

"Everyone, please look down," Fairy Consort Jingyue faced them and pointed downward.

The cloud-like sea beneath their feet quickly dispersed, revealing a huge demon's lair interweaved with blood-red and deep sea colors.

The demon's lair was as grim as the gates of hell, with boundless demon qi surging like tsunamis in all directions, making one's hair stand on end.

The outer body of the lair was composed of countless black vines, twisted and climbing like dancing snakes, writhing endlessly, making subtle rustling sounds as if telling endless grudges. Thorns grew from the snake-like vines, sharp as blades, dripping dark red poison, spreading a foul stench.

Huge skeletons were scattered inside and outside the lair. They had various forms, some human-shaped, some beast-shaped, all broken and mangled, with clear bite marks, terrifyingly gruesome, making one's heart and gallbladder freeze in fear.

There were also huge pieces of ghostly green demon stones, flickering with light, gloomy and bizarre. In the interplay of light and shadows, the lair's scenes flickered between bright and dark, as if countless wronged souls were weeping in the ghostly light. Under the demon stones' illumination, one could barely see countless ant-like passages. These passages wound and coiled, like blood vessels of the abyss, connecting the entire lair into one, naturally formed whole.

At important nodes throughout the lair, ancient demon altars were distributed. The altars were densely covered with ancient symbols, their patterns profound, emanating evil and dense demon qi. Various instruments were arranged on the altars, some broken and damaged, some stained with dried blood, clearly used for evil sacrificial rites.

And in the deepest part of the lair, layers of dark caverns and abysses, dark as ink, unfathomably deep. Countless low growls and shrill howls continuously echoed out.

Just looking from afar, everyone felt a chill rise from their feet to their crown. The demon qi was so boundless it made one suffocate, as if placed in an endless nightmare with no hope of escape.

Fairy Consort Jingyue spoke softly: "This is a supreme demon lair."

"The way of demons originates from beyond the heavens."

"This supreme demon lair fell from the sky, it is the source of all demons in the world, undying and indestructible, only able to be suppressed and sealed."

"In years past, the Martial Emperor led a great army to besiege Mount Kunlun, needing to suppress the supreme demon lair to solve the demon problem at its source."

"However, the demon lair is undying and indestructible, constantly operating, spawning countless demon beasts, ordinary methods could hardly suppress it for long."

"The Martial Emperor, Military Advisor, and other great cultivators thought hard and meditated, finally working together to create the Linlang Mirror Wall. I, the Five Elements Divine Lord, and others personally went to Mount Kunlun, fought in secret, and finally sealed the supreme demon lair, achieving victory in the decisive battle."

The Fairy Consort revealed these ancient secrets.

She continued: "The Linlang Mirror Wall was originally a spiritual treasure, able to reflect many worthy individuals, capture their images, and create legal bodies. The legal bodies can only move within the wall but possess all the fighting power of the cultivators' true bodies."

"Over countless years, the supreme demon lair has spawned endless demon beasts, while I have presided over the Linlang Mirror Wall, using countless talented individuals and great sages who appear during the months to create legal bodies to counter them."
