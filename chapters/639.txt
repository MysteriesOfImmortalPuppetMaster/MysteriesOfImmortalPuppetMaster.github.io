Chapter 639: Entering the City

Forgetful River Crossing erupted in an uproar.

"How did he get on first?"

"He was supposed to be at the very back of the line!"

"Could this be the secret method to board the Void Return Raft? But how could such basic instructions achieve this?"

Ghostly creatures and Soul Cultivators clamored, utterly baffled.

The elder who had been guiding Sun Lingtong was momentarily stunned before bowing deeply to Yun Xiao's Reflection. "Thank you, Senior, for your great kindness and support. I am deeply grateful and will proclaim your benevolence and fairness for a lifetime!"

His words instantly silenced the crowd.

Though resentment and doubts lingered, they wisely held their tongues. The reason was simple: Yun Xiao's Reflection had promoted the elder. To question this was to oppose the Cloud Dao Reflection's decision!

Yun Xiao's Reflection remained impassive, merely waving his long sleeve again.

In the next instant, Sun Lingtong vanished from the bank and reappeared on the Void Return Raft.

Forgetful River Crossing erupted once more.

"What's happening?!"

"How did that little ghost get on?!"

"Why is he allowed to board? He was just the one being helped!"

If not for the established rules, the Soul Cultivators and ghostly creatures would likely have stormed the Void Return Raft to attack the old man and the boy.

This is outrageous!

The Void Return Raft only had ten spots, and two had already been taken.

It's important to note that over thirty people were currently queued at the Forgetful River Crossing.

The limited slots for passage had caused many ghostly creatures and Soul Cultivators to nearly erupt in curses, shouting about backdoor dealings!

As one of the affected parties, Sun Lingtong was utterly bewildered.

He approached the old man and uses his divine sense to ask, "Old man, what exactly is going on here?"

The old man winked at Sun Lingtong. "Actually, this is all thanks to you, Little Ghost. Consider this a debt I owe you."

"Huh?" Sun Lingtong is startled.

Clearly, he was the one who had been guided and helped.

The old man gazed deeply into Sun Lingtong's eyes. "Little Ghost, who were you in life? What kind of good deeds did you perform to accumulate such immense merit and light of purity?"

"You're an exceptionally good person."

"Thus, even a small act of assistance from me is enough."

Sun Lingtong's pupils constricted, his heart pounding. He quickly realizes the truth: How could he possibly be such a "good person"? Before joining the Void Sect, he'd spent his days stealing - how could he possess light of purity?

"It's the Qi given to me by Xiao Ning's mother."

"She said it would help me enter the Forgetful River Immortal City."

"So this Qi actually has such a great use!"

Although he had figured it out, Sun Lingtong continued to feign ignorance, scratching his head. "I really don't understand."

The old man patted his shoulder. "Losing some memories after becoming a ghostly creature is perfectly normal. Don't worry if you can't figure it out. I said I owed you a favor, and I will definitely repay you."

As their divine senses communicated, Yun Xiao's Reflection waved his sleeves repeatedly, selecting eight more individuals to board the Void Return Raft.

The Cloud Dao Reflection gradually faded away, dissolving into the vast river mist.

The Soul Cultivators and ghostly creatures left behind at the Forgetful River Crossing watched helplessly, or glared furiously, as the Void Return Raft drifted leisurely away. Many stared at Sun Lingtong and the old man, their throats bobbing as they opened their mouths to speak, yet none dared utter a single curse.

After all, they could still remain in line, waiting for their chance to cross later. If they cursed and angered the Cloud Dao Reflection, being expelled would mean losing this opportunity forever.

The Void Return Raft floated slowly on the surface of the Forgetful River.

It didn't resemble an ordinary boat, but rather a massive, frost-white crescent moon, slightly concave, or a withered yet veiny lotus petal.

The bow and stern of the Void Return Raft curved naturally inward, its lines flowing yet carrying an aura of desolation.

It emitted an extremely faint, almost ethereal moon-white glow, forming a halo as thin as a cicada's wing yet infinitely resilient.

Sun Lingtong, unable to stay still, paced back and forth on the raft, touching and feeling its surface.

He discovered that the material of the Void Return Raft was utterly peculiar, neither metal nor wood, neither stone nor jade.

The body of the raft seemed woven from countless translucent, hair-thin glazed meridians. Within these meridians flowed a dim, star-like silver light, like frozen tears.

The substance filling the spaces between the meridians was beyond Sun Lingtong's experience; he couldn't identify it at all. It felt icy to the touch, yet its texture was unexpectedly resilient and stable. After enduring countless ages, it possessed both fragility and tenacity, reminding Sun Lingtong of moonlight - only this was condensed, frozen moonlight.

The entire raft was peerlessly exquisite, yet it radiated a profound, bone-deep loneliness and emptiness. Recalling the stories of Yun Xiao and Yue Yi, Sun Lingtong faintly understood the endless, irreparable loss that had consumed Yun Xiao's heart.

The waters of the Forgetful River surged.

Countless ghosts drifted and struggled here, emitting silent screams and wails. When they saw the figures on the Void Return Raft, they surged forward, their faces twisted with despair and malice, desperate to drag others down with them.

The Soul Cultivators and ghostly creatures on the raft felt their tension grow. They knew all too well the dire consequences of being dragged into the water.

Adding to their unease, the raft itself felt insubstantial beneath their feet. A strange sensation of floating, as if treading on dense, icy mist, made them feel utterly unsteady.

The turbulent river surged around them, waves crashing against the raft's protective barrier and sending sprays of water into the air. Each impact shook the raft, causing the starlight and moonlight within its glazed meridians to shimmer.

The silvery-white starlight and gentle moonlight intertwined, forming a steady shield that enveloped the raft's passengers.

A swirling vortex, formed by the intermingling currents, trapped the Void Return Raft. For a moment, the raft circled helplessly in place, causing the passengers' faces to pale with growing anxiety.

Fortunately, the vortex soon dissipated, and the raft resumed its journey.

A yin wind whipped across the surface of the Forgetful River, its waters crashing and roaring, mingled with the anguished cries of drowning ghosts. Yet within the raft, a profound silence prevailed, a stark contrast to the chaos outside.

This silence, however, was oppressive, like a deathly stillness that made everyone distinctly uncomfortable.

The longer they remained, the deeper the sorrow that permeated their hearts, growing increasingly heavy. At the same time, they felt a profound emptiness, as if a void had opened within them, stripping away all meaning and purpose, leaving everything utterly devoid of vitality.

Past regrets and the pain of loss loomed larger in their minds, yet there was no one to confide in, tormenting them relentlessly.

The Forgetful River stretched endlessly, and their sense of time became blurred. It might have been only the time it takes an incense stick to burn, or it might have been a thousand years. Around them swirled boundless yin winds, turbid waves, and vengeful souls. Only the Void Return Raft beneath their feet emitted a small, faint but steadfast glow, like the sole ark of salvation adrift in the abyss of despair.

Amidst this oppressive atmosphere, the raft trembled slightly, and the pale, moonlit glow surrounding it rapidly faded and vanished.

The passengers above were astonished to discover that they had arrived at the Forgetful River Immortal City.

Or, more precisely, at the city's foundation.

Countless black pillars, unimaginably massive, like the fangs of primeval behemoths, pierced the murky waters of the Forgetful River, rising in twisted or straight lines toward the heavens.

Where the Void Return Raft docked, one could barely call it a "dock" - a few uneven, perilously slippery stone steps emerged from the pitch-black waterline, vanishing into the shadows cast by the towering pillars.

The turbulent waves surged just below, their filthy spray nearly reaching the foot of the stone steps. The mournful wails of resentful souls mingled with the yin wind, echoing endlessly between the stone pillars.

As soon as Sun Lingtong stepped off the Void Return Raft, he was enveloped by the bone-chilling yin wind.

He climbed the stone steps with painstaking caution, each step fraught with peril.

The narrow, slippery steps offered no railing. To one side lay the surging, murky waters of the Forgetful River. The higher they ascended, the more tense the group grew, knowing that a single misstep could send them plummeting into the river's abyssal depths.

After passing the halfway mark, the yin wind grew fiercer, howling past them with a blade-like chill. Miasmic gray mist swirled around, draining both spirit and physical strength from those it touched.

As they drew closer to the Immortal City, signs of life increased. Lianas snaked across the path, threatening to entangle ankles, ensnaring even ghostly creatures and ethereal souls. Fossilized bones weathered into the stone crevices silently testified to the fate of those who had failed the climb.

When Sun Lingtong's group had set out, they numbered ten. By the time they reached the summit, only four remained.

Sun Lingtong felt as if his limbs and bones were made of lead, his mind overwhelmed by terror, despair, and other negative emotions, leaving him utterly exhausted.

The old man kept his promise, intervening multiple times along the way to help Sun Lingtong ascend.

When they reached the massive city gates, Sun Lingtong collapsed onto the ground, too exhausted to move, gasping for breath.

The other three weren't much better off.

The stone platform was wide and icy-cold. The walls of Forgetful River Immortal City towered like a colossal iron curtain descending from the heavens.

Rumble...

Sensing the four newcomers, the heavy gates slowly creaked open.

At the very top of the gates hung the Karmic Mirror.

The ancient bronze mirror, covered in a gray patina that seeped with reddish-purple hues, had a surface like murky mercury. Within, swirling gray sand emitted a ghastly green phosphorescence.

This was the Karmic Mirror.

The four cultivators, either lying prone or sitting, panted as they stared at the mirror.

After a long silence, the first to recover stood and solemnly stepped toward the open gates.

Buzz - !

The bronze mirror suddenly vibrated, its resonant hum tearing through the stillness.

A piercing green light erupted from the mirror's surface, so intense it made their eyes ache.

"Ugh..."

The Ghost Cultivator struck by the light screamed. Black-red flames erupted from his body, only to vanish like snow under the blazing sun beneath the mirror's green glow.

Sun Lingtong and the others' pupils constricted in shock.

The deceased Ghost Cultivator had possessed Golden Core cultivation, yet had been utterly defenseless against the mirror's light, weaker than a newborn infant.

And once activated, the Karmic Mirror showed no mercy.

The azure pillar of light, having obliterated the first Ghost Cultivator, continued its relentless sweep, now targeting the elder who had been assisting Sun Lingtong.

The elder, who had been sitting, suddenly lowered his head as if an invisible mountain had descended upon his neck. Straining with all his might, he trembled violently, white steam rising from his body under the mirror's glare.

Sun Lingtong and the fourth Ghost Cultivator were observing the scene when, without warning, the azure pillar of light abruptly expanded, engulfing both of them in its radiance.

Sun Lingtong's heart leapt into his throat.

In that instant, he felt utterly stripped bare, exposed in a frozen wasteland, every past sin laid bare and undeniable.

Just as despair threatened to overwhelm him, the aura he carried erupted, enveloping his entire body.

This aura belonged to Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin!

Under the azure light, the aura transformed into a majestic golden glow, intermingling with the azure-white radiance, rising like auspicious clouds.

The once frigid, judgmental, and destructive azure light, now tempered by the golden glow and auspicious clouds, softened into a warm, gentle radiance.

Sensing merit and purity, the Karmic Mirror's resonant hum mellowed, as if in acknowledgment.

The elder transmitted his thoughts telepathically: "Heavens! Little Ghost, how many good deeds did you possibly perform in your lifetime?"

He was barely holding on, so he secretly stole a few strands of Qi and added them to himself.

The azure light shining on the two of them swiftly dissipated.

The remaining light still enveloped the fourth person, lingering for a moment before slowly fading away, leaving the severely wounded individual unconscious.

The old man looked at the fourth person with lingering fear, explaining to Sun Lingtong, "He failed, but his sins aren't deep. His life has been spared. Once he recovers, he can return the way he came, using the Void Return Raft to cross back to the other side of the river."

Sun Lingtong narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing the old man.

The old man waved his hand apologetically. "My apologies, young friend. I've benefited from your kindness once again. I will repay you handsomely once we're inside the city."

Sun Lingtong hummed in acknowledgment and turned away.

He walked ahead, the old man following behind. Thus, the old man and the youth passed through the city gates, officially entering the Forgetful River Immortal City.

Meanwhile, on another route, the thunderous hoofbeats of an Underworld cavalry echoed as they marched in grand procession.

The cavalrymen were ghostly creatures, their faces either green with fangs or red-haired with ghostly eyes. Yet the bone blade battle flags fluttering in the wind, the frosty crescent moon greatswords, the void-piercing spears compressed from talisman paper, and the black blood paper horses all revealed their true identity - the Qing-Jiao Army!

After parting ways with Sun Lingtong and Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and the others set off for the battlefield.

Their ability to transform into various ghostly creatures stemmed from a spell inherent to the Qing-Jiao Army, called Human-Ghost Visage. This spell allowed soldiers to fully assume either a human or a ghostly form.

However, their battle flags, weapons, and other equipment remained unaffected, leaving them vulnerable to detection.

Fortunately, their chosen route was remote, and any scattered encounters with ghostly creatures or Soul Cultivators along the way proved inconsequential.

"Directly above us should be the sacrificial altar for the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual!" Following Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's instructions, Ning Zhuo arrived at the designated location.

He and Qing Chi looked up to see dense black clouds overhead, occasionally streaked with scarlet flashes like lightning within thunderclouds.

Qing Chi felt stumped. "The altar is so high up. How will we reach it?"

Few members of the Qing-Jiao Army possessed the ability to fly.

Ning Zhuo, however, had already devised a solution during their march. "This is easy," he said. "We'll use the Ceremonial Barracks."
