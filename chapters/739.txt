Volume 739: This Young Man's Vision Surpasses Even My Expectations

Inside the martial training formation, Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.

"From Qing Huangzi's meaning, it seems he wants to cancel the Rising Clouds Trial outright and pass the legacy directly to me."

"While it would save trouble, what I'd actually gain is much less than my original plan."

"Without the Rising Clouds Trial, there's no top rank. And that's something I could have achieved anyway."

He already held a stone token; three more top ranks would allow him to upgrade to a higher-level token.

Having decided to act boldly, Ning Zhuo wouldn't hesitate here.

"I must seize every chance to claim the top rank and widen the gap with others!"

"Besides the top rank, I also need to focus on my reputation."

"Many are watching me now. If this Rising Clouds Trial is suddenly canceled, some might spread malicious rumors out of jealousy."

"That won't do!"

In righteous circles, a good reputation is crucial.

Ning Zhuo knew this all too well.

After careful consideration, he began writing his reply.

Soon after, Qing Huangzi received the letter and immediately read it with his spiritual sense.

I Respected Elder Qing Huang,

Your letter arrived, bringing both shock and honor!

I, Zhuo, am but a junior of little learning, from humble origins—how could I possibly deserve your exceptional favor, entrusting me with your legacy?

Reading your esteemed words, each character struck my heart like gold and jade, each sentence awakened my spirit like a great bell.

Your insight into subtle matters and praise for my foolish actions, along with your earnest expectations warmer than spring sunshine...

The art of mechanisms is not merely about physical movement; it is the blade that explores principles, the bridge to profound mysteries, the very form of thought!

I have always loved this path, often sitting alone in my humble room, fiddling with gears, forgetting sleep and meals, feeling time flash by yet finding endless fascination.

Now, hearing of your great path ahead is like seeing the North Star in the dark night or encountering sweet rain after a long drought!

The responsibility you entrust weighs a thousand pounds.

I vow here with all my heart: I will exhaust my mind, burn the midnight oil, and diligently study this art!

I will ensure that its profound principles and wondrous truths not only continue through me but will be glorified and expanded!

Your and your master's aspirations shall be my lifelong goal, unwavering even unto death!

However, I have one request, earnestly hoping for your approval: I still wish to participate in the Rising Clouds Trial!

I dare not doubt your judgment, nor do I seek empty fame out of wishful thinking.

My only concerns are "posthumous reputation" and "the purity of the legacy."

Our sect is vast, and tongues wag.

If I receive the true inheritance without undergoing the trial, I fear it may provoke suspicion from petty minds, accusing you of favoritism and disregarding tradition.

Worse, they might slander your master's lineage as careless or lacking worthy successors.

Gossip spreads like wildfire; if it tarnishes your esteemed reputation or brings shame to your master's memory, I could never atone even with ten thousand deaths!

Participating in the Rising Clouds Trial also offers two benefits.

First, using the trial as a whetstone to temper myself and verify my learning!

Through practical combat, I can better grasp the depth of your legacy.

Second, using my strength as clear proof to announce to my peers!

If I am fortunate enough to take the top spot, then inheriting your legacy will be rightful and justified, silencing all disputes!

It can thwart the improper thoughts of envious individuals and stop baseless gossip.

Let all under heaven know that your decision today is not out of personal favor but due to your sharp discernment, like a master recognizing a fine steed!

Bearing your heavy trust, I have my own aspirations.

Success or failure in the trial, to me, isn't about glory or shame but concerns the heart of the Dao!

If I win, I'll do so honorably, enhancing your reputation for recognizing talent; if I lose, I'll accept it openly, demonstrating the strict standards of your lineage's selection!

I earnestly hope you will grant my sincere wish!

Written with fervent respect, I pray for your peace in the Dao!

Your junior, Ning Zhuo, bows respectfully.

Qing Huangzi read it three times with his spiritual sense before letting out a long, trembling breath filled with complex emotions.

"Good... What a fine Ning Zhuo! What fine points about 'posthumous reputation' and 'purity of the legacy'!"

His voice was hoarse, carrying unexpected emotion and warm approval.

"This young man's vision, the firmness of his character, the depth of his consideration, the breadth of his spirit... far exceed what I had anticipated!"

Qing Huangzi's sharp gaze seemed to pierce through the paper, envisioning the white-robed youth respectfully writing his reply.

The young man, with his slightly large head, sat upright, his upper body straight as a peak, face full of solemnity and righteous energy!

"He doesn't flaunt his talent or look down on others! Even with my promise, he shows no arrogance or laziness, instead treating this opportunity as a heavy responsibility, considering its weight!"

"He doesn't shirk duty but dares to take it on! Without fear of the trial's challenges, he volunteers to enter the fierce competition to prove himself!"

"Not for empty fame, but for the sake of my and my master's reputations!"

"What a remarkable young man!"

The more Qing Huangzi thought, the more excited he became.

He couldn't help but stand and pace his small cave dwelling, his steps unusually light.

"Such an outstanding youth—how can I let his earnest efforts go to waste? How can I allow his upright heart to be tarnished!"

"Since it's so, I must lend him a hand."

The next day, at Green Bamboo Peak.

The stone platform was already surrounded by a bustling crowd.

"So many people have come," Jiang Xiaobian remarked, feeling a bit nervous.

"Qing Huangzi's Rising Clouds Trial is different from most; he's selecting an heir," Zhang Dadan replied.

"No, that alone wouldn't attract so many people. There's only one reason..."

Patchwork Sun shook his head, but before he could finish, the surrounding crowd stirred.

"They're here, they're here!"

"Am I seeing this right?"

"No mistake, no mistake—it's Ning Zhuo!"

The watching cultivators exclaimed loudly, countless burning, curious gazes turning toward Ning Zhuo as he arrived riding a cloud.

Ning Zhuo had expected this kind of situation.

Wearing a slight smile, he descended his cloud, cupped his hands to the crowd, displaying the demeanor of a scion from a great clan.

The cultivators in the crowd returned his greetings one after another.

Many praised Ning Zhuo: "Young Master Ning Zhuo, with you stepping forward this time, you're sure to take first place!"

"It's our honor to see Young Master Ning Zhuo sweep through all opponents."

"No one will stand in your way!"

Ning Zhuo keenly sensed the ill intent hidden within these praises, but the smile on his face only grew a bit wider, as if he noticed nothing at all.

The crowd automatically parted to make a path, allowing Ning Zhuo to calmly approach the stone platform.

There, he saw many familiar faces.

"Everyone, we meet again," he greeted Patchwork Sun, Chen San, Jiang Xiaobian, Zhang Dadan, Little Fire, and the others proactively.

Ning Zhuo had once hosted a banquet for these people, so they had a slight connection.

Everyone returned his greetings.

Some who were also participating in this Rising Clouds Minor Trial but hadn't accepted Ning Zhuo's invitation last time now felt regret: If they had known it would be like this, they should have accepted and formed a connection with Ning Zhuo.

Patchwork Sun cupped his hands, quickly responding to Ning Zhuo, showing a different attitude than before—more humble and respectful.

Jiang Xiaobian pressed his lips tightly together, growing even more nervous.

The others also felt pressure because of Ning Zhuo.

Only Little Fire showed an unwilling expression, shouting that even if Ning Zhuo was strong, he wouldn't admit defeat.

He would give his all and truly compete with Ning Zhuo once.

Ning Zhuo smiled and accepted the challenge on the spot.

Qing Huangzi revealed himself and announced the content of the second round of the Rising Clouds Minor Trial.

On the stone platform, cultivators could only use sound control to manipulate many small bamboo puppets, engaging in a chaotic battle.

During this process, Qing Huangzi would personally intervene, activating different musical notes to disrupt everyone's sound control.

As Qing Huangzi announced the rules, the entire area fell silent.

Chen San, Little Fire, and the others listened with full attention.

Once it ended, they couldn't help but glance at each other, each sensing the others' excitement.

The spectators who had come specifically to watch immediately began communicating through their spiritual senses.

"These rules put Ning Zhuo at a great disadvantage."

"Exactly. If I were participating, I'd definitely team up first to deal with Ning Zhuo together!"

"Qing Huangzi's rules don't forbid teaming up at all. This is practically making Ning Zhuo face everyone else alone."

"Not necessarily. Maybe Ning Zhuo has already contacted other cultivators in advance and reached some kind of understanding."

Qing Huangzi floated up and sat on a stone seat to one side.

He lightly stamped his foot, activating the formation. Instantly, two barriers enveloped the entire stone platform.

"All step onto the stone platform," Qing Huangzi said quietly.

All the cultivators participating in this Rising Clouds Minor Trial stepped forward, standing at the edge of the stone platform.

They stood with their backs to the outer hemispherical barrier, facing the inner barrier.

Qing Huangzi added, "Release your bamboo puppet teams."

Ning Zhuo and the others complied.

Soon, the stone platform was filled with hundreds of small bamboo puppets.

These small mechanical puppets, made by each cultivator, carried a bit of their personal style.

For example, Patchwork Sun's bamboo puppets looked ragged, as if randomly pieced together from various mechanical parts, with many joints crooked and uneven.

The small puppets lined up in a few rows, sparse and scattered.

Then there were Black Kite Chen San's bamboo puppets, noticeably smaller in size, very agile, equipped with needle tubes and arm crossbows, giving off a sneaky vibe.

Jiang Xiaobian's bamboo puppets had strange shapes, with beetle-like hard shells on their backs.

Some had mantis-like blade arms, while others had scorpion-like stingers.

Iron Drum Zhang Dadan had only three bamboo puppets, the largest on the platform.

All three puppets were wrapped head to toe in heavy armor, tightly sealed like three miniature fortresses.

Little Fire's bamboo puppets either carried strings of firecrackers or clay pots with fuses.

Ning Zhuo's small bamboo puppets were the most eye-catching.

These little figures were nearly identical, arranged in a way that seemed simple but actually hid a rigid order.

Each bamboo puppet had smooth joints and flawless bodies, standing still as if an elite army ready to strike, their silence carrying an unsettling sharpness.

Qing Huangzi sat in the main seat on the high platform, his expression as calm as an ancient well, with only a faint, hard-to-notice flicker of anticipation deep in his eyes.

"The Rising Clouds Minor Trial begins now!"

As soon as he spoke, the bamboo puppets on the stone platform almost all sprang into action.

Their attack was unified, their focus aimed directly at Ning Zhuo’s bamboo puppet squad!

"Charge! Go, charge!"

Little Fire yelled, striking a bronze gong.

His bamboo puppets rushed to the front.

Zhang Dadan slapped his waist drum, and three heavy-armored giant puppets moved slowly but steadily, pressing toward Ning Zhuo’s formation with overwhelming force.

Black Kite Chen San, sharp-eyed, whistled continuously, maneuvering his bamboo puppets away from the main group to circle from the left, attempting a flank attack on Ning Zhuo’s forces.

Jiang Xiaobian blew into a bamboo flute, producing sharp, eerie notes that made his insect-like bamboo puppets unite like a sharp blade, thrusting forward as one.

Onlookers gasped at the sight—some worried for Ning Zhuo, others excited at the prospect of a good show.

A few even thought with envy, "If only Ning Zhuo would fail here, defeated in front of everyone, that would be perfect!"

Qing Huangzi glanced at Ning Zhuo, ready to use musical notes to interfere at any moment.

He had designed this Rising Clouds Minor Trial to manipulate the rules, ensuring he kept control throughout.

If Ning Zhuo couldn’t react in time, Qing Huangzi would unleash notes to sway the battle!

"If you can stand alone against everyone’s combined efforts, then no one will question me naming you the top rank!"

"This is a perfect opportunity—if you seize it, you can turn the tables."

"Come on, show me what you’ve got!"

Qing Huangzi held deep expectations for Ning Zhuo.

But the next moment, the temporary bamboo puppet alliance suddenly fell into chaos.

Many puppets moved erratically—some stalled, some charged wildly, and others even fell apart on the spot.

"What’s going on?" Patchwork Sun and the others turned pale.

Chen San’s eyes flashed with understanding, and he immediately sent a mental message.

At the same time, one cultivator shouted, "We’re all using sound control based on the Primordial Sound Reed Manual! The overlapping sounds are clashing and causing internal conflict!"

The rest quickly grasped the situation.

The spectators caught on as well.

"So, this trial isn’t as straightforward as it seems—there’s a hidden trick to it."

"Of course Qing Huangzi’s trial to pick a successor wouldn’t be simple!"

"Hah, if I were him, I’d just hand the legacy to Ning Zhuo and be done with it. Why bother with a contest?"

"But then we wouldn’t get to see a show like this, would we?"

"Well, that’s true!"

The bamboo puppet alliance was in disarray, their advance halting abruptly.

Ning Zhuo remained expressionless, waving his arm to summon an artifact-grade zither.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, the big-headed youth used just two fingers of his left hand to press the strings.

He plucked lightly.

"Twang!"

A sharp, abrupt note burst forth, like metal being torn apart.

Ning Zhuo’s bamboo puppet squad surged forward with the sound, launching their attack!

Then, Ning Zhuo’s left hand danced like a butterfly, fingers moving so fast they blurred into shadows.

A series of harsh, piercing noises suddenly swept through the area!

The unexpected zither notes felt like countless needles stabbing into every cultivator’s eardrums.

"What is that sound?"

"It’s awful!"

"Ugh... I’m going to be sick."

The noise was as grating as nails on glass, sharp and irritating, making everyone restless.

Patchwork Sun and the others were badly affected, and the bamboo puppet alliance descended into even greater chaos.

Ning Zhuo’s squad seized the chance to cut through them, dominating the field unchallenged!

Little Fire had boldly challenged Ning Zhuo before the trial, drawing attention.

Ning Zhuo made sure he was dealt with first.

In just a few breaths, Little Fire’s bamboo puppets were nearly wiped out.

"No!"

Little Fire glared in fury, crying out in despair and frustration.
