Chapter 780: Shaving Off Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck

Ning Zhuo took out Meng Yehu to inspect it again.

Meng Yehu's spirituality was extremely weak; even when Ning Zhuo utilized the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, he could not elicit any response.

In this state, there was no hope for Meng Yehu to engage in autonomous combat.

However, Ning Zhuo felt deeply satisfied.

"It is already a stroke of great fortune that the request for help was successful."

"Meng Yehu has escaped the trap. If it had been destroyed, the loss would inevitably have caused me heartache."

He took out Meng Yehu this time to re-examine its mechanical structure.

The result revealed that Meng Yehu's mechanical design was quite outstanding! Even though Ning Zhuo's proficiency in mechanical arts had now reached the Master level, he could not see any areas that needed improvement.

The deeper Ning Zhuo investigated, the more he discovered that Meng Yehu's mechanical body possessed a kind of natural aesthetic beauty.

"Originally, I pieced it together relying on scattered design blueprints. I didn't expect the level of this design to be so excellent. Adding a bit would be too much, and removing a bit would be too little."

Therefore, for Ning Zhuo to upgrade Meng Yehu next, he only needed to put effort into its materials.

Meng Yehu's mechanical body had already suffered severe sandification and could essentially no longer be used. Ning Zhuo planned to destroy the old body directly after sculpting a new one this time.

Although there were some scraps that still held value and could be sold for money.

But there was no need to earn this small amount of money, as it could easily leak many of Meng Yehu's secrets. Ning Zhuo would not lose the greater for the lesser.

"Perhaps I can employ Nascent Soul-level precious materials to refine a new body for Meng Yehu?"

Once this thought arose, it became uncontrollable.

Ning Zhuo decided to try.

Because the design was already fixed and needed no changes, the direction for material selection was basically finalized.

"But there are still some small material tests that need to be done."

Ning Zhuo slightly estimated the workload and found that it would take quite a few days.

"It doesn't matter. I can hand this aspect over to Gongsun Yan to handle. He can help me resolve more than half of the workload."

Ning Zhuo was different from before; it was not just an improvement in his personal strength, but there were also many cultivators around him who could act as assistants and help share his work.

Ning Zhuo put away Meng Yehu and took out Yuan Dasheng to begin his research.

When seeking help from True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard this time, Ning Zhuo did not take out Yuan Dasheng to let the True Lord act again.

On one hand, the agreement was for a single intervention. Asking for a second intervention would inevitably require paying a price.

On the other hand, if Ning Zhuo were to take out two spiritual mechanical puppets in succession, it would be a bit too conspicuous. It might lead True Lord Shutu to make connections to a certain destroyed Sect. This kind of risk should not be shouldered if it can be avoided.

Finally, Yuan Dasheng's problem was much simpler than Meng Yehu's. His spirituality had already stabilized, and Ning Zhuo had also discovered where the crux of the issue lay. He was confident he could solve it independently.

Ning Zhuo then took out Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.

He groped along its form, examining it carefully, and gained quite a bit of insight.

Throughout the process, various ideas and directions for improvement surged in his Divine Sea, triggering numerous inspirations.

"If this round of design is finalized, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's combat power will probably surpass Yuan Dasheng."

"Compared to Meng Yehu's old body, the combat power would likely be on par."

Regarding the initial design of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, Ning Zhuo had not expended much thought, designing it quite ordinarily.

The version of Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng was also a result of Ning Zhuo being in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Now that Ning Zhuo's strength had greatly increased, looking back at his past designs, he suddenly felt they were full of holes.

Ning Zhuo put Snow-Colored Maiden Hui away, stood up to leave the cultivation chamber, and walked straight toward the martial arts practice formation.

The active Snow-Colored Maiden Hui was not on his person. In most cases, Ning Zhuo left her in the Green Stone Cave Abode to keep Qing Chi company so they could improve together.

Ning Zhuo arrived inside the internal space of the formation and saw at a glance that Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Qing Chi were engaged in a practice fight.

"Young Master Ning Zhuo!" Qing Chi discovered Ning Zhuo and was pleasantly surprised, involuntarily revealing a flaw, and was almost caught off guard by Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, which nearly led to her defeat.

"Keep fighting, let me have a good look." Ning Zhuo nodded to Qing Chi, smiling as he urged her on.

Receiving Ning Zhuo's encouragement, Qing Chi immediately surged with a strong fighting spirit, twisting her body to clash with Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, her moves swift and fierce. Compared to before, the previous Qing Chi seemed as if she hadn't eaten enough.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui: ?!

She was not human after all, but merely a mechanical puppet with spirituality. Caught off guard by Qing Chi's change, she was immediately suppressed into a disadvantage.

However, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui had a haughty temperament; feeling the humiliation, she immediately adopted a daring style, enduring several hits to hold her ground, gradually pulling this intensifying practice battle back to an equilibrium.

Ning Zhuo watched the battle for a while, nodding continuously in satisfaction.

Qing Chi's progress exceeded Ning Zhuo's expectations.

"Little Qing originally had a talent for martial combat, it's just that after losing her memory, her strength greatly declined."

"But her physical body is still original, so there is a lot of muscle memory."

"Her current situation is somewhat similar to when I was undertaking the trials in the Profound Armor Cave - it counts as a review."

The difference was that Qing Chi had memory in her physical body. Ning Zhuo, having absorbed the experiences of many demonic cultivators, had memory in his brain.

In short, it was all review, not learning from scratch.

This made Qing Chi's growth in martial combat become quite obvious.

"Snow-Colored Maiden Hui has also improved a lot."

This was the benefit of mechanical constructs possessing spirituality - they themselves possessed a certain degree of growth potential.

Qing Chi and Snow-Colored Maiden Hui could be said to be helping each other achieve success.

Both sides continued to fight, quickly becoming out of breath and nearing exhaustion.

Ning Zhuo decisively spoke up, terminating this practice match.

"Qing Chi, look at this spell image." Ning Zhuo mobilized the formation of the drill grounds to replay the practice match just now.

Ning Zhuo then offered guidance: "Actually, in many places, it would have been better if you handled it this way."

He commented on Qing Chi's recent performance and her choices at critical moments.

Qing Chi once again demonstrated her unique talent. Ning Zhuo had only just pointed it out, and she immediately understood the core essence. In some areas, Ning Zhuo only needed to mention it briefly, and she could draw inferences about other cases.

"Young Master, what you say makes so much sense!" Qing Chi's eyes rippled with extraordinary splendor as she looked at Ning Zhuo, revealing a look of adoration.

Ning Zhuo smiled.

Although the trip to the Profound Armor Cave did not directly raise his martial arts realm, Ning Zhuo had honed himself significantly during the trials, fully digesting the memories and experiences of the demonic cultivators he had absorbed earlier, gaining considerable insight.

Using this to guide the current Qing Chi was more than sufficient.

After Ning Zhuo finished his guidance, he had Qing Chi and Snow-Colored Maiden Hui start another practice match.

The effect of Ning Zhuo's guidance was immediate!

In the practice match just now, Qing Chi worked quite hard, but overall, it was a stalemate. But now, after consciously making changes, after the first three rounds of exchanging offense and defense, she gained the upper hand, clearly suppressing Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.

Qing Chi herself also felt this improvement; the more she fought, the more excited she became, gradually getting carried away.

At the same time, her admiration for Ning Zhuo deepened in her heart.

Ning Zhuo nodded frequently, feeling gratified.

He felt quite a bit of guilt toward Qing Chi. Bringing her to the Myriad Manifestations Sect was partly due to his mother's dying wish, and partly because Ning Zhuo had the objective of compensation and befriending her.

In the Qing-Jiao Army, Qing Chi was the primary general, while Ning Zhuo was only the vice general.

The person best suited for the Qing-Jiao Army's military seed had never been Ning Zhuo, but Qing Chi.

In Ning Zhuo's cultivation plan, the White Paper Immortal City occupied an extremely important position. And controlling the Qing-Jiao Army was one of the keys to grasping the monstrous benefits within.

Bang.

With a muffled sound, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui was knocked to the ground again.

But she quickly stood up and turned back to fight.

Her proud nature remained; she was unwilling to give in and showed no intention of admitting defeat.

Seeing this scene, Ning Zhuo's heart stirred, and he said clearly: "Qing Chi, be careful next, I'm going to make a move."

Ning Zhuo took out several segments of spider silk from his storage belt.

It was shockingly Golden Core-level Void Spider Silk!

This spider silk was sourced from Che Zhuzi; before the Profound Armor Cave trial, Che Zhuzi had used the Commerce Hall's channels to deliver the goods to his door.

Ning Zhuo infused spiritual energy into the Void Spider Silk, immediately causing the latter to escape into the void; the front half disappeared from in front of him and then reappeared around Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.

The Void Spider Silk draped over the body of this mechanical puppet, immediately establishing a stable and powerful connection with Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's fingers moved slightly as he began to control Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.

With his participation, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's martial combat ability soared instantly, surpassing Qing Chi in one fell swoop.

However, with Ning Zhuo deliberately holding back, the margin by which he surpassed her was not large - just enough to bring a benign external pressure upon Qing Chi.

Qing Chi fell to a disadvantage, but under this pressure, she continued to break through, her progress visible to the naked eye with every exchange of offense and defense.

This situation was very similar to when Ning Zhuo was in the Profound Armor Cave, facing various Mystic Iron Armor soldiers in actual combat practice!

"I really am different now." Ning Zhuo rejoiced in his heart. While training Qing Chi, he was also realizing his own capabilities in mechanism manipulation.

His martial combat ability had skyrocketed, and his realms in military strategy and mechanical arts had been raised, making his control over mechanisms now clearly much more powerful than before, giving him a sense of freedom and control as if using his own fingers.

He gradually sensed the foundation of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui as a puppet and the limits of her abilities.

This feeling was something he had never experienced before.

"Aside from the realm of mechanical arts, my artifact refining realm reaching the level of a Renowned Master also gives me an intuitive understanding of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's performance."

This feeling was amazing.

So much so that Ning Zhuo's hands itched more and more, and he really wanted to control Snow-Colored Maiden Hui to display her strongest power.

But he forcefully held back; after all, Qing Chi was not his real enemy.

For a moment, Ning Zhuo even hoped for Ban Ji or Situ Xing to cause trouble, so he could have a good time satisfying his craving on them in the Martial Arts Hall.

The practice match continued for a while until Qing Chi's stamina was completely exhausted, and it was timely terminated by Ning Zhuo.

Qing Chi pouted, looking at Ning Zhuo resentfully: "Unfair, Young Master. I couldn't beat you to begin with, and you even teamed up with Snow-Colored Maiden to two-on-one me. Bullying me. This isn't fair at all!"

Ning Zhuo walked up to her, reached out to pat her hair, and comforted her with gentle words, which corrected Qing Chi's mood.

He encouraged her again: "Your talent is formidable, and your progress is visible to the naked eye. The reason I put pressure on you is that I know you can do it."

"You are inherently strong, and the potential you contain is even greater; it deserves to be excavated more vigorously!"

Encouraged by Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi's spirits were lifted. Although she was exhausted, her eyes shone, and she secretly decided that after a short rest, she would continue extra practice to consolidate what she had just gained. She would strive for greater progress, not to let down Ning Zhuo's expectations, and to surprise him even more.

Ning Zhuo took new combat imagery and conducted guidance for Qing Chi.

Although Qing Chi devoted herself wholeheartedly, her stamina was spent and her spirit was weary, so she soon became drowsy.

Ning Zhuo decisively stopped and let her go to rest.

Qing Chi was unwilling.

Ning Zhuo comforted her: "Another day I will teach you some Confucian techniques that can let you 'tie your hair to the beam and stab your thigh with an awl' to stay awake, giving you more capacity for learning."

Qing Chi was overjoyed.

Ning Zhuo himself loved learning and hoped those around him would love learning too.

After Qing Chi left, Ning Zhuo brought Snow-Colored Maiden Hui before him, groped along her for a while, and had many ideas for improvement.

These all required him to organize them properly afterward, compare them, and then make a decision.

Ban Family Ancestral Land.

"You have arrived." Many Supreme Clan Elders bowed, their faces full of respect.

"Mm." The Grand Supreme Elder was expressionless as he scanned the circle. "Everyone should know that Ban Ji lost in the Profound Armor Cave."

"If he had lost to anyone else, it would be fine, but although he was eliminated by Tie Zheng this time, he ultimately still counts as having lost to Ning Zhuo."

"Ning Zhuo is Ban Ji's Human Tribulation. Once Ban Ji is defeated, the Qi Luck lost in secret is enormous."

"Although we promptly took out the Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pill and gave it to Ban Ji to patch his Qi Luck with external items, Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck should have seen a significant increase."

"This time, we will use the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain to attack his Qi Luck and dispel this increase."

"Otherwise, as he fights and gets stronger while Ban Ji fights and gets weaker, when will we ever trigger the Royal Mandate?"

The Grand Supreme Elder mobilized the cultivators in the venue.

Every cultivator looked solemn. For the family, for the future, their resolve was absolutely sufficient.

They had long deduced: Ning Zhuo must possess a strong treasure for protecting Qi Luck on his person.

But Ban Ji's Royal Mandate was already tied to the Ban Family's destiny, so this round of contest was imperative!

The Supreme Elders took their respective positions, pouring their divine sense, spiritual energy, and so on into the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain.

Hum...

This Ban Family heavy treasure emitted a low hum; the sliding rails on the surface began to slide at high speed, knobs rotated autonomously, levers rose and fell, and fine, complex runes lit up on countless mechanical parts.

This operation targeting Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck formally began!

Crack, crack...

A series of mechanical parts shattered on the spot.

The Supreme Elders had solemn faces, not wavering in the slightest. This situation was long within their expectations.

At the same time, Ning Zhuo discovered with astonishment that his Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his Divine Sea began to tremble slightly, simultaneously emitting a faint radiance.

As time passed, the vibration amplitude of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal became larger and larger, and the radiance became increasingly intense.

"Someone is plotting against me!" A cold glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes, and he immediately urged his spiritual energy, pouring it into the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal to provide slight assistance.

Ban Family.

The expressions of many Supreme Elders gradually changed.
