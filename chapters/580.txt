Chapter 580: Life-Bound Artifact, the Spirit Mirror

“A divine aphrodisiac?” Ning Zhuo was momentarily stunned.

He glanced at the burly, thick-bearded Yang Weida standing before him and recalled two significant facts.

Firstly, Yang Weida was a merchant hailing from the Flying Cloud Kingdom. It wasn’t unusual for him to deal in aphrodisiacs.

Secondly, Qing Yan, the Golden Core cultivator of the ghost clan, had previously mentioned that Jiao Ma cultivated the Jiao family’s signature technique, the Three Furnace True Yang Scripture. It was precisely this scripture that made Jiao Ma abundantly vigorous, prompting Qing Yan to confidently predict that Jiao Ma would surely stand out among the male consorts.

Considering these two points, Ning Zhuo nodded slightly and conveyed through spiritual sense to Yang Weida, “Then I’ll buy a little, just to test the effects.”

Yang Weida’s expression brightened immediately but quickly froze in disbelief.

Because when Ning Zhuo said “a little,” he literally meant only a tiny amount!

“Jiao Ma, how am I supposed to sell such a tiny amount?” Yang Weida complained. “You’re not exactly short on cash.”

Ning Zhuo shook his head firmly. “You call it a divine medicine. Naturally, I must personally test its efficacy first. What if I buy too much and it turns out ineffective?”

“Although you’re from the outside, here, others see us as being from the same village.” Ning Zhuo patted Yang Weida’s shoulder, saying warmly, “So give me a good deal, will you?”

Yang Weida gritted his teeth. “Since we’re village mates, I suppose I have no choice!”

Glancing around cautiously, he pulled out a medicine box, revealing the ointment inside.

Yang Weida used his spiritual sense to retrieve a fingertip-sized portion of the ointment, placed it carefully into a small vial, and handed it to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo exchanged it for a dozen spirit stones, completing the transaction.

Before leaving, Yang Weida advised, “If it works well, contact me again. We’re fellow villagers - I’ll give you the best discount!”

Ning Zhuo nodded and left without further comment.

Yang Weida quickly moved onto other male consorts, loudly proclaiming, “You’ve seen it yourselves - someone just bought my divine aphrodisiac. If you don’t follow suit, you’re missing out! Remember, slots in the Aphrodisiac Hall are limited…”

Sun Lingtong observed the whole scene silently.

Upon returning to Grade-A Room One, Sun Lingtong recounted the incident to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo, however, had already anticipated this and smiled, “Good. He’s advertising exactly as intended.”

Taking out the vial, Ning Zhuo carefully extracted a tiny amount of the ointment, mixing it with other medicinal herbs to test its properties. After a brief examination, he confirmed its potency.

Yang Weida hadn’t exaggerated; it genuinely worked well.

Yet, as Ning Zhuo attempted to apply it to himself, the mechanism ring around his finger suddenly tightened slightly, a clear warning sign.

Ning Zhuo’s eyes glinted coldly. After informing Sun Lingtong, he safely stored away the ointment.

Sun Lingtong sighed. “I didn’t expect Yang Weida, with his honest appearance, to plot against others this way. He must be confident in his medicine, or perhaps he has powerful backing that gives him such boldness.”

“We’ll ignore it and pretend we know nothing,” Ning Zhuo responded calmly. “In fact, we’ll buy more from him when we encounter him again.”

Sun Lingtong nodded in agreement.

They weren’t short on money anyway!

If Yang Weida wanted to scheme, Ning Zhuo was willing to play along.

“Let’s find a way to meet the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer and get the results of the divination. After that, we leave this place,” Ning Zhuo instructed Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong agreed wholeheartedly. If not for Meng Yaoyin’s matter, he would have preferred staying longer for more excitement and adventure.

“You keep playing the role of Jiao Ma, and I’ll scout around outside to find an opening,” Sun Lingtong volunteered proactively.

“Boss, I trust your methods completely. But wait half a day,” Ning Zhuo interjected suddenly. “I want to test out a new ability first.”

This new ability Ning Zhuo intended to try was none other than the Spirit Mirror, his newly acquired life-bound technique.

He had already advanced to the Wondrous Visions Sowing Talismans stage, and unexpectedly, he had fully mastered the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, forming a complete talismanic technique.

The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique allowed Ning Zhuo to communicate with objects possessing spirituality.

However, the Spirit Mirror life-bound spell went a step further, enabling him to draw spiritual beings from within mirrors, essentially granting him summoning capabilities.

“According to the Foundation Establishment section of the Mirror Stage Scripture, to maximize the power of this life-bound spell, I first need to forge my life-bound artifact. Boss, please help me with this task!” Ning Zhuo requested earnestly.

Sun Lingtong agreed without hesitation. Normally, cultivators should strictly keep their primary cultivation methods secret, but there was deep trust between them.

Given the close and intimate relationship between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, such taboos simply did not exist.

Ning Zhuo immediately handed over the contents for Sun Lingtong to read. After thoroughly absorbing the details, Sun Lingtong was fully prepared.

Together, they entered the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, arriving before the mechanism platform.

Ning Zhuo took out the Woodfire and infused it with magical power.

The flames of the Woodfire were gentle, yet within mere breaths, it melted various precious materials into liquid form.

Cold Iron, Flowing Cloud Sand, Great White Gold Essence, Heavenly Crystal, and Thick Earth merged into a silvery-white fluid.

Sun Lingtong controlled the mechanism platform, pulling the silver liquid into a perfectly round embryonic mirror shape within its groove.

He continued to manipulate the device, swiftly engraving formations within the embryonic mirror.

Finally, a three-hundred-pound Tempering Copper Hammer rose from the platform.

Clang!

The hammer descended forcefully, solidifying the formations and mirror embryo instantly.

Ning Zhuo bit open his right index finger, drawing out a drop of blood. Using his own vital essence, he etched intricate runes onto the mirror embryo.

The Woodfire was handed over to Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong gently blew onto the flame in his palm, sending sparks onto the mirror embryo, enveloping it in a sphere of fire.

As the flames dispersed, Ning Zhuo quickly cooled the mirror using Cold Moon Essence Dew.

With a sizzling sound, steam rose amid swirling seven-colored smoke and haze.

The haze cleared, revealing the mirror embryo floating gently in midair, trembling slightly.

Taking a deep breath, Ning Zhuo decisively executed the final step - extracting the Spiritual Mirror’s technique rune from his own spirit sea, directly imprinting it onto the core of the formation.

With a soft resonance, the Spiritual Mirror artifact was complete!

Ning Zhuo tested its capability immediately.

“Meng Yehu,” he called, drawing out the Nightblade Shadow Tiger.

Holding the Spiritual Mirror up, Ning Zhuo aimed at Meng Yehu. A ray of light shot forth from the mirror, enveloping Meng Yehu.

Connected deeply with Ning Zhuo, Meng Yehu offered no resistance and quickly vanished, absorbed into the mirror’s internal space.

With another flick, Ning Zhuo projected a beam of mirror light, instantly relocating Meng Yehu to a distant spot.

“Excellent.” Ning Zhuo nodded, rapidly devising various combat strategies.

He stored Meng Yehu within his storage belt, then summoned the mirror’s power once more.

This attempt was ten times harder, yet Ning Zhuo still managed to effortlessly summon Meng Yehu directly from the storage belt’s separate dimension.

“Marvelous!” Ning Zhuo visibly rejoiced.

Though seemingly just a convenient trick, bypassing the spatial barrier of the storage belt represented a profound qualitative leap.

But Ning Zhuo quickly noticed cracks forming on the Shadowblade Night Tiger. The cross-dimensional summoning had severely strained the artifact.

“This means Meng Yehu needs an upgrade. Once it reaches Artifact Level, it can withstand greater damage from cross-dimensional summoning.”

“But at that point, my Spiritual Mirror would also have to reach Artifact Level, or else it would be like a pony pulling a cart.”

“Interesting, there’s actually much more I can do.” Ning Zhuo’s eyes gleamed with excitement, his gaze settling on Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong shivered slightly, sensing Ning Zhuo’s intense stare, and turned cautiously, asking, “Little Zhuo, why are you looking at me like that?”

Shortly afterward, Sun Lingtong, feeling slightly dizzy, left Grade-A Room One.

Although Hidden Yang Mansion had strict management rules requiring male consorts to report their movements, servants like the ghostly Iron Weights needed only notify the gatekeepers.

Passing through the middle courtyard, Sun Lingtong spotted a gathering of cultivators discussing something heatedly around a posted notice.

Curious, Sun Lingtong approached but was immediately rebuked by a human male cultivator, “Ghost clan servant? Whose slave are you? Get lost, don’t come near us!”

A sharp glint briefly flashed in Sun Lingtong’s eyes, but outwardly he bowed submissively and retreated, observing from afar.

He vaguely saw it was a ranked list, a magical artifact whose rankings shifted periodically.

As he prepared to examine closely using a technique, a robust man strode boldly into the courtyard.

Tall and muscular, with a sharply defined, inverted triangle torso, golden-red pupils, and dark golden hair, the man wore luxurious clothing: fiery red Firewash Cloth, a Golden Sunlight Soft Armor overlay, a Millennium Li-Fire Jade Pendant on his waist, and Thundercloud Flame-step Boots.

He arrogantly unleashed a surge of power with a wave of his sleeve, scattering the gathered male consorts who nearly stumbled or fell.

Initially enraged, the consorts recognized him instantly, choking back their curses.

This proud man approached the notice, seeing his name - Golden Sun - at the very top, and sneered disdainfully, “Bunch of worthless trash.”

Though humiliated, the surrounding consorts swallowed their indignation silently, seething internally but not daring to retaliate.
