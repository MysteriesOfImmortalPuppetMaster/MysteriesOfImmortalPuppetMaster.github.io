Chapter 275: Ning Zhuo's Efforts

The concern that Ning Zhuo had been vaguely worried about finally happenedâ€”the Zheng family had set their sights on the Medical Pavilion!

The Medical Pavilion within the Lava Immortal Palace was equipped with excellent facilities, greatly aiding in the repair of mechanical constructs and the treatment of cultivators themselves. Whichever faction controlled the Medical Pavilion would hold significant sway over logistics, elevating their influence to new heights. If the Lava Immortal Palace were to open in the future, the Medical Pavilion would become a lucrative business, capable of earning a fortune daily just from its facilities alone.

The Zheng family's long-standing artifact refining business could not compare to the Medical Pavilion. Setting aside all other factors, the mere act of repairing mechanical constructs would yield enormous profits. Cultivators could disassemble various mechanical constructs within the Lava Immortal Palace, gaining firsthand information and quickly learning the mechanical techniques involved. These techniques, originating from the three sects' elders and at the level of Void Refinement, were of immense value.

Ning Zhuo currently held three second-grade positions, corresponding to the Medical Pavilion, the Five Elements Tower, and the Command Platform. Among these, the Medical Pavilion was undoubtedly the most valuable. This was because the Medical Pavilion could produce, create value, and its applicability far exceeded that of the Five Elements Tower and the Command Platform.

Zheng Jian approached Ning Zhuo, asking him to name a price to relinquish the Medical Pavilion. This made Ning Zhuo chuckle softly. He had initially intended to cultivate the Zheng family's reformation team, maintaining an open attitude. However, the Zheng family wanted to monopolize the entire Medical Pavilion, treating it as their own and not allowing other factions to interfere!

"This is the true attitude of a major cultivation family."

In the past, the Zheng family had primarily tried to win over Ning Zhuo, appearing friendly. But when a real conflict of interest arose, the Zheng family immediately showed a tough and indifferent stance. They competed with full force, not hesitating to turn hostile, disregarding past friendships as long as the benefits were sufficient.

"Zheng Jian's persuasion is just the first step in the competition."

Ning Zhuo was well aware that if he refused, the Zheng family would likely resort to various means. Ning Zhuo looked at Zheng Jian, his expression unreadable: "Brother Zheng Jian, you must be joking, right? How can such an important place as the Medical Pavilion be easily relinquished?" "In the past, the scenes of us working together to refine the mechanical apes are still vivid in my mind." "Today, let us compete fairly."

Zheng Jian shook his head, his face sincere: "Ning Zhuo, there are plenty of positions within the Lava Immortal Palace. Why are you fixated on the positions related to the Medical Pavilion?" "If this continues, both our sides will engage in a serious confrontation. This is extremely disadvantageous for both our families." "Let's be rational, mutual avoidance benefits both of us and is advantageous for the bigger picture."

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "Regarding the Medical Pavilion positions, my side will not yield. I ask the Zheng family to step back."

Zheng Jian finally snorted coldly: "How is that possible? The strength of my Zheng family is clearly superior to your Ning family. My family is an established family in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, while your Ning family is just a wanderer from Northern Wind Kingdom." "If it comes to competition, you will undoubtedly lose. Ning Zhuo, think carefully about whether you have misjudged the situation."

At this point, the negotiation had already broken down. Ning Zhuo said expressionlessly: "I don't believe it. Let's compete and see the truth from our actions!" With that, Ning Zhuo turned and left, parting on bad terms.

On this matter, he could not compromise. The Medical Pavilion had a critical care room! This was extremely useful for Ning Zhuo, not only for storing some unspeakable items but also for private meetings with people like Sun Lingtong. It was a very safe place. Just now, in the critical care room, he had created the Floating Ice Jade Hands. In the future, when building his foundation, he might also choose this place.

The critical care room was crucial for Ning Zhuo. During the negotiation, he had considered feigning cooperation with the Zheng family. After thinking it through, he realized there was no room for maneuver. If Ning Zhuo agreed to back down, given the Zheng family's family style and temperament, they would likely not allow Ning Zhuo to freely enter and exit the Medical Pavilion in the future. Even if they agreed, Ning Zhuo might be allowed in, but other members of the Ning family would be excluded. If this happened, it would be even worse for Ning Zhuo. It would almost seem as if Ning Zhuo was only looking out for himself, failing as a leader, abandoning his family, and disregarding the family's interests.

"This matter is a bit troublesome..." Ning Zhuo left the Medical Pavilion, pondering how to respond. After the visit to the children's orphanage, he had solidified his resolve, unwavering, determined to fight for the Lava Immortal Palace with all his might. Undoubtedly, the competition for the position of palace master of the Lava Immortal Palace had reached its final stage. Ning Zhuo was now waiting for the palace examination. This was currently the only method Ning Zhuo had to secure the position of palace master.

"To become the palace master, I must excel in the palace examination." "And to participate in the palace examination, it depends on merits." "In this regard, my disadvantage is indeed significant." This was Ning Zhuo's current biggest concern. Previously, he had bombed the Immortal Palace, resulting in his merits being deducted to a negative number. Since then, he had taken on multiple tasks, earning a large amount of merits. However, up to now, his merits were still embarrassingly negative.

This was just the account for bombing the Immortal Palace. Not long ago, as the tower master of the Five Elements Tower, he directly bombarded the base of Fire Persimmon Mountain, triggering a tide of scarlet flame beasts. Currently, the beast tide continued to attack the Lava Immortal Palace, and the various damages they caused to the palace would partly be attributed to Ning Zhuo. After that, Ning Zhuo, in cooperation with the dragon turtle fire spirit, actively let in the scarlet flame beasts to meet the minimum conditions for bombarding the Lava Immortal Palace. Ultimately, the Historical Records Pavilion was destroyed, and a significant portion of this loss would also be attributed to Ning Zhuo.

"However, these have not yet been settled." Ning Zhuo could fully anticipate that once the results were settled, his merits would undoubtedly be a massive pit. "I must fill this pit before the palace examination." "Not only do I need to fill it, but I also need to accumulate more merits to be among the top, to qualify for the palace examination." In this situation, relying solely on Ning Zhuo to earn merits with all his might was definitely not enough. The only path before him was to leverage the strength of others! The Ning family, Zheng family, Zhou family's reformation teams, and even the City Lord's Mansion could be leveraged to maximize Ning Zhuo's chances of participating in the palace examination.

Therefore, dealing with the Zheng family and Zheng Jian was quite troublesome for Ning Zhuo at the moment. He couldn't just suppress them, nor could he simply yield. The methods and strategies of the struggle needed to be carefully handled, and the balance must be firmly controlled. Only in this way could he achieve a favorable outcome.

After careful consideration, Ning Zhuo took action that afternoon. He led a group of people from the Ning family, waiting by the street. A battle had just ended, and the mechanical constructs gathered into a stream, slowly retreating. Ning Zhuo stood at the forefront of the crowd, suddenly pointing: "Do you see that mechanical pillar? Ning Yong, go and bring it over."

Ning Yong leaped forward, mustering his magical power, and grabbed the target, pulling it out of the mechanical team. Ning Yong carried the mechanical pillar straight back to Ning Zhuo. Ning Zhuo had him lay the pillar flat on the ground, then he and Ning Yong took on the corresponding repair task. This was a repair task that required multiple participants. Ning Zhuo squatted down and began to work, while Ning Yong stood by watching.

Ning Zhuo quickly opened the outer layer of the pillar. Then, he lifted the inner layer of armor, revealing the internal structure of the pillar. The pillar was hollow, with numerous formation patterns on the inner wall, a central support beam, and a multitude of brass gears and hair-thin gold wires. These gold wires and brass wheels crisscrossed, some clearly tangled into a mess. Such a complex situation made Ning Yong feel a bit dizzy.

Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed as he quickly assessed: "The problem is not significant. We need to replace some brass gears and reorganize the gold wire circuits." Ning Zhuo completed the most difficult and tedious tasks. Ning Yong watched from the side. At the final stage, Ning Zhuo took out a small bronze wrench from his storage belt, with faint traces of talisman patterns on it. Ning Zhuo guided Ning Yong, instructing him to use the small wrench to adjust the angles of the gears. Ning Yong recited incantations with each gear adjustment, completing the installation one by one. He followed Ning Zhuo's orders to the letter, not thinking for himself. His main trait was obedience!

Ning Yong successfully finished, and the repaired mechanical pillar stood upright again, stepping back into the retreating mechanical army. Ning Zhuo then began to allocate merits. In cooperative repair tasks, the distribution of merits depended on the contributions of the participants. However, contributions were difficult to assess. Besides factual evidence, it mainly relied on the judgment of the dragon turtle fire spirit and Ning Zhuo himself.

Since the Historical Records Pavilion was destroyed, Ning Zhuo had lost contact with the dragon turtle fire spirit. Without the dragon turtle fire spirit's involvement, it became a one-man show for Ning Zhuo, the Medical Pavilion's director. As the director, he demonstrated a righteous demeanor, showing high moral standards, suppressing his own merits to the minimum and pushing most of them to Ning Yong. As a result, Ning Yong saw his merits soar, suddenly reaching the standard for a physician's position. Ning Yong had accumulated a considerable amount of merits himself. Ning Zhuo then arranged for him to immediately go to the Medical Pavilion to continue earning merits as a physician.

Ning Zhuo looked at the people behind him: "Who's next?" Ning Chen stepped forward. "Young master, it's me." "By the way, there's a Zheng family cultivator nearby, watching us. He should be a scout from Zheng Jian's side." Ning Zhuo chuckled: "It doesn't matter." "Our actions are for the greater good." "Zheng Jian alone... cannot stop its momentum!" "Let's continue." "Yes!!!" Everyone responded in unison, their morale soaring.
