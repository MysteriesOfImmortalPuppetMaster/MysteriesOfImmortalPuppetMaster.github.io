Chapter 676: A Chess Player's Vision

Ning Zhuo proactively submitted his formal invitation. After waiting a full day without a response, he understood the situation.

He wasn't surprised in the slightest. Before taking this action, the young man with the large head had already anticipated this possibility.

"It seems Yu Heye doesn't consider me a threat."

This reaction was perfectly logical.

In Yu Heye's eyes, Ning Zhuo was merely a Foundation Establishment newcomer drawn to the Flying Cloud Assembly.

Who is this insignificant nobody?

Yu Heye didn't even know Ning Zhuo!

In fact, Liu Fu hadn't even bothered to properly investigate Ning Zhuo.

Who would pay for such an investigation? How much is it worth spending on a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator?

Though Ning Zhuo had demonstrated some skill, it wasn't yet enough to warrant Yu Heye's faction taking him seriously.

Moreover, the further one cultivated the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art, the stronger its combat power became, but the more difficult it became to control. The risk of qi deviation and demonic possession increased exponentially.

Only those with exceptional cultivation realms can restrain this chaotic state.

Yu Heye had already reached the limits of his cultivation. According to intelligence reports, he was barely managing to maintain control. Most of his daily cultivation time was likely spent stabilizing his dantian and adjusting his internal state to prevent qi deviation.

"In this situation, his attention naturally wouldn't be focused on me."

While Yu Heye's faction underestimated Ning Zhuo and neglected to investigate him, Ning Zhuo wouldn't make the same mistake.

He even purchased a portion of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art to study.

The Myriad Manifestations Sect's Main Mountain Gate naturally lacked a branch of the All-Book Pavilion, but one of the sixteen halls, the Art Transmission Hall, served a similar function.

The greatest advantage of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art was its combat prowess. Cultivators who practiced this art experienced rapid and explosive progress in the early stages, often surpassing their peers in battle strength.

However, it had two major drawbacks.

First, the risk of cultivating the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art and suffering a qi deviation was far higher than with other cultivation arts of similar grade.

Second, the art's upper limit was relatively low, only allowing cultivation up to the Nascent Soul Stage. It was a cultivation art that could only reach the Nascent Soul Stage.

Ning Zhuo's mastery of the Five Elements was profound. After just one reading, he fully grasped the essence of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art.

This demonic art primarily cultivated the Middle Dantian Qi Sea and the Lower Dantian Essence Sea, focusing on replacing spiritual energy with vital essence blood and substituting the body's Five Viscera and Six Bowels for the external Five Elements spiritual intuition.

Under normal circumstances, even Ning Zhuo would cultivate his own spiritual energy by converting external spiritual energy through a Five Elements Technique. The type of Spell one could cast depended entirely on the Cultivation Art practiced. A Wood Element Technique would yield Wood Element spiritual energy, while Ning Zhuo's Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual produced Five Elements spiritual energy.

The Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art, however, drew its power from the Five Viscera and Six Bowels. By extracting spiritual intuition from the Five Elements classifications within these organs and channeling it through vital essence blood, the Art created a source of spiritual energy far more intimately connected to the cultivator's own body.

This vital essence blood could be rapidly converted into Five Elements spiritual energy, and conversely, Five Elements spiritual energy could be transformed back into vital essence blood to replenish the body's reserves.

With this mechanism, the Essence Sea effectively functioned as another Qi Sea, while the Qi Sea could be considered a specialized Essence Sea.

The combined power of these two dantian naturally granted practitioners of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art exceptional strength. Vital essence blood flowing from the Five Viscera and Six Bowels could be instantly transformed into spiritual energy of any of the Five Elements—metal, wood, water, fire, or earth—and wielded with perfect precision.

Conversely, spiritual energy of each element could be converted back into vital essence blood, nourishing the Physical Body and enhancing close-combat prowess.

As a result, cultivators of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art typically excelled in both ranged and melee combat.

However, the very principles of this cultivation art made practitioners prone to qi deviation and demonic possession.

The reason was clear: converting singular spiritual energy into vital essence blood, which was not naturally produced by the body, required prolonged cultivation and assimilation.

Conversely, transforming vital essence blood into spiritual energy severely depleted the Physical Body's foundation. The Physical Body served as the cornerstone of cultivation; excessive extraction of vital essence blood was akin to suffering a severe injury, triggering a cascade of adverse effects and accelerating the body's deterioration.

Furthermore, the Five Elements spiritual energies maintained complex relationships of mutual generation and destruction. Storing these energies within the Qi Sea Dantian posed inherent risks, necessitating cultivation arts to harmonize and arrange them to prevent internal conflict.

For example, Ning Zhuo's Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual formed a Five Elements vortex within his Qi Sea Dantian, allowing the energies to coexist and transform in a balanced manner.

The Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art, however, didn't merely store the Five Elements spiritual energies in the Qi Sea Dantian; it also allowed them to mix freely within the body! After all, the conversion between vital essence blood and Five Elements spiritual energy couldn't be instantaneous, no matter how brief the process.

The mingling of Five Elements spiritual energy and vital essence blood within the body was a grave matter!

If not handled properly, it was like a powder keg, ready to explode at the slightest provocation. Even without a full-blown explosion, the constant internal friction and minor conflicts between the elements would accumulate, inflicting continuous torment on the body.

Thus, cultivators who mastered the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art often suffered from internal injuries.

After paying the price to master the complete Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art, Ning Zhuo gained significantly more confidence in dealing with Yu Heye.

He also gained a wealth of practical experience in manipulating the Five Elements.

"Although my mastery of the Five Elements is profound, my practical experience in applying them is still limited. After all, I've only been cultivating for a short time."

"Perhaps I should collect a vast number of Five Elements Techniques to fill my experiential reservoir."

"With enough accumulated knowledge, I might even be able to create my own Five Elements Techniques."

With this realization, Ning Zhuo's mind stirred, and he took a step forward.

His mastery of the Five Elements far exceeded conventional standards, allowing him to create spells on the fly. However, creating a complete Cultivation Art was far more challenging than creating a single spell. Yet, with sufficient theoretical knowledge and practical experience, he could bridge the gap and forge his own Cultivation Art.

"I'll jot this down for later. I can work on it when I have more time!"

For now, Ning Zhuo's priority remained dealing with Yu Heye.

This was still a bit troublesome.

Against Yu Heye, a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, Ning Zhuo was completely confident of victory. Now that he had mastered the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art, he could counter Yu Heye's primary combat methods with ease, almost like swatting a fly.

But let's not dwell on that.

If Ning Zhuo were to use his Divine Technique, Life Hanging by a Thread, he could directly control Yu Heye, forcing him to count numbers on the spot, kneel, and call him "Father" without the slightest effort.

After all, Yu Heye wasn't a Nascent Soul cultivator.

Any Golden Core cultivator, with few exceptions (such as Zhu Xuanji and Linghu Jiu), would be unable to resist the Divine Technique's control.

Yet Ning Zhuo had no intention of resorting to such methods.

If he challenged Yu Heye and emerged victorious, he would inevitably attract widespread attention and scrutiny, triggering a flood of public opinion, relentless investigations, and recruitment offers from various factions.

Under such circumstances, every move Ning Zhuo made would be observed and analyzed by countless cultivators.

How could he possibly plan his secret infiltration of the Jade Cleansing Sect under such intense scrutiny?

Making a grand entrance and establishing his reputation was fine, but not now.

Ning Zhuo needed to make a name for himself, but he was waiting for the right moment.

The Rising Cloud Trials, held before the Flying Cloud Assembly, had gradually become a crucial stage for cultivators to showcase their abilities within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

Ning Zhuo had planned to make a grand display of his skills during this event, but now was not the time.

The timing wasn't right.

"Within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Eight Great Peaks are undergoing a transition. With the decline of Purple Thunder Peak, Flowing Cloud Peak has become the primary target."

"If I rashly step forward and reveal my abilities, I'll be targeted by both major factions and various other powers."

"Targeted" here encompasses a wide range of tactics: bribery, coercion, suppression, and more.

Wherever there are people, there is the jianghu.

Once Ning Zhuo demonstrates his value, a vortex will inevitably form around him.

At that point, he won't have the option to remain uninvolved. He'll be forced into the fray simply because his existence cannot be ignored.

He is human, and a powerful one at that! In the jianghu, such individuals naturally stir up storms.

Ning Zhuo isn't unwilling to participate; he's merely waiting for the opportune moment.

What constitutes the opportune moment?

Now is far from it!

First and foremost, Ning Zhuo needs more detailed intelligence.

That's why he's been waiting for Wen Ruanyu to report on her duties these past few days.

In Ning Zhuo's eyes, Wen Ruanyu's strength lay not merely in his Golden Core Stage cultivation or his mastery of the Four Arts of the Scholar—music, chess, calligraphy, and painting—as a Confucian cultivator. Wen Ruanyu's most outstanding ability was his political acumen!

For years, he had served as the Myriad Manifestations Sect's representative in White Paper Immortal City, effectively managing its internal affairs as the White Paper City Lord's deputy.

Through long-term governance of White Paper Immortal City, Wen Ruanyu had accumulated vast experience. He had inevitably navigated complex power dynamics, witnessed both the best and worst of human nature, and observed the constancy and fickleness of the human heart.

Though Wen Ruanyu was unfamiliar with the Myriad Manifestations Sect's current situation, his extensive network within the Sect remained intact despite his long absence.

Given a little time, he could quickly grasp the Sect's current internal affairs.

Moreover, Wen Ruanyu was absolutely loyal to Ning Zhuo.

This would provide Ning Zhuo with a crucial source of intelligence and a valuable reference point for his actions.

Even with sufficient intelligence and a thorough analysis of the situation, the timing still wasn't right.

Ning Zhuo needed to wait for the perfect entry point.

At the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, that entry point had been Lin Shanshan. In the Two Note Kingdom, it had first been Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei, then Mu Lan. White Paper Immortal City was a special case: the entry point had been prepared for him in advance—he was the long-awaited savior!

What was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's entry point?

The Flying Cloud Assembly was merely a massive opportunity, equally available to everyone, not a specific entry point.

Wen Ruanyu, Yang Sanyan, and the close friend mentioned in Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's Jade Slip message were closer to the concept of an entry point.

Wen Ruanyu represented the masses outside the sect. Meng Yaoyin's identity also aligned with this—someone from beyond the main peaks.

Yang Sanyan represented the Demon Subduing Hall, one of the sixteen halls, a place where real work was done.

Meng Yaoyin's close friend, a cultivator from the main peaks, might offer Ning Zhuo a path to join them.

Ning Zhuo's willingness to associate with Shen Xi and his group stemmed from the possibility that they too could serve as an entry point.

In the future, new entry points might emerge.

As for which path Ning Zhuo would ultimately choose, he couldn't say yet. It would depend on how the situation unfolded.

"The Myriad Manifestations Sect's old and new factions are bound to engage in a fierce power struggle! And this year's Flying Cloud Assembly will be the perfect arena for their clash."

Ning Zhuo had already gleaned this from his own analysis of intelligence gathered from Purple Thunder Peak and Flowing Cloud Peak.

However, his understanding of the Myriad Manifestations Sect remained far from comprehensive.

He needed to continue waiting and observing until the situation became clear and he could determine which side had the greater chance of victory. Once he knew which side was likely to win, he would align himself with them.

"I'm an outsider. My family is far away in the Southern Bean Kingdom."

"By joining the winning side, I become a winner myself!"

Who would willingly choose to lose?

At the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Ning Zhuo's allegiance as an outsider was entirely his own choice, making him remarkably flexible.

Though his cultivation level was weak, this didn't mean his capabilities were lacking.

The decade-plus he spent enduring in Fire Persimmon Immortal City had honed his political acumen.

It was precisely this acumen that allowed him to make numerous correct choices, enabling him to thrive in the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, the Two Note Kingdom, and White Paper Immortal City.

He excelled at leveraging situations, pitting wolves against tigers, and using his weakness to overcome strength.

"Now isn't the time for me to make a move. Securing my mother's belongings remains my top priority."

Ning Zhuo's objectives were always clear.

Therefore, his real problem now was: how to eliminate Yu Heye without drawing undue attention or causing a stir.

Shen Xi's intervention undoubtedly complicated matters further.

How should Ning Zhuo showcase his talents before Shen Xi, and to what extent? This would severely test Ning Zhuo's political acumen.

Su Lingkou, having gathered intelligence, approached Shen Xi with grave concern. "Cousin, the situation has changed! Yu Heye has made his move. Many of his Foundation Establishment subordinates are challenging the newly arrived cultivators."

"The Martial Arts Hall swiftly accepted these challenges, clearly indicating they had pulled strings and made prior arrangements."

"The people Ning Zhuo recruited are completely useless!"

"Many have been intimidated into withdrawing, so there's no chance of getting those ten mid-grade spirit stones."

"Cousin, Ning Zhuo's plan has failed! And all our money is in his hands."

Shen Xi shook his head, smiling. "This contest has only just begun."

"Do you really think Ning Zhuo was the first to spot this 'golden opportunity' to make money? That no one has tried this before?"

"Cousin, you must understand that the structure of the mountain peaks is a matter of established custom, evolved naturally over time. Such naturally evolved systems tend to be well-established and mature."

"For example, Yu Heye's dispatch of Foundation Establishment subordinates to issue martial challenges is a mature response. Many precedents have been crushed in this very manner."

Su Lingkou's eyes lit up. "Cousin, you truly live up to your reputation! You foresaw this all along!"

Shen Xi shook his head again. "If I could foresee it, Ning Zhuo undoubtedly anticipated it long ago. Yet he proceeded anyway. What truly intrigues me is how he will respond."

Su Lingkou's expression shifted, a smile spreading across her face. "I believe Ning Zhuo will personally enter the arena and fight these Foundation Establishment cultivators. His combat prowess must be exceptional, or he wouldn't dare provoke Yu Heye's faction so brazenly."

"We shall wait and see," Shen Xi replied noncommittally.

Personally enter the arena?

That's impossible.

Under Su Lingkou's silent observation, Ning Zhuo remained completely still, showing no signs of action whatsoever.
