Chapter 731: Then Let Me Shine Bright!

Low-profile, moderate, or high-profile... three paths lay before him.

As Ning Zhuo faced this crucial decision, his mind wandered.

In that instant, he seemed to see a child on Fire Persimmon Mountain, who had begun his disguise from a young age. Each time he looked up at the City Lord's Mansion, it loomed like a towering mountain. He concealed his intelligence, growing up in the shadows, secretly clinging to Sun Lingtong. He twisted and grew in the cracks, scheming against adults, exhausting his mind, and risking his life in the Lava Immortal Palace - his first all-out assault.

The resentment he had suppressed for over a decade, the dark fire he had stifled for so long, erupted like the volcano on Fire Persimmon Mountain, scorching the depths of his heart. This was the resistance of a petty thief against his own misfortune!

In that instant, he seemed to see a young man in Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, repeatedly showcasing his martial prowess, finally revealing himself to the world. The bone-jarring combat made him truly feel alive. He forged new friendships - drinking companions and female cultivators alike. Amidst the joyous revelry, their smiles bloomed like flowers, honest and radiant. He glimpsed a new life, a world of such splendor that Fire Persimmon Mountain seemed small and stifling by comparison.

The young man began to show his true colors, embracing a new way of life. He admired Linghu Jiu, believing him to be a true gentleman.

In that moment, he saw again the grand battle in the Thousand Peaks Forest. He was but a grain of sand in the iron tide sweeping across the plains, a witness to countless heroes crumbling beneath the relentless onslaught of war.

Each battle plunged him into perilous situations, yet like a hammer and fiery forge, they tempered Ning Zhuo, honing his sharpness and refining his brilliance. From Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei, and from Mu Lan, he learned the grandeur and martial prowess of a true commander. A man's courage, he realized, springs from within.

In that instant, he saw the White Paper Immortal City, teeming with ghostly creatures, the Black Cloud Battlefield stretching across the horizon, and a resolute young man, his potential just beginning to bloom, standing tall against a Soul Formation-level foe - the sovereign of an entire nation!

Yet the youth had never possessed innate courage. He simply felt bound by destiny, duty-bound to fulfill his mother's dying wish and his own ambitions. He finally declared with certainty that he was no longer a thief. He would honor his mother's expectations with the glory of a hero.

Now.

At this very moment.

He had arrived at the Myriad Manifestations Sect, his mother's former sect. Ning Zhuo had always felt an innate affinity for this place. Here, he had forged friendships with people of all kinds, and here, he had also gained enemies, each with their own unique talents and schemes.

I'm not weak anymore.

Three choices lie before me. I'm no longer limited to choosing to hide!

So, which path should I take?

Or, to put it another way, how should I live?!

The big-headed youth asked himself these questions inwardly.

Scenes from his past flashed through his mind, accelerating like a whirlwind, like a fleeting glimpse of flowers from horseback.

These were no longer mere fragments of memory; they were like sparks, accumulating in Ning Zhuo's eyes until they ignited his gaze.

His eyes grew increasingly bright, like stars kindled into flame.

His emotions surged, gradually transforming into an overwhelming, unstoppable torrent - like the iron tide of the Thousand Peaks Forest sweeping across the plains, shattering all hesitation and cowardice!

Each fallen mountain represented the shadows of his past.

The boy who had survived for over a decade in those shadows had now undergone a complete transformation.

He stood tall and proud, facing the unknown, embracing the challenge. He yearned to blaze across the heavens like a comet, unafraid to shine brightly, undeterred by the cost, burning passionately to forge his own path!

Then let me shine.

Then let me dazzle!

This was precisely the moment:

For twenty years, a blade lay hidden in a dark alley,

Molten waves forged a dragon's pool.

Thousand Peaks' iron tide forged my bones,

Ten Thousand Medicines' herbs cleansed my heart anew.

White Paper's edge tears through the Ghost's veil,

My blood-soaked robes bear witness to my brilliance.

From this day forth, I shall no longer conceal my soaring ambition, but pilot the Flying Boat straight through the Nine Realms.

With this resolve, Ning Zhuo slowly raised his head from the stone platform within the Hall of Demon Subjugation.

All eyes immediately turned toward him.

Ning Zhuo's gaze seemed to pierce through the Demon Subjugation Hall's towering walls, focusing on some distant, indistinct point.

His expression was solemn, yet his composure carried an unwavering determination.

He spoke, his voice low but each word resonating with the weight of his soul, sinking clearly into the hearts of everyone present: "What is this body worth?"

A collective tremor ran through the crowd.

Ning Zhuo met the Golden Core Elder's deep gaze, enunciating each word with unwavering conviction: "If this broken vessel can still ignite a single spark, momentarily halting the demon's slaughter and shielding the grass and trees behind me for even a breath... then it is enough."

"To bear the stain of infamy? Compared to the myriad paths of life behind me, compared to the peace of mind within my heart... it is mere rubble!"

"What is there to fear? What is there to hesitate for?"

A collective gasp swept through the hall.

The elderly cultivator's eyes widened, his overwhelming joy nearly bursting from his skull.

His eyes shone as he stared at Ning Zhuo, his heart soaring with silent exclamations: "A seed of the Righteous Path! This is a true seed of the Righteous Path!"

The detection methods remained silent, confirming that Ning Zhuo's words sprang from the depths of his heart.

This realization filled the elderly cultivator with boundless delight.

The other High-Ranked Cultivators also sighed inwardly.

"How many years has it been? How many years have passed since someone finally passed the Three Questions of the Heart?"

"There have been a few in past trials, but none as young and with such boundless potential as this cultivator!"

"Truly exceptional! Legend has it that Hall Master Zhong Dao himself was like this in his youth, dedicating himself to upholding justice throughout the realm!"

"Perhaps what we're witnessing today is a historic moment."

The elderly cultivator took a deep breath, striving to maintain his composure, and transmitted a message via divine sense to the others: "What do you all think? Does this youth deserve first place?"

Someone immediately countered, "If such an outstanding junior doesn't deserve first place, who else could?"

Another cultivator, unable to contain his impatience, declared, "First place belongs to him without a doubt!"

"Agreed."

"Agreed."

"Absolutely agreed!"

No one voiced any dissent.

The elderly cultivator nodded slightly, retrieved a token, and handed it to Ning Zhuo. "Well done, young man. You have passed. Congratulations on securing first place!"

Ning Zhuo nodded and immediately cupped his hands in a formal bow, expressing his gratitude.

The elderly cultivator continued, "As the first-place winner of the Demon Subjugation Hall's Rising Cloud Minor Trial, you will receive the highest reward."

As he spoke, the elderly cultivator solemnly produced a precious treasure.

All eyes were drawn to the treasure, its dazzling splendor impossible to ignore.

It was a miniature pagoda, exquisitely crafted and held in the palm of an elderly cultivator.

The pagoda rested upon a lotus pedestal made of azure-gold, its six layers resembling cascading waves of jade.

The pagoda's body was forged from Formless Thousand Buddha Glazed Glass, its surface shimmering like crystalline ice. When illuminated, it radiated a golden aura.

Eighteen hundred Enlightened figures emerged from the depths of the glazed material, some forming demon-subduing mudras, others cradling relic pagodas, their Buddhist intent boundless.

At the pagoda's apex sat a lustrous, two-toned pearl. When white, it displayed the Heavenly Script Wheel, radiating meritous light. When black, it revealed the Rakshasa's fangs, capable of expelling sinful souls. This was the Karma Dharani Pearl!

The elderly cultivator explained to Ning Zhuo, "Since you wish to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, you should know of our sect's supreme treasure: the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda."

"This treasure discerns good from evil, suppresses fortune, and has been entrusted to the Demon Subjugation Hall's master throughout the ages."

"This miniature pagoda is a replica of the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda. Crafted from rare materials, it has achieved magic treasure status and is suitable for Golden Core cultivators."

"Though you are only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, you can still manage to use it."

"It can detect merit and sin, and possesses some power to protect one's personal fortune."

Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda!

Ning Zhuo was well aware that this was one of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's foundational treasures.

Super sects, powerful clans, and cultivation nations invariably possessed precious artifacts to suppress their fortune. The Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda was one such treasure for the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

The elderly cultivator's presentation of the pagoda came as no surprise to Ning Zhuo.

Every cultivator who passed the Rising Cloud Minor Trial in the Demon Subjugation Hall received such a treasure. However, the standard reward was a Magic Artifact-grade Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda.

Only the top performer earned a magic treasure-grade reward.

Ning Zhuo had chosen the Demon Subjugation Hall precisely because he knew it distributed these pagodas. Yet the actual outcome far exceeded his expectations.

A magic treasure-grade pagoda was naturally superior to a Magic Artifact-grade one. Ning Zhuo accepted the small pagoda with both hands, bowing deeply in gratitude once more.

The elderly cultivator specifically mentioned that the Demon Subjugation Hall would soon hold a different Rising Cloud Minor Trial, urging Ning Zhuo to participate if interested.

He genuinely admired Ning Zhuo's potential but remained remarkably principled. Even after gifting the magic treasure, he refrained from forcing Ning Zhuo into any binding contracts.

Ning Zhuo immediately proposed exchanging spiritual energy signature to enable mutual communication via flying messages.

This suggestion brought a genuine smile to the elderly cultivator's face.

After exchanging names and capturing each other's spiritual energy signatures, Ning Zhuo added, "Senior Cai, I..."

"Having just arrived, I, due to my possession of a powerful Mechanism treasure, provoked the wrath of a Demonic Path cultivator. Unfortunately, his deep connections make him impossible to deal with directly, even though his subordinates have been taken care of."

Elder Cai, the elderly cultivator with the Cai surname, frowned deeply and immediately asked, "Who is this person?"

Ning Zhuo sighed, his expression a mix of helplessness and frustration. "His name is Ban Ji. He belongs to the Ban Clan but follows the Demonic Path."

Elder Cai's frown deepened further. After carefully considering his words, he said, "Our Myriad Manifestations Sect's rules are all-encompassing, like a vast ocean that accepts all rivers. Therefore, even those who follow the Demonic Path or other unorthodox practices are eligible to join. Of course, once they become disciples of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, they must restrain themselves and act according to the Righteous Path."

"This is a brilliant method for upholding justice and guiding others back to the righteous path."

"Why is the Flying Cloud Kingdom so peaceful and stable, unlike most other cultivation nations? A major reason is that with each large-scale recruitment, our Myriad Manifestations Sect draws elites from other factions and converts them into members of the Righteous Path."

"Based on your account, Ban Ji still retains Demonic Cultivator habits but hasn't truly violated our sect's rules."

"Consider this trouble a trial on your Dao Path."

Seeing the disappointment on Ning Zhuo's face, Elder Cai changed his tone. "Of course, if you formally join our Demon Subjugation Hall..."

"As a member of the Hall, Ban Ji will undoubtedly restrain himself."

"If he continues to trouble you, it would be tantamount to challenging the Demon Subjugation Hall itself. Do you understand?"

Ning Zhuo immediately bowed deeply. "This junior understands perfectly. Thank you for your guidance, Senior!"

With that, Ning Zhuo bid farewell to Elder Cai and departed under the watchful eyes of numerous cultivators.

As Ning Zhuo's figure receded into the distance, Elder Cai communicated telepathically, his voice low and urgent: "Investigate Ning Zhuo's claims immediately."

He would not act without thorough investigation. Elder Cai had witnessed too much treachery and conspiracy in his long life.

Ning Zhuo felt no disappointment that Elder Cai had refused to intervene on his behalf. The elder's reaction had been precisely what he had anticipated.

"The moment I leave, the Demon Subjugation Hall will launch a full-scale investigation into me."

"Heh."

"Let them investigate."

"What will Zhong Dao do when they discover I'm Meng Yaoyin's son?"

Ning Zhuo estimated that Zhong Dao would likely become a significant obstacle to any action against him by the sect's higher echelons.

Of course, he couldn't be certain.

After all, the stakes surrounding the White Paper Immortal City were astronomically high.

"Faced with the sect's overwhelming interests, will Zhong Dao compromise?" Ning Zhuo found himself unable to answer this critical question.

His understanding of Zhong Dao was limited to publicly available information. Having never interacted with the man personally, he couldn't be sure of his stance.

Leveraging Zhong Dao's influence had been Ning Zhuo's plan since he first reviewed the intelligence.

However, it wasn't until he stood on the stone platform, facing the third question, that he finally made his decision.

Once the decision was made, Ning Zhuo wasted no time.

After leaving the Demon Subjugation Hall, he immediately found the nearest registration point.

Even after so many days, the line of cultivators waiting to register remained long and crowded.

Ning Zhuo, familiar with the process, walked straight to the front of the line.

"Hey, big-headed guy, get to the back of the line!" a cultivator shouted, noticing Ning Zhuo cutting ahead.

The registration official's attention was drawn to the commotion. Seeing Ning Zhuo was unfamiliar, he was about to ask him to step aside when Ning Zhuo produced three tokens of first-place honors.

"I'm here to exchange these for a stone tablet," Ning Zhuo stated.

The official's expression changed dramatically. At this stage, possessing three first-place tokens was irrefutable proof of Ning Zhuo's exceptional talent.

Moreover, it demonstrated that he belonged to the most elite group of cultivators at this year's Flying Cloud Assembly.

Realizing Ning Zhuo's immense potential, the supervising cultivator immediately stood up, his face beaming with a smile. "Fellow Daoist, I haven't had the pleasure of learning your name yet."

Ning Zhuo replied.

The cultivator's smile widened. "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, please wait a moment while we verify the authenticity of your credentials."

"I'll do it! I'll do it!" His companion eagerly reached out to grab the credentials for testing.

Several other companions joined in, nearly starting a scuffle.

Seeing this, the long line of cultivators waiting to register behind Ning Zhuo fell into complete silence.

The entire hall became eerily quiet.

The three cultivators responsible for testing moved swiftly, almost simultaneously declaring, "Authentic."

The cultivator facing Ning Zhuo burst into laughter, retrieved a stone token, and exchanged it for the wooden one Ning Zhuo had presented. "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, the Sect welcomes you warmly. There's just one final formality. After receiving your stone token, the Sect requires additional information for our records."

"Oh, I understand. What do you need to know?" Ning Zhuo asked.

The cultivator quickly replied, "We need to record your Cultivation Art and current cultivation stage."

Prepared for this, Ning Zhuo immediately answered, "Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual. Currently mid-Foundation Establishment, at the Phenomena Seed Talisman stage."

The responsible cultivator quickly recorded the information on a Jade Slip: "I see. Thank you, Fellow Daoist. I've made a note of it."

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, this is my spiritual energy signature. If you exchange your token later, please come to me. I'll personally handle these trivial matters for you at full speed."

His companion immediately cast envious glances.

Cultivators assigned to such tasks were typically at the lower rungs of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Meeting someone like Ning Zhuo was a great honor for them, potentially altering their entire destiny.

Ning Zhuo accepted the spiritual energy signature offered by the cultivator with a smile, but he didn't reciprocate with his own.

This simple gesture immediately drew even more envious and even jealous gazes toward the responsible cultivator.

The cultivator himself beamed with joy, unable to contain his delight!

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, safe travels," the cultivator said, respectfully seeing him off. Ning Zhuo leisurely departed from the nameless peak where registration was held.

As he flew back to his Azure Stone Cave Abode, Ning Zhuo's expression remained impassive, his eyes closed.

He knew his actions would inevitably have far-reaching consequences.

Information about him would now be highly valued and actively sought after by countless interested parties.

"Then let them come."
