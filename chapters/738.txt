Chapter 738: This is the Dawn Exorcising Devil Score!

"Damn it, damn it!" Huo Wa'er clenched his fists, extremely unwilling.

His bamboo puppets not only had sound-component parts, but also incorporated his unique mechanical parts, each of which could self-destruct. And the destructive power of the self-destruction was considerable.

But now, he had no way to control these bamboo puppets, watching helplessly as they were cut down like vegetables by Ning Zhuo's squad, unable to play any role.

This made Huo Wa'er, who wanted to perform well, feel utterly aggrieved.

Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppet squad directly crushed the Fire Bandit's small team and rushed to Zhang Dadan's bamboo puppets.

Zhang Dadan knew his disadvantage; unlike other cultivators of the Art of Mechanisms, his spiritual sense was coarse and difficult to control precisely. Thus, he played to his strength and only released three heavy-armored bamboo puppets.

When unable to be controlled, these three large puppets appeared very clumsy, stopping in place like pillars.

But Zhang Dadan was not too worried: "Even if I can't control them temporarily, with this defense, it's enough for you to hack for a while."

The next moment, Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppet phalanx, like flowing water, bypassed the three large puppets and continued to charge towards the rear.

Zhang Dadan: "Huh..."

His plan fell through? Ning Zhuo had never intended to tangle with them from the start.

Ning Zhuo himself had personally experienced two great wars and knew all too well how important it was to seize the military opportunity.

"At this moment, I want to inflict maximum damage, not get entangled with clumsy opponents. I must avoid such a waste of time."

Ning Zhuo's phalanx rushed all the way, taking advantage of the opponents' restraint, causing several times the casualties to the enemy. The scale of the battle results was visible to the naked eye.

"Damn it!" Chen San was the first to regain his ability to move. He gritted his teeth and fully urged his bamboo puppet team.

His situation was somewhat awkward. Before the battle began, he had already maneuvered his small bamboo puppet team to break away from the main force, intending to flank and surround Ning Zhuo's squad from the rear.

But unexpectedly, facing such an enemy, Ning Zhuo did not choose to defend solidly, but instead used offense as a defense!

Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppet battle squad was like a fierce tiger descending a mountain. The beast pack under its sharp claws could not last a single round; some were wounded, and some were killed.

Chen San could only fully control his squad to rush over from the rear, but he couldn't catch up with Ning Zhuo's squad. He could only watch helplessly as the only enemy army on the field charged deep into his formation like a fierce tiger.

Thus, the encirclement lost all meaning.

Chen San could only follow the gap Ning Zhuo had created and plunge in.

"Get out of the way quickly!" Chen San shouted at Zhang Dadan.

Zhang Dadan replied with a wry smile.

The next moment, the onlookers witnessed a comical scene - Chen San's bamboo puppet team slammed head-on into the three heavy-armored bamboo puppets. Many bamboo puppets were directly knocked to the ground, lightly damaged, or seriously scattered and dismantled.

"Does he really practice the Art of Mechanisms with such a control method?"

"Compared to Ning Zhuo, the gap is too obvious."

"He's practically a clown!"

The crowd burst into laughter, some unscrupulously giving Chen San sharp ridicule and sarcasm.

Chen San's face grew even worse, his eye twitching. He cried out in his heart: "My performance is already very good! You must know, I have never developed anything in the way of sound-based control!"

While Chen San was chasing with all his might, Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppet team's killing momentum was checked for the first time.

Jiang Xiaolan was trying her best, blowing the flute until her face was flushed red.

The sharp flute sound, even under the cover of Ning Zhuo's zither music, still firmly occupied a place. This led to her insect-bamboo puppets also showing tenacious resistance.

This bizarre squad, composed of beetle shells, arm blades, and poisonous needles, exhibited a stiff, yet fearless and painful tenacity, full of aggression.

Ting! Sha! (Sound of impact and cutting)

The insect-bamboo puppets fearlessly clashed head-on with Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppets.

Arm blades sliced through the surfaces of the puppets, poisonous needles cleverly stabbed at the joints and other weak points of Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppets. Even Ning Zhuo's own movement of playing the ancient zither slowed down a little.

This was not due to external influence, but the young man with the large head, seeing something interesting, had a strong desire to investigate.

He subconsciously slowed down his offense, wanting to take a good look at the performance of these insect-bamboo puppets.

As a result, his opponents all misunderstood.

"Good!"

"We still have a chance!!"

"Quickly adjust. Don't waste energy on each other; focus on supporting Jiang Xiaolan!"

"Although Ning Zhuo is strong, this is just a contest of bamboo puppets. If everyone works together, we still have a great chance to win this battle!"

This temporary alliance, under Ning Zhuo's immense pressure, adjusted on the fly, establishing primary and secondary roles.

This allowed the sounds they each produced to be quickly re-aligned. Jiang Xiaolan, Chen San, Zhang Dadan, and others became the main force.

Jiang Xiaolan had never blown her bamboo flute so fiercely, but after a long attack with no breakthrough, she felt her offensive was like a tide while the opponent was as firm as a rock.

"Chen San! Quickly! Pincer attack!" Seeing Chen San's squad charge behind Ning Zhuo's forces, Jiang Xiaolan's eyes lit up, and she quickly sent a voice message.

Chen San heard the urgency in Jiang Xiaolan's voice. His pupils constricted, knowing that Jiang Xiaolan appeared to be on the offensive but was actually exhausted and couldn't sustain it for much longer.

"Ning Zhuo's Art of Mechanisms is truly strong. I admit that none of us is your match."

"But precisely because of this, the current situation has been created."

"The path of cultivation lies in striving! Ning Zhuo, you are a first-rate genius, but I am not. I must seize every opportunity possible."

"For you, the legacy of Elder Qing Huangzi might be nothing. But for me, it is the greatest opportunity in this life!"

Chen San roared in his heart, fully exerting himself, controlling all his bamboo puppets to violently crash into the rear of Ning Zhuo's squad.

Ning Zhuo's squad was in a pincer attack predicament!

Seeing this situation, the observing cultivators inevitably became nervous, as if Ning Zhuo's defeat was imminent.

"Are they going to succeed?" Old Patchwork Sun nervously clenched his fists. He knew his strength was insufficient, so he simply kept all his puppets in the back.

Only by first dealing with Ning Zhuo could he hope to control his puppets and find some slim chance of victory in the subsequent competition.

Ning Zhuo's face was calm. His eyes narrowed slightly, and he felt a little disappointed in his heart.

"Is that all there is?" After observing for a moment, he couldn't see the insect-bamboo puppets exhibiting any more novelty.

So, the next moment, Ning Zhuo's suspended left hand, whose five fingers had only been plucking one or two strings, suddenly spread open. The five fingers were like the claws of a soaring bird, suddenly bringing a shadow down and enveloping the zither strings!

Zheng zheng zheng zheng...

Although still piercing, this suddenly erupted zither music was distinct in rhythm, solemn, grand, and brought out a strong fighting spirit of clashing metal, iron, and blood!

Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppets instantly seemed to come alive.

They seemed to truly transform into a hundred-veteran elite army!

Those few openings that seemed to have been "torn open" were instantly sealed! The few insect-bamboo puppets that rushed in were like falling into a whirlpool of a meat grinder, quickly eliminated.

The inner circle of bamboo puppets moved with staggered steps and twisted bodies, their arms like spears, accurately stabbing joints!

The outer circle of bamboo puppets rotated like a wheel, raising a whistling wind and violently knocking away the subsequent surging insect puppets!

Some bamboo puppets slyly attacked the lower limbs, while others leaped high, like a fierce tiger pouncing on its prey, savagely attacking and eliminating Chen San's bamboo puppets.

The entire bamboo puppet phalanx transformed into a high-speed, precisely interlocking mechanical millstone!

No matter how tough the insect shells, how cunning and peculiar the poisonous needles and arm blades, no matter the attack from the rear, once they fell into this killing formation driven by rhythm, they were like soybeans thrown into a stone mill, utterly crushed!

Jiang Xiaolan and Chen San's eyes widened suddenly, their pupils shrinking, their faces filled with shock.

The onlookers suddenly let out a collective gasp of surprise.

"This is... a battle formation?"

"Controlled as if by a finger! What kind of control skill is this!"

"Military formation! He actually integrated the way of military formations into puppet control?!"

On the stone seat, Elder Qing Huangzi straightened his hunched back, and his cloudy old eyes shot out an unprecedented brilliance.

He had been worried for Ning Zhuo just a moment ago, but now he was so excited he nearly stood up.

"Ning Zhuo possesses such strength. No wonder he was so confident."

"A genius like this, able to inherit my mentor's legacy, will surely carry it forward. This is truly heaven's blessing upon me."

Elder Qing Huangzi was surprised in his heart.

He had anticipated Ning Zhuo's skill in mechanism crafting, but he hadn't expected the latter also to practice the military path, and that his military skill was also profound.

The crowd's gasps subsided, replaced by discussion about Ning Zhuo.

"Ning Zhuo is so young, yet he has such skill. He truly is a genius. He has already left all his opponents far behind."

"Controlling dozens of bamboo puppets with one person, and being able to execute such a precise battle formation... The top spot in this trial is already settled!"

Everyone unanimously believed that Ning Zhuo was bound to be the winner of this Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

At this moment, Ning Zhuo raised his head to look at Elder Qing Huangzi.

Elder Qing Huangzi's eyes suddenly narrowed, sensing a fervent eagerness to try from Ning Zhuo.

The old cultivator couldn't help but feel a surge of heroism at this moment: "This boy is not satisfied yet, he's looking forward to a higher difficulty? If that's the case, then I'll add fuel to the fire!"

He flipped his withered hand, and a jade-black flute appeared.

Elder Qing Huangzi brought the flute to his lips, took a deep breath, and used his spiritual sense and spiritual energy to blow with all his might!

Ming -  (A sharp, resounding sound)

The sound suddenly rose, instantly overriding all other sounds. It directly targeted other musical tones, causing strong interference and distortion.

Old Patchwork Sun, Jiang Xiaolan, Chen San, Zhang Dadan, and others' faces turned pale, as if struck by a heavy blow.

The difficulty of controlling the bamboo puppets increased several times. The bamboo puppets in the arena stumbled, some fell directly to the ground, and others spun wildly in place!

Ning Zhuo's battle formation, which had been perfectly controlled, was also severely affected. All the bamboo puppets' movements slowed down and became distorted.

"Elder Qing Huangzi has made a move!"

"What kind of sound is that? I feel that even spiritual sense communication is very difficult."

"This must be the true test of this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, right?"

Ning Zhuo's phalanx became chaotic, and the losses became severe.

Although his opponents suffered even greater losses than he did, the situation was clearly more disadvantageous for Ning Zhuo.

Because he couldn't afford to trade.

He was fighting against multiple opponents, and every bamboo puppet was precious. Conversely, his opponents had abundant soldiers, large teams, and could withstand the attrition.

Furthermore, people like Zhang Dadan, who only had three heavy-armored bamboo puppets, were already difficult to control. In this situation, the large bamboo puppets threatened Ning Zhuo's squad, like three heavy hammers trying to crush his phalanx.

The observing cultivators were somewhat dissatisfied when they saw Ning Zhuo being targeted.

"What's wrong with Elder Qing Huangzi, is he playing favorites?"

"First, the rules allow teaming up, and now there's sound interference. This is a bit too much targeting of Ning Zhuo."

"This is not fair at all!"

Chen San's eyebrows furrowed slightly, then smoothed out. His calm expression changed for the first time, adding a hint of fighting spirit.

In front of everyone, he slowly spoke, his voice not loud, but amplified by spiritual energy, making the message clear: "Only now does it become somewhat interesting."

"It's worth using both my hands for."

Chen San, Jiang Xiaolan, and the others' pupils suddenly shrank to the size of needle tips.

Old Patchwork Sun's music went completely off-key.

Zhang Dadan's heart also skipped a beat.

The observing cultivators then realized: all along, despite the seemingly dangerous situation, Ning Zhuo had only used his right hand.

Now, his hands floated in the air, and ten fingers rested on the ancient zither.

Na fu fu qian... (Sound of intense zither playing)

Ning Zhuo's hands swept and rolled across the zither strings like a violent storm!

The ancient zither erupted with an unprecedented sound, sharp, savage, and like a furious roar.

The sound was tearing, yet penetrating, filled with an extreme fighting spirit.

The zither music directly overwhelmed the entire arena, even stealing the spotlight from Elder Qing Huangzi's flute sound.

Elder Qing Huangzi's fingers gripping the flute trembled slightly, his eyes filled with disbelief and surprise!

"This child's musical skill is surprisingly solid and profound! How old is he? He is practically my contemporary! If I only use my Foundation Establishment level strength, I would actually be suppressed by him!"

Accompanied by the zither music that dominated the arena, Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppets were like fierce tigers breaking free from their chains. The formation once again flowed smoothly without obstruction!

Crushing. Complete crushing.

Sweeping away all resistance! Truly sweeping away all resistance!

About a dozen breaths later, only Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppets remained on the stone platform. They still maintained a strict formation, standing quietly in position.

All the other bamboo puppets had been reduced to a pile of fragments and broken pieces on the ground!

The dust settled.

Only the final, mournful echo of the zither music lingered in the air and in the hearts of the crowd for a long time.

A few breaths later, Elder Qing Huangzi broke the silence and asked Ning Zhuo: "What ancient zither score method are you using?"

Ning Zhuo bowed with his hands clasped and said loudly: "Elder Qing Huangzi, this is the Dawn Exorcising Devil Score. Its intent is to glorify the righteous path, to eliminate and exorcise devils, using the tearing zither sound to slay all evil. Even if there is darkness, it must be torn and pierced through. If there is a long night, I shall bring the dawn!"

The young man in white stood tall and straight, his words resonating clearly.

"Good, good, a 'Dawn'." Elder Qing Huangzi finally stood up in excitement. His gaze was burning as he looked at Ning Zhuo, filled with admiration for this successor.

"In this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, you are the winner!"

"This legacy of my mentor, for you to inherit, is most appropriate."

A smile bloomed on Ning Zhuo's face. He said loudly: "Thank you, Elder!"

Old Patchwork Sun, Chen San, Jiang Xiaolan, Zhang Dadan, Huo Wa'er, and the others had ashen faces and no dissent.

The large area of shattered bamboo puppet fragments on the stone platform best reflected the deep sense of powerlessness in their hearts at that moment.

The crowd of onlookers, who had initially come with curiosity and doubt about Ning Zhuo, having witnessed this trial firsthand, were left only with respect and shock.

"This... this is simply crushing!"

"Actually, Elder Qing Huangzi already showed so much favoritism, yet he still couldn't suppress Ning Zhuo."

"There's no point in continuing this Rising Cloud Minor Trial. Ning Zhuo is too outstanding. Elder Qing Huangzi's decision is wise."
