Chapter 537: Arrangements

Sun Lingtong’s expression was anxious as he stared intently at the Ice Pipa: “Little Zhuo, you restrain Tian Shuang; I will attempt to steal this magic treasure!”

Ning Zhuo: “Great Buddha above, these Buddha treasures are a scourge to the world; the sooner they are eliminated, the sooner they can benefit the people.”

Sun Lingtong was momentarily speechless: “Alright, Little Zhuo, I am taking action.”

Just as they were speaking, Tian Shuang took a deep breath, and his palms suddenly pressed together tightly in front of his chest.

Divine Power - Xuan Yin Frozen Realm!

In an instant, centering on Tian Shuang, a barrier of ice mist spanning a hundred zhang unfolded.

Within the barrier, mist pervaded, condensing into countless inverted ice spikes.

The ice spikes displayed a grim green and deep black color, with eerie talismans carved on their surfaces.

Inside each ice spike, a Cold Prison Wailing Ghost was sealed, giving the ice spike extremely threatening lethality.

Both Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were trapped by the barrier, and every hair on their bodies stood on end.

Sun Lingtong warned loudly: “Little Zhuo, be extremely careful!”

The two of them had already learned the intelligence about the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, among which one detail mentioned was the Xuan Yin Frozen Realm.

This in itself was a spell involving space, frost, ghost Path, and numerous other mysterious and subtle techniques.

Tian Shuang comprehended the inner essence of the spell and grasped its underlying principles, thus transforming it into a Divine Power!

Once this Divine Power was unleashed, it could form a massive barrier in a very short time. Within the barrier, the frigid aura raged, capable of freezing both body and soul. The talismans on the ice spikes not only served a sealing function but could also cooperate with the Cold Prison Wailing Ghost to exchange souls.

The Cold Prison Wailing Ghost, bound in the frigid prison, emitted wails to attract external living beings, seeking to elicit sympathy.

Their cries were either heart-wrenching, or slight weeping, or plaintive and gentle, varying from person to person, most capable of touching a specific target.

Once the target living being was infected and shed tears out of sympathy, the Cold Prison Wailing Ghost would succeed in swapping its own soul with that of the target, thereby escaping from the icy prison.

If Ning Zhuo fell for it, his own soul would fall into an ice spike, and his body would be occupied by one of the ghosts within the ice spike!

A surging cold aura rushed and hit, greatly interfering with Ning Zhuo’s vision.

Countless ice spikes shot forth, piercing through the cold mist, and shooting toward Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo, riding on the somersault cloud, dodged rapidly in the air, occasionally flipping over, only able to evade and without any chance to counterattack.

All because at that moment, he was also being attacked by the sound of the pipa!

“My lord, I shall protect you!” At the critical moment, Yuan Dasheng once again stepped forward, using his own body as a shield to block nearly all of the ice spikes aimed at Ning Zhuo.

Hundreds of ice spikes were stabbed into his body, densely and even layered on top of one another.

The Somersault Cloud at his feet also suffered, disintegrating directly! This magic treasure–level Flying Cloud, under the terrifying assault of the ice spikes, met a tragic destruction.

Yuan Dasheng turned his head with difficulty, looked toward Ning Zhuo, and then the brilliance in his eyes quickly faded.

“You have labored hard. Come back!” Ning Zhuo sighed, releasing flames to scorch.

The ice spikes on Yuan Dasheng were burnt, howling, and dispersed in a rush.

Ning Zhuo took the burned, beyond-recognition, heavily armored Blood Ape, Dasheng, back into his bag.

A cry sounded from his body.

Although he dodged everywhere and had Yuan Dasheng’s protection, in the end he still got hit by several ice spikes.

The ice spikes embedded in his body, with the Cold Prison Wailing Ghost within, immediately launched an attack; the crying emanated from within his body, which immediately caused Ning Zhuo’s eyes to redden.

“Crap! Ning Zhuo, your divine sea is filled with Buddha thoughts,” Sun Lingtong exclaimed in shock.

“My Buddha is compassionate!” Ning Zhuo’s face was full of sorrow, “As the saying goes, if I do not enter hell, who will enter hell…”

“Bullshit!” Sun Lingtong roared.

At the critical moment, he could no longer hold back and directly took action.

Stealing Technique - Actually Copying Hands!

The several ice spikes embedded in Ning Zhuo disappeared in an instant, appearing in the mechanical dragon.

Ning Zhuo returned to safety!

But through this incident, Sun Lingtong was exposed in the eyes of Tian Shuang, Zhu Xuanji, Lin Bufan, and the Red Sleeve Fairy.

The Red Sleeve Fairy let out a soft “Eek.”

Lin Bufan frowned: “The one who just took action doesn’t seem to be Ning Zhuo.”

Zhu Xuanji nodded: “Of course.”

Being a divine constable, he had long known that Sun Lingtong was right by Ning Zhuo’s side. Back in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he had encountered Sun Lingtong and was deeply impressed by him.

After all, in Zhu Xuanji’s life, he had rarely been bump-caught or had someone cling to him on the street.

Tian Shuang roared angrily: “No matter how many allies you hide, all must perish in my Xuan Yin Frozen Realm!”

Half of his Buddha thoughts had already been nullified, and his own power was further unleashed.

Ning Zhuo maneuvered the somersault cloud, struggling within the Xuan Yin Frozen Realm.

His somersault cloud was merely a magical tool, and it soon was scrapped.

“Ning Zhuo, use mine!” Sun Lingtong immediately lent his own somersault cloud.

Back then, in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had also bought one for Sun Lingtong.

Because Sun Lingtong was the one who actively lent it, Ning Zhuo accepted it without any hesitation.

But evidently, this magical tool–level Flying Cloud could not last long either.

Tian Shuang roared, and once again threw out a magic treasure.

This was a wholly transparent Cold Jade Coffin, overall presenting an icy blue luster.

The coffin was carved from the Xuan Yin Cold Jade of the extremely cold land, crystal clear and transparent, and just by looking at it, one could feel the bone-chilling cold penetrating deep into the bones.

The four sides of the coffin were carved with intricate and ancient talismans, which emitted a faint blue light.

Along the edge of the coffin, ice crystals were inlaid; the frost formed by the condensed cold aura created natural patterns on the surface of the coffin, like snowflakes blossoming in the cold winter.

On the coffin lid, it was covered with complex array patterns; these arrays combined with one another to form a spell formation. At the center of the formation was an ice-blue ghost-eye shape, taking form exactly at the center of the coffin lid.

Around the coffin lid, four cold pearls of different colors were inlaid; each of these cold pearls contained a force of extreme cold, capable of enhancing the power of the Xuan Yin Ice Coffin.

Through the transparent coffin, one could faintly see a frozen corpse puppet inside.

The corpse puppet was sealed within the Cold Jade, its face contorted, carrying the grievances and unwillingness from its past life, sending shivers down one’s spine.

Magic Treasure - Xuan Yin Ice Coffin!

Seeing Tian Shuang take out the Ice Coffin, the Earth Ghost immediately spoke up: “What the hell are you messing around with? Don’t arbitrarily open the coffin; do you know how much treasure I have to spend each time you open it?!”

“To deal with a mere Foundation Establishment, and you still want to open the coffin?!”

“Hmph! Shut your mouth for me.” Tian Shuang retorted, and ultimately did not open the coffin, but instead activated the coffin itself, unleashing a burst of chilly aura.

The chilly aura rushed toward Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo winced in pain at his fingertip, and immediately a chill ran down his heart.

At the critical moment, the mechanical Finger Ring gave a warning, telling him that he could not directly take the hit; directly taking the hit would certainly pose him mortal danger!

Ning Zhuo quickly dodged.

Cang Iron Armor!

In order to increase his own speed, he exerted all his strength, and even managed to put on his Mechanism Armor in an instant.

Mechanism Technique - Wind and Thunder Motion!

The spirit stones within the Cang Iron Armor were being consumed frantically, transforming into a massive surge of spiritual power. The spiritual power was eventually delivered into two palm-sized, intricately patterned Wind and Thunder talisman seals.

Each talisman emitted wind power and thunder power respectively, flowing along the internal formations of the Cang Iron Armor, merging together to ultimately form a brand new power - Wind and Thunder Motion!

Greenish-blue electric light swirled around the Cang Iron Armor.

In an instant, the speed of the Cang Iron Armor soared to the extreme.

Mechanism Technique - Iron Armor Chill!

Within the Cang Iron Armor, the defensive array was activated to its strongest state, humming as it operated.

In the formation, the forces of Metal and Water surged, emitting a fierce chill, and carrying the nature of metal, enveloping the entire Cang Iron Armor, causing its attack and defense to be integrated, and its defense to surge to the extreme.

The two major mechanical techniques of the Cang Iron Armor were almost simultaneously activated by Ning Zhuo.

After ten breaths.

The somersault cloud that Ning Zhuo borrowed was exhausted, and the surface of the Cang Iron Armor was scarred all over; this was the result after Ning Zhuo dodged with all his might.

Mechanism Technique - Azure Dragon Striking the Void!

From the back, shoulder blades, as well as the elbows and wrists of the Cang Iron Armor, the plates were suddenly flung open, revealing hidden explosive talismans.

The talismans lit up with dazzling white light, accompanied by Ning Zhuo’s movements and posture, propelling him to a burst of speed in a certain direction.

The mechanism technique originally used for fighting could be regarded as the battle power embodiment of the Cang Iron Armor. But when facing an enemy as strong as Tian Shuang, Ning Zhuo could only use it to evade and mitigate the crisis.

As Tian Shuang increasingly exerted his battle power, Ning Zhuo’s dodging became more and more perilous.

The mechanical ring kept warning repeatedly, and Sun Lingtong, within the mechanical dragon, continuously intervened; the two of them provided strong assistance to Ning Zhuo, which enabled him to continue struggling for survival within the Xuan Yin Frozen Realm.

Mechanism - Floating Ice, White Jade Hand!

Ning Zhuo used mechanical creations to freeze one of his own limbs, in order to heal his wounds.

His divine sense spread out, observing the Three Generals’ Camp.

The Three Generals’ Camp was constantly being attacked, in an extremely passive situation; the Three Generals were all exhausted, while the Earth Ghost remained far away, not having sustained a single wound.

Ning Zhuo originally had hopes for Liu Er and the others, but seeing this scene, he couldn’t help but sigh deeply.

“Ning Zhuo, we should retreat! Staying any longer will yield no benefit,” Sun Lingtong urgently warned.

Ning Zhuo said nothing.

Hidden in the shadows, Lin Bufan also spoke: “Ning Zhuo holding on until now far exceeded my expectations; it is extremely difficult. If there are any means or arrangements, they must be quickly activated to prevent any mishaps.”

Zhu Xuanji nodded, and suddenly smiled, turning his gaze to the distance: “My arrangement has arrived.”

Lin Bufan also followed his gaze, only to see a dense forest of mountains.

He then observed carefully, employing spells and divine sense, and discovered a trace of a clue.

Lin Bufan’s pupils immediately narrowed: “Quite a number of people have arrived. Impressive, such hidden means can already contend with my One-Leaf Canopy technique.”

These words immediately caught Zhu Xuanji’s attention, who wanted to speak but then paused.

“Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, you still dare to come here!”

“For the previous enmity, I will have you both pay back a hundredfold!”

“Kill! Beat these two ghosts to the point that their souls scatter!”

A group of cultivators suddenly appeared, forcefully intervening in the battlefield.

The unexpected appearance of reinforcements surprised and delighted Liu Guan Zhang, Ning, Sun, and others.

Ning Zhuo recognized that the reinforcements were all familiar faces; they were Nascent Soul cultivators from the main forces of Twin Rivers Kingdom.

“How did they come? It’s a bit too timely,” Ning Zhuo wondered curiously.

He did not know that the movements of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth had already been leaked by Zhu Xuanji through an insider to the main forces of Twin Rivers Kingdom.

“Heavenly Ghost, Liev Yang Zhenren is here!”

Liev Yang Zhenren flew high into the air and took out his destiny magic treasure, the Golden Crow Sky-Burning Mirror.

He channeled his main cultivation method, the Golden Crow Sky Patrol Technique, and immediately summoned a virtual image of the three-legged Golden Crow from the Golden Crow Sky-Burning Mirror.

The virtual image flapped its wings and flew high, rushing into the Xuan Yin Frozen Realm, and directly attacking the Ice Coffin.

Wherever it went, heat waves roiled and the frigid aura dissipated; even the coffin lid of the Ice Coffin showed signs of melting under this glaring golden sunlight.

Tian Shuang quickly retracted the Ice Coffin, and activated countless ice spikes, firing out a barrier that surged toward Liev Yang Zhenren.

The second cultivator flew to the rear of Liev Yang Zhenren, and it was the Taoist, Mountain Yuezi.

Mountain Yuezi had long been accumulating strength and brewing, and at this moment, with his fingers forming a gesture, he channeled a spell - The Five Peaks Soul-Subduing Seal!

A seal rapidly expanded, swelling to the size of a small mountain.

In the light and shadow of the seal, one could faintly see the eight square and upright guzheng carved at the bottom, which read “Imperial Order to All Ghosts, Five Peaks Subdue Souls.”

Once the seal was cast, it immediately suppressed all the ice spikes.

The Cold Prison Wailing Ghosts inside the ice spikes had no strength to resist, and were all tightly suppressed.

The third Nascent Soul cultivator was an old hunchback, wielding a damaged bronze sundial.

He dripped Time Snake Poison onto the sundial, causing it to trigger and run in reverse, emitting a bronze radiance.

The radiance shone on the barrier, and the entire Xuan Yin Frozen Realm seemed as if time was rewinding, automatically retracting, and in a few breaths, it completely dissipated.

Tian Shuang coughed up a little blood, glanced at the three Nascent Soul cultivators, and surprisingly, instead of retreating, advanced toward Ning Zhuo!

Catching Ning Zhuo and completing his sect’s mission was the greatest objective of his journey.

Ning Zhuo retreated at full speed, without hesitation igniting all the talismans in the Cang Iron Armor to maximize his speed.

The hunchback old man slightly flicked his wrist, causing the bronze radiance to also shine upon Ning Zhuo.

In an instant, time itself flowed faster for Ning Zhuo, allowing him to quickly widen the distance between himself and Tian Shuang, and he soon escaped from danger.

The reinforcements from the Twin Rivers Kingdom were clearly well-prepared, not only targeting Tian Shuang but also dealing with the Earth Ghost.

Last time, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth and other cultivators had fought over treasures underground on the battlefield, suppressing the entire main forces of the Twin Rivers Kingdom, which brought enormous humiliation to the latter.

The main forces of the Twin Rivers Kingdom suffered losses, and after reflection, fully exploited the advantage of numbers. This time, not only were the personnel carefully selected, but the methods employed were also meticulously planned.

“Divine Constable Zhu, your arangement is excellent!” Lin Bufan, upon seeing this, sighed deeply, moved.

He connected the dots and understood many things.

Since the Red Sleeve Fairy was the arrangement of the Southern Bean Kingdom in the Thousand Peaks Forest, then earlier, the fact that the Red Sleeve Fairy and others actively arranged to meet the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth to obtain the great treasure was naturally at Zhu Xuanji’s behest.

At that time, Zhu Xuanji arranged for Lin Bufan to oversee Ning Zhuo, who was attacking the Ten-li Burning Forest, while also arranging for the Red Sleeve Fairy to guide the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth into causing havoc on the battlefield.

This scheme not only temporarily prevented the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth from capturing Ning Zhuo but also served another purpose, which was to establish a rift between the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth and the main forces of Twin Rivers Kingdom.

Now, as this conflict erupted, it was all used by Zhu Xuanji.

Allowing Zhu Xuanji to sit aside, and with the help of the Twin Rivers Kingdom’s forces, deal with the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth; on one hand, to protect his own man Ning Zhuo, and on the other hand, to weaken the power of the Twin Rivers Kingdom and Thousand Peaks Forest, further increasing their friction and hatred.
