Chapter 709: Bamboo Puppet's Trial Run

Over a hundred cultivators had gathered at the summit of Green Bamboo Peak.

Though Peak Master Qing Huangzi had yet to appear, Ning Zhuo had already arrived.

It was early morning, and the sky was still dim.

A vast sea of clouds rolled silently around the mountain's waist, resembling countless slumbering cloud beasts slowly stretching their massive bodies.

The bamboo forests that blanketed Green Bamboo Peak were a deep, muted color - neither emerald nor jade, but a warm, restrained hue that radiated a metallic, cold sheen. As the light shifted, jade-like patterns shimmered faintly within the stalks.

The bamboo leaves were paper-thin, their edges rimmed with a crystalline jade light. When the morning breeze rustled through them, the myriad jade leaves brushed against each other, producing a soft, rustling sound. This sound was unlike the rustle of ordinary foliage; it resembled the gentle striking of countless tiny jade chimes by the wind, creating a clear, ethereal melody - a "bamboo wave jade chime" that cleansed the world's clamor.

As Ning Zhuo admired the scenery, he sensed someone's gaze upon him.

Turning his head, he followed the gaze to find Ban Ji smiling faintly. Using divine sense, he transmitted, "Fellow Daoist Ban Ji, I didn't expect to encounter you here."

Ban Ji's amber eyes flashed with coldness as he replied through divine sense, "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, I agreed to postpone our duel. Yet you repay my goodwill by coming here to make things difficult for me."

"What's wrong?"

"After investigating me, did you conclude that Ban Ji of the Ban Clan would be an easy opponent?"

"You dare try to ambush me during the Mechanism-related Flying Cloud Trial?"

"Hmph, what a fool's dream!"

Ning Zhuo maintained his smile as he communicated through divine sense: "Fellow Daoist Ban Ji, to be frank, I also possess some understanding of Mechanism techniques."

"After investigating your background, I've grown quite interested in you."

"I humbly request your guidance during this Flying Cloud Trial."

Ban Ji snorted coldly, ignoring Ning Zhuo.

His face was like frost, but his vigilance had intensified.

He had been planning for Qing Huangzi's Flying Cloud Trial for a long time. The former had organized the trial to select suitable Cultivators as successors to his Mechanism legacy.

Qing Huangzi's Mechanism techniques would be a powerful complement to Ban Ji's own skills, making this opportunity crucial.

Now, Ning Zhuo's sudden interference... made Ban Ji feel a flicker of unease.

Ning Zhuo is my Human Tribulation, but since our clan activated the Mechanisms, he can sense the anomaly within me.

That's why he's here!

Will his presence disrupt the trial?

Ban Ji's mind churned with irritation.

Ning Zhuo's proactive approach was undoubtedly an aggressive move. Ban Ji immediately realized that Ning Zhuo's earlier refusal to spar wasn't cowardice, but a calculated strategy to gather intelligence first.

"This young man is indeed full of youthful vigor!"

"I wasn't looking for trouble with him, yet he came looking for trouble with me. Heh."

"I'll see what this Human Tribulation is truly worth!"

With these thoughts, a figure drifted gracefully into view.

Qing Huangzi stood before the assembled cultivators.

His gaze was calm and steady, framed by three wisps of long beard. His slender frame was draped in a flowing green robe, and he carried a nine-section jade bamboo staff, a small bronze bell hanging from its tip.

The surrounding area fell into immediate silence.

Qing Huangzi slowly began to explain the purpose of the Flying Cloud Trial. He revealed that his lifespan was nearing its end, and having no worthy successor, he had decided to use this year's Flying Cloud Assembly as an opportunity to set up a series of trials to select outstanding cultivators to inherit his legacy.

Clearly, many of the cultivators present had already learned of this beforehand, as their expressions remained unchanged upon hearing Qing Huangzi's words.

Among them were elderly men, young masters and ladies from noble families, and solitary cultivators dressed in practical attire, swords and sabers strapped to their backs.

"Very well, let the trial begin," Qing Huangzi declared after explaining his reasons, his tone decisive. He struck the ground with his bamboo staff, initiating the process. "Grand Formation, activate!"

As the staff touched the ground, jade-green light rippled outward like water, blurring and distorting the figures of the hundred cultivators within its glow, as if they had been submerged in shimmering, swaying jade-green water.

As Ning Zhuo's vision stabilized, he realized that he and the other cultivators had been transported by the Grand Formation to an enclosed space within the array.

They stood in a clearing surrounded by towering walls of green bamboo that soared into the clouds.

Ban Ji took a deep breath, inhaling the crisp, slightly pungent scent of freshly broken bamboo and the heavy, damp aroma of earth.

Most of the cultivators, however, were visibly agitated. They discovered that the Grand Formation had suppressed their cultivation levels to the Foundation Establishment Stage. Moreover, their spiritual talismans, magic artifacts, and even medicinal pills were bound by a restrictive force, making them nearly impossible to access.

Qing Huangzi remained unseen, but his voice echoed through the space: "The Bamboo Puppets are about to arrive. Each of you must exert your utmost effort to select one. You may only use your divine sense and spiritual energy Threads to attempt control and refine it for your own use."

"Once the time limit expires, any cultivator who fails to claim a Bamboo Puppet will be eliminated."

As his words faded, the air trembled, sending semi-transparent ripples through the atmosphere.

Then, like a flock of startled emerald birds, countless Bamboo Puppets cascaded from the sky, rustling as they fell.

The cultivators, already poised for action, simultaneously unleashed their divine sense in a massive sweep.

Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with sharp focus as his divine sense spread out. He immediately discerned that the vast majority of the Bamboo Puppets were merely Magic Artifact-grade. However, a select few radiated a brilliant, treasure-like glow, clearly reaching Magic Treasure-grade.

Without a doubt, the Magic Treasure-grade Bamboo Puppets were the primary targets of everyone's competition!

As expected, dozens of Spiritual Energy Threads shot forth like lightning, each aimed at the Magic Treasure-grade elites within the Bamboo Puppet swarm.

The Spiritual Energy Threads tangled and clashed in mid-air, many dissipating as they collided.

However, a select few, forged with exceptional resilience, broke through the chaotic fray and latched onto the Bamboo Puppets.

Ning Zhuo's Five Qi Threads were among them.

His divine sense followed the Spiritual Energy Threads, swiftly infiltrating the puppets' interiors. But other cultivators were doing the same.

Multiple streams of divine sense collided within the puppets, engaging in fierce clashes that drained their energy.

"Heh heh heh, ha ha ha!" Ban Ji's divine sense transmitted a wild, unrestrained laughter. "Is this all you've got? Get out of my way!"

His divine sense radiated overwhelming demonic intent, corroding and rapidly dismantling the other cultivators' divine senses, then absorbing their remnants to bolster his own.

Ban Ji cultivated the demonic art Greedy Opportunity Demonic Heart Art, a technique he had acquired through a separate opportunity rather than inheriting it from the Ban Clan.

This art emphasized: Nourish the demon with greed; as the demon grows stronger, opportunities become more perilous. Seize opportunities to feed greed; as greed intensifies, the demon rages.

Fueled by demonic intent and frenzied thoughts, Ban Ji swept aside his opponents with unstoppable momentum.

Even Ning Zhuo's divine sense suffered repeated defeats, unable to maintain its defenses, and was forced to swallow the bitter fruit of his rout.

Ban Ji taunted Ning Zhuo, "Ning Zhuo, I thought you were special. Your divine sense is pathetic - how dare you try to stop me?"

He seized the opportunity to crush Ning Zhuo's morale.

"Interesting!" Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up with excitement.

Though he had participated in several major battles, this was his first encounter with a clash of divine senses.

"So this is the Greedy Opportunity Demonic Heart Art? It must be a top-tier Cultivation Art - truly formidable!"

"My Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual is also a first-rate Cultivation Art, but its strength lies in spirit communication, not divine sense."

"Losing to an opponent like Ban Ji is only natural."

Ning Zhuo remained undeterred, possessing clear self-awareness.

In truth, the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual had a significant weakness in divine sense cultivation. To compensate, the Three Sects' High Priests had designed numerous Mechanical Mirrors to enhance its capabilities, expanding its range, improving its precision, or deepening its perception.

However, Ning Zhuo couldn't use these tools. Qing Huangzi had strictly forbidden the use of anything beyond divine sense and Spiritual Energy Threads.

Having suffered a minor setback, Ning Zhuo maintained his composure and immediately shifted his focus, targeting other Magic Treasure-grade Bamboo Puppets.

Ban Ji grinned maliciously. "Ning Zhuo, I'll make you understand the pain of defying me!"

Having successfully claimed one Bamboo Puppet, Ning Zhuo didn't rest on his laurels. He immediately activated his Spiritual Energy Threads and Divine Sense to join the scramble for the remaining puppets.

The rules stipulated that each participant could claim only one Bamboo Puppet.

Ning Zhuo! Ban Ji had already secured his minimum requirement and was now focused on disrupting Ning Zhuo's attempts, which had repeatedly failed.

Besides Ban Ji, several other cultivators possessed exceptional divine sense, either through specialized Cultivation Arts or secret techniques. In this competition, Ning Zhuo's divine sense was unremarkable.

However, he wasn't without advantages.

Ning Zhuo's strength lay in the endurance and rapid recovery of his divine sense. This wasn't due to the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual, but rather his profound foundation - a physical body and soul far surpassing ordinary cultivators.

It wasn't until the final Magic Treasure-grade puppet that Ning Zhuo finally saw an opening.

This guy's divine sense isn't particularly strong, yet he keeps coming back, never giving up.

He's my Human Tribulation. I can't underestimate him!

To be safe, I must seize every opportunity. Ideally, I should eliminate him in the first round!

As Ban Ji thought this, his breathing grew heavy and ragged, like the wheezing of a broken bellows.

Ban Ji surged forward, his divine sense overflowing with greed, crashing like a tidal wave against Ning Zhuo's.

Ning Zhuo immediately felt Ban Ji's overwhelming desires: Mine! Seize it! Tear you apart!

Ning Zhuo's divine sense retreated step by step, while Qing Huangzi's voice echoed once more, warning them that only thirty breaths remained.

"I've won!" Ban Ji roared with laughter, taunting Ning Zhuo. "You're finished!"

But a faint smile suddenly curved Ning Zhuo's lips.

He transmitted a message through his divine sense: Fellow cultivators, how much longer will you endure? This is our final chance!

The cultivators' expressions turned grim as they suddenly launched a coordinated attack, surrounding Ban Ji.

Ban Ji's face twisted in shock.

It turned out that divine sense clashes could also transmit thoughts.

While battling Ban Ji, Ning Zhuo had been secretly communicating with his allies.

Ban Ji relentlessly pursued Ning Zhuo's divine sense, exerting all his might to suppress him, displaying an arrogant, overbearing aura.

This alarmed and intimidated the other cultivators. Under Ning Zhuo's coordination, they had secretly formed an alliance against Ban Ji.

"Ban Ji's power is overwhelming. If we let him unleash his full strength later, our chances will be slim!"

"He's crushing Ning Zhuo now. Once Ning Zhuo falls, we'll be next."

"Attack with full force! Eliminate Ban Ji first!"

The cultivators, united in their hatred, launched a coordinated assault.

Ban Ji frantically mustered all his strength to defend himself, but the sheer number of cultivators overwhelmed him. His earlier pursuit of Ning Zhuo's divine sense had already drained much of his energy, leaving him in a desperate retreat.

"Damn it!"

"I was so focused on suppressing Ning Zhuo and trying to force him out that I forgot about these cultivators."

"My Ban Clan is one of the few Mechanical Clans in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, and I'm the only candidate they've recommended to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect. This very position makes me a target of envy and resentment."

"That Ning Zhuo, on the other hand, has kept a low profile and hasn't received the recognition he deserves."

"Damn him..."

"Hold on! I have to hold on!"

Ban Ji gritted his teeth, his body trembling violently.

He desperately pushed his divine sense to its limits, causing his Upper Dantian's divine sea to convulse violently, as if pierced and churned by thousands of rusty steel needles!

"I can't lose!"

"I can't fall here. I'll hold on even if it kills me!"

"Hold on! Just hold on!"

Ban Ji squeezed every last drop of potential from his body. His eyes became bloodshot, his face twisted into a terrifying grimace.

In those thirty short breaths, time stretched into an eternity.

Ning Zhuo charged ahead, his divine sense depleted, drawing fresh reserves from his divine sea.

Without such leadership, how could the other cultivators follow?

The morale of the group must not waver!

"Three, two, one, time's up," Qing Huangzi announced.

Ning Zhuo's vision blurred, his face deathly pale, his entire body feeling numb and weak.

"No!!!" Ban Ji howled in anguish, tearing at his hair, his eyes burning with murderous intent, as if he wanted to devour someone alive.

He had persevered to the very end, clinging on with every ounce of his strength, but ultimately failed to hold his ground. The Bamboo Puppet he had seized earlier had been snatched away by another cultivator.

He never imagined he would fall in the very first stage.

To prepare for the trial, he had meticulously researched Qing Huangzi's background, even speculating on how the master might test his successor. He had been confident in his thorough preparation, certain he would achieve his goal.

Yet, in the very first round, he had been eliminated by the collective efforts of the other cultivators!

"Ning Zhuo is the real culprit! I'll kill him! I'll kill him!"

Ban Ji was so enraged he nearly died on the spot, wishing he could tear Ning Zhuo apart alive.

Ning Zhuo responded with a faint smile - a pale, feeble expression. This victory was a pyrrhic one for him as well.

He hadn't managed to secure a Magic Treasure-grade Bamboo Puppet. In the end, he only obtained a Magic Artifact-grade one.

But Ban Ji had been eliminated, losing his chance to participate in the next stage.

With this outcome, Ning Zhuo was satisfied.

He manipulated his palm-sized Bamboo Puppet, guiding it through the miniature maze constructed from green bamboo.

A sharp, piercing sound suddenly erupted as over a dozen bamboo spears shot out from the walls on either side, aiming to turn Ning Zhuo's Bamboo Puppet into a pincushion.

Ning Zhuo frantically maneuvered the Bamboo Puppet to evade the barrage, but his divine sense had been severely depleted in the previous confrontation and hadn't fully recovered.

Hampered by this weakness, the Bamboo Puppet managed to survive the gauntlet, but its chest was pierced through, leaving a gaping hole.

"What should I do now?" Ning Zhuo frowned, his anxiety growing.

This was only the second stage, and it was already this difficult. The remaining stages would likely be even more challenging.

A flash of inspiration struck him. Ning Zhuo seized one of the exposed bamboo spears, hacked it down, and used the material to repair his puppet.

New bamboo strips were wrapped around the hole in the Bamboo Puppet's chest, sealing it shut. Still clutching two other bamboo spears, it resumed its journey.

Having cleared the maze, the Bamboo Puppet arrived at the third stage: a spacious arena where cultivators controlled their Bamboo Puppets in a chaotic free-for-all.

"Damn it! I knew this stage was coming and prepared extensively!"

"Aaaah! Why did I lose? How could I lose here?"

Ban Ji was so enraged he nearly fainted, unable to accept the reality before him.

When he discovered that Ning Zhuo had become one of the final twelve victors, he clutched his chest, gasped for breath, and nearly let out a skyward roar before vomiting three liters of blood.

"My calamity!"

"He is my calamity!"
