Chapter 643: Suitable for All Ages

White Paper Immortal City.

Sun Lingtong had barely passed through the city gates when he was stopped.

"I am the Guide. First, congratulations to all of you for passing the Karmic Mirror's examination and entering White Paper Immortal City."

"Now that you've crossed the gates, you are officially new members of our city!"

The Guide, a middle-aged man with a kind smile, continued, "First, here are your Jade Tokens for entry."

He handed a Jade Token to Sun Lingtong, the elderly man, and the others.

Sun Lingtong took the token and scanned it with his divine sense. It was a simple, crudely made Magic Artifact used to identify its owner.

The Guide explained, "It's no easy feat to join White Paper Immortal City. This Jade Token marks your new beginning. Everything from your past can be left behind like smoke. Here, you can adopt new names and start anew."

"Of course, you may also keep your original names."

"But remember, the name engraved on the Jade Token can only be done once. Once named, it cannot be changed."

Sun Lingtong and the others listened intently, remaining silent.

The Guide continued, "After engraving your names, you can take your Jade Tokens to the Fire Grain Depot and other locations to collect your cultivation supplies."

"The distribution of these materials varies based on individual circumstances. Please don't be surprised if you receive more or less than others."

"As for you, you will receive the most abundant cultivation supplies."

At this point, the guide's smile widened as he turned to Sun Lingtong. "Here are several formal letters of introduction from prominent figures in our Immortal City. They wish to befriend someone of your caliber and have entrusted these to successive guides."

Sun Lingtong understood that this was yet another instance of benefiting from Ning Zhuo's mother's influence.

Under the Karmic Mirror's scrutiny, radiant hues and luminous glows had revealed his virtuous life and character. This had earned him special treatment and courteous reception upon entering the city.

Yet Sun Lingtong refused to accept the letters. "This favorable treatment isn't solely because I'm a good person, is it?"

"I'm deeply curiousâ€”what do these people truly seek?"

The guide first praised Sun Lingtong's clarity of mind before explaining, "This leads us to the policies of our White Paper Immortal City."

"All who wish to enter the Immortal City must undergo the Karmic Mirror's trial."

Based on the results, individuals are categorized into several tiers. The lowest tier, marked by faint traces of dark bloodlight, requires hard labor, purification rites, and further scrutiny.

"The middle tier emits Turbid Light. These individuals have committed sins, but they are not grave, and they possess inherent virtue and a willingness to repent. Newcomers with this light are placed under the supervision of the Karma Cleansing Bureau, tasked with performing more purification labor. Once they accumulate sufficient merit, they can apply for assessment. If they pass, they gain personal freedom and are no longer subject to oversight."

"The upper tier emits Pure Light. Only those with a pristine past or minor transgressions display this serene radiance. Such newcomers are directly registered and become ordinary citizens."

"As for the very top tier, that's where you, sir, belong. You've accumulated merit through great deeds. Upon entering the city, you receive the most favorable treatment, with no restrictions on the tasks you can undertake. Everyone respects and envies you. This is not something ordinary people can achieve through mere effort; it requires a truly great heart of virtue."

Sun Lingtong listened attentively before asking, "What else is there?"

A glint flashed in the guide's eyes as he finally revealed the crucial point: "At the City Lord's Mansion, a long-standing mission has been issued. Only those with a great heart of virtue and accumulated merit can complete it. Throughout history, those who have accomplished this mission have been favored by the Lord Prefect, granted high office and generous rewards."

Sun Lingtong finally understood.

Because of the Qi bestowed upon him by Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, he had been marked as a "great benefactor."

This status carried immense weight within White Paper Immortal City. The true reason lay in the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's ambitions: under his rule, such "great benefactors" naturally ascended to high positions within the city.

The individuals behind these formal greeting scrolls were paying their respects to Sun Lingtong's future high-ranking status, along with the resources and connections that came with it.

Sun Lingtong murmured, "I joined White Paper Immortal City solely to start anew, to live freely without entanglement in troublesome affairs."

"I'll go explore first."

Determined to cause trouble within the city, he bid farewell to the escort official and the elderly man.

The escort official, eager to continue introducing him to others and cultivate good karma, was politely rebuffed by Sun Lingtong.

Left with nothing else to do, the official watched helplessly as Sun Lingtong departed, offering one last piece of advice: "As a newcomer, you may not be aware of the recent developments. Although the incident has been contained, it's best to avoid the City Lord's Mansion for the time being."

"Earlier, a particularly audacious Demonic Cultivator, overestimating their strength, forced their way through the city gates and stormed the City Lord's Mansion."

"She's been intercepted and trapped within the City Lord's Mansion's Formation."

"My lord, there's no need to rush to accept the City Lord's Mansion's mission."

Sun Lingtong's heart stirred. Could this Demonic Cultivator be an opportunity? After all, he had come to White Paper Immortal City to cause trouble and destruction, but he was alone and his strength was limited.

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin had advised him to let things take their natural course.

Sun Lingtong remembered her words. Now he wondered, "If I hear about the Demonic Cultivator and approach the City Lord's Mansion on my own initiative, is that 'letting things take their natural course'?"

The escort officer advised him not to go, but since he harbored ulterior motives, he was even more determined to rush there.

On the surface, he bid farewell to the escort officer and also took his leave of the Ash Bone Elder.

"This elder has hidden depths."

"Since he wants to start a new life in White Paper Immortal City, there's no need for him to accompany me."

"If trouble arises and he gets implicated, that wouldn't be good."

Sun Lingtong's ability to enter the city was largely due to the Ash Bone Elder's assistance. He was grateful and didn't want to involve innocent people.

Forgetful River Immortal City, with its white and green palette, exuded a peaceful atmosphere. Passersby yielded to each other politely, their faces adorned with gentle smiles.

Sun Lingtong's objective was clear: the City Lord's Mansion.

He slipped into an alley, gradually embodying the qualities of an outstanding disciple of the Void Sect. Stealthily moving through the shadows, he reached the mansion only to find its gates tightly shut, the protective formations pulsing with intense energy. Outside the towering walls, squads of Yin Soldiers patrolled relentlessly.

Sun Lingtong cautiously tested the defenses with his magic artifact, immediately sensing faint divine sense and the operation of detection formations.

"The previous Demonic Cultivator was too reckless, barging straight into the city and triggering full alert status. Sigh..."

"This City Lord's Mansion is too heavily fortified. With only Foundation Establishment cultivation, how can I possibly slip inside?"

Just as Sun Lingtong was at an impasse, a carriage rushed up at high speed.

The coachman cracked his whip, urging the horses forward while shouting, "Open the gates quickly! Our lord has urgent official business to attend to!"

The guards immediately raised their weapons, but in the next instant, the formation surrounding the mansion activated automatically.

A white light flashed from the carriage, revealing the aura of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

"Ah, this is a direct command from Lord Prefect himself!"

"Open the gates immediately!"

"Clear the way!"

The guards' expressions changed dramatically as they scrambled to comply.

"Perfect opportunity!" Sun Lingtong's eyes widened, gleaming with sudden inspiration.

Though fully aware of the risk, he hesitated not a moment, gambling his life on this chance.

Activating his Theft Path Methods, he masked his presence completely. As the carriage passed, he darted into the shadow of a corner, rolled, and swiftly climbed onto the underside of the carriage.

The wheels rolled swiftly, the carriage speeding through the gates and into the City Lord's Mansion.

"I'm in!" Sun Lingtong clung tightly to the carriage's undercarriage, his heart racing. "Getting into the City Lord's Mansion isn't so hard after all."

"Hahaha!"

"So thrilling."

His eyes sparkled, his mouth watering, his entire body buzzing with exhilaration.

The carriage weaved through the mansion's winding paths with practiced ease. Guards and attendants scrambled to clear the way.

Whoa!

The coachman yanked hard on the reins, rearing the four fine horses to a halt. The carriage screeched to a stop.

A cultivator leaped out, his face flushed with urgency. He muttered to himself, urging himself on: "Hurry, hurry, hurry!"

He rushed to the door, forming intricate finger seals. Only after several tense moments did the portal finally swing open.

The coachman had calmed the spirited horses and was now inspecting the carriage.

As soon as the door opened, the cultivator rushed inside without looking back, casually closing it behind him.

If even opening the door is this complicated, this must be a critical area within the City Lord's Mansion! Sun Lingtong thought to himself.

The two doors swiftly closed, leaving only a narrow gap through which one person could pass.

Sun Lingtong had already darted into the bushes beside the doorway. Now, he sprang up and slipped into the room with a barely audible rustle, narrowly avoiding being caught.

The doors closed with a clack.

The cultivator strode forward, and Sun Lingtong followed closely behind.

The room was filled with rows of bookshelves, each shelf laden with jade slips.

Could this be a cultivation art library? Sun Lingtong's interest immediately waned. Neither he nor Ning Zhuo lacked excellent cultivation arts.

Even if we sold these slips for money, that would be good enough, he consoled himself.

Here, here. Yes, that's it! The cultivator, now drenched in sweat from frantic searching, finally found his target and snatched it up with delight.

"Who's there?!" He whirled around, spotting Sun Lingtong lurking around the corner.

In that instant, Sun Lingtong's hair stood on end, his heart pounding with alarm as he sensed imminent, fatal danger.

The cultivator, who had appeared unremarkable, was in fact suppressing his aura to an extreme. Now, as he moved to attack, his true strength was revealed: Nascent Soul-level!

Thud.

Before the cultivator could strike, he was ambushed and knocked unconscious.

Sun Lingtong had been on the brink of death, now reborn. The sudden shift in fortune left him breathless and frozen in place, staring blankly.

The old man materialized, smiling at Sun Lingtong. "Little Ghost, why the glare? I'm your savior, you know."

It was the same elder Sun Lingtong had met at the Forgetful Crossing, reappearing just in time to save him.

Sun Lingtong snapped out of his daze and retreated several steps, his face a mask of wariness. "Senior, you used me to draw the cultivator's attention, then struck him down when he was distracted."

"At the city gate, you also used me to pass the Karmic Mirror's scrutiny."

"Back at the Forgetful Crossing, you helped me, but you also used the opportunity to praise Yunxiao and Yueyi, gaining favor and securing your place on the Void Return Raft first!"

"Did you help me, or just use me?"

The old man chuckled. "You're quite clever, Little Ghost. Truly worthy of being a successor to the Void Sect."

Sun Lingtong was taken aback. "Senior, you..."

The old man remained silent, his hands moving continuously as he demonstrated several Theft Path Methods of the Void Sect, both signature techniques and secret arts.

He had proven his identity with the simplest of means.

The old man continued, "I am from the Void Sect. My name is Zeng Jide, and I am your senior's senior. Little Ghost, you're incredibly boldâ€”hundreds of times bolder than I am!"

"To charge into Forgetful River Immortal City without knowing a thing... Tsk tsk, you were practically courting death!"

"I secretly protected you the entire way, especially when you clung to the underside of the carriage to sneak into the City Lord's Mansion. Do you really think you could have pulled it off on your own?"

Sun Lingtong hastily bowed in gratitude. "Senior Zeng, so you were one of us all along! You are my savior, and this life-saving grace will be etched in my heart forever."

A realization struck him. This must be why Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin had advised him to "let nature take its course"â€”it was because a senior from the sect was secretly protecting him!

Sun Lingtong's expression immediately changed as he rushed to Zeng Jide and knelt to kowtow.

Though Zeng Jide had died long ago, his thieving nature remained unchanged. He loved to steal, and his modus operandi was audacious: he would send advance notices to his targets, urging them to increase their defenses, thereby artificially raising the difficulty of the challenge.

Zeng Jide was a master of the Theft Path Methods and thrived on challenges.

After discovering Sun Lingtong's affiliation with the Void Sect, he grew to genuinely admire this junior member of the sect.

"This kid's boldness surpasses even mine! Rare, truly rare."

"His mastery of the Theft Path Methods is unparalleled. Though clearly trained in the sect's Virgin Boy Art, his physical body and soul possess remarkably profound reserves. To have built such a solid foundation at such a young age... impressive, truly impressive!"

Sun Lingtong primarily cultivated his Upper Dantian, but his physical body benefited from the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, resulting in an even stronger soul foundation, reaching the level of a hundred thousand souls.

This profound accumulation of soul power was entirely due to the Heaven-Bestowed Talisman.

This talisman had been obtained from Luo Si, arranged by the Ash Bone Elder as a gift for the sect's savior. Upon learning of this, Ning Zhuo voluntarily gave the Heaven-Bestowed Talisman to Sun Lingtong for use, while he himself utilized his Nascent Soul-level magic treasures to elevate his soul to the hundred thousand souls level even earlier.

"Meeting here is fate itself," Zeng Jide said, stroking his beard. "Little Ghost, I'll give you some proper guidance. Just remember to spread word of my greatness when you return to the Living Realm."

It was clear he was a proud man who loved to show off before others.

Sun Lingtong asked, "Senior, why have you come to Forgetful River Immortal City?"

Zeng Jide recounted how he had informed the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord of his intention to steal treasures.

Sun Lingtong immediately gave him a thumbs-up, praising his thieving spirit.

This struck a chord with Zeng Jide, making the senior member of the sect laugh heartily as he peppered Sun Lingtong with questions.

Sun Lingtong gave him vague answers, especially when he mentioned his love for theft and thrill-seeking, which delighted Zeng Jide even more.

"Wonderful, wonderful!" Zeng Jide exclaimed. "No wonder I felt such affinity for you! This time, we'll wreak havoc in Forgetful River Immortal City together and make our names famous throughout the Underworld! Hahaha!"

Their conversation brought them much closer.

Sun Lingtong approached the unconscious cultivator and retrieved the Jade Slip from his hand. Curious, he probed it with his divine sense and raised his eyebrows in surprise. "Oh? This is Luo Si's curriculum vitae!"
