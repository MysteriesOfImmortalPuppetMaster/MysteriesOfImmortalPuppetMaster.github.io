Chapter 803: Noble Qi

The crowd's gaze flickered back and forth between Gu Qing and Ning Zhuo. Most people were aware of the friction between the two, so these looks were heavy with meaning and rife with interest. Watching a spectacle was, after all, a near-universal human trait.

"Huff... huff..."

Gu Qing’s breathing was heavy, and his eyes were bloodshot. He had consumed pills too frequently just now, and the cumulative side effects were beginning to surface. A sickly flush colored his face, and fine beads of sweat seeped from his forehead. His temples throbbed in sync with his drum-like heartbeat. Each pulse brought a sharp, needle-like pain that tormented his nerves.

His hair, usually meticulously bound by a jade crown, now had several loose strands clinging to his sweat-dampened cheeks, making him look increasingly disheveled.

"I won." "Once again, I am the winner!"

The joy of victory was far less intense than he had initially imagined. It was because the win had been far too narrow. Gu Qing had been forced to swallow three whole bottles of medicinal pills just to maintain a slim lead at the final moment.

"This guy..." Gu Qing looked at Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo stood in his white robes. Even in defeat, he wore a composed smile, exuding an air of grace and magnanimity that made his loss seem honorable. Gu Qing’s pupils constricted as curiosity gnawed at him: What kind of pills did this guy take for the effects to be so potent? Or did he use some other means? Or perhaps... he truly possesses such high calculation power?

Waves of speculation caused Gu Qing’s resolve to waver slightly.

Meanwhile, Nangong Zhi’s gaze also rested on Ning Zhuo. She praised him inwardly: No wonder he caught the eye of Wen Ruanyu. There is a reason why Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng are exerting themselves on his behalf.

To think he could calculate so accurately and swiftly. If the problems were even more difficult and complex, would he perform even better? Seeing Ning Zhuo looking refreshed and spiritually vibrant, Nangong Zhi couldn't help but feel that this youth was unfathomable.

Ning Zhuo's performance and demeanor were witnessed by everyone present. Gu Qing had taken first place? So what! He was a Confucian cultivator, a genius famous throughout the Kingdom of Huazhang. Taking first place was only natural for him.

Ning Zhuo, however, was different. Among all the cultivators present, how many were Confucian? Not even ten percent. The majority felt a greater resonance with Ning Zhuo.

The third stage of the Confucian "Rising Cloud Minor Trial" involved refining spiritual paper, a trial clearly biased toward their own path. The public held no resentment for this; instead, they were secretly grateful. After all, the Confucian organizers had publicly shared the refining methods, providing a significant benefit to all participants. Their primary goal was to expand their influence, making it a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Anyone who had experienced papermaking knew that the Confucian advantage here was massive! Gu Qing’s win was expected, but Ning Zhuo - not a Confucian himself - taking second place was a rare and precious achievement.

The crowd responded with validation, understanding, and even sympathy. To sympathize with Ning Zhuo was to sympathize with themselves. Unconsciously, they had begun to view him as one of their own.

After the second stage ended, even more cultivators crowded around Ning Zhuo. Unlike before, they now approached him out of respect for his unyielding efforts.

"Well done, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo!" "Securing second place was no easy feat. You’re only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, yet there are Golden Core cultivators ranked behind you." "Keep it up! Maybe you'll take first in the third stage!"

Encouraging words filled Ning Zhuo's ears. He smiled bitterly and bowed repeatedly, thanking everyone for their support. He claimed his performance in the last two stages was beyond his usual level and expressed fear of failing their expectations.

Watching Ning Zhuo at the center of the crowd, Gu Qing’s hands clenched into fists inside his long sleeves. He was the winner, yet he stood in relative isolation. How could he compare to Ning Zhuo's glory?

So, even though Ning Zhuo lost the round, he won the support and the hearts of the people. This brat is truly something! Gu Qing narrowed his eyes to hide the cold light within. He had once again witnessed Ning Zhuo's "righteous" methods, and his wariness grew.

As if sensing Gu Qing’s gaze, Ning Zhuo looked back. Their eyes met in mid-air, seemingly sparking with friction. Though not exactly enemies, they now viewed each other as their greatest rivals.

Hmph! Gu Qing steadied his mind. The 'Mountain and River Page' and 'Stellar Tracks Paper' stages are over. Those were the easiest types of spiritual paper, placed first to accommodate the masses. Next are the 'Noble Qi Xuan' and 'Heart-Fire Plain' papers. Let’s see what you do then!

Gu Qing flicked his sleeves and departed.

Internal Strategy and External Suspicion

Ning Zhuo also withdrew his gaze, his mood heavy. It will be very difficult to maintain this performance moving forward.

Through the intelligence from Zhu Fenxiang, he knew the sequence of the five spiritual papers: Mountain and River Page, Stellar Tracks Paper, Noble Qi Xuan, Heart-Fire Plain, and finally, the Dao-Bearing Jade Page.

When refining the Mountain and River Page, I could rely on my Earth and Water element attainments to grasp the materials. For the Stellar Tracks Paper, I could use the Dao Treasure 'Luo Shu' to gain a massive calculation advantage. But for the Noble Qi Xuan and Heart-Fire Plain, I have no such shortcuts.

I don't know the specifics of the Noble Qi Xuan method, but it surely requires Noble Qi. I don't possess a single bit of that energy, and it's hard for others to use! Furthermore, the one presiding over the third stage is Situ Gu. He isn't like Lu Zai or Nangong Zhi; his stance clearly favors Gu Qing. He might even secretly target me.

Sigh. Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng, who are more inclined toward me, are organizers and won't participate. And right now, their hearts are likely filled with a longing for 'Mind Studies'. Compared to that, I am simply not important.

The fourth stage, Heart-Fire Plain, was a spiritual paper that drew inspiration from the Strange Path, making it incredibly peculiar and difficult to understand. Ning Zhuo had estimated his results before participating: the first two stages were his best bets for high scores. In reality, even with those advantages, he had lost twice to Gu Qing.

I have no expectations for first place; I don't even care about it. As long as I can obtain the refining method for the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, I’ll be satisfied. Ning Zhuo was always pragmatic. Losing to Gu Qing didn't matter; getting the recipe did.

Last time, when I asked Zhao Hansheng about the 'Unity of Knowledge and Action' technique in the public lecture, he brushed me off. But this time, when I seek the refining method for the jade page, he won't be able to stall again. This is the Rising Cloud Minor Trial. If he does that, I’ll be laughing in my sleep - it would be like digging his own grave. Since he wants to make a name for himself at the Myriad Manifestations Sect main headquarters, he won't do that. However, obtaining the method likely won't be simple. He will surely attach some conditions or restrictions.

The Demon Subjugation Hall

Inside the main hall of the Demon Subjugation Hall, demon-suppressing talismans emitted a cold, eerie light.

Zhong Dao sat behind a desk of Profound Iron, his broad back straight like an unbending iron tower. "Hmph, the Demonic Cultivators here are still rampant. They deserve death! The local magistrate is utterly incompetent - he deserves death even more!" He frowned at the scrolls in his hand, his facial lines as sharp as if carved by a knife, revealing his hatred for evil.

A subordinate entered the hall, stopping ten paces from the desk. "Hall Master, the first round of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial is complete. Here are the dossiers of the outstanding candidates. The second round is currently being prepared."

A jade slip was placed on the iron desk. Zhong Dao’s blade-like gaze shifted to the slip. After a few breaths, he reached out and scanned it with his divine sense.

The contents were laid bare:

Lu Xuanan: Known as the "Upright Sword." He once severed a spiritual vein to stop a conflict and protect mortals, damaging his own cultivation and Dao heart in the process. He was a True Inheritance Disciple of the Azure Cloud Sword Sect but was sidelined due to his injuries and moved to the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

Gu Huaijiu: From a prestigious family in the Flying Cloud Kingdom that was destroyed by a corrupt official controlled by an evil cultivator. He specializes in hunting down officials who have fallen to the Demonic Path.

Yun Niaoniao: Born into a medical family, she provides free treatment to the poor and injured, known as the "Little Bodhisattva."

These were all promising talents. Every time Zhong Dao saw such righteous young heroes emerge, his mood improved. Finally, his divine sense paused on the name "Ning Zhuo".

Among these elites, Ning Zhuo remained the most radiant. His performance during the "Three Questions of the Heart" had left a deep impression on Zhong Dao. Now, the slip recorded his latest feats: his actions in the Profound Armor Cave, his duel with Gu Qing in the Martial Hall, and his current participation in the Confucian trials.

A shred of doubt flickered in Zhong Dao’s eyes. In the cave, he read people’s hearts perfectly and used words to repel enemies, much like a Confucian. In the Martial Hall, he used rhetoric to drive Gu Qing into a corner. And now, he uses Dragon Qi to create top-grade paper to offset the negative impact of losing, while showing incredible calculation power...

This led Zhong Dao to a thought: Can a cultivator so skilled at scheming and manipulating hearts truly be filled with righteousness? Were his answers to the Three Questions of the Heart sincere, or were they faked?

Zhong Dao put down the slip and asked, "Has Ning Zhuo's background been fully investigated yet?"

"Hall Master, it should be finished soon."

Zhong Dao was dissatisfied. "What do you mean 'should be'?"

The subordinate broke into a cold sweat. "The investigation is slow because his movements involve huge geographical jumps. we suspect he is using void travel to traverse long distances."

Zhong Dao tapped the desk. "Find it as quickly as possible." He then remembered a piece of information from his friend, Duanmu Zhang, regarding the test. "I recall the third stage is the 'Noble Qi Xuan'?"

He suddenly ordered, "Go to the treasury and take out the 'White Rainbow Righteousness Staff.' Deliver it to Ning Zhuo personally. Tell him it is a loan."

The subordinate left, marveling internally. That Ning Zhuo really caught the Hall Master’s eye. To personally lend that item is rare. Wait... why that specific item? Could it be because the investigation is taking too long, so the Hall Master is using this treasure to test him?

The subordinate shivered. If Ning Zhuo was faking his righteousness during the heart trial, the 'White Rainbow Righteousness Staff' will strip away his disguise! But if he is the real deal, this treasure will suit him perfectly.

The Third Trial Begins

The next day, nearly a thousand cultivators sat cross-legged within the formation space. Before them were the tools for papermaking: desks, mortars, bamboo screens, and vats of spiritual bamboo pulp and purple morning dew.

Situ Gu stood on the high platform, his face as cold and hard as stone. "The refining method has been taught. This stage lasts three hours. You will be judged on both quality and quantity. Begin."

The expressions of the cultivators were grim. Refining spiritual paper was already hard, but this time there was a key element required: Noble Qi!

Gu Qing opened his eyes, and a surge of Literary Qi erupted from him, swirling around his body. Then, a distinct, different aura was drawn out from within him.

It was, unmistakably, Noble Qi!
