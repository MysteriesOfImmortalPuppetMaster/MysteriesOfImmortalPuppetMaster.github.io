Chapter 743: The Ban Clan's Scheme

Ning Zhuo's arrival at a branch of the Universal Commerce Hall immediately drew attention.

"Who's that young man?"

"That must be Ning Zhuo. One of the top newcomers to emerge from this year's Flying Cloud Assembly!"

Many cultivators cast curious glances, whispering among themselves or communicating through divine sense.

Ning Zhuo approached the counter.

The cultivator on duty behind the counter felt his heart race. He quickly stepped forward, greeting him warmly: "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, are you looking to buy or sell something? If you wish to make a discreet purchase, we can communicate through divine sense. I assure you, I'll keep your secrets safe!"

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "Thank you, but that won't be necessary. I'm here to purchase some Confucian cultivator spells."

He chose to communicate verbally rather than through divine sense.

Seeing Ning Zhuo's lack of arrogance despite his genius, the on-duty cultivator felt a sense of familiarity and nodded eagerly. "I know you've won first place in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial for Confucian cultivators twice in a row. What kind of Confucian spells are you looking for? I'll find them for you right away. Or perhaps you have something specific in mind?"

"What ideas do you have? I can offer some humble suggestions."

"That would be wonderful! Thank you!" Ning Zhuo's smile widened. "I'm still quite unfamiliar with Confucian cultivation. On this trip, I'd like to purchase some spells that can help me impart knowledge to others."

The on-duty cultivator flinched slightly, surprised by Ning Zhuo's request.

Ning Zhuo was participating in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, so shouldn't he be focused on learning himself, rather than studying methods for teaching others?

He's a top-tier genius, the cultivator thought. Naturally, his thinking is beyond the comprehension of ordinary people like us.

With that, the cultivator immediately accessed the records and quickly recommended several spells to Ning Zhuo.

This was the golden age of cultivation.

Dozens of Confucian cultivation spells were available. After careful consideration, Ning Zhuo selected eight:

Standing in the Snow at the Master's Gate, Discipline Ruler Technique, Broad Enlightenment Technique, Collective Enlightenment Technique, Strict Teacher's Rigorous Training, Incentive Whip of Merit, Successor of the Mantle and Bowl Passing on the Sacred Flame

Ning Zhuo's current foundation in Confucian cultivation was insufficient to cast the Standing in the Snow at the Master's Gate spell directly. However, he could use a related array to assist in its execution.

The Formation, now complete, would aid in the success of the Confucian Technique. If successful, the target cultivator would instantly grasp the imparted knowledge, crossing the threshold and entering the inner sanctum of understanding.

The Discipline Ruler Technique required the use of a specific Magic Artifact - a Discipline Ruler. By striking with the Ruler, the cultivator could impart useful knowledge to the student.

The Collective Enlightenment Technique was a Confucian ritual. The cultivator would receive tuition fees from students through portraits of Confucian sages, then bestow upon them a particular wisdom or skill.

"I'll take all of these," Ning Zhuo said, producing Spirit Stones and paying on the spot.

Having inherited Qing Huangzi's legacy, he had acquired a substantial cache of Spirit Stones for daily expenses, finally escaping the awkward situation of relying solely on his Ghost Path Golden Core.

"Farewell," Ning Zhuo said, calmly departing the Trading Hall under the watchful eyes of the attending cultivator and other patrons.

---
Ban Jie sat by the window on the second floor of a tavern.

A Flying Message landed before her.

"Ning Zhuo's visit to the Universal Commerce Hall was merely to purchase some Confucian Techniques?"

Ban Jie examined the information more closely, her brow furrowing slightly. "Why are these all methods for imparting knowledge to others? What... what is the purpose of this?"

As the Ban Clan's emergency envoy, Ban Jie found this intelligence puzzling and incomprehensible.

"Never mind that for now. Where is Ning Zhuo?" Ban Jie stroked the jade pendant at her waist, contacting her subordinates.

Her subordinates, who had been monitoring Ning Zhuo's movements, immediately responded. The intelligence, relayed through multiple layers of communication, quickly reached Ban Jie.

Thus, Ban Jie successfully intercepted Ning Zhuo midway through his journey.

"Fellow Daoist Ning, please wait," Ban Jie called out, blocking the path. "I am Ban Jie, a cultivator of the Ban Clan."

Ban Jie took the initiative to perform the Rites, introducing herself.

She deliberately spoke loudly, knowing that a bustling market was being held on a nearby mountain peak to the southeast. The crowd surged, shoulder to shoulder, their voices rising in a clamor.

Sensing Ban Jie's commotion, many cultivators immediately turned their attention to the scene.

"Look! It's Ning Zhuo!"

"Ban Jie? The Ban Clan has sent someone? And they're confronting Ning Zhuo? Are they going to teach this outsider a lesson?"

"Let's go! This is going to be good!"

"There have been rumors that Ban Ji, driven by jealousy and envy, secretly hired Demonic Cultivators to harass Ning Zhuo. Now, the Ban Clan has even sent someone here."

Many cultivators grew excited, some casting detection spells while others simply summoned floating clouds and left their mountain peaks, heading toward the location of Ning Zhuo and Ban Jie.

Ning Zhuo sized up Ban Jie, noting her Hundred-Refined Heaven inner armor, a robe of autumn-fragrant cloud-patterned silk, and a four-layered amber-threaded veil.

Her eyebrows were thin and sharp as blades, and at her temples, two Profound Copper eyebrow studs rotated imperceptibly, like tiny gears.

A glint of sharp insight flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes, and he immediately grew wary. He quickly scanned the crowd of cultivators gathering to watch the spectacle, then snorted coldly. "Ban Jie? What brings you here?"

Ban Jie's face revealed a perfectly calibrated expression of sorrow and sincerity. "During the recent turmoil, my brother Ban Ji was framed! The claim that he hired Demonic Cultivators is nothing but a vile scheme by petty villains seeking to incite conflict between the Ban and Ning Clans. Their motives are despicable! The Ban Clan is a noble and reputable family; we would never stoop to such tactics. Unless this misunderstanding is resolved, both our clans will suffer, and the Righteous Path will be disgraced!"

At this point, Ban Jie surveyed the entire assembly before fixing his gaze on Ning Zhuo. "Today, Ban Jie presents herself here, carrying the goodwill of my clan elders, to offer these humble gifts as a token of sincerity. I sincerely hope to resolve our misunderstanding with Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo and transform enmity into harmony."

"Fellow Daoist, your insights into mechanisms and the profound mysteries of the Five Elements are truly exceptional. With a heart like the Qin and courage like a sword, your noble spirit shines like jade, making you a model for our generation and naturally inspiring admiration and a desire for friendship."

"It is far better to resolve conflicts than to perpetuate them, to turn swords into jade and strife into peace - a tale of beauty. Perhaps one day, united in purpose and virtue, we might even walk the path of the Great Dao together. Such a vision is not mere fantasy."

Upon hearing these words, the cultivators from the National Observatory exchanged glances and communicated through divine sense.

"The Ban Clan is actually taking the initiative to resolve their misunderstanding with Ning Zhuo?"

"Ning Zhuo may appear solitary, but his clan's influence extends beyond the Flying Cloud Kingdom. The Ban Clan's move is quite shrewd."

"I always knew the Ban Clan's principles wouldn't allow them to associate with Demonic Cultivators. It turns out this was all a cunning scheme by others!"

Ning Zhuo frowned, about to speak, but Ban Jie, keenly observing his expression, decisively interrupted him. With a swift tap on the storage pouch at his waist, he released the gifts he had brought for Ning Zhuo.

Gifts.

Instantly, a radiant treasure light erupted, its brilliance swirling and drawing in spiritual energy and Qi.

A dozen precious artifacts were lifted by an invisible force, suspended between Ban Jie and Ning Zhuo, their mere sight causing onlookers' hearts to tremble.

The cultivators gasped in unison.

"Am I seeing things? That bottle seems to contain Nine Heavens Profound Ice Essence! The Ban Clan is giving away three drops of such an extremely cold treasure!"

"An Earthfire Lotus Seed? This spiritual plant is incredibly rare. Legend says that if cultivated properly, it can extinguish Fire Seeds!"

"Look at that massive Void Array Spirit Stone! It's a top-tier material for constructing teleportation arrays or forging spatial magic treasures!"

Even Ning Zhuo couldn't help but be drawn in.

His gaze fell upon a treasure tower among the gifts. The exquisite, translucent nine-tiered pagoda rotated silently. Its surface was covered in a dense network of profound magnetic threads and miniature gears, subtly aligning with the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, its precision leaving him mesmerized.

Ban Jie introduced it at the opportune moment: "This is the Profound Magnetic Thousand-Mechanism Nine-Twist Treasure Tower. The treasures hidden within are often exceptionally rare and precious - otherwise, such elaborate storage methods wouldn't be necessary."

She pointed to a piece of jade: "This is Ten-Thousand-Year Azure Void Divine Wind Jade."

Her finger moved to a crystalline spirit egg: "This is an Azure Window Egg. Hatching it will yield an excellent mount."

Finally, she presented an ancient beast-hide scroll: "This contains the Heavenly Evolution Myriad Transformations Beast Spirit Contract. Once mastered, it allows you to forge contracts with any demonic beast, binding them to your service. Even if the beast dies in battle, there's a chance it will become a Beast Spirit, continuing to serve you."

Ning Zhuo's brow furrowed deeper, while the surrounding cultivators grew increasingly agitated.

"Heavens! The Ban Clan is truly going all out! This is no mere token gift!"

"Nine Heavens Profound Ice Bone! Earthfire Lotus Seed! Void Stone! My Dao Heart... I've never seen such treasures in my life!"

"The Ban Clan's generosity is astounding! They're willing to pay such a price to prove their innocence. But Ning Zhuo himself is indeed worthy of such attention."

Ban Jie fixed her gaze on Ning Zhuo, scrutinizing every slight change in expression.

Ning Zhuo, she murmured inwardly, such extraordinary gifts are within your reach. Just one word, and they're all yours. I refuse to believe you're unmoved!

"If you accept these gifts, the Ban Clan will finally have the righteous standing we've sought!"

"By accepting these benefits, the ancestral shrine's Clan Pivot Chain will be activated, allowing them to target your Qi once more!"

How could Ning Zhuo possibly accept these treasures from the Ban Clan without paying a terrible price? A price that would remain almost imperceptible to outsiders.

"Heh," Ning Zhuo chuckled softly, his eyes flashing with cold starlight. His gaze, sharp as a blade, fell upon Ban Jie's face.

"Fellow Daoist Ban Jie, the Ban Clan... truly offers a grand gift of sincerity."

"This Nine Heavens Profound Ice has nothing to do with my Five Elements Circulation. It's not needed for balancing the Five Elements. Storing it would require vast quantities of Pure Yang and Wood-attribute Heavenly Materials and Earthly Treasures to construct a special sealing formation."

"The Earthfire Lotus Seed naturally grows deep underground, within magma. Cultivating it would demand massive investments of Fire Element resources and a protracted, time-consuming process."

"The larger the Void Array Spirit Stone, the more difficult it is to use. Any disruption to its internal stability during array formation will trigger a self-detonation, collapsing space and plunging me into the Void - leaving me with no place to rest my bones!"

"And this Profound Magnetic Thousand-Mechanism Nine-Twist Treasure Tower? How much time and effort would it take to unravel its mysteries and claim the treasures within?"

"As for the Heavenly Evolution Myriad Transformations Beast Spirit Contract, judging by its ancient appearance, it's likely an archaic method. Do you expect me to spend years studying it?"

"How long?"

"Did you go to the trouble of sending me a Qingwan Egg specifically to motivate me to cultivate this ancient technique?"

Ning Zhuo's insightful remark silenced the assembled cultivators.

Exposed, Ban Jie remained unfazed, shaking her head repeatedly. "Fellow Daoist Ning, you've misunderstood the Ban Clan deeply. You've fallen for the lies of malicious individuals."

"These gifts were carefully selected from our clan's treasury. Even if you don't use them yourself, selling them to the Universal Commerce Hall would bring you a substantial profit."

"The Ten-Thousand-Year Azure Void Divine Wind Jade within nourishes the Divine Soul and clears the mind, making it an invaluable treasure for comprehending Wind Movement and Space. It's inherently beneficial and harmless. Why would you twist its purpose?"

Only Ban Jie knew the full truth.

These gifts were indeed "carefully selected," each carrying hidden flaws. While Ning Zhuo's assessment contained minor inaccuracies, his overall assessment was largely correct.

The Ten-Thousand-Year Azure Void Divine Wind Jade also had a flaw. Its Wind Movement principles were so potent that cultivators who attempted to comprehend them risked becoming completely immersed, allowing the principles to invade their bodies and minds. Unable to fully digest and master the jade's essence, their foundations would be corrupted - a fate worse than having their cultivation scattered.

Ning Zhuo snorted coldly, his gaze piercing Ban Jie like lightning. "Hypocritical and utterly deceitful!"

"Ban Ji hired Demonic Cultivators to assassinate me. I have ample evidence, but I refuse to be distracted by such matters at present."

"Once the Flying Cloud Assembly concludes, I will reveal everything publicly and confront the Ban Clan directly."

"You tried to obstruct me halfway, attempting to bribe me with lavish gifts to distract me and lead me astray, leaving me no time for other matters!"

"This scheme is truly insidious."

Ning Zhuo raised his voice, his gaze sweeping across the crowd. He declared, "As the Confucian sage said, 'To receive without giving in return is contrary to the Rites!'"

"The Ban Clan has repeatedly harmed me. Do you take me for an ignorant child?"

"This is utterly outrageous!"

"I, Ning Zhuo, hereby vow to retaliate against Ban Ji with all my might. I will not rest until I've beaten him to tears, reduced him to begging for his mother, and sent him fleeing like a cornered wolf!"

"I ask all present to bear witness to this!"

Ning Zhuo knew there were likely Ban Clan plants in the crowd, but most were probably bystanders.

The cultivators stared at him, their eyes wide with astonishment.

"I never expected Ning Zhuo to be so resolute!"

"He's being reckless. He's not just challenging Ban Ji, but the entire Ban Clan. What backing does he possibly have?"

"Speaking of which, could Ban Jie's gifts have been offered with malicious intent?"

After finishing his speech, Ning Zhuo shot Ban Jie a cold glance and soared away.

Ban Jie suppressed her fury and called out repeatedly, but Ning Zhuo ignored her, watching helplessly as the young man strode away, his sleeves billowing behind him.

A twitch finally flickered at the corner of Ban Jie's eye.

"This brat actually remained unmoved by such lavish gifts!"

"I even reminded him he could sell it for money, but he still refused!"

Stubborn.

Ban Jie's first clash with Ning Zhuo ended in defeat.

"But I have more tricks up my sleeve. Hmph, just you wait, Ning Zhuo!" Ban Jie glared at Ning Zhuo's retreating figure, her heart seething with murderous intent.

--------
Star Point Peak.

Council Hall.

Yan Linglong stood beside Situ Xing, whispering softly, "Leader Situ, as the saying goes, 'Secure your own house before dealing with outsiders.'"

"The emergence of two top-tier geniuses in succession is undoubtedly a great blessing for us."

"Yet Ning Zhuo refuses to participate in the rankings, causing much discussion among the disciples today. Does he look down on us?"

"You hold the first seat, followed by Lin Jinglong and Shen Bu. Ning Zhuo, however, doesn't even have a seat. He claimed the stone tablet, his reputation soared, and he hasn't even acknowledged your presence."

"If this situation continues to develop, I fear everyone will start to feel uneasy," Li said.

Situ Xing frowned deeply, gazing out the window as he pondered aloud, "Indeed. The seating arrangement is our established rule, yet Ning Zhuo disregards it. Every moment he remains outside the established order undermines our authority."

"What do you think we should do?"

Yan Linglong smiled faintly, well aware of Situ Xing's temperament. She deliberately suggested, "It's simple. Situ Xing, why not send him a gentle letter of persuasion? Arrange for Ning Zhuo to sit in the second chair."

Yan Linglong's brow furrowed even deeper.

Sensing the moment was right, Shen Fengyu immediately excused himself under the pretense of cultivation.

Upon returning to his secluded cave dwelling, Shen Fengyu sent a Flying Message to Ban Jie: "You've done everything he asked. There will be no battle between Yan Linglong and Jiao Bing in the coming days!"
