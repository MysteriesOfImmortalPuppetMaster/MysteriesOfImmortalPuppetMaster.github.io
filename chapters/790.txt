Chapter 790: Snow-Colored Maiden Hui vs. Snow Pivot Guard Xie

Duanmu Zhang had been ordered to leave the Huazhang Kingdom for the Flying Cloud Kingdom with the specific goal of spreading Confucianism and cultivating more Confucian cultivators.

After a period of investigation, he did not take a formal position within the government of the Flying Cloud Kingdom. Instead, he stationed himself directly within the Myriad Manifestations Sect. One reason for this was that the Sect Master of the Myriad Manifestations Sect at the time had personally come forward to extend a warm invitation.

This involved another layer of power maneuvering at the national level, which will not be detailed for now. Duanmu Zhang figured that since the Sect Master showed such a strong desire to cooperate, starting his work from within the Myriad Manifestations Sect was undoubtedly the best path.

Little did he know that shortly after joining the sect, the previous Sect Master passed away from illness. Without active cooperation from the high-level leadership, Duanmu Zhang had no choice but to develop independently. He possessed the necessary strength and quickly managed to open up a new situation for himself.

However, as his influence expanded, the high-level leaders of the Myriad Manifestations Sect began to take notice. The incident involving Qin De had, from the moment it happened until now, served as the leadership's most effective tool for suppressing the expansion of the Confucian group - a tool they used repeatedly with great success.

Duanmu Zhang had been constrained by this for many years. He had made numerous attempts, but the hope of convincing Qin De through his own strength alone remained extremely slim.

This time, the arrival of Zhao Hansheng - or more accurately, the manifestation of "Heart Study" - allowed Duanmu Zhang to see a new glimmer of hope in this matter.

The Confucian group within the Myriad Manifestations Sect was not merely a collection of like-minded individuals huddling together for warmth. From its inception, it had been a mature political entity. This meant it inevitably possessed its own political aspirations. Growing and strengthening was the primary aspiration of the Confucian group, as well as the mission Duanmu Zhang had carried with him from the Huazhang Kingdom.

From a personal perspective, who wouldn't want more people around them who shared their views? Even those with similar philosophies would suffice.

But the existence of Qin De was a major obstacle stifling the continued development of the Confucian group. It wasn't simply because of his status as a demonic cultivator, but rather his philosophy. The existence of the Scripture of Sages and Great Thieves provided the high-level leaders of the Myriad Manifestations Sect with the perfect weapon against the Confucians.

If Confucian cultivators wished to develop, they had to spread their own cultivation philosophy. If their philosophy gained support from the leadership and recognition across multiple levels, development would naturally follow. Philosophy must lead the way.

But now, the Confucian group could not even manage that.

The skepticism of the Myriad Manifestations Sect leadership regarding the Scripture of Sages and Great Thieves had spread to the entire traditional philosophy of the Confucian school. Duanmu Zhang and his peers had racked their brains and exhausted their strength, yet they found no way to resolve this doubt. To do so, they would need to provide a complete theoretical refutation and thorough critique of the Scripture of Sages and Great Thieves!

Duanmu Zhang and the others had tried countless times, but relying on traditional Confucian concepts, it was essentially impossible.

"But perhaps Heart Study can?"

This was the hope buried deep within Duanmu Zhang's heart.

If Zhao Hansheng could rely on Heart Study to perfectly resolve the issue of the Scripture of Sages and Great Thieves, bring Qin De back to the righteous path, and reopen the landscape for Confucian development, such a monumental achievement would surely make him worthy of the title of "Headmaster." Why should it not be him?

On the other hand, Duanmu Zhang knew that this move carried enormous risks. He was undecided. Because of this, he had gathered everyone to hear their opinions and strive for a unified conclusion.

Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng, who had maintained consistency throughout the third Rising Cloud Minor Trial, found themselves at odds over this matter. Chu Xuangui expressed clear opposition, while Song Taosheng was more eager to use Heart Study to solve the great problem of Qin De.

The two factions held distinct attitudes, each sticking to their arguments, debating without end. Until the very end, the Confucian group failed to reach a conclusion.

Pure Quiet Courtyard.

A flying letter, having passed through multiple rounds of inspection, reached the hands of Wen Ruanyu.

As one of the pillars of the Confucian group, although Wen Ruanyu was currently under confinement, his access to information was not entirely blocked. In fact, the treatment he received here was quite high, with various cultivation resources being almost luxurious items.

This was because Wen Ruanyu had not committed any crime; on the contrary, he was a meritorious official. He had lost his freedom only because the high-level leaders of the Myriad Manifestations Sect needed to struggle for interests. As long as someone above spoke up for Wen Ruanyu, he would not have ended up in his current situation.

The letter was from Chu Xuangui, detailing recent events with a focus on Duanmu Zhang's thoughts regarding the Qin De matter.

Wen Ruanyu’s brow furrowed deeply. Among all the Confucian cultivators in the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Wen Ruanyu’s political acumen was certainly near the top - perhaps even the very best. In White Paper Immortal City, he had attained the position of Vice City Lord as a Golden Core True Disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. From this result alone, one could see that Wen Ruanyu's contributions were not limited to the construction of White Paper Immortal City.

"Old Master Duanmu Zhang is still a bit too naive."

Wen Ruanyu paced, carefully recalling the series of actions taken by Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing since their arrival at the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Although he lacked concrete evidence, Wen Ruanyu sensed a trace of unusual ambition.

"This master and disciple pair... I fear their designs are not small!"

In Wen Ruanyu’s view, Duanmu Zhang’s initiative to yield the position of "Headmaster" was a major blunder. Even if Duanmu Zhang wanted to use Zhao Hansheng to handle Qin De, there was no need to act in such a manner.

Wen Ruanyu was also a member of the Confucian group; this identity was nearly impossible to discard. Although he was stationed away for many years, his political identity had always been that of a member of the Confucian faction.

That night, Wen Ruanyu tossed and turned, unable to sleep. He felt the wind and rain approaching; the long-stable Confucian group was experiencing a fierce undercurrent. In the future, this undercurrent might very well sweep the group toward an unknown direction.

Late at night, Wen Ruanyu threw on his clothes and got out of bed. By the dim light of the lamp, he began to write letters.

He first wrote to Chu Xuangui and Duanmu Zhang. His handwriting was elegant yet possessed a strength that seemed to penetrate the paper as he elaborated on his views:

"The study of Wang Xinyue is like a sudden peak rising, commanding respect. However, its momentum is too urgent, its edge too sharp! The matter of Qin De concerns the core reputation and old wounds of our Confucian school; it must not be handled lightly!"

"It is better to observe for now and wait for an opportunity. As the saying goes, 'a long road tests a horse's strength, and time reveals a person's heart'..."

Wen Ruanyu knew he could not participate personally, so he could only choose a middle-of-the-road approach, hoping to buy more time.

"My concerns go further... Ning Zhuo is the son of an old friend. Seeing his stunning performance is truly heartening. However, as circumstances change, those who ride the waves are also the most likely to be struck by them. I ask my fellow cultivators to take extra care of him."

In the letter, Wen Ruanyu expressed his concern for Ning Zhuo. In reality, he wanted the Confucian group to strictly guard the matters regarding White Paper Immortal City, though he did not say it explicitly. However, any Confucian outside who received the letter would surely understand it at a glance.

Next, Wen Ruanyu spread out another sheet of letter paper. After deliberating for a long time, he finally set his pen to paper; this one was for Ning Zhuo.

In the letter, he first expressed his praise for Ning Zhuo’s performance in the Flying Cloud Assembly, feeling heartened that his old friend had such a fine son.

Then, his tone shifted, as he warned with earnest gravity: "Zhuo’er, your talent is rare in this world. However, 'the tree that stands out in the forest will be destroyed by the wind.' Remember not to immerse yourself in hollow fame or become prideful. Under the current circumstances, do not get too close to the sphere of influence of the Old Four Peaks. Be patient for a while. Once I can move freely again, I will personally plan the most suitable path for you to enter the sect, helping you move forward steadily with a firm foundation."

At the end of the letter, his pen paused slightly. He hesitated for a moment but eventually wrote down his concerns, explicitly mentioning the subtle changes within the Confucian group: "Recently, winds and clouds have been shifting within the sect. A great sage from outside has arrived to lecture, and his theories are profound, but his brilliance is too exposed. Some within the Confucian group have begun to have other ideas. This matter goes back to years ago, when there was a Confucian genius named Qin De..."

Originally, Wen Ruanyu would not have informed Ning Zhuo of such information. After all, it was a family scandal.

But now, Ning Zhuo’s various performances were constantly being brought before him - especially his performance in the Profound Armor Cave, of which there were clear and detailed magical recordings. After Wen Ruanyu watched them, he had spent the entire afternoon with a smile on his face.

Among Ning Zhuo's many displays, what surprised and delighted him most was not Ning Zhuo's learning ability or comprehension, but the political capability Ning Zhuo showed throughout the struggle. Using words to retreat an enemy rather than brute force was something Wen Ruanyu deeply appreciated and found immensely gratifying!

It was this discovery that caused Ning Zhuo's standing in Wen Ruanyu’s heart to leap up significantly. It was also the primary reason Wen Ruanyu, after hesitating, decided to tell Ning Zhuo the truth in this letter.

In Wen Ruanyu’s view, Ning Zhuo already possessed enough strength to handle these difficulties. Even if he couldn't, it was good to let him gain more experience.

The letters were soon finished. Wen Ruanyu put down his spirit pen and looked out the window. The night was deep, and the mountain mist swirled unclearly - much like the state of the Confucian group, where ripples were already beginning to form.

Blue Stone Grotto.

Inside the martial arts array.

Ning Zhuo stood by the edge with his hands behind his back, his gaze calm as water. Before him, two mechanical puppets he had forged with his own hands - Snow Pivot Guard Xie and Snow-Colored Maiden Hui - stood facing each other from a distance.

"Begin," Ning Zhuo ordered calmly.

Snow Pivot Guard Xie struck first! Standing her ground without moving, the roaring Ice Flood Dragon beast head on her shoulder guards suddenly lit up, firing two beams of azure light. The cold light shone with a frigid intent that surged and spread as if to freeze the soul itself.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui started moving, gliding as if she were skating on ice. The three-colored enamel armor on her body flowed with a seven-colored luster.

She was incredibly fast!

The speed of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, however, could not match the speed of the blue light. Furthermore, they were within a martial arts formation, where space was limited.

She lightly raised her arms, tracing a profound trajectory in the air.

Finger seals!

An ice mirror instantly condensed. It was as thin as a cicada's wing, shimmering with three-colored radiance as it blocked the cold light.

Sssss - !

The ice mirror did not block the attack head-on but instead deflected it. The azure cold light grazed past her side, turning a large section of the formation wall behind her into a solid block of azure ice.

The attacks from Snow Pivot Guard Xie were relentless. Six cold steel mechanical orbs silently dispersed, occupying various positions and continuously spewing freezing breath.

The cold breath and azure light beams wove into a net. Snow-Colored Maiden Hui shifted and turned within this net, pushing her movement techniques to the limit. Her three pairs of jade arms either formed seals, struck with palms, or pointed with fingers, every movement precise. A large number of attacks grazed past her.

Hui's movements were elegant and fluid, as if she were not in battle but performing a ritual dance. At times she was as soft as a withered flower, at others as swift as a sword drawn from its sheath. For attacks she could not avoid, she did her best to tilt and deflect them, resolving the most dangerous strikes with the least possible cost.

On the battlefield, light danced wildly and cold air surged.

Xie’s offensive surged like a cold tide. Hui appeared to be in constant danger, yet she always managed to maintain that sliver of ground to avoid defeat. Power and skill formed a brief equilibrium.

Ning Zhuo was not surprised by this, thinking to himself: "I upgraded Snow Pivot Guard Xie. Although her appearance hasn't changed much, her combat power has increased significantly."

"Although Snow-Colored Maiden Hui didn't receive any material upgrades, during this recent period she has cultivated alongside Qing Chi. Whether it's refining talismans or martial practice, she has accumulated a vast amount of combat experience. This has led her control over her own mechanical body to far exceed that of Snow Pivot Guard Xie."

"The current stalemate is only temporary. The winner of this battle will be Snow Pivot Guard Xie."

A turning point occurred shortly thereafter.

As Snow-Colored Maiden Hui dodged once more, a cold steel orb suddenly correctly predicted her gliding path and blocked it in advance. Her movement was obstructed, and Xie seized the opportunity.

The Ice Flood Dragon beast head on her shoulder guards roared again. This time, it did not fire a beam but a spiral of frigid fiend energy, which was faster and covered a more difficult range!

Although Hui raised a pair of secondary arms to cross-block, instantly forming a heavy ice shield on her forearms, the frigid fiend energy was the perfect counter to the ice shield. The shield shattered upon impact, and Hui was sent flying.

A sharp glint flashed in Ning Zhuo’s eyes.

On the surface, it looked as though Hui had lost after defending for too long, but in reality, Xie was gradually adapting to and quickly mastering her own body and combat power.

Sure enough, the subsequent battle proceeded just as Ning Zhuo had estimated. Xie showed no mercy, launching a comprehensive and massive offensive. Hui’s blocks and dodges became more frequent; her three pairs of jade arms waved like the wind, yet she could not hide her decline. Cracks continued to spread across her enamel armor, and her spiritual light visibly dimmed.

She still relied on her exquisite skills to resolve fatal attacks, but every clash added to the damage on her body. However, Hui’s fighting spirit grew higher and higher. Under the increasing external pressure, she gradually displayed more and more subtle movements.

It is worth noting that a series of spider silks were connected to both Snow Pivot Guard Xie and Snow-Colored Maiden Hui. These silks were of the Golden Core level - specifically, Void Spider Silk. Only a small portion was exposed before they pierced through the void, with the ends connected to Ning Zhuo’s ten fingers.

Under normal circumstances, Ning Zhuo would have to move his fingers rapidly, caught in intense operation. But given the special circumstances, the two portions of ample spiritual intelligence allowed Ning Zhuo to skip the most tedious control steps, saving him a great deal of energy and time. Letting these two spiritual machines fight on their own also served as a way to train them.

"Alright, stop."

Ning Zhuo spoke indifferently, and Snow Pivot Guard Xie and Snow-Colored Maiden Hui immediately ceased their actions. Mechanical puppets possessed a massive advantage in this regard - the phrase "orders strictly followed" seemed to have been tailor-made for them.

"The effect of this kind of training is quite excellent. Snow Pivot Guard Xie didn't exert her full power; she needs a stronger opponent to clash with..."
