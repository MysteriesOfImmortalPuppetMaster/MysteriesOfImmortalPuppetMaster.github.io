Chapter 311: Defeated and Fleeing?

Zhu Xuanji advanced with large strides, and within a few steps, he was upon Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo had already retreated, but his speed was far inferior to Zhu Xuanji's.

Zhu Xuanji extended his palm from above, striking downwards.

In an instant, Ning Zhuo's breath was stifled. Zhu Xuanji's attack was as fierce as a divine being descending, his hand covering the sky and earth!

In this critical moment, Ning Zhuo slapped his storage belt.

A gigantic ape suddenly appeared, using its chest to block Zhu Xuanji's palm.

This mechanical ape was precisely the Golden Core stage mechanical ape that Ning Zhuo had crafted by leveraging the situation. At the beginning of the second stage of the palace examination, Ning Zhuo had even lent it to Ning Jiufan.

Although this mechanical ape was suppressed to the Foundation Establishment stage, Ning Zhuo had heavily invested in its materials, making it extremely sturdy and resilient.

Ning Zhuo controlled the mechanical ape to battle Zhu Xuanji.

After a few exchanges, Zhu Xuanji suddenly employed the Golden Mountain Stance, releasing a portion of golden mystical light that directly pressed onto the mechanical ape, making its movements difficult.

Zhu Xuanji bypassed the mechanical ape, heading straight for Ning Zhuo, the controller.

Ning Zhuo hurriedly took out a silver-gray token and tossed it into the air.

The token had the character "Azure Iron" on the front and "Warrior Armor" on the back. It quickly disassembled, expanded, and emitted dazzling silver-gray beams.

As the beams dissipated, the Azure Iron Warrior Armor floated silently in mid-air.

Ning Zhuo pushed backward, and the Azure Iron Warrior Armor instantly opened, enveloping him.

The Foundation Establishment Pill hidden in the spine, full and round, activated swiftly.

In an instant, Ning Zhuo possessed Foundation Establishment level combat strength, and his speed surged.

Zhu Xuanji's attack thus missed its mark.

Failing to hit, Zhu Xuanji stood still, his gaze calm: "As expected, you are Chui Tiao Ke." As he spoke, he raised a single finger, his palm facing the retreating Ning Zhuo.

Martial Art - Air Slash!

An invisible force suddenly erupted, striking Ning Zhuo in an instant.

Iron Garment Cold!

At the critical moment, Ning Zhuo frantically urged the defensive formation of the Azure Iron Warrior Armor, pushing its capability to the maximum.

As a result, a mechanical technique erupted, cold air spreading, and the metallic nature becoming even more resilient.

Even so, he was still heavily struck by the overwhelming palm force.

Bang.

Ning Zhuo crashed into the wall, his back embedding into the wall itself.

Ning Zhuo was so battered that he almost vomited blood, his vision blurred, and his ears rang. The mechanical ring on his finger suddenly tightened, jolting him awake.

Mechanical Technique - Wind and Thunder Movement!

Spirit stones were consumed madly, transforming into immense spiritual power that poured into two palm-sized, intricately patterned wind and thunder talismans.

The talismans each emitted wind and thunder power, intertwining along the internal formation patterns of the Azure Iron Warrior Armor, merging to form a blue-green electric light that surrounded the Azure Iron Warrior Armor.

In the next moment, the invisible force struck again!

Ning Zhuo controlled the Azure Iron Warrior Armor, shooting away like lightning, leaving only a few strands of green electric light in place.

Bang.

The palm force heavily covered the spot, extinguishing the green electric light completely, leaving a massive four-foot square palm imprint on the wall.

Sun Lingtong urgently transmitted a message: "Ah Zhuo, be careful! Both the Golden Mountain Stance and the Jade Pillar Stance provide comprehensive enhancements to cultivators."

Ning Zhuo had already realized Zhu Xuanji's prowess!

Despite being suppressed by the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities' restrictions, his cultivation was confined to the Foundation Establishment level. Yet, his divine abilities allowed him to fight beyond his level.

Ning Zhuo's recent sneak attack had triggered Zhu Xuanji's powerful state with three divine abilities enhanced.

Rudie Niang needed to exert all her strength to unleash a quasi-Golden Core power. Yet, every strike from Zhu Xuanji surpassed the normal Foundation Establishment level, reaching quasi-Golden Core standards!

"Let's attack him together!" Ning Zhuo shouted lowly.

Mechanical Technique - Azure Dragon Soaring!

The armor plates on the back, shoulders, and elbows, and wrists of the Azure Iron Warrior Armor all flipped open, revealing hidden explosive talismans.

In the next moment, the talismans fully ignited, shining with brilliant white light, fully propelling Ning Zhuo's actions.

Ning Zhuo seemed like a silver dragon, breaking through the air.

He circled Zhu Xuanji, engaging in mid-range combat.

Ning Zhuo's attacks landed on Zhu Xuanji, causing the golden mystical light to ripple, the golden branches and jade leaves on the mountain to clink continuously, yet failing to harm Zhu Xuanji in the slightest.

In contrast, he was constantly dodging, occasionally blocking.

Zhu Xuanji's attacks were powerful and heavy, quickly causing the Azure Iron Warrior Armor to struggle, cracks appearing all over.

This was already the strongest state of the Azure Iron Warrior Armor, yet it could only barely maintain its stance.

The mechanical ring frequently activated, allowing Ning Zhuo to evade multiple attacks.

The Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai retracted the ghost, leaned forward, and emitted a sound wave from his mouth.

In his throat, there was a mechanical component, the Soul-Shaking Throat Drum, whose sound could disturb souls. However, when it landed on Zhu Xuanji, it merely caused his golden branches and jade leaves to sway more gracefully.

Seeing this, Ning Zhuo's pupils contracted, realizing that the three divine abilities were closely linked, making Zhu Xuanji's defense overwhelmingly strong.

"We must break the connection between the three divine abilities!"

Ning Zhuo had identified the key to the battle, but he couldn't think of any way to achieve it at the moment.

Sun Lingtong dared not to engage in close combat, using blade techniques for long-range attacks.

The Golden Core mechanical ape and Ning Zhuo cooperated seamlessly, yet were continuously pushed back by Zhu Xuanji.

Rudie Niang watched anxiously from the side, wanting to intervene but fearing harm to her allies.

Yang Chanyu stopped shooting poison arrows: "Our coordination is not smooth, severely lacking practice, and our combined strength is poor." She silently concealed her form, making a certain decision.

Ancient Cicada Technique!

Autumn Cicada's Last Cry!!

The piercing sound of the autumn cicada suddenly rang out, and Yang Chanyu appeared behind Zhu Xuanji.

She wielded the Soul-Stealing Light Blade, piercing through the golden mystical light, breaking through the jade skin, intending to continue stabbing, but the blade was caught by Zhu Xuanji.

Zhu Xuanji looked down at Yang Chanyu: "To make me bleed in this state, Yang Chanyu, you have reason to be proud." Yang Chanyu's heart was alarmed, and without hesitation, she abandoned the blade and retreated!

Zhu Xuanji's left eye emitted a golden glow.

Innate Talent - Golden Time.

Spell - Needle Blanket.

Innate Talent Spell - Golden Eye Needle.

In an instant, Yang Chanyu was enveloped in a layer of golden light.

Within the light, golden rays condensed into needles, hundreds and thousands of golden needles shot forth!

Piercing Yang Chanyu all over!

Yang Chanyu cried out in pain, urging her mana to activate defensive artifacts, fully supporting herself.

But as long as she remained within Zhu Xuanji's line of sight, she would constantly suffer the barrage of hundreds of golden needles.

Yang Chanyu attempted to use invisibility techniques.

Zhu Xuanji pointed a finger.

Official Technique - Lock Nation!

Golden chains immediately formed on Yang Chanyu's body, binding her tightly.

Zhu Xuanji's fingers continued to point.

Sun Lingtong, the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai, and the Golden Core mechanical ape were all successively hit, bound in place, struggling desperately.

Only Ning Zhuo, relying on the mechanical ring's warning, escaped in advance.

"This is in the Southern Bean Kingdom."

"Zhu Xuanji's official technique is immensely powerful, difficult to resist!" "What should we do?"

Ning Zhuo avoided the Lock Nation technique, but exposed himself in Zhu Xuanji's line of sight, enveloped in a layer of light.

Countless fine light needles constantly pierced his body.

Ning Zhuo inwardly cursed, forced to fully defend. The Azure Iron Warrior Armor quickly deteriorated, its surface densely covered with needle holes, increasing in number!

Everyone was preoccupied, and Zhu Xuanji attacked again!

Martial Art - Mountain Separation.

He struck with his hand, hitting the chest and abdomen of the mechanical ape. The powerful force penetrated the heavy armor, striking the intricate ice mechanism structure inside the ape.

Bang.

With a muffled sound, the intricate ice mechanism structure shattered completely under this strike.

The Golden Core mechanical ape thus lost much of its power, its combat strength plummeting to the bottom, nearly paralyzed in place.

Zhu Xuanji then advanced towards the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai, slicing with his hand like a blade, splitting the latter from shoulder to waist in half.

He charged towards Rudie Niang.

Rudie Niang's face turned pale, screaming in terror!

The wings behind her erupted with power, forming countless twisted light lines, weaving into fragmented light and shadow.

The light and shadow intertwined, rapidly expanding.

Zhu Xuanji charged in, clearly moving in a straight line, yet in the light and shadow, he turned, bypassing Rudie Niang.

"It's actually the Curved Light Weaving Formation!" Zhu Xuanji felt surprised, and also found it troublesome.

He temporarily abandoned Rudie Niang, advancing towards Yang Chanyu.

Yang Chanyu had to defend against the golden needles, unable to counter Zhu Xuanji, and was struck by his leg, severely injured, spitting blood. The mechanism activated, and she was instantly swallowed by a light ring, sent out of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.

Zhu Xuanji then targeted Sun Lingtong.

"Boss, run!" Ning Zhuo rushed over at the critical moment, pushing Sun Lingtong away.

Sun Lingtong crashed to the ground, got up, and saw the door close at hand.

"Run!" Ning Zhuo's voice echoed.

Sun Lingtong turned to see Ning Zhuo being struck by Zhu Xuanji's heavy punch, the Azure Iron Warrior Armor on him shattering mostly, fragments flying with the wind.

But Ning Zhuo also used the force of the punch to fly backward, diving into Rudie Niang's Curved Light Weaving Formation, disappearing from Zhu Xuanji's sight.

Covered by light and shadow, Ning Zhuo no longer had the light halo on him, free from the crisis of golden needle barrages.

But in the next moment, a golden light pierced through the light and shadow, like a sharp sword, stabbing through Ning Zhuo's abdomen!

Ning Zhuo hurriedly fled.

The light and shadow wove together, forming a strange black and white world.

Golden swords occasionally shot through, each time accurately targeting Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo knew very well that he was being tracked and monitored by Zhu Xuanji's methods.

In just a few breaths, Ning Zhuo was already drenched in blood.

"Little Zhuo!" Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth, but did not join the battle, instead rolling over, pushing the door open, and immediately running towards another door.

Zhu Xuanji saw this and snorted disdainfully: "Ning Zhuo, see, this is the loyalty of a thief!"

"Your defeat is certain, there's no need to struggle further. Surrender voluntarily, and leave. Reflect well afterward, turn yourself in, and strive for leniency!"

The black and white light and shadow filled the entire Secret Pavilion, overlapping continuously, making Zhu Xuanji's perception of Ning Zhuo increasingly vague.

His persuasion received no response from Ning Zhuo, and he hesitated whether to enter the formation, when suddenly he lost all sense of Ning Zhuo.

In the next moment, he heard a message announcement.

"Ning Jiufan battles Zheng Shuangjun, Meng Chong, and the Meng Family's Golden Core true disciple. Ning Jiufan is defeated and eliminated, Zheng Shuangjun is defeated and eliminated!" Zhu Xuanji's brows furrowed deeply.

In the next moment, he received a second message.

"Zhu Xuanji battles Entry Standard, Yang Chanyu, and Ning Zhuo. Yang Chanyu is defeated and eliminated, Ning Zhuo surrenders and is eliminated." Zhu Xuanji's brows slowly relaxed, and after taking one last look at the Curved Light Weaving Formation, he turned and left.
