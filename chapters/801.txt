Chapter 801: Supreme-grade Mountains and Rivers Page!

The statue of the Wutu Suppression Prison True Lord showed an unusual movement.

This statue was naturally forged by Ning Zhuo after he utilized the Zhu Clan’s Divine Summoning Art to invite the deity. 

In the next moment, divine light surged, landing upon Ning Zhuo. 

The light carried a stream of information, which Ning Zhuo received in its entirety. 

"The third Cloud-Rising Trial for Confucian cultivators?" Ning Zhuo’s brows twitched slightly in surprise. This news came from Zhu Fenxiang, transmitted through her own statue - essentially using the Wutu Suppression Prison True Lord as a relay station.

"So that's how it is."

"Zhu Guizhi and Zhao Hansheng have already reached a private agreement. That is why there is a plan for Zhu Fenxiang to participate in the Confucian trial."

Ning Zhuo immediately gained a direct understanding of the cause and effect. 

Zhu Fenxiang’s stance was primarily influenced by the Wutu Suppression Prison True Lord. Therefore, upon learning of this matter, she immediately used the statue as a relay to deliver this precious intelligence into Ning Zhuo’s hands.

Just as Ning Zhuo was about to study it, a flying message from Wen Ruanyu arrived. 

It turned out that Chu Xuangui had once again informed Wen Ruanyu via flying message about the Confucian community's discussions regarding Qin De. 

After Wen Ruanyu learned of this, he felt that Ning Zhuo should be made aware, so he transcribed a large portion and sent it to him. He did not offer his own views in the letter, only stating the facts, which carried a hidden intent to test Ning Zhuo. 

"Sigh... Qin De is indeed the greatest obstacle to the development of the Confucian community." 

"The Confucian cultivators originally designed this third Cloud-Rising Trial based on my needs." 

"But with the interference of Gu Qing and Zhao Hansheng, the scale of this trial has expanded, deviating greatly from its original direction. I am no longer the primary focus of the Confucian group." 

Previously, Ning Zhuo had intentionally purchased a large number of Confucian techniques at the Commerce Hall to subtly inform the Confucian community of what he needed. 

However, Ning Zhuo was actually considering whether he should give up on this trial. 

According to the content of this trial, Gu Qing’s advantage was too great. There was no need for Ning Zhuo to lose time, energy, and - most importantly - reputation just for the sake of crafting a few sheets of spirit paper. 

If he lost to Gu Qing, it would allow the latter to reclaim a victory, significantly weakening the influence of his previous achievements in the Martial Arts Hall. 

"Mountains and Rivers Page, Starry Sky Paper, Haoran Xuan, Heartfire Silk, and the Dao-Bearing Jade Page?!" As Ning Zhuo reviewed the intelligence sent by Zhu Fenxiang, his previous thoughts of withdrawing were thrown to the back of his mind. 

The first four were all types of spirit paper that were widely used and held great market value. 

Learning the methods to refine them was a path to profit in itself. He was certain that the number of cultivators participating in the trial would be explosive! 

Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng had indeed gone to great lengths for this trial, creating a truly massive momentum and scale. 

"The key is the Dao-Bearing Jade Page; it can actually carry True Intent!" 

"Can Zhao Hansheng really produce it?" 

"To participate in this trial, he has truly spared no effort and is willing to pay a heavy price." 

Ning Zhuo was very clear on the weight of a Dao-Bearing Jade Page! 

Spirit paper capable of carrying True Intent was extremely rare. Every refining method was a closely guarded secret, treated as a foundational, supreme treasure of any power.

For instance, the Ning Clan did not possess one. 

Thus, the Ning Clan’s foundations were the Proud Snow Map and the Frost-Defying Map. These types of papers only carried a certain type of Sentiment. 

Comprehending True Intent had no threshold and was 100% successful. 

Comprehending Sentiment was different; if the hearts did not align, a cultivator facing a Comprehension Map could only stare blankly.

With True Intent spirit paper, one could create a True Intent Map. No matter a cultivator’s innate comprehension - even if they were a fool - they could understand it at a glance, receive the infusion of True Intent, and immediately see their realm soar. 

"If I had the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, I could infuse my own True Intent into it and then pass it on to Big Brother." 

Similarly, Sun Lingtong could do the same to provide feedback to Ning Zhuo.

Although True Intent would be depleted and might even lead to a drop in realm, a cultivator could make up for it through future bitter cultivation. 

"I have a massive amount of experience and memory, and I won't lose myself." 

"After a period of bitter cultivation and sufficient review, I should be able to restore my realm." 

"Perhaps, just perhaps..." 

"I could even directly pass True Intent to my mechanical puppets?" 

Several of the Golden Core-level puppets in Ning Zhuo’s hands possessed spirituality. This spirituality wasn't yet enough for them to learn spells on their own, but would True Intent absorption work? 

If the absorption of True Intent succeeded, they would become veterans; it might even be possible for them to comprehend or even create their own spells. 

Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel his heart throb with excitement. 

He had to go to this Rising Cloud Trial! 

The opportunity for a Dao-Bearing Jade Page was exceptionally rare. Once this chance passed, it might never come again.

"Of course, since Zhao Hansheng brought it out, he must have the confidence and certainty that others cannot learn it. However, as his student, Gu Qing has likely already mastered it." 

"Thus, he is using this trial to guarantee Gu Qing becomes number one."

"Even if others see through this, for the sake of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, they will turn a blind eye and acquiesce."

Ning Zhuo had already seen through Zhao Hansheng’s scheme.

He also anticipated the difficulty.

Even so, he was willing to try.

-----
The Third Rising Cloud Trial!

Just as Ning Zhuo expected, the mountain workshop was nearly a sea of people. 

A large number of cultivators had gathered here, eager to participate in the trial. In contrast, the Confucian cultivators appeared small in number, primarily because their population was naturally limited.

Lu Zai served as the trial examiner and presided over the event.

Under everyone's gaze, he slowly took the stage. 

This man had the appearance of a middle-aged male; his stature was not tall, but he was exceptionally sturdy and steady. 

His face was broad and kind, his skin a healthy wheat color as if nourished by Earth Qi year-round. His hands were large and warm, his knuckles distinct, and his palm lines resembled the contours of mountains and rivers.

Today, he wore a suit of ochre-yellow Confucian robes made of cotton and linen, which felt heavy to the touch. Simple fretwork was embroidered on the corners and sleeves of the robe, giving a sense of endless continuity and stability. A dark, wide belt was tied around his waist, upon which a jade slip titled the Yu Gong Geographical Map was tucked. 

Lu Zai’s voice was steady as he first briefly introduced the rules of this trial and then announced its commencement. 

Everyone filed into the designated doorways. 

Upon entering, they stepped into a Formation Space. 

The Confucian cultivators had long anticipated such a flow of people, so they had made preparations, arranging formations to create a massive plaza.

Every set distance on the plaza, there was a stall. Each stall was equipped with the same refining tools.

There were over a thousand stalls in the entire plaza. 

Even on such a scale, it wasn't enough. A large number of cultivators were still lining up outside the doors. 

Following the flow of people, Ning Zhuo entered the formation and randomly chose a stall.

Lu Zai floated in mid-air and began his lecture: "Paper is the mountains and rivers; the heart is the creation. Today's trial is to refine the Mountains and Rivers Page."

"Earth is the bone, and water is the vessels. Bones without vessels wither; vessels without bones scatter..."

He truly had no nonsense; he started lecturing immediately, explaining the refining method for the Mountains and Rivers Page.

The listeners had varied expressions. 

Some were joyful, some frowned, some were confused, and some had sudden realizations... 

Lu Zai did not just explain it once; he explained it three times in succession. He even allowed cultivators to engrave the information into jade slips. He truly held nothing back, sincerely wanting to spread this papermaking technique.

Ning Zhuo understood it clearly after hearing it once. 

Once Lu Zai finished his explanation, he personally demonstrated the process, quickly producing a Mountains and Rivers Page.

"For us Confucian cultivators, the Literary Palace is wisdom, Literary Qi is power, and the Literary Heart is the root."  Lu Zai’s gaze swept across the field. "Today, I will use my own Literary Heart as a guide to help you sense the earth veins; I will use my Literary Qi as a supplement to help you harmonize the spiritual materials."

After saying this, he slowly rose and landed in the core of the formation. 

Then, he activated his cultivation, continuously gushing out Literary Qi. 

With Lu Zai’s command, the trial began. 

Gu Qing, situated in the first row, immediately began his work. 

First, he had to gather materials. 

The stall was equipped with various materials, with Earth Element as the primary ingredient, Water Element as the secondary, and Wood Element as the third. 

The Earth primary ingredients included the Royal Soil from the dynasty’s ancestral temple, Frontier Soil from the border passes, Mountain Essence from famous peaks, and Shrine Soil from villages. 

The Water auxiliary materials were mainly Stalactites from underground caves. 

The Wood auxiliary materials were various types of Wood Pith. 

Gu Qing discarded the Royal Soil and Frontier Soil, taking a piece of Mountain Essence and holding it in his hand. 

His divine sense moved, surrounding the Mountain Essence as he performed the Confucian technique - Investigation of Things! 

Very quickly, within his Literary Palace in his divine sea, information about the Mountain Essence was continuously generated, converging together to form a phantom of the Mountain Essence. Its appearance was no different from the Mountain Essence in reality. 

Gu Qing followed the same pattern, taking a section of Stalactite and performing the Investigation of Things. 

In the Literary Palace, the phantom of the Stalactite appeared again. 

Gu Qing’s divine sense shifted, and from a massive bookshelf in the Literary Palace, an essay immediately flew out. 

The content of the essay was exactly the refining method for the Mountains and Rivers Page that Lu Zai had spoken of earlier.

Countless characters emitted a faint light, gathering into a vortex that spun continuously before spreading out and turning into a mass of gray-white halo. 

The phantoms of the Mountain Essence and Stalactite were sucked into the halo, merging with each other to form the phantom of a sheet of paper. 

However, the form of the paper was unstable, sometimes shrinking into a ball, sometimes spreading out into a foot-long sheet, and sometimes twisting into a spiral... 

Gu Qing’s divine sense was continuously consumed, but he quickly made a precise judgment. 

He took a second piece of Mountain Essence and performed the Investigation of Things. As the phantom merged into the halo, the form of the paper immediately stabilized significantly, though the corners remained blurry and wrinkles occasionally appeared on the surface. 

Gu Qing’s divine sense continued to be consumed, and he made another accurate judgment. 

This time, he chose a suitable Wood Pith. The addition of the Wood Pith phantom completely stabilized the paper phantom. 

Gu Qing could have done even better, making the paper phantom lifelike and even emitting a jade-like glow.

"This Confucian trial’s evaluation criteria include both quality and quantity.  Furthermore, in all five stages, the ratio of quality to quantity is different for each. In this stage, I will prioritize quantity and then seek quality; this is the most secure approach." 

After finishing his calculations, Gu Qing immediately set to work and began the refining process. 

He first used a fire-refining method to melt the Mountain Essence and Stalactite, then used a water-refining method to dissolve the Wood Pith, finally bringing the three together in a Dissolving Basin. 

A Dissolving Basin was a water-refining vessel, the counterpart to a furnace.

Next, Gu Qing continuously channeled his own spiritual energy and Literary Qi into the Dissolving Basin. 

When the timing was right, he permeated his divine sense and activated the refining essay within his Literary Palace. 

The mingled substances in the basin finally mixed into a blue-brown paper pulp. 

"It’s time."

He shouted inwardly: "Rise!" 

The pulp was pulled out of the basin, rising into the air. Gu Qing activated the Literary Heart in his Lower Dantian and spat out a stream of vital essence, hitting the pulp. 

The pulp, which had been clumped together, suddenly unfurled after being hit by the vital essence, forming a sheet the size of a fingernail. 

The pulp quickly hardened, its surface uneven, resembling a miniature landscape of mountains and rivers. 

Gu Qing’s mind focused on it; after three breaths, he immediately acted, his fingers flying as he pinched the correct finger seals. 

Consequently, the thick paper was directly sliced apart, turning into over twenty sheets. 

The several sheets on the top and bottom layers were uneven and coarse, making them impossible to write upon, so they were discarded. However, the central layers and the sheets near them had flat surfaces and a delicate texture - these were qualified spirit paper! 

After checking them once, Gu Qing placed the qualified spirit paper to the side and continued with a second wave of refining. 

"Brother Gu’s Confucian technique attainments are so strong!" Not far away, Bai Jiyun, who was at another stall, witnessed Gu Qing being the first to complete the papermaking and couldn't help but feel a shock in his heart. 

The Confucian technique Investigation of Things best reflected a Confucian cultivator's attainment. 

Having finished his first wave of refining, Gu Qing immediately started the second. 

At this time, Bai Jiyun was still investigating the properties and details of the various precious materials. His speed could not even be compared to Gu Qing’s.

Bai Jiyun used his divine sense to scan Liu Fushu and saw that he had already begun processing the materials, causing him to give a bitter smile. 

Liu Fushu’s cultivation was even weaker than Bai Jiyun’s, but his basic skills were solid; at the very least, his execution of the Investigation of Things was much stronger than Bai Jiyun’s. Therefore, Liu Fushu’s progress was slightly ahead of Bai Jiyun’s. 

Bai Jiyun usually preferred poetry and did not care much for Confucian techniques like the Investigation of Things. He practiced them very little and was now suffering the consequences. 

Ning Zhuo was located in the middle-to-rear section. 

He handled the materials one by one, his divine sense covering or permeating these precious materials as he also investigated their properties. 

However, unlike Bai Jiyun, he concluded this process after only a few breaths. 

These materials were primarily of the Earth and Water elements. Ning Zhuo had a very deep realm in the Five Elements, so the speed at which he understood them was quite rapid.

He then began processing the materials. 

This process also went smoothly. The properties exhibited by the materials did not exceed the scope of his understanding. 

Ning Zhuo’s realm in Artifact Refining had also recently been elevated. 

However, he slowed down in terms of speed, faring much worse than Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and others. He simply could not compare with Gu Qing. 

"There's no way around it. The papermaking method Lu Zai taught involves Confucian resources; the Literary Heart, Literary Qi, and Literary Palace are all participating." 

"I don't have these, so I can only borrow them." 

The stall provided a continuous stream of Literary Qi, and thanks to the formation, its size could be adjusted. 

A Literary Palace could not be provided, but the effects of a Literary Heart could be simply substituted by a cultivator spitting out their own vital essence blood. 

Of course, the assistance it provided to papermaking was naturally inferior to a true Literary Heart. 

By the time Ning Zhuo refined his first wave of Mountains and Rivers Pages, Liu Fushu had just finished his second. Gu Qing’s progress was already on the fifth wave. 

Meanwhile, the majority of cultivators were still checking their materials or processing them. 

Clang, clang, clang... 

A bell rang, reminding all the cultivators present that half the time had already passed. 

Ning Zhuo performed a rough observation with his divine sense and found that he was only in an above-average position. Among the leading cultivators, such as Gu Qing, the number of sheets produced was already double his own. 

The big-headed youth shook his head inwardly, a bitter smile in his heart: "Confucian cultivators have too great an advantage in papermaking. Whether it's the Literary Heart, Palace, or Qi, it is most convenient when using one's own." 

"And that's not even counting the fact that these Confucian cultivators have, more or less, refined these spirit papers before."

"Especially Gu Qing." 

"Since Zhao Hansheng could leak information to Zhu Fenxiang, Gu Qing has likely practiced many extra sessions before the trial." 

"He came prepared." 

In contrast, many cultivators, including Ning Zhuo, were hearing the refining method for the Mountains and Rivers Page for the very first time. This pre-existing gap led to a massive difference between the upper and lower levels of performance in the papermaking field. 

"If I can't compete in quantity, can I find a way through quality?" Ning Zhuo pondered.

Elsewhere, Kong Ran had already achieved results. 

The number of sheets he produced was also limited, mainly because his cultivation was only at the Qi Refining Stage.  However, the quality of the paper he produced was very high. The reason was simple: in the final process, he added Official Qi to the paper. 

His father was a high-ranking official of the Flying Cloud Kingdom. As his biological son, it was a simple matter for Kong Ran to borrow some Official Qi. 

The Official Qi caused the quality of the Mountains and Rivers Page to rise by at least one grade. 

Gu Qing observed his surroundings with his divine sense and felt at ease. 

Although he had no Official Qi to use, using the precious Royal Soil and Frontier Soil could also greatly enhance the quality of the Mountains and Rivers Page. 

"In this round, I shall be number one!" 

"Hmph, this Ning Zhuo actually showed up." 

"That's fine. Defeating him easily and leaving a clear gap will greatly offset the influence of his previous plot against me." 

Just as he was thinking this, he observed Ning Zhuo’s expression change slightly through his divine sense. 

Immediately after, with a look of doubt, Ning Zhuo took out a jade pendant from his storage belt. 

Roar - 

A dragon’s cry echoed throughout the venue. 

Then, a dragon shadow emerged from the jade pendant and dove into the Mountains and Rivers Page. 

In the next instant, the Mountains and Rivers Page erupted with brilliant light, setting off a wave of air that left everyone in the field shocked and curious.

"What's going on?" 

"What happened?" 

"Supreme! A Supreme-grade Mountains and Rivers Page has been refined!!!"
