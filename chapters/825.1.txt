Galloping Toward the Moon, Unhindered!

(Happy Spring Festival 2026 to all my fellow readers!)

Ah, 2025...

So many things happened, so very many things.

I encountered deception and became disillusioned with many "rules of existence." I went through several high-stakes gambles. Pressure was everywhere, attacking from all sides.

I gritted my teeth and walked away from a major contract. I was honored to play a top-100 popular character, participated in creating an AI anime that hit a million views within 24 hours, successfully held another "Grilled Fish" convention, and launched the very first offline readers' meetup...

I met so many elites, experts, and masters from the worlds of politics, business, academia, gaming, self-media, and literature.

I consulted them with an open mind... and learned a great deal.

People come and go... but all are friends. May we all cultivate good karma.

My understanding of the world has constantly shattered and renewed; I realized that past plans could never bridge the gap to success.

I have reshaped the relationships around me! I am doing my utmost to win more support!

Physically and mentally exhausted, I finally managed to seize a hard-won moment of respite at the end of the year.

I made many unprecedented breakthroughs.

But there were also many promises left unkept, and many points of failure!

Successes and losses - it is difficult to sum up in a single word.

I "came down from the mountain" in 2024 - a ten-year redemption!

2025 was the first year.

I threw myself into the turbulent currents of society; the waves of the AI era are surging, nearly blotting out the sun.

Seeking guidance with humility, dealing with the constant influx of people and affairs - it felt like an endless series of trials.

Gradually, I stopped using words to explain myself, because action itself is the firmest answer!

2026, the second year.

Waking from the hazy dreams of the Year of the Snake, galloping toward the Year of the Horse.

I wish all readers a Happy Spring Festival and the spirit of the Dragon-Horse!

Let us move forward together and progress together- 

Three winters of frost have frozen the immortal bones; one evening of spring breeze enters the wine.

Knowing well the dangers and peaks of the road ahead, I shall gallop toward the moon, unhindered!
