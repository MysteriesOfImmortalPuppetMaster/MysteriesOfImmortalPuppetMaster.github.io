Chapter 744: Was It Really Just Luck?

Situ Xing sat upright in the main seat, his brow furrowed as he sank into deep thought.

Lin Jinglong's words had struck at the deepest recesses of his heart.

Ever since Ning Zhuo's ostentatious actions - securing the stone tablet and leveraging the Demon Subjugation Hall's Three Trials of the Heart to rise to prominence - Situ Xing had felt like he had thorns in his back and gills in his throat.

As a scion of the Situ Clan, blessed with Innate Talent, he had received the clan's full support from childhood, groomed to become its heir.

Thus, he possessed not only formidable combat prowess and cultivation but also exceptional political acumen.

Ning Zhuo's brazen actions immediately made Situ Xing realize that his own power and status were under grave threat.

Shen Bu and Lin Jinglong, both lacking Innate Talent and having long been familiar to him, seemed relatively safe allies.

Ning Zhuo, however, was a complete stranger. Even now, Situ Xing had never had a truly in-depth conversation with him.

Situ Xing recalled how he had first "met" Ning Zhuo. Initially, he had learned about him from Shen Bu.

"Initially, he kept a low profile, clearly biding his time."

"Such restraint suggests immense ambition!"

"Once he assessed the situation and saw an opportunity, he seized it ruthlessly, making a name for himself and revealing his true sharpness."

"We must never underestimate such an ambitious individual!"

"Perhaps when he first joined our group, it was merely a test. But now that he understands the inner workings and rules of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial and the Flying Cloud Grand Assembly, could he be plotting to usurp my position as leader?"

Situ Xing sensed a formidable threat emanating from Ning Zhuo.

He feared that Ning Zhuo's burgeoning ambition would lead him to act against him in secret, ultimately seizing control and driving Situ Xing from his position. Such a humiliation would be unbearable.

In the Righteous Path, losing face is no trivial matter!

Reputation is paramount.

Having been groomed as a potential successor, Situ Xing understood the profound importance of reputation. Since beginning his cultivation journey, every significant action he had taken carried deeper meaning, each step carefully calculated to cultivate his prestige.

"Even if I succeed in vying for the clan leader position in the future, I can still leverage my reputation to secure a high-ranking position within the Situ Family."

"But in this situation, Ning Zhuo has forced me into a disadvantageous seat. Such a humiliating defeat will undoubtedly become a major weakness in my future bid for clan leadership. My rivals will seize upon this vulnerability to launch devastating attacks against me."

If Situ Xing can't even maintain his position as leader of a small faction, how can he possibly lead the entire Situ Family?

How will Situ Xing counter this?

"Power... oh, power..." Situ Xing sighed inwardly.

I crave power, and I pursue it relentlessly. With power, I can leverage the entire Situ Family to secure the resources necessary for my cultivation.

This is a golden age of cultivation, abundant in spiritual energy and resources. But when it comes to competition among cultivators, the quality of resources becomes crucial.

A cultivator with superior Innate Talent deserves only high-grade resources; anything less will inevitably hinder their progress.

Situ Xing, proud and ambitious, seeks nothing less than the best resources - the most abundant and refined.

Therefore, forming a powerful faction and successfully navigating the Flying Cloud Grand Assembly became Situ Xing's most crucial plan. By gradually demonstrating his leadership abilities and cultivating a following among the elite, he aimed to prove his individual combat prowess and showcase his leadership potential. These were Situ Xing's true objectives.

For a prodigious cultivator like him, joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect was practically effortless. His innate talent alone would have been enough for the sect to actively recruit him.

But Situ Xing wanted more!

Ning Zhuo had become a threat, even though he had never actively participated in the faction. His mere existence was enough to put Situ Xing on high alert.

"Ning Zhuo's current inactivity doesn't guarantee his future passivity. He might not covet my position now, but what about later?"

Moreover, Ning Zhuo's casual demeanor and unconventional methods severely disrupted Situ Xing's control over the faction.

As long as Ning Zhuo existed, everyone would clearly see that within this group, someone could challenge Situ Xing's authority and disregard Situ Xing's rules.

Heaven has seven days; man has seven masters.

Ning Zhuo's very existence was eroding Situ Xing's power.

The rules of the power were cruel, suspicious, and unforgiving.

"In the future, if I make even the slightest mistake, Ning Zhuo will raise his voice, and I fear someone will rush to kiss his stinky feet, creating a tidal wave to overthrow me."

Situ Xing had long understood that the dilemma before him offered no middle ground.

He had to "deal with" Ning Zhuo.

Lin Jinglong's advice merely echoed his own intentions. It also prompted him to consider: Was now the right time to address this problem?

After careful deliberation, Situ Xing concluded that it was.

To be precise, he was more concerned about the future.

"Ning Zhuo is a foreigner. Even with his retinue, he remains essentially alone."

"If we don't strike while his position is still unstable, won't things only worsen once he solidifies his foundation?"

Had this been any other first-rate genius rivaling Situ Xing, he wouldn't have been so worried. The problem was Ning Zhuo's extraordinary rise.

Winning first place in both the Confucian cultivator's Rising Cloud Minor Trials was one thing, but Ning Zhuo's performance on the Demon Subjugation Hall's Three Trials of the Heart was truly astonishing.

Ning Zhuo's performance had been nothing short of astonishing!

Situ Xing himself could never have achieved such brilliance.

The reason was obvious: Situ Xing simply wasn't the "righteous" type.

"What kind of person is the current Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall? He must undoubtedly hold Ning Zhuo in high regard!"

"If we delay any longer, waiting for a future opportunity, it might be too late."

With this realization, Situ Xing finally made up his mind and summoned Shen Bu and Lin Jinglong.

His face grave, he addressed them with eloquent words:

"Fellow Daoists Shen and Lin! Our alliance, the Star Point Peak Society, stands firm on the three pillars of Heaven, Earth, and Man - you and me. Bound by oaths as steadfast as gold and stone, we gather here on Cloud Platform to convene the Flying Cloud Grand Assembly, aiming to shake the Nine Thunders. Since our alliance's inception, each of you has demonstrated exceptional talent, united by shared Qi and acting as seamlessly as limbs controlled by the mind."

"By Heaven's grace, Fellow Daoist Shen Bu recommended Ning Zhuo, a talent capable of safeguarding the world, whose abilities and longevity promise boundless potential. His auspicious presence, like the phoenix's plumage and the dragon's scales, is truly our great fortune!"

"Yet Ning Zhuo's position remains undefined - a grave oversight! If rumors spread across the four seas, claiming we lack discernment, slighting hidden talents, would this not tarnish the reputation of our noble lineage?"

"My mind is made up. We shall choose an auspicious day to compete against Ning Zhuo at Star Point Terrace. Should I be defeated, I will vacate my seat and offer the position of leadership to Young Master Ning, with sincere respect and admiration, witnessed by heaven and earth!"

Lin Jinglong and Shen Bu fell silent.

Having known Situ Xing for years, they saw through his true intentions.

What nonsense about relinquishing the first seat to Ning Zhuo if he loses? Such empty rhetoric!

A fiery glint flashed in Lin Jinglong's eyes as he mentally translated: Situ Xing is worried about Ning Zhuo's ambition and power grab. He needs to deal with him first! He wants to provoke a fight, crush him, and remain the top dog. He's counting on the support of his allies, exploiting their loyalty.

Lin Jinglong, having been groomed by his clan since childhood, immediately recognized Situ Xing's true motives.

A wry smile tugged at his lips. "Situ Xing's flowery rhetoric is rarely seen. This shows how much pressure Ning Zhuo is putting on him, forcing him to resort to such grandstanding!"

"True," Lin Jinglong agreed. "Both I and Shen Bu have had contact with Ning Zhuo. I even fought him once."

"And Shen Bu personally recommended Ning Zhuo for his position."

After the battle began, actively recruiting allies and establishing a numerical advantage to overcome the odds - this was the standard playbook for righteous factions.

Situ Xing, the rising star of the Righteous Path, was employing the standard opening move of the Righteous Path!

Situ Xing stared intently at Shen Bu, pressing him for his stance.

Shen Bu pondered aloud, "A snake moves with its head - this is the Heavenly Dao. Since the founding of our sect, Brother Situ Xing has been working tirelessly, while consistently leding the charge. How can we allow someone from a lesser clan to seize the position of sect leader?"

"Though Ning Zhuo was nominated by me, our relationship is as fleeting as water meeting on the surface. How can it compare to the bond between us and the sect leader?"

"I propose we send a formal letter to Ning Zhuo, outlining these terms: First, the title of 'Chief Strategist' rightfully belongs to Fellow Daoist Situ Xing - this is undeniable. Second, i am willing to retreat to the third seat, ceding my current position to Ning Zhuo."

"With this arrangement, the Four talents will each find their proper place. Wouldn't this be a stroke of fortune for our faction?"

"To prevent the central pillar from falling, I will gladly serve as its foundation. As long as the Turning Banner points the way and our collective strength remains united, what grand undertaking could we not achieve?"

Seeing Shen Bu's willingness to support him, Situ Xing's gaze softened.

"Ning Zhuo was introduced by me through recommendation. If we clash with him, Situ Xing sits in the first seat and can watch the tigers fight. Even if Ning Zhuo wins, his position won't be shaken."

Situ Xing was satisfied with Shen Bu's stance.

But, he was not pleased with Shen Bu's proposal.

Sending letters back and forth would be too slow, and it would give Shen Bu and Ning Zhuo time to communicate and react - who knows what mischief they might concoct!

Situ Xing knew very well that one purpose of summoning them urgently was to catch them off guard with a sudden move.

Situ Xing had never fully trusted Shen Bu.

"I suffered a setback in Shen Bu's Formation back then."

"When we were forming our faction, I even deliberately "tested" Shen Bu to confirm his ambition for a high position before I began to worry."

"What if Shen Bu is merely stalling for time, secretly using Ning Zhuo to exhaust us, allowing him to seize the opportunity to usurp my position? It's not impossible, you know."

Situ Xing shifted his gaze to Lin Jinglong.

Lin Jinglong's attitude remained resolute.

I've clearly expressed my concerns. The clashes in the Martial Arts Hall are matters of life and death. If something were to happen to either of them, would the Situ Clan and the Ning Clan remain silent? Such an outcome would be troublesome and complicated.

Even if no one dies, a serious injury that forces them to miss the Flying Cloud Grand Assembly would inevitably invite ridicule from outsiders.

Currently, our faction is fortunate to have top-tier geniuses like Situ Xing, and Ning Zhuo. This is a rare opportunity that we must cherish and seize.

"In my opinion, Ning Zhuo's position on any matter depends on whether he has a personal stake in it. You should consider him merely a guest elder here."

"From beginning to end, he's never participated in any decision-making on this mountain."

"Moreover, even preparing for a clash among the two of you takes time and effort. If we devote too little energy to it, we'll miss opportunities - not just at the Flying Cloud Grand Assembly, but even in the current Rising Cloud Grand Trial!"

A sharp glint flashed in Situ Xing's eyes.

Lin Jinglong was the one vehemently refusing now!

This revelation once again defied Situ Xing's expectations.

He had initially believed Lin Jinglong would support him more strongly than Shen Bu. As the third-ranked seat holder, Lin Jinglong's support should have been more unwavering.

Lin Jinglong keeps emphasizing the big picture, worrying about a mutually destructive conflict between me and Ning Zhuo...

He once clashed with Ning Zhuo himself. Does his current stance prove Ning Zhuo's combat prowess is truly formidable?

Cultivation-wise, Ning Zhuo is only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage. Why does Lin Jinglong value him so highly?

Situ Xing's expression turned cold.

He had sought support from both both of them. Shen Bu had explicitly pledged his support, but Situ Xing wasn’t fully reassured. Lin Jinglong, on the other hand, had expressed approval without committing to either side.

"It's all because of Ning Zhuo's presence, which threatens our interests!"

Situ Xing slowly shook his head, his voice low.

“Brother Jinglong, you worry too much! I have my own plans; how could I be careless? Ning Zhuo is extraordinary, and I’m genuinely curious."

Seeing Situ Xing's firm stance, Lin Jinglong and Shen Bu knew that further opposition would defy the established arrangement.

"In that case, Brother Shen, would you please deliver this challenge letter on our behalf?" Situ Xing handed the prepared letter to Shen Bu.

Shen Bu accepted the letter with decisive movements.

After bidding farewell to Situ Xing, Shen Bu and Lin Jinglong walked home together.

Lin Jinglong communicated telepathically, expressing his reservations: Situ Xing and Ning Zhuo are both top-tier geniuses. If they combined their strengths and worked together, I suspect they could achieve remarkable results at the Flying Cloud Grand Assembly. But when two tigers clash, one will inevitably be injured. The Myriad Manifestations Sect forbids lethal duels, yet we both know Situ Xing's temperament. Ning Zhuo's true nature, however, remains hidden. If someone dies, our current favorable situation will be ruined.

Shen Bu, you're usually so clear-headed. Why did you agree so readily?

Shen Bu smiled faintly and replied telepathically: You've already tasted defeat at Ning Zhuo's hands, haven't you?

"Were you trying to gauge Ning Zhuo's true nature?" Shen Bu asked. "We know Situ Xing inside and out, but we've only known Ning Zhuo for a short time. His declaration just now didn't really mean he was protecting an ally."

Lin Jinglong chuckled. “Shen Bu, stop testing me. I was indeed wary of Ning Zhuo before and kept my guard up. But now, look at his track record - the Confucian cultivators think highly of him, giving him top honors twice in a row, and his answers to the Three Questions of the Heart in the Demon-Slaying Hall were powerful and resolute!"

“Ning Zhuo is an upright person! A man of principle! He’ll be our most reliable ally."

“At the very least, when fighting side by side, I don’t worry about him betraying us. But Situ Xing is full of pride and likes to control everything… If huge interests were at stake, wouldn’t it be normal for him to turn his sword against us?"

Hearing Lin Jinglong’s response, Shen Bu felt reassured and said, “Since you think that way, I’ll tell you the truth."

“Situ Xing has made up his mind. If I were in his place, I’d strike now too."

“Even if we openly opposed him, we couldn’t stop him."

“And it’s not our place to stop him. There are plenty of cultivators in this world who could."

Lin Jinglong’s heart stirred. “You mean…"

Shen Bu smiled meaningfully. “My Shen family has a mortal enemy in the Pi family. Doesn’t the Situ family have one too?"

Lin Jinglong asked, “The Situ family has many enemies, but who would be the most suitable?"

Just as Shen Bu was about to share his view, a cultivator descended with an imposing aura, shouting from above, “I bear a challenge letter from Lady Zhu Fenxiang! Where is Situ Xing? Dare you accept it?!"

Lin Jinglong and Shen Bu exchanged glances in surprise.

Lin Jinglong sent a mental message, exclaiming, “The Zhu and Situ families are sworn enemies. This challenge letter concerns their family’s honor - Situ Xing will have to accept without question."

"This saves us a lot of trouble. Our luck is good, and Ning Zhuo’s luck is even better, haha."

Shen Bu fell silent, the image of Ning Zhuo’s faint smile appearing in his mind.

“Is it really… just luck?"
