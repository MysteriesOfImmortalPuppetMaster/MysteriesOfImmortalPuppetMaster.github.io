Chapter 821: "Short-sighted"

In the great hall, every move Ning Zhuo made drew the attention of the crowd.

"Every time the Hall Master holds a meeting, he races against time. But with Ning Zhuo, he shows absolute patience."

"This lad took first place again, living up to Hall Master Zhong's high hopes. Receiving such treatment isn't out of line, is it?"

"A young hero indeed! At his age, I was still walking dogs and teasing birds. Thinking back, I am truly ashamed!"

"But Hall Master Zhong publicly promised that as long as Ning Zhuo achieves three Class-A major merits in the future, he can win the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone]. Isn't that a bit excessive?"

The cultivators communicated secretly via divine sense.

Ning Zhuo's ears still rang with Zhong Dao's recent words.

"As long as I save this reward for taking first place in the second trial and accumulate more in the future, I can obtain the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone]?"

The big-headed youth couldn't help but recall the glorious scene where he had once used the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] to unleash a vast amount of awe-inspiring righteousness qi that shook the mountain gates...

"No, that is not the best choice." Ning Zhuo maintained an icy calm.

He had decided to use this reward immediately!

"I specialize in mechanical arts; my entire Dao path lies therein. Even if I rely on the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] to emit oceans of righteous qi, it would only be icing on the cake - like adding wings to a tiger."

"It is not a qualitative change!"

"Taking first place in this second trial was within everyone's expectations. But this situation is actually disadvantageous to me. Right now, I should maintain some distance from the Demon Subjugation Hall."

It was practically a foregone conclusion that Ning Zhuo would use the opportunity of the Flying Cloud Assembly to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

But he needed to find the most suitable entry point.

Was the Demon Subjugation Hall the most suitable?

"On one hand, the Demon Subjugation Hall is one of the Eight Peaks and Twelve Halls of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. It is a solid institution with real power and immense strength. The current Hall Master, Zhong Dao, even surpasses some of the Peak Masters of the Eight Peaks in terms of aptitude, combat power, and prestige."

"But on the other hand, the Demon Subjugation Hall is the sharpest blade of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. It has too many hostile cultivators, and its strained relationships are as numerous as the stars."

Everything had two sides; the option of joining the Demon Subjugation Hall had both pros and cons.

Ning Zhuo had managed his reputation in the Righteous Path very well, and he was highly valued by Zhong Dao. But Zhong Dao himself was quite domineering. While being the object of his special expectations, Ning Zhuo would inevitably lose a lot of freedom.

At the same time, joining the Demon Subjugation Hall meant inheriting the strained interpersonal relationships of the Hall, and even Zhong Dao himself.

This gave Ning Zhuo considerable hidden worries.

" Although currently, the Demon Subjugation Hall is the best choice for me."

"But... that is only currently."

"This is just the Minor Cloud Trial; the main body of the Flying Cloud Assembly hasn't even taken place yet. Why must I make a decision now?"

It was not yet time for Ning Zhuo to truly decide!

The big-headed youth preferred to reserve more possibilities, which meant he would hold the initiative.

Zhong Dao's thoughts on this matter mirrored Ning Zhuo's.

Therefore, Zhong Dao deliberately offered the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] as a reward. Upon closer inspection, it was full of intent to lure Ning Zhuo in.

If Ning Zhuo agreed to this and temporarily gave up the reward for the second trial's first place, he would be seeking the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone]. And according to Zhong Dao's conditions, Ning Zhuo would have to establish three Class-A major merits.

How did one establish merit?

Only by joining the Demon Subjugation Hall would the merits count.

"Therefore, as long as I do not resist the temptation of the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] and give up this first-place reward, it will undoubtedly be a public announcement - that I have decided to join the Demon Subjugation Hall!" Ning Zhuo was well-versed in the methods of the Righteous Path, and his mind was clear as snow.

And once he did that, his losses would be immeasurable.

If nothing else, the doors to the many upcoming Minor Cloud Tests would immediately close to Ning Zhuo.

Why would I sponsor a cultivator who is confirmed to be joining another faction within the sect?

From Zhong Dao down, the cultivators of the entire Demon Subjugation Hall were aggressive in their actions, which inevitably caused tension. Thus, beneath the glory of the Demon Subjugation Hall, there were absolutely no small number of cultivators who secretly feared it, set traps for it, or harbored hidden hostility and schemes against it.

Taking a side too early was problematic.

"Waiting for the highest bid is my optimal choice!"

In just a few breaths, Ning Zhuo completely eliminated the temptation of the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone]. His divine sense swept through the jade slip list in his hand.

The inventory list of the Demon Subjugation Hall was filled with a dazzling array of rare treasures.

Ning Zhuo saw five or six types of fire seeds that were rare on the outside just in his first sweep.

Suddenly, his heart shook, and his divine sense froze on a specific spot.

A demon cultivator whose true form was a ten-thousand-year-old jujube tree. It swallowed and spat the essence of the sun and moon, bearing a tree full of Fire Jujubes like red jade. However, it ultimately failed to cross that threshold. When the lightning tribulation fell, its thousand-year Dao fruit turned into a pile of tribulation ash.

Within the tribulation ash, only a single Fire Jujube remained.

The jujube pit contained a wisp of vitality. As long as it was planted and cultivated, the Fire Jade Jujube Tree could be reborn and begin its cultivation anew.

But the cultivator who obtained the Fire Jujube did not do this. Instead, using unique methods and the remaining Fire Jujube as the main material, they exhausted it to extract the vitality as fuel, causing a qualitative change. It transformed into a special case that was rare even among fire seeds-

Post-Calamity Survival Fire!

This fire seed contained the two forces of "Calamity" and "Life," coexisting in incomparable harmony.

Using this fire for artifact refining would make the magic treasure adept at resisting tribulation, naturally increasing the cultivator's success rate in transcending tribulation. This point alone was of immense value!

Using this fire to refine medicinal pills was specifically targeted at those with heavy injuries near death, virtually hopeless cases, helping them hang onto their lives and radiate new vitality.

It should be known that the fire seed Ning Zhuo had obtained previously had already been exhausted during the battle against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. His recent artifact refining had been done using fire seeds rented from the Artifact Refining Hall.

"This Post-Calamity Survival Fire seed is a hundred times more precious and rare than the fire seed I lost!"

"What other good things are further down?"

His divine sense continued to browse.

After just a few breaths, he paused again.

Buzhou Mountain Stone!

This was only a piece the size of a thumb, yet it weighed three jin and seven liang.

"According to the classics, Mount Buzhou was the pillar of the heavens in the immemorial era. This mountain stood between heaven and earth, containing the momentum to support the sky. Even shattered, it does not fall."

"Although Mount Buzhou collapsed, every piece of its stone will never weather or wear down. The larger the fragment of the mountain stone, the closer it is to the original, and the stronger the gravity it possesses."

Therefore, Buzhou Mountain Stone was the best suppression artifact. Used in a formation, it would produce a completely different qualitative change.

Moving Thought Wind!

This was a wisp of strange wind sealed in a purple crystal bottle, looking like a transparent silk ribbon.

It seemed insignificant, but in reality, as long as a cultivator filled it with thoughts, it could continuously derive more, becoming truly inexhaustible!

If blown out, all living things would have thoughts arise in their minds. If there were no means to suppress it, the thoughts would become extremely complex, overwhelming the divine sea and reducing the victim to madness.

Three Lights Fleeting Water!

Powerful cultivators had spent a hundred years setting up grand formations at three polar regions to collect the fading light of the sun, moon, and stars. That is: the light when the sun is about to set but hasn't set, the moon is about to rise but hasn't risen, and the stars are about to appear but haven't appeared.

The Three Lights Fleeting Water contained the secrets of time. Used in alchemy, it could greatly increase the preservation limit. Used in painting, it could capture the spirit, strength, and even the thoughts possessed during life.

Supreme Emotionless Path - Fragment!

The signature cultivation method of the ancient Emotionless Sect. Cultivated to great success, one severs the seven emotions and six desires, viewing heaven and earth as white paper and all living things as straw dogs. The cultivatable portion in the fragment: stops at the "Forgetting Objects" stage. One who forgets objects has no excess possessions outside the body and no hindrances in the heart. When achieved, one holds weapons without greed, encounters danger without fear, and sees treasure without joy.

Nine Nether Soul-Tempering Paste!

Gathered from a place where the Nine Yins converge, taking thousands of yin souls, ice-refined for twelve years, and cold-tempered for thirty-six years, finally obtaining the essence condensed into a paste.

Small Reincarnation Formation Plate!

A formation plate of the immemorial Reincarnation Sect, about seven inches in diameter. The face is engraved with the outline of the Six Paths, with blurred reincarnation patterns. Used once, the patterns on the plate fade a bit. When the patterns are gone, the plate is useless. Used seventy-three times; remaining patterns allow for about twenty-seven uses.

According to records, past cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall used this to lay formations, overcoming strong enemies across multiple major realms. There was once a Nascent Soul-level Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator who used this formation plate to inflict light injuries on a Void Refinement-level mighty figure.

Rebirth Resurrection Scroll - Incomplete.

This is a Soul Formation-level calligraphy scroll. By writing the deceased's name, birth date, date of death, and other information on this scroll, one can call the departed soul back from the underworld to briefly resurrect them!

Demon Subjugation Hall cultivators used this to call back sect seniors to slay strong enemies. They even summoned certain deities!

......

Ning Zhuo's horizons were greatly broadened!

"This is just the Demon Subjugation Hall - no, just one part of the Demon Subjugation Hall's treasury."

Treasures like the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] couldn't possibly be on this list.

"Just how profound is the foundation of the Myriad Manifestations Sect?" Ning Zhuo exclaimed repeatedly in his heart.

"Wait, what is this?!"

When he saw the final section of the list, his body suddenly shook, and his pupils constricted slightly.

He saw an item that immediately seized his attention.

"I didn't expect the Demon Subjugation Hall's treasury to actually contain a cultivation method from that mighty figure!"

"Choose it, I must choose it!"

Ning Zhuo barely suppressed this intense impulse, his divine sense sweeping through the remainder of the list.

Soon after, he slowly opened his eyes and looked up at Zhong Dao: "Lord Hall Master, I have selected an item from the list."

As soon as these words came out, the cultivators in the hall were surprised.

In the view of most people, if it were up to them, they definitely wouldn't be tempted by immediate benefits and would choose the long-term goal.

"How can Ning Zhuo be so short-sighted?"

"If I had his talent and flair, what would three Class-A major merits be? Give me enough time, and I could definitely complete them!"

"Ning Zhuo made a mistake. That is the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone]. This was a promise made by the Hall Master in a moment of excitement; if he doesn't seize this opportunity, it will be gone! The [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] is not for sale; wanting to make it one's private possession in the future will be too difficult!"

There were also a few who seemed lost in thought.

Zhong Dao stared at Ning Zhuo, a sharp light flashing in his eyes.

However, Ning Zhuo's gaze did not dodge in the slightest; he looked straight at Zhong Dao, calm and confident.

This attitude made Zhong Dao let out a laugh: "What did you choose?"

Ning Zhuo responded immediately, but used divine sense transmission: "This junior specializes in mechanism arts, and paper effigy arts share many similarities with mechanism arts. Today, I saw the legacy work of the mighty figure, the Grand Primordial Scholar. This junior could not bear the thirst for learning and had to brazenly ask for it."

"Grand Primordial Scholar, paper effigy arts..." Zhong Dao's eyes flickered, and a subtle feeling rose in his heart.

Some time ago, during the Eight Peaks meeting, he was summoned into the formation for a detailed discussion involving the White Paper Immortal City, which was precisely the handiwork of the Grand Primordial Scholar.

"Currently, the sect's progress on this matter remains slow, with difficulties in negotiation between parties."

"One of the key figures, Wen Ruanyu, is a pillar of the Confucian cultivator community. Ning Zhuo has a good relationship with the Confucian cultivators; did he understand their hints and take an interest in the Grand Primordial Scholar?"

Zhong Dao was not clear about the relationship between Ning Zhuo, Meng Yaoyin, and the White Paper Immortal City, so he could only temporarily think to this level.

He had no reason to stop him, so he agreed on the spot.

Ning Zhuo's reward for taking first place in the Demon Subjugation Hall's second trial was a classic recording a cultivation art, titled Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture!

This classic was war booty obtained by cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall after successfully hunting down a powerful demonic cultivator.

Just the title of the book made Ning Zhuo immediately think of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.

This precious ruler had given Ning Zhuo tremendous help in the battle against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. It could be said that without the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, Ning Zhuo could not have made it to the end, nor would he have had any chance to defeat the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

But Ning Zhuo's control over the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale relied solely on his identity as Vice City Lord.

"The names Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture and Great Primordial Dispersal Scale are very similar."

"The two come from the same source."

"Perhaps I can find a way to refine the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale by comprehending the Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture?"

"Even if I can't succeed, relying on the Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture, I should be able to gain a lot of understanding regarding the White Paper Immortal City!"

The Ghostly Black Marshlands and the White Paper Immortal City held immense weight in Ning Zhuo's heart!

Because the various opportunities he had accumulated already made him quite certain: the White Paper Immortal City was his place of cultivation.

The big-headed youth and Sun Lingtong had long reached a consensus - in the future, they would focus their operations there! And if Ning Zhuo could control the White Paper Immortal City, that would be even better.

Ning Zhuo left the Demon Subjugation Hall with the Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture, and news of him taking first place in the Demon Subjugation Hall's second trial spread rapidly within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

"Ning Zhuo took first place?" The public was not surprised at all.

"He had absolutely no competitive pressure."

"Even Golden Core cultivators like Gu Huaijiu and Lu Xu'an aren't Ning Zhuo's match?"

"Even if the specifications of the Demon Subjugation Hall's second trial were raised, the purpose wouldn't change. Therefore, cultivation level is not the key."

"Zhong Dao personally distributed the reward to Ning Zhuo; this has never happened in previous sessions. Ning Zhuo joining the Demon Subjugation Hall is practically set in stone!"

"I'm so envious of Ning Zhuo! With him joining the Demon Subjugation Hall, his future is bright and splendid!"

"This is a win-win. A hundred years from now, when Ning Zhuo has grown, he will inevitably be a capable general of the Demon Subjugation Hall. Having such a rising star of the Righteous Path join, the entire Demon Subjugation Hall should be very pleased."

Chen San collected these public opinions and reported them to Ning Zhuo.

Inside the azure stone cave dwelling, Ning Zhuo held this intelligence report and sighed in his heart: "Sure enough, everyone has started to see me this way. This is not good!"

His thoughts turned, and he immediately issued new orders to Chen San. He didn't propagate falsehoods, but simply had Ning Zhuo's experience in the great hall circulated truthfully.

Ning Zhuo did not temporarily give up the second trial's top prize, disregarding the possibility of obtaining the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] in the future, all for short-term gain... He believed that once the public received this intelligence, there would certainly be more reactions.

Ning Zhuo looked forward to these reactions.

Of course, he looked forward to the Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture even more.

So, after giving instructions to Chen San, he couldn't wait to open the classic.

"Hmm? It is indeed boring..."
