Chapter 635: Forgetful River Prefecture Lord vs. Ghostfire Prefecture Lord

Ning Zhuo was puzzled, sensing an unspoken meaning in Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's words, but he couldn't grasp it. Unable to understand, he immediately used his divine sense to ask.

Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin replied, "Heavenly Secrets cannot be fully revealed. Although Destiny Dao is profoundly mystical, its excessive misuse invites the wrath of heaven and earth."

"Especially certain things - if you learn of them in advance, it will inevitably provoke the heavens and earth to intervene, causing the future to drastically change course, deviating from your calculations, or even becoming their exact opposite."

"I've already given you too much guidance, Little Zhuo."

Ning Zhuo hastily said, "Mother, you know far more than I do. I won't ask anymore. Please take care of yourself!"

Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin turned and walked toward the army of Paper Persons.

This was the seventh army, incomplete and thus vulnerable, which Meng Yaoyin had exploited in her lifetime.

The Paper Persons stood silently in place, having endured countless years. Cinnabar on their thin armor had congealed into blood-like stains, and the seams of their patched-together forms exuded the scent of aged incense ash.

The infantry's long spears stood dense as a forest, while dewdrops clung to the arrowheads of the crossbowmen.

Thirty-six Divine Chariots stood motionless like coffins, their three-headed, six-armed Paper Gods holding cloud gongs and wind banners, yet appearing as rigid as clay sculptures or wooden carvings. Only the massive, thirty-three-meter-long white silk forest billowed intermittently in the yin wind.

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin stood equally still, gathering her strength.

After a dozen breaths, her lips parted as she murmured an incantation.

Mouth seal.

Simultaneously, her fingers fluttered like butterflies.

Finger seal.

Her spirit and spiritual energy poured into the formation plate, officially activating the arrangements she had prepared in life.

A faint glow spread across the vast ground.

The light rapidly intensified, becoming blinding as it flowed into each Paper Person.

This process lasted twenty breaths. The Paper Persons swelled, as if lit from within, transforming into human-shaped paper lanterns.

Finally, the Soul-Guiding Banner atop the great banner trembled violently, its seven layers of banner tails whipping like enraged serpents.

Swish, swish, swish...

The rustling of scattering paper money filled the air.

The Paper Persons' eye sockets lit up, imbuing them with vitality. Countless talismans materialized across their bodies, glowing as bright as branding irons!

As if heaven were wielding a brush, strokes of color gradually filled in the Paper Persons until they were fully rendered.

The ox cavalry stared straight ahead, their mounts exhaling thick puffs of steam as their hooves began to paw the ground.

The fluttering Paper Armor rapidly thickened, transforming into heavy iron armor.

Lances, shields, and even bows and crossbows solidified into tangible weapons.

The three Paper Gods coiled around the Divine Chariot, however, remained unchanged.

The Central Army General slowly opened his eyes, revealing a resplendent, multicolored armor that shimmered with radiant light.

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin slowly ascended, then descended onto the Divine Chariot, standing beside the Central Army General.

She beckoned to Sun Lingtong.

"Coming, coming!" Sun Lingtong hurriedly led his ox cavalry squadron to join the main army.

The next moment, this massive Paper Person army roared into motion!

Sacrificial Altar Battlefield

The Waters of the Forgetful River surged with overwhelming force, encircling and lifting the entire altar as they flowed relentlessly.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord remained hidden within the waters, unseen.

High above, Ghostfire Prefecture Lord sat cross-legged upon the Scorched Bone Lotus Throne, overlooking the churning river. Around him, nine candles, each as thick as a man's forearm, stood upright in the lotus seeds of the throne.

Only the candle directly in front of Ghostfire Prefecture Lord was burning.

"The Soul-Hooking Spirit-Guiding Candle truly lives up to its name," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord thought, healing his wounds. "It's a remarkable tool."

To inherit the position of Prefecture Lord of the Ghostfire Prefecture, one must traverse the Blazing Current Barren Land on foot and guard the Fire Soul Purgatory for eighty-one days.

This was an extremely arduous task.

As a result, there were often periods when the previous Prefecture Lord of the Ghostfire Prefecture had passed away, leaving no qualified successor. This led to the Prefecture Lord position remaining vacant, causing the Underworld Prefecture's power to wane.

These were prime opportunities for the Forgetful River Prefecture to launch a proactive attack.

However, once a Prefecture Lord ascended to the position, they were inevitably a profoundly powerful entity, having met the stringent succession requirements.

Therefore, each Prefecture Lord brought prosperity and strength to the Ghostfire Prefecture. With a Prefecture Lord in place, the Ghostfire Prefecture was invariably formidable.

The current Ghostfire Prefecture Lord was no exception.

In life, he had been a master at the Crimson Dawn Dao Sect, specializing in Fire Element cultivation methods. After death, he became a Ghost Cultivator, continuing his lifelong path of cultivation.

It's worth noting that the Crimson Dawn Dao Sect is a superpower, specializing in Fire Element cultivation methods and collecting fire seeds from across the world. Yin Jiuzhu held a significant position at the academy during his lifetime, and his ability to become a Prefecture Lord after death stemmed from his extensive accumulation of knowledge and skill in handling the Fire Element.

Although the Fire Element isn't as prevalent in the Underworld as in the Living Realm, Yin Jiuzhu carved his own path. By drawing upon the resources of his entire prefecture and mobilizing all his power to gather materials, he achieved a breakthrough. He developed nine distinct types of Strange Fire.

Since these Strange Fires hadn't yet reached the stage of Fire Seeds, he had to rely on fuel reserves. Through continuous refinement, upgrading, and adjustment of these fuels, he ultimately created the nine candles that now surround him.

This was the culmination of his lifetime's cultivation, and Yin Jiuzhu couldn't help but feel proud. Thus, he abandoned his original name and adopted this near-moniker: Soul-Hooking Spirit-Guiding Candle!

Once lit, this candle ignites Strange Fire, forcibly drawing the souls of nearby living beings into its flames to be burned as fuel. When Yin Jiuzhu fully activates it, even the soul of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord trembles within his body.

Of course, part of the reason for this was that the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had expended considerable energy in his previous two battles.

If the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was already weakened, his subordinates outside the sacrificial altar were even worse off. They had already lost more than half their number, and now only one Nascent Soul and fewer than ten thousand Imperial Guards remained.

The Imperial Guard, in particular, had been painstakingly cultivated by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord over centuries. He had continuously culled the ranks, training them into an elite force loyal only to him - a bitter fruit of over a hundred years of painstaking effort!

Such losses were catastrophic.

Therefore, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord summoned a small branch of the Forgetful River. It not only surrounded the sacrificial altar but also contained the power of the Soul-Hooking Spirit-Guiding Candle, absorbing most of its energy to protect his remaining subordinates outside the altar's vortex.

Yin Jiuzhu sat cross-legged upon the Scorched Bone Lotus Throne, looking down below with hidden trepidation, reluctant to enter the river himself.

The Forgetful River was no ordinary river; most living beings would lose their memories and emotions upon immersion, and in severe cases, their very souls could be corrupted.

Only the current Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, relying on his unique innate talent, could frequently and extensively traverse the Forgetful River - and even utilize it to such an extent.

Witnessing this scene only strengthened Ghostfire Prefecture Lord's resolve.

"He already possesses such innate talent. If he succeeds, he'll become truly terrifying."

"I must absolutely prevent the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's scheme!"

Although Ghostfire Prefecture Lord still didn't know the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's ultimate goal, it didn't hinder his determination to thwart him.

Ever since the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's grand move, Ghostfire Prefecture Lord had sensed danger, as if facing a formidable enemy. He consulted a renowned diviner skilled in mathematical divination.

The divination result horrified even Ghostfire Prefecture Lord: if the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord succeeded, he would lie dormant for years before his power skyrocketed to unimaginable heights. Ultimately, he would mobilize the entire Forgetful River Prefecture, launching a campaign to conquer surrounding realms and swallow up the Ghostfire Prefecture and other factions.

Moreover, he would extend his reach into the Living Realm, seize the White Paper Immortal City, infiltrate the Ghostly Black Marshlands, and establish a Ghost-Human Kingdom spanning both the yin and yang realms!

A cold glint flashed in Ghostfire Prefecture Lord's eyes as he channeled spiritual energy and lit the second candle.

The Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle blazed to life!

It wasn't a traditional candle shape, but rather a miniature ice coffin the size of a palm, crystalline and translucent, radiating a biting chill. A small hole at the center of the coffin lid housed an icy wick.

A Strange Fire ignited at the wick's core.

This fire, no larger than a soybean and icy blue in hue, burned steadily without the flicker or sway of ordinary flames, like a frozen crystal.

The icy blue glow pierced through the air, illuminating the flowing barrier formed by the Branch of the Forgetful River.

The ice spread like a plague, its madness unchecked.

Waves that had roiled like enraged dragons just moments before froze into static ice sculptures, preserving their ferocious, crashing forms.

Wherever the ice advanced, the very space itself groaned under the strain, crystallizing into intricate patterns of pale blue frost.

Hidden within the Branch of the Forgetful River, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord suddenly felt an overwhelming, bone-chilling cold enveloping him from all sides.

The Prefecture Lord found himself trapped in a dilemma.

"If I emerge, I'll be exposed to the Soul-Hooking Spirit-Guiding Candle's light, and my soul will be drawn out of my body."

"If I remain here, I'll likely become a permanent prisoner of the Forgetful River's icy realm."

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's thoughts raced like lightning as he immediately conceived a solution.

In the next instant, a figure burst through the air, charging directly toward Ghostfire Prefecture Lord, who hovered in mid-air.

Ghostfire Prefecture Lord focused his gaze and saw that his enemy was a giant.

Standing nine meters tall, the behemoth was pitch-black, his rugged, knotted muscles resembling a dried-up, cracked riverbed. Beneath his skin, dark red blood vessels flowed like molten lava.

Countless pitch-black holes dotted the giant's head, emitting streams of black smoke.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's divine aspect - the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God!

Breathing Yin Qi, with Earth Lung Turbid Qi as his blood and ancient Sinking Iron as his bones, his defenses were as immovable as mountains, and his power was immense!

While the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form primarily cultivated Water Element Yin techniques, the painstakingly trained divine aspect he unleashed was intimately connected to the Earth Element.

Regardless of his reasoning, the Turbid Filth God's appearance immediately broke the deadlock.

His steel-like fists whistled through the air, shattering the icebergs and crushing them back into flowing water, restoring them as a branch of the Forgetful River.

The fist's aura swept across the battlefield, shattering the frozen space. Countless wisps of icy frost patterns were obliterated in a brutal display of destructive force.

Seizing the momentum, the Turbid Filth God pressed his attack toward Yin Jiuzhu.

Enraged by the insult, Yin Jiuzhu let out a cold snort and violently activated the third candle.

The Heart-Rending Bloodshed Candle ignited with a faint glow.

This candle was dark crimson, resembling congealed, tainted blood. Its uneven surface pulsed rhythmically, expanding and contracting like a beating heart. Its wick was a slender, black bone needle, still oozing blood.

As it burned, the flame remained a dark crimson, burning silently.

Wherever the Strange Fire illuminated, all living creatures suffered excruciating heart pain, continuously losing their lifeblood.

Though the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's divine body was not composed of flesh and blood, it was still affected.

The highly compressed Earth Lung Turbid Qi within its body - viscous as quicksilver and shimmering with Earth Element spiritual light - was now drained from every part of the Turbid Filth God's form, rapidly staining its entire being crimson.

"Ugh... roar!" The Turbid Filth God let out a pained roar, its expression contorted. Its forward momentum halted abruptly, its massive form staggering to one knee.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was deeply shaken. "It seems Ghostfire Prefecture Lord's candle has transcended the conventional concept of blood. Any substance analogous to blood is now vulnerable to this curse, draining endlessly."

What caused such agony to the Turbid Filth God wasn't just the Heart-Rending Bloodshed Candle; the combined glow of the Soul-Hooking Spirit-Guiding Candle and the Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle also played a part.

This formidable Divided Self, under the combined radiance of the three candles, suffered a devastating blow.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had to act swiftly to save his Divided Self.

He took a deep breath and uttered an incantation: "Earth Lung Breath, Turbid Waves Overwhelming the Heavens! Activate!"

His arms spread wide, his aura surged wildly around him. He disregarded the risk of revealing his True Form's precise location, focusing solely on unleashing the full power of the technique in this critical moment.

In the next instant, a thunderous roar shook heaven and earth, reverberating across the battlefield.

The Formation roared to life, propelling hundreds of towering pillars of qi skyward. Each pillar was as thick as a giant python, viscous like petroleum, and reeking of foul, polluted stench - the Earth Lung Turbid Qi, accumulated over countless eons deep within the Underworld's earth.

This Turbid Qi could corrupt magic treasures, obscuring their spiritual energy, but to the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, it was a priceless treasure, the most suitable Medicinal Pill for him.

One of these pillars of Turbid Qi, serpent-like in its surging motion, poured into the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's body, immediately accelerating his recovery.

In the next moment, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God stood tall and proud, even more vigorous than before!

But that wasn't all. The intertwining pillars of Turbid Qi formed a dense, churning canopy that blanketed the entire battlefield - a Turbid Qi Sky Veil!

The moment Yin Jiuzhu entered the battlefield, he felt his breathing grow labored. An invisible pressure enveloped him from all sides, making every movement feel like wading through mud. Even mobilizing his spiritual energy became arduous.

He didn't dare lower his guard and immediately took countermeasures.

First, he activated the Yin Crow Ghost Eye Candle to observe the battlefield. Simultaneously, he unleashed a ghost technique aimed at the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

A massive bone hand shot forth with incredible speed, grasping the Turbid Filth God's arm. The bone hand instantly ignited with a ghastly, phosphorus fire, its pale green flames burning so fiercely that the Turbid Filth God roared again. The once-impenetrable Sinking Iron body softened and collapsed under the flames, billowing thick, toxic green smoke. The bone hand's fingers, like hot knives slicing through butter, sank deep into the Turbid Filth God's arm.

With the Turbid Filth God immobilized, Yin Jiuzhu's second ghost technique pierced its body. Thin, dark purple flames, as fine as hair, twisted and bored through the divine flesh like countless venomous snakes. The Turbid Filth God's organs ruptured, its dark red veins pulsating with crimson light as violent tremors shook its entire body from the agony.

After brewing his third ghost technique, Yin Jiuzhu summoned nine three-legged silver crows in mid-air. These crows, wreathed in Ghostfire, crashed into the Turbid Filth God's chest in rapid succession, exploding on impact.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Nine explosions in quick succession blasted a gaping hole in the Turbid Filth God's chest, leaving only a thin layer of skin connecting it to the back.
