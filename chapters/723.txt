Chapter 723: What Do You Know About Soul-Searching Techniques?

"Boss, help me!" Ning Zhuo transmitted the message through Life Hanging by a Thread.

"I'm coming," Sun Lingtong replied. He had been hiding within the Jade Cleansing Pavilion, diligently studying the Water Vortex Formation, exerting every effort to seize the Luo Shu Page as quickly as possible.

Without hesitation, he responded to Ning Zhuo's plea, activating his Innate Talent to pierce through the Formation and glimpse the Luo Shu Page's True Form.

Despite having witnessed it countless times, Sun Lingtong couldn't help but marvel at the Dao Artifact's power: "What an immensely powerful Dao Artifact!"

Through Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo's expression shifted slightly as he sensed himself falling under the Luo Shu Page's influence as well.

The Bitter Ink had been ground to perfection.

The Jade Slip containing the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique lay horizontally on the desk.

Beneath the Jade Slip, a sheet of Xuan paper lay spread out.

Ning Zhuo held the Intent Brush in his right hand and a wooden awl in his left.

A bundle of hemp rope rested beside him.

Activating his Divine Sense and channeling spiritual energy, Ning Zhuo immediately animated the hemp rope. It rose vertically, one end coiling around his hair while the other looped around a ceiling beam.

Simultaneously, the wooden awl in his hand slowly pierced into the inner side of his thigh.

Head suspended by a rope, thighs pierced by awls!

With the Luo Shu Page, Intent Brush, Bitter Ink, the head-suspending rope, the thigh-piercing awls, and the immersive Literary Wind enveloping him, Ning Zhuo formally entered his learning state.

He began to copy the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique.

This spell had been obtained from Tian Shuang. The Jade Slip was ancient, likely predating this era.

The opening section wasn't the main text but rather admonitory verses left by past sages:

"Burn their souls, cross the sea of desire, gain myriad techniques, and steal the profound secrets of creation. Yet the Soul Boat carries not only treasures but also the sinking lives of others. When the boat is consumed and the flames extinguished, neither the one who kindled the fire nor the one who scavenges the ashes remains. Burning the boat to cross souls is akin to setting oneself ablaze, offering oneself as sacrifice. Beware! Fear it! Unless you are among those who seek life through death, driven mad by obsession, do not touch this forbidden art!"

Ning Zhuo attempted to copy this passage, and his eyes lit up.

Wisps of profound meaning flowed from the tip of his brush into his divine sea.

"This Jade Slip truly is an ancient artifact, perhaps even crafted by the founder of this cultivation art?"

After all, the Soul Devouring Sect was a Super Sect with a long and storied history.

In any case, the Jade Slip contained an abundance of profound meaning, unlike the cultivation art Jade Slips Ning Zhuo had created himself, which held virtually no value for copying.

Ning Zhuo began studying the true essence of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique.

The spell was divided into four parts:

Part 1: Fundamental Roots of Calamity Fire

The opening line posed a question: "Who understands the fundamental roots of one who offers Soul Ointment to Calamity Fire, uses the Wisdom Soul to cross the Sea of Suffering, and abandons virtue to reach the shore?"

Part 2: Ghost Crossing the Sea of Suffering

Ning Zhuo meticulously copied the entire text, but one line left the deepest impression: "A thousand years of joy and sorrow are but fleeting journeys, and the ten thousand fathoms of mortal dust are waves of calamity. When the Primordial Spirit enters the boat, it plunges into the  endless illusion..."

Part 3: Returning to Truth in the Sea of Names

After copying this section, Ning Zhuo's expression grew solemn, his gaze fixed on a particular line: "Where the boat's sinews end is not the far shore, only the ashes of calamity engulfing the starry ladder."

Part 4: Five Calamities Entangling Truth

This section listed five severe consequences that could arise from practicing or using the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique:

1. Name Loss: Forgetting one's own name, then the names of others, ultimately severing all human connections.

2. Consciousness Blaze: Within the Upper Dantian of the divine sea, any divine sense that arises spontaneously combusts, burning to ashes.

Boat Marks were manifestations of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique's corrosive effects on the physical body. Some appeared as scorched marks on the forehead, while others manifested on the chest, back, or elsewhere. When these marks intertwined to form the shape of a solitary boat, the cultivator's soul would ignite, as if struck by the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique, ultimately burning to ashes.

Karma Burning, on the other hand, ignited the Red Lotus Karmic Fire, searing the cultivator. In mild cases, external flames would erupt, burning meridians and destroying networks of Qi channels. In severe cases, the five vital organs would burst into flames, reducing the cultivator to ashes from within.

Clearly, this spell violated fundamental taboos, deeply offending the natural order.

The final technique, Lost Navigation, plunged the cultivator into another's memories, trapping them beyond escape. Their sense of self would become severely distorted, shifting unpredictably and without pattern.

After studying the first passage, Ning Zhuo saw the Xuan paper filled with characters. Each stroke was carved with meticulous precision, reflecting his desperate effort to decipher the profound mysteries.

His thigh was already a bloody mess, his scalp tightened, and his vital energy was rapidly draining under the Luo Shu's influence.

Having achieved initial mastery, Ning Zhuo fully grasped the spell's terrifying power.

"Burn the soul to forge a boat, forcibly seizing creation's essence. Risking the abyss, draining another's lifetime of cultivation!"

"Magnificent! Truly magnificent!"

The spell's sheer power and extreme nature stirred Ning Zhuo's heart deeply.

After catching his breath, he began his second round of learning, once again meticulously copying each character from the beginning.

The hemp rope stretched taut, creaking under the strain, and strands of severed hair scattered across the ground.

A thin layer of blood had already pooled on the floor. The wooden awl had been moved, now piercing the other leg repeatedly.

After studying the second iteration, Ning Zhuo's understanding of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique deepened significantly.

His expression grew solemn as he began to focus on the fourth section, Five Calamities Entangling Truth.

"The Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique is too extreme."

"With my Innate True Self Talent, I can withstand Name Loss and Lost Navigation. But how will I face Consciousness Blaze, Boat Mark, and Karma Burning?"

"This requires careful consideration."

The more he studied, the more he realized the Five Calamities were no trivial matter. Underestimating them would come at a devastating cost.

"Can my Buddha-Heart Demon Seal withstand Consciousness Blaze? If my divine sense were suppressed for an extended period, that would be disastrous."

Divine sense was indispensable for cultivators!

Whether refining pills, forging artifacts, controlling mechanisms, or engaging in combat, every aspect of cultivation relied on divine sense.

"How does the Boat Mark calamity affect the physical body through the soul? This requires further investigation."

"The Red Lotus Karmic Fire is a calamity triggered by accumulated sins, often afflicting Demonic Cultivators more severely. Once the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique is activated, it incinerates souls into nothingness, a truly heinous act that drastically increases one's karmic debt."

"Therefore, selecting which souls to use for the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique requires careful consideration."

"Furthermore, can my accumulated merit offset this karmic debt?"

Five Calamities Entangling Truth...

Ning Zhuo possessed the Innate True Self Talent, which could mitigate two of the calamities. However, three remained, demanding his utmost caution.

"With some remaining energy, perhaps I can attempt a third iteration of learning."

Ning Zhuo meticulously assessed his condition. His soul felt weakened, his divine sea dimmed, and his spirit drained. His thighs were bloodied and torn, and much of his hair had been severed. Yet after some healing, he could still persevere.

In truth, the Pine Breeze Qi Nourishing Art he had previously studied contained even more content than the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique. However, learning it had been significantly easier that time.

"The Pine Breeze Qi Nourishing Art is majestic and natural, aligning with the essence of heaven and earth. Though it gathers Qi and harnesses the wind, it doesn't harm the fundamental nature of spiritual beings, resonating with my own nature."

"The Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique, on the other hand, is excessively extreme, burning souls for personal gain. It defies the natural order, living up to its origins as a Demonic Path Cultivation Art derived from the Heavenly Ghost. It clashes with my temperament."

Sigh... I'm only learning this out of necessity, Ning Zhuo lamented inwardly.

He persisted, studying the third time.

His hastily treated thigh was repeatedly pierced by wooden awl, blood pooling on the floor and pain unrelenting.

Nearly half his hair had broken off, leaving it noticeably sparse.

His divine sea gradually dried up, and the speed at which thoughts arose slowed to a crawl. His Literary Wind passively activated, rapidly depleting as it transformed into wisps of Literary Qi—the final key to Ning Zhuo's endurance.

After completing the arduous third study, Ning Zhuo's vision darkened. He braced himself against the table, stubbornly fighting off the overwhelming dizziness to avoid collapsing into unconsciousness.

The Intent Brush, its spiritual energy dimmed to its limit, rolled across the table and came to rest beside the Jade Slip.

The countless characters he had copied on the Xuan paper were now soaked through with Bitter Ink, staining the surrounding blank spaces black. Ink splattered across the table, creating a chaotic mess.

Ning Zhuo's brow furrowed deeply as he clung desperately to his final insights, refusing to yield his focus at this critical moment.

This was the culmination of his third study. If he allowed himself to fall unconscious, even if it brought temporary relief, he would lose most of his hard-earned progress.

"So, the truth behind the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique is actually nurturing material."

"By offering oneself as a sacrifice, experiencing a thousand lifetimes, one's very being will be reduced to nothingness, sinking into an endless abyss, becoming a rare soul material!"

"Using others as stepping stones, only to become stepping stone for others in the end."

"The Soul Boat is no boat at all, but a vessel for luring souls and spirits, bearing a carved copy of the True Self. Soul Crossing is no crossing, but a gravedigger's shovel, digging one's own grave!"

Having grasped the truth, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "The Calamity Fire cooks a hundred flavors of souls, only when turned to ashes does one realize they were feeding the crows."

During his first attempt at learning the technique, Ning Zhuo had only perceived its extreme power, like a razor-sharp divine weapon that could carve flesh and extract pearls without regard for the dripping blood, focusing solely on the weapon's sharpness.

In his second attempt, with a moderate understanding, he began to focus on the technique's aftereffects—the Five Calamities—and grew wary.

By his third attempt, having mastered the technique, Ning Zhuo had gained a profound understanding. He realized that this Demonic Art must have been created by someone with sinister intentions, deliberately spread to lure others into cultivating it, refining their souls into soul materials. When the time was right, the creator could effortlessly harvest these souls, reaping the benefits with ease.

Thus, the apparent flaw of this Demonic Art—the Five Calamities Entangling Truth—was not a price cultivators had to pay for seeking extreme power. Instead, it was a trap deliberately designed by the founder, centered around these very flaws, to refine the souls of others.

"Demonic Cultivators are just evil," Ning Zhuo muttered.

"You have to be so careful and scrutinize every spell before practicing it."

"Fortunately, my learning ability has greatly improved. After just three attempts, I've already achieved success and uncovered this hidden truth."

"In the future... I need to be more vigilant and avoid falling into the schemes of Demonic Cultivators so easily. This is truly insidious."

After sighing in contemplation, Ning Zhuo could no longer stay awake. He made some preparations and drifted into a deep slumber.

Safe within the Blue Stone Cave Abode and the protective Formation, he slept soundly.

When he awoke, he felt refreshed and in perfect condition.

The robust foundation of his Physical Body and Soul once again demonstrated its advantages.

Using Confucian methods, which involved self-inflicted harm for rigorous study, made healing particularly difficult. Most conventional treatments were significantly less effective, if not entirely useless.

Confucian cultivators should have corresponding healing methods, as they are within their own school.

But for an External Cultivator like Ning Zhuo, his true reliance lay in his own innate recovery abilities.

"What now?"

Ning Zhuo had been studying the Soul-Searching Technique to use against Lady Spiderweb. Ban Ji's problem didn't require immediate attention.

Putting himself in Ban Ji's shoes, Ning Zhuo knew he would give his all in the Rising Cloud Trials.

But first, Ning Zhuo needed accurate intelligence to make such a judgment. Otherwise, he would be irresponsible to himself!

Tian Shuang's collection contained numerous manuals on the Soul-Searching Technique.

After all, the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts hailed from the Soul Devouring Sect, the Demonic Sect renowned throughout the cultivation world for its profound research into souls. Soul-Searching Techniques were their specialty.

From this vast collection, Ning Zhuo chose the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique, its power undeniably the greatest!

However, after studying it for three cycles, he gained a deeper understanding and realized the technique was a trap. The founder or later disseminators had deliberately spread it to lure others into cultivating rare soul materials for them, a sinister scheme to acquire precious resources.

The plan was beautiful in theory, but in practice, countless variables always arose.

"I need to learn other Soul-Searching Techniques and see if I can refine the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique."

Ning Zhuo's study schedule had to be temporarily expanded.

He wasn't particularly confident in his ability to improve the technique, as his understanding of soul manipulation was worlds apart from his mastery of the Five Elements Realm.

Ning Zhuo relied more on his exceptional learning ability.

Tian Shuang's collection contained a dazzling array of Soul-Searching Techniques.

With unwavering patience and resilience, Ning Zhuo studied each one meticulously.

The Soul-Binding Silk Thread Technique allowed his own soul to transform into a thread, piercing through the target's acupoints like a fisherman reeling in a catch. The victim's senses became ensnared in a spiderweb, their past memories leaking out along the soul thread.

The Three Souls Spinning Wheel Technique targeted the target's Three Souls. The Taiguang soul spun into brocade threads (revealing memories), the Shuangling soul twisted into blood-red strands (exposing secrets), and the Youjing soul wove into poisonous gauze (enticing the Heart Demon). Originally a method for crafting soul materials, memory extraction was merely a byproduct.

The Spirit Embryo Planting Technique involved directly extracting one of the target's souls, nurturing it within his own dantian to transform it into a Ghost Flower. Through this flower, he could control the target, with memory retrieval being just one of its many powers.

Soul Cicada Molting, Human Candle Sacrifice, Soul Adornment Mirror Gazing, Profane Soul Sutra, Dream-Siphoning Soul Ointment, Nine Netherworld Bone-Questioning Bell, Emotion-Tethering Puppet Guidance, Heart-Corroding Ghost Fireflies, Vengeful Puppet Sympathetic Calamity...

Ning Zhuo spent several days mastering all the relevant Soul-Searching Techniques.

"I never imagined the first thing I'd truly dedicate myself to learning would be a Demonic Cultivator's Soul-Searching Technique."

Even someone as steadfast as Ning Zhuo felt utterly exhausted.

His physical body and soul both showed signs of exhaustion. The frequent cycles of intense exertion and recovery had significantly diminished their restorative capacity.

"Then I'll take a break for now," Ning Zhuo decided, understanding the importance of balance.

Despite the immense investment, Ning Zhuo's progress had been remarkable. He now had over a dozen potential directions for improving the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique.

However, limited by his current cultivation realm, Ning Zhuo couldn't clearly discern which of these paths were correct.

"Using the Luo Shu Page for simulations should allow me to quickly calculate the consequences of these dozen improvement routes."

"But doing so would undoubtedly require an enormous and unpredictable expenditure of time, energy, and resources."

"There's no rush. I have a more optimal cultivation sequence to follow."

With this thought, Ning Zhuo released Lady Spiderweb, whom he had imprisoned for days.

When Lady Spiderweb saw Ning Zhuo again, though her eyes were still blurry from confinement, she sneered haughtily, "What? Young Master Ning Zhuo has finally decided to be honest with me? Trying to trick me by claiming you're skilled in Soul-Searching Techniques?"

"Even if you were a demonic cultivator from a prestigious clan, how old are you? What level of mastery could you possibly have in Soul-Searching Techniques?"

Ning Zhuo paused, his tone and expression equally calm. "Since you insist, I'll show you the true depth of my Righteous Path foundation."
