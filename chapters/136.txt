Chapter 136: The Last Battle

"Now!" Ning Zhuo frantically activated the Blue Iron Armor, charging towards Cheng Bai without hesitation.

Cheng Bai's head was bleeding profusely, his vision darkened, and he was on the verge of fainting.

In the next moment, the Blue Iron Armor tore through the air.

Chui Xu Ke's Hanging Death Whip!

Dozens of long whips danced wildly like a swarm of pythons, lashing out frenetically.

Cheng Bai was whipped around in mid-air, unable to land for a moment.

The whips struck his body, causing bursts of golden ripples, but they couldn't break through his protective technique.

"Is it a spell, a divine ability, or a protective Magical Treasure?" Ning Zhuo's eyes were bloodshot, his heart filled with anxiety.

This was his meticulously planned counterattack.

If Cheng Bai were allowed to catch his breath, the suspense of this battle would vanish completely.

However, the Hanging Death Whip, which was usually very effective against Foundation Establishment cultivators, couldn't break Cheng Bai's defense.

Sun Lingtong urgently transmitted a message: "Little Zhuo! Cheng Bai is not a body cultivator; he commands ghostly entities, and his innate talent is the Netherworld Death Eyes. The possibility of his defense being a spell or divine ability is very small. I can see that the weakest point of the golden light is at the wound on his head, which is currently healing rapidly. The strongest point is three inches below his navel, at the location of his Essence Sea and lower dantian. Use your strongest technique!"

Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with determination as he responded, "Understood!" He pushed the Blue Iron Armor to its maximum power.

Spirit stones were consumed rapidly, transforming into immense spirit power that was channeled into two palm-sized, intricately patterned wind and thunder talismans.

The talismans each emitted wind and thunder power, intertwining through the internal formation patterns of the Blue Iron Armor, merging to form a new force.

Wind and Thunder Move!

Greenish-blue electric light coiled around the Blue Iron Armor.

In an instant, the speed of the Blue Iron Armor soared to its peak, reaching Cheng Bai in a flash.

Iron Garb Chill!

The defensive formation within the Blue Iron Armor was pushed to its full capacity, humming with power.

The formation combined the forces of metal and water elements in a perfect collaboration, emitting a piercing cold aura infused with metallic properties, enveloping the entire Blue Iron Armor, enhancing both its offense and defense to the utmost.

Azure Dragon Soars!

The back, shoulders, elbows, and wrists of the Blue Iron Armor opened up, revealing hidden explosive talismans.

The talismans ignited completely, shining with brilliant white light, propelling Ning Zhuo's attack to its extreme in an instant!

The black robe disguising Chui Xu Ke was torn apart, revealing the true form of the Blue Iron Armor, which shot out like a silver dragon, tearing through the darkness with blinding white light!

Fists like a rain of arrows, legs like a violent storm.

Fists and feet intertwined, weaving a terrifying wave of attacks, completely enveloping Cheng Bai.

Fists and feet struck the golden light shield fiercely, causing it to splinter into countless fragments of light.

Cracks gradually appeared on the golden light shield, rapidly fading and dimming.

The defensive power of the golden light quickly weakened, unable to counteract the force of the fists and feet, causing Cheng Bai inside to also suffer from the attacks.

A punch landed, twisting his head to the side, his neck contorted to the extreme.

A knee strike hit Cheng Bai's groin, bending him like a shrimp, his posture exaggerated, eyes bulging as if they would pop out, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Another punch struck Cheng Bai's chin, his teeth clamped shut, nearly biting off his tongue.

Cheng Bai's head snapped back, sending him flying higher into the air!

But in the next moment, a flash of lightning, and a silver-white agile figure suddenly appeared above Cheng Bai's head.

Ning Zhuo clasped his hands tightly, forming a fist, raised it over his shoulder, and then, driven by the Blue Iron Armor, he dove towards Cheng Bai like a meteor.

The golden light protecting Cheng Bai had weakened to near transparency.

And his head was still bleeding profusely from the spot where it had been pierced by the Peach Core of External Fate, the weakest point of the golden light shield.

Ning Zhuo's gaze was as sharp as a knife, locking onto the enemy's weakest spot.

A full-force strike!

Ning Zhuo's raised fist smashed down fiercely, like a meteor chasing the moon, its power so immense that the silver-white fist turned fiery red from the friction with the air.

At the brink of life and death, Cheng Bai finally awoke from his survival instinct!

"Meng! The Peach Core of External Fate!!" Cheng Bai's heart trembled, a chill spreading through him.

"If he used the Peach Core of External Fate, he must have already used the Sitting Mountain Observation Technique before." "Why?!"

As a true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect, Cheng Bai was sent to Fire Persimmon Mountain with preparation.

He was well aware of Meng Kui's signature divine ability, the Sitting Mountain Observation Technique, and the Peach Core of External Fate.

But Cheng Bai couldn't understand.

Why did Meng Kui suddenly use this divine ability, and in Fire Persimmon Immortal City no less!

"He's the city lord of the Immortal City, isn't he afraid that a slight mistake could cause the citizens to riot and kill each other?" "There must be something I'm not aware of that prompted Meng Kui to take such drastic action." For a moment, Cheng Bai felt deeply wronged.

His first time entering the city, he just wanted to subdue three fellow disciples, to establish a foothold for exploring the Soul Repository later.

Unexpectedly, his luck was so bad that he fell into the Sitting Mountain Observation Technique right away.

"Fate has blinded me, causing me to make mistake after mistake!"

"Why didn't I kill Sun Lingtong? There are other ways to subdue Han Ming."

"I shouldn't have pursued them so relentlessly. These two at the Foundation Establishment Stage are indeed troublesome, but there was no need to create such a commotion." According to Cheng Bai's original plan, he was supposed to lie low and act when the opportunity arose.

"Why did I keep casting spells? In the Immortal City, spells are greatly weakened, making it a thankless effort."

"I should have killed these two quickly. Using my innate talent wouldn't have mattered, but instead, I released the Yin Souls and Ghost Generals to torture and kill them, wasting too much time." "I should have used my strongest methods to kill them swiftly, settling it once and for all, avoiding prolonged troubles. In the battle, I wasted too many opportunities!" "These two have been operating in the Immortal City for too long, with various underground bases emerging one after another. If I couldn't kill them immediately, I should have retreated in time." "That Sun Lingtong has been marked by my methods, which only a Golden Core Stage cultivator can dispel. I should have let them go and waited for the right moment to hunt them down again, wouldn't that have been better?" "The most damnable is this Chui Xu Ke!"

"Layer upon layer of traps, forcing me to exhaust myself against the Immortal City Grand Formation, pushing me to use my full strength." "If not for this, Meng Kui might not have smashed me with a walnut." Cheng Bai was completely awakened by this blow.

Various thoughts flashed through his mind like lightning.

He looked up and saw Ning Zhuo's full-force strike.

"I'm going to die!" Cheng Bai's hair stood on end, filled with horror.

"I absolutely cannot let him hit the wound on my head."

However, he had no time to deploy stronger defensive measures.

He couldn't even use his protective Magical Treasure in time.

Magical Treasure—Ghost Mist Handkerchief.

In a moment of desperation, he used his divine sense to draw out a handkerchief from his storage belt.

This was a Magical Treasure he frequently used during his Qi Refining Stage and Foundation Establishment Stage, allowing him to shroud himself in ghost mist and disguise as a Yin Soul when venturing into eerie and terrifying places.

The Ghost Mist Handkerchief had been a great help to him, enabling him to successfully approach and capture some malevolent spirits.

The Ghost Mist Handkerchief had accompanied him through his difficult beginnings, accumulating bit by bit, step by step, until he finally became a true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect.

Once he advanced to the Golden Core Stage, the frequency of using this reliable Magical Treasure rapidly declined.

Cheng Bai kept it in his storage belt more as a memento.

Unexpectedly, at this moment of life and death, the only Magical Treasure he could quickly activate was this one.

Bang!

Ning Zhuo's full-force strike pierced through the ghost mist, heavily striking Cheng Bai's chest.

In that instant, the golden light shield covering Cheng Bai's body could no longer hold, shattering into countless fragments that flickered in the sky before vanishing.

Cheng Bai's chest bones broke in four or five places, his chest caved in, and his lungs and other internal organs suffered severe damage, almost being pulverized.

He fell like a meteor, crashing through a building and hitting the ground, causing a tremor.

Immediately, the building collapsed, dust rising everywhere, burying Cheng Bai.

"He’s not dead!" Sun Lingtong had been observing the battlefield, disregarding the blood tears streaming from his eyes.

Ning Zhuo's heart sank.

He gritted his teeth fiercely and once again gathered his momentum, plunging headfirst into the smoke and dust.

The Ghost Mist Veil shattered.

But it was precisely because of its cover that Ning Zhuo's attack landed on Cheng Bai's chest instead of his head, indirectly saving Cheng Bai's life.

Ning Zhuo charged forward, and Cheng Bai had more time to react than before.

He took out a Magical Treasure.

The Soul-Stirring Rattle Drum!

The drum surface was deathly pale, made from tanned human skin, faintly translucent, emitting a soft glow in the darkness.

The drum edge was carved from jet-black ink jade, exuding a chilling aura.

The drum handle was assembled from grayish-yellow adult finger bones, pieced together section by section.

Cheng Bai shook the Soul-Stirring Rattle Drum.

Dong, dong, dong.

The drumbeats were crisp, each one resonating in the hearts of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, fiercely shaking their souls.

Sun Lingtong, already severely injured, immediately bled from his seven orifices upon hearing the drumbeats.

His eyes lost their light, and he could no longer circulate his magical power, forcing him to stop.

Ning Zhuo felt the world around him sway.

His steps faltered, and he nearly collapsed to the ground.

As a result, his recharged attack was interrupted.

"Little Zhuo!" Sun Lingtong's exclamation reached Ning Zhuo's ears.

Years of tacit understanding allowed Ning Zhuo to instantly grasp Sun Lingtong's meaning—this was their final opportunity! They had to seize the chance to eliminate Cheng Bai.

If they missed this golden opportunity and allowed Cheng Bai to recover from this critical moment, they would be doomed.

Ning Zhuo was almost out of resources.

The Mechanical Constructs he had accumulated over eighteen years were nearly exhausted, with only one remaining that could still be of use.

The Tree Martial Ape!

Ning Zhuo half-knelt on the ground and released the Mechanical Ape.

To prepare for this battle, Ning Zhuo had retained the core mechanical components, replacing everything else, causing the Tree Martial Ape to undergo a massive transformation.

The new appearance bore almost no resemblance to the old one.

The Martial Ape bore a heart seal and had a staff embedded in its body.

Ning Zhuo flicked his arm, and ten fingers shot out threads of magical power, connecting to the crucial points of the Tree Martial Ape.

Under the triple command, the Tree Martial Ape charged at Cheng Bai.
