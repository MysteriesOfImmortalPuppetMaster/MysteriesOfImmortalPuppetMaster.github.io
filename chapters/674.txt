Chapter 674: Making Money

When Shen Xi and Su Lingkou found Ning Zhuo, he was at a counter in the Hall of Internal Affairs, engaged in a quiet conversation with another cultivator.

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo," Shen Xi called out softly.

Ning Zhuo turned, a faint smile erasing any lingering shadows from his recent expulsion. "Ah, Shen Xi and Su Lingkou. I didn't expect to see you both here again."

He then introduced the cultivator behind the counter: "This is Fellow Daoist Cao Gui. We've been having a delightful conversation."

"If you're looking to rent a cave dwelling, his expertise should meet your needs."

Shen Xi nodded politely to Cao Gui before turning to Ning Zhuo. "Actually, I came to see you, Fellow Daoist Ning. May I speak with you privately?"

"Oh?" Ning Zhuo raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

The three immediately left the Hall of Internal Affairs and settled under the shade of a nearby tree to talk.

Shen Xi explained that he had heard about Ning Zhuo's recent ordeal and had brought him some intelligence.

Ning Zhuo accepted the Jade Slip Shen Xi offered and scanned it with his divine sense. The information pertained entirely to Yu Heye.

He arched an eyebrow, his gaze sharpening as he scrutinized Shen Xi.

Shen Xi's actions surprised Ning Zhuo. While his previous gestures of goodwill had been within acceptable bounds, this proactive assistance suggested a hidden motive.

In the past, Ning Zhuo might have chosen to feign compliance, patiently observing while biding his time. But now, after experiencing two major national wars and the perilous adventure in White Paper Immortal City, he had unconsciously cultivated a fearless and heroic spirit within his heart.

Staring directly into Shen Xi's eyes, he asked bluntly, "Fellow Daoist Shen, we've only just met. Why are you so attentive to me and so eager to help? What are your motives?"

Shen Xi was momentarily taken aback, not expecting such directness from Ning Zhuo.

Su Lingkou, feeling offended, immediately snorted coldly. "Ning Zhuo, your attitude is utterly ungrateful! My cousin is trying to elevate you because he sees your potential, yet you dare to suspect us? Hmph, you can't possibly think we're trying to take advantage of you, do you?"

She was about to continue when Shen Xi gently patted her shoulder, silencing her.

Recovering his composure, Shen Xi looked at Ning Zhuo with genuine admiration. "Fellow Daoist Ning, you speak plainly, so I'll be equally straightforward."

He explained his intentions: first, he valued the coincidence of arriving with Ning Zhuo in the same batch; second, he noticed Ning Zhuo's companion, who appeared to be a True Inheritor from the Myriad Manifestations Sect; and third, he surmised Ning Zhuo's exceptional strength and proposed a joint venture to cooperate and prepare for the Flying Cloud Assembly.

The Flying Cloud Assembly had just begun and was not yet the grand spectacle it would become. Its original purpose was simply to concentrate the Sect's resources and have all its members collaborate to clear the backlog of Sect missions.

Ordinary super sects might not have accumulated such a massive backlog of missions. But the Myriad Manifestations Sect was different. Its scale was immense, with countless outposts scattered across the Flying Cloud Kingdom and extending its influence into neighboring nations.

White Paper Immortal City served as a prime example. The Myriad Manifestations Sect had long maintained a presence there.

When the White Paper City Lord faced the imminent threat of losing the Immortal City, she used this outpost to request aid from the Myriad Manifestations Sect. In response, the Sect dispatched powerful reinforcements, including cultivators like Meng Yaoyin and Wen Ruanyu.

The Ghostly Black Marshlands, a Yin-Tide-infested region, served as a buffer zone between two Cultivation Kingdoms. Yet the White Paper City Lord sought assistance not from the North Wind Kingdom nor the Flying Cloud Kingdom.

Requesting aid from any Cultivation Kingdom would have been a significant political statement. Aligning with the North Wind Kingdom would have risked retaliation from the Flying Cloud Kingdom, and vice versa.

This was one of the advantages of being a Super Sect.

Dealing with nations often meant navigating sensitive political fault lines, leaving one constrained and unable to act decisively. But collaborating with a Super Sect like the Myriad Manifestations Sect was an entirely different matter.

The influence of Super Sects extended across numerous Cultivation Kingdoms.

Some Cultivation Kingdoms even sought to establish Super Sect outposts within their borders. This not only enhanced their national strength but also facilitated resource extraction and spurred regional development.

Furthermore, Super Sects served as bridges for Cultivation Kingdoms to forge clandestine alliances, shift allegiances, resolve conflicts, and forge strategic partnerships.

In terms of raw combat power, Cultivation Kingdoms naturally reigned supreme. Their organizational structure centralized national, governmental, and military might, enabling highly efficient resource mobilization. This allowed them to transcend cultivation levels collectively, harness the power of heaven and earth, manipulate Qi Luck, and command the might of ghosts and deities.

This was the golden age of Cultivation!

Super Sects, alliances, clans, and other organizations filled the Void between Cultivation Kingdoms, collectively shaping the stable Cultivation society that had emerged from centuries of strategic maneuvering.

Su Lingkou explained, "We've joined forces with two other Heavenly Prides to establish our own faction. Cousin recommended you, but your previous withdrawal from the Stone Spring Cave Residence has left one of the Heavenly Prides deeply dissatisfied."

Shen Xi clarified, "These 'factions' are merely customary practices within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, not formal regulations. They weren't included in the intelligence we jointly purchased."

"It's generally understood that only a force capable of controlling an entire mountain, ensuring all cave dwellings on that peak belong to their faction, can be considered truly established, qualified to compete, and worthy of allegiance."

"Looking at it another way, the Eight Main Peaks operate on the same principle."

Ning Zhuo smiled. "I see."

Previously, he hadn't grasped the true meaning behind "joint tenancy." But after his conversation with Cao Gui this morning, he understood that it wasn't about co-leasing a single cave dwelling or renting multiple ones to pool resources, share expenses, and compensate for each other's weaknesses.

After all, each cave dwelling had its own advantages. Some were rich in spiritual energy, while others possessed geothermal vents suitable for alchemy and Qi Refining.

Ning Zhuo sensed Shen Xi's goodwill.

Shen Xi's "joint tenancy" was actually an invitation for Ning Zhuo to team up, forming a temporary alliance to face the Flying Cloud Assembly together.

This piqued Ning Zhuo's interest.

His journey down Fire Persimmon Mountain and into the world was meant to broaden his horizons - to see more, hear more, experience more, and engage in discussions and exchanges with others.

Collaborating with Shen Xi on the same mountain, exchanging ideas and insights, could be quite beneficial.

But not now, Ning Zhuo thought to himself.

Even if he had understood the underlying meaning earlier, Ning Zhuo would have chosen to defer for the time being.

Firstly, his most urgent priority was securing Meng Yaoyin's inheritance. Who knew when the Great Serpent Scythe might act up again?

Secondly, he needed to assess Shen Xi's suitability for collaboration and exchange. Many opportunities that appeared promising on the surface were actually traps. Ning Zhuo had witnessed countless such cases throughout his life.

After all, he had assisted Sun Lingtong in establishing their small empire - long-term control of the Black Market in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. The myriad events within the Black Market had profoundly enriched Ning Zhuo's life experience.

Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in a fist salute. "Fellow Daoist Shen's sincere goodwill is deeply appreciated. Learning from a Heavenly Pride like you would undoubtedly be beneficial."

Su Lingkou finally seemed satisfied with Ning Zhuo's attitude, letting out a cold snort. "Good that you understand."

"But for now, you must deal with Yu Heye."

"Your initial hesitation has greatly angered Situ Xing. Now that we've provided you with detailed intelligence, you must show some resolve - at least demonstrate your courage."

"If you still shrink back, you'll disappoint us greatly."

A sharp glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes.

From Su Lingkou's words, Ning Zhuo sensed Situ Xing's domineering nature and understood Shen Xi's motive for recruiting him: to strengthen his own faction and gain an advantage in the internal power struggles within the sect.

He didn't object to this at all.

"Being used proves my value. In this world, it's all about you using me, me using you - everyone using each other."

Ning Zhuo retrieved another Jade Slip from his Storage Belt and handed it to Shen Xi.

Shen Xi examined it and found that its contents were nearly identical to the one he had given Ning Zhuo - intelligence on Yu Heye.

Shen Xi was both surprised and delighted. "So, Fellow Daoist Ning had already planned his counterattack!"

Ning Zhuo sighed. "As a newcomer, I was wary of Yu Heye's connections. Opposing him rashly would have been unwise. So, I first investigated his background."

Su Lingkou chuckled. "Rest assured, he has never been recognized as a Golden Core True Inheritance Disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Clearly, he lacks any significant connections."

"In fact, he primarily cultivates the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art and once accidentally killed the beloved disciple of a high-ranking elder from Heavy Array Peak. He's hardly favored."

This information was already listed in the intelligence report.

Ning Zhuo sighed again. "To be honest, even knowing all this, I still hesitated to confront him. What's the point?"

"The opponent is a Peak Golden Core cultivator, and he even gave me ten mid-grade spirit stones."

"All I had to do was spend a little time moving to a new cave dwelling."

Shen Xi: "Now that Fellow Daoist Ning knows our intentions, what are your plans?"

Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in a respectful bow. "It's an honor to have earned Fellow Daoist Shen's high regard. Naturally, I intend to regain some face and seize opportunities for further sparring and exchange with you."

Su Lingkou: "So, what do you plan to do?"

Ning Zhuo: "Allow me some time to consider."

He adopted a thoughtful expression before saying, "Perhaps I'll need to trouble Fellow Daoist Shen for another favor."

Shen Xi: "Oh? Feel free to speak."

Ning Zhuo smiled. "I would like to borrow a sum of spirit stones from you."

"Borrow money?" Su Lingkou immediately grew wary.

"How much?" Shen Xi asked.

Ning Zhuo rubbed his fingers together. "I'm not sure exactly, but... the more, the better."

Su Lingkou frowned. "Spirit stones aren't something to lend casually. At least tell us what you need them for."

Ning Zhuo turned to Shen Xi, his expression solemn. "How I intend to use them, however, I must keep secret for now. What do you say, Fellow Daoist Shen?"

Shen Xi's heart stirred. He realized this was Ning Zhuo testing him.

Friends choose each other.

Ning Zhuo's attitude secretly raised Shen Xi's estimation of him. Though hesitant, the testing glint in Ning Zhuo's eyes suddenly spurred him to action.

Shen Xi gritted his teeth and pulled a storage belt woven from gold coins from his robes. "Use these spirit stones as you see fit!"

He tossed the belt to Ning Zhuo, while Su Lingkou's eyes widened in shock.

Ning Zhuo probed the belt with his divine sense, finding it filled with approximately three thousand mid-grade spirit stones.

"I wonder if this will be enough," Ning Zhuo muttered deliberately, weighing the belt in his hand.

The corner of Shen Xi's eye twitched.

Su Lingkou sent him a frantic divine sense message: "Cousin, how could you just give him the spirit stones Mother gave you? That's practically your entire fortune!"

Regret already gnawed at Shen Xi, but as a scion of a prominent family, he couldn't retract his offer so soon. He could only reassure his cousin through divine sense.

Ning Zhuo remained unmoved.

The funds he had invested in establishing the Qing-Jiao Army far exceeded the contents of this belt. Back then, he had committed without hesitation. Now, this paltry sum barely registered in his mind.

He turned to face the counter, looking at Cao Gui, the cultivator behind it. "Please purchase all the cultivators who have suffered the same fate as me. I want to investigate their current situations."

"As you can see, I have ample funds," Ning Zhuo added, deliberately waving the gold-threaded pouch in his hand.

Cao Gui examined the records. "These profiles are mostly just summaries. The only information I can provide is which cave dwellings they're currently renting. For more comprehensive details, I recommend you visit the Trade Hall, submit a request in person, and give them some time to gather the information."

"Very well," Ning Zhuo nodded.

He casually withdrew a handful of mid-grade spirit stones from the pouch and placed them on the counter. "Fellow Daoist Cao, please consider my earlier proposal. This is an earnest deposit."

"If you decide not to participate, simply return the deposit."

Cao Gui stared at the pile of spirit stones on the counter, momentarily stunned.

"Wait, hold on..." he called out, reaching for Ning Zhuo.

But Ning Zhuo had already turned and left the Hall of Internal Affairs without looking back, leaving only a parting remark: "Fellow Daoist Cao, take your time to consider. There's no rush. I still need to visit the Trade Hall."

Shen Xi and Su Lingkou followed Ning Zhuo out of the Hall of Internal Affairs.

Su Lingkou, curious, pressed Ning Zhuo about what he had discussed with Cao Gui earlier.

Ning Zhuo offered no explanation. "Fellow Daoists Shen and Su, time is pressing, so I won't keep you company. I must attend to business first. Once I've made some progress, I'll seek you out to witness the results firsthand."

"After all, this money will be used for something specific, not wasted on frivolous expenses," Ning Zhuo said.

Shen Xi smiled. "Very well."

Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in a fist salute and stepped onto a cloud, soaring away.

Su Lingkou stamped her foot in frustration. "Aiya! Just like that, we let him go? With such a massive sum of money! If it were me, I'd skip the Flying Cloud Assembly and run away with the cash. The world is vast - where would we even begin to look for him if he hid?"

Shen Xi shared her concerns, but since his cousin had spoken, he couldn't voice his doubts. Instead, he suppressed his anxiety and calmly reassured her, "Let's not panic. We'll wait and see what happens next."

Ning Zhuo sent them a message that very evening, much earlier than Shen Xi had anticipated.

When Shen Xi and Su Lingkou arrived at Ning Zhuo's location, they found he had already gathered a group of cultivators.

Over twenty cultivators, mostly in the Qi Refining Stage, were present, along with at least two or three Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Ning Zhuo addressed the group, "I know you've all come to attend the Flying Cloud Assembly, but you're short on funds and can't afford to rent cave dwellings."

"Now, I'm offering you a chance to earn money."

"I'll provide the initial capital. All I ask is half of the Spirit Stones you earn in return."

Shen Xi was stunned.

Su Lingkou's eyes widened, and her jaw dropped slightly as the realization dawned on her. She suddenly realized that this might actually be a way to make money.
