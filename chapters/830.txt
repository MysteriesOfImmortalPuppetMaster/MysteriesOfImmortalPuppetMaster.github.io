Chapter 830: Sweeping the Formations

Ning Zhuo looked at the two of them, his expression calm.

He lifted his tea cup, took a light sip, then set it down and spoke slowly, "Brother Shen, Miss Su, I did not intend to deceive you."

Su Lingkou frowned and was about to speak, but Ning Zhuo continued, "Previously, my attainment in the Dao of Formations was indeed only at that level. The first time I attempted the Nine Twists Gallery, I couldn't even pass the third twist. That was my true ability, not a pretense."

He paused, his gaze sincere. "But in the past few days, I obtained a fortuitous opportunity. My formation realm advanced by leaps and bounds, leading to today's achievement."

"It was truly just luck!"

Su Lingkou’s frown deepened.

An opportunity?

What kind of opportunity could allow a person to jump from failing the third twist to becoming the top ranker capable of breaking the ninth twist in just a few short days?!

She wanted to press for details, but the words reached her lips and were swallowed back down.

Involving another person's fortuitous opportunity... forcing a question on this topic would be too impolite.

She came from a prominent family and had been groomed since childhood. Her upbringing made her voluntarily shut her mouth.

Su Lingkou looked toward her cousin, awaiting Shen Xi’s judgment.

Shen Xi sat there, his expression calm. He did not question, did not press, nor did he hesitate in the slightest.

He simply nodded directly. "So that is the case! Congratulations, Brother Ning."

Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned, and immediately, a wave of warmth surged in his heart.

Shen Xi’s trust was unreserved, saving him the effort of many explanations.

"Many thanks for your understanding, Brother Shen," Ning Zhuo said sincerely.

Shen Xi lifted his wine cup and toasted Ning Zhuo. "Come, a toast to Brother Ning’s joy in taking first place."

Ning Zhuo hurriedly raised his cup, and the two drank together.

Su Lingkou watched from the side, feeling a mix of complex emotions. She wanted to say something, but her cousin had already stated his stance; anything she said now would be superfluous.

She could only lift her wine cup and drink silently.

After three rounds of wine, Ning Zhuo took the initiative to bring up the Nine Twists Gallery Formation.

The two focused their discussion on the eighth and ninth twists.

Ning Zhuo explained in detail, and Shen Xi listened earnestly. When reaching critical points, Ning Zhuo would even use his hand to outline formation diagrams in the air to aid his explanation.

Su Lingkou listened quietly from the side and gradually became engrossed as well.

By the time Ning Zhuo finished his explanation, Shen Xi was shaken to the core. He was now certain that Ning Zhuo’s attainment in the Dao of Formations absolutely surpassed his own!

Meanwhile, Su Lingkou had fallen into a deep silence.

The banquet dispersed.

Shen Xi and Ning Zhuo bid farewell at the entrance of the restaurant.

Shen Xi thanked Ning Zhuo, his tone earnest. "Brother Ning, I benefited greatly today. If there is an opportunity another day, I must ask for your guidance again."

Ning Zhuo cupped his fists. "Brother Shen is too polite. We are merely exchanging ideas and learning from one another; there is no need to speak of asking for guidance."

These words were very similar to what was said earlier inside the Nine Twists Peak. However, subtly, the roles of the two had been swapped.

The two exchanged a few more modest pleasantries before parting ways.

On the way back, Shen Xi remained silent the entire time.

Moonlight flowed like water, passing through the window lattice of the bronze flying carriage and shining upon Shen Xi’s face.

Su Lingkou sat beside her cousin. Several times she wanted to speak, but she didn't know what to say.

She had never seen her cousin like this.

In her heart, her cousin had always been the high-spirited, calm, and confident genius of the Shen family. No matter what difficulties he encountered, he could handle them with composure; no matter what opponent he faced, he could deal with them calmly.

But at this moment, her cousin's silence made her panic.

"Cousin..." she called out softly.

Shen Xi did not react.

"Cousin?"

Shen Xi still did not react.

Su Lingkou reached out and tugged at his sleeve.

Only then did Shen Xi snap back to reality and look at her. "What is it?"

Su Lingkou looked at him. Under the moonlight, she saw that her cousin's expression seemed somewhat lost and despondent.

Her heart clenched, and she quickly offered gentle comfort, "Cousin, the failure of this battle does not lie with you. There is a huge problem with Ning Zhuo; he is very likely cheating!"

Shen Xi frowned slightly.

Su Lingkou continued her analysis. "Don't let his smooth talking fool you; perhaps there is an expert behind the scenes guiding him."

"Why did he happen to have a major fortuitous opportunity right now? He didn't clarify what that opportunity was at all - that is simply a guilty conscience. He most likely cheated!"

Shen Xi shook his head. "In the Cultivation World, methods are complex and endless. It is very possible that there are paths allowing one to advance their cultivation realm in a specific area by leaps and bounds within a few days, achieving a massive jump. For example... True Intent!"

Su Lingkou scoffed coldly. "An opportunity like True Intent is so rare! I really don't believe such an opportunity would coincidentally land on Ning Zhuo. The key is that the timing is too coincidental, happening right at this critical moment."

She paused, then added, "Furthermore, even if it is True Intent, it would at most raise his realm. The formation-breaking methods Ning Zhuo just expounded upon were skilled and seasoned; that is not something True Intent can improve. One must have abundant practical experience."

Shen Xi fell into silence.

He naturally knew his cousin spoke with reason.

True Intent could raise one's realm, but it could not raise one's experience. The details Ning Zhuo just explained, those thoughts on adapting to the situation, those grasps of the subtle points of the formations - they indeed required a massive accumulation of practice.

But where did Ning Zhuo get his practical experience?

Based on Shen Xi’s knowledge, he could think of True Intent, but he could not guess the existence of the Innate Talent: True Self.

This Innate Talent could effectively utilize the experience of others without losing oneself!

Master-level Formation Path True Intent, the Innate Talent: True Self, and the three waves of Demonic Souls - these three opportunities stacked together were what caused Ning Zhuo’s inconceivable progress in the Dao of Formations!

"Cousin, I think Ning Zhuo cheating is the highest probability. He deliberately asked us for advice and deliberately discussed the methods for breaking the eighth and ninth twists just to cover up this truth and silence us in advance."

Shen Xi remained silent.

The bronze carriage flew for another stretch of the journey before Shen Xi suddenly spoke, "Compared to opportunities or cheating, I actually believe that Ning Zhuo possessed this level of formation attainment all along. It is only now that he has chosen to reveal it."

Su Lingkou shook her head. "Ning Zhuo and you, Cousin, are of the same generation. He mainly cultivates Mechanism Art; how could he have the spare time and energy to put effort into the Dao of Formations?"

In her perception, Shen Xi had been a first-rate genius since childhood. Peers stronger than Shen Xi in the vast Flying Cloud Kingdom could be counted on one's fingers!

Su Lingkou insisted, "Cousin, I have witnessed with my own eyes since childhood how much hard work you put into the Dao of Formations. For you to have today's formation attainment, how much bitterness have you eaten, how much pain have you endured! It is impossible for Ning Zhuo to catch up to you in just a few days!"

"If he is truly that formidable in the Dao of Formations as well, then he is an old monster pretending to be young."

Shen Xi replied, "That probability is very low. Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang both value him; they must have investigated and confirmed Ning Zhuo’s real age. Even if they haven't... Ning Zhuo will definitely exchange for a higher-grade identity token later on. He must register more information. And his real age is one of those items."

"If he deliberately concealed his age to gain the favor of various big shots by pretending to be young, once exposed in the future, he would certainly be loathed and mocked, despised by others. He would also offend powerful figures like Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang due to the deception."

"That would be too unwise. Ning Zhuo would absolutely not make such a mistake."

Shen Xi had observed Ning Zhuo for a long time and had extreme confidence in Ning Zhuo’s intellect and strategy.

Shen Xi continued, "Compared to opportunities or cheating, I actually believe that Ning Zhuo possessed this level of formation attainment all along. It is only now that he chose to reveal it."

"If Ning Zhuo wanted to cheat, the wisest move would be to display his true strength from the very beginning. There was no need to stop at the third twist during the first trial and then reveal his true talent later. Wouldn't that arouse even more suspicion?"

Su Lingkou fell silent.

Shen Xi spoke no more either.

The moonlight could not thoroughly illuminate the interior of the carriage; the majority of the shadows left behind were also projected into the depths of Shen Xi’s heart.

In his mind, the impression of Ning Zhuo as a scheming, deep thinker became involuntarily more profound.

-----

The next day.

Ning Zhuo came to Nine Twists Peak again, publicly accepted the first-place reward, and at the same time politely declined the recruitment of Nine Twists Peak.

For him, Nine Twists Peak was not the best entry point.

Under the gaze of many eyes, Ning Zhuo left Nine Twists Peak and went straight to the Earth Fire Valley.

There was an Earth Fire Abundant Field Formation here.

This formation was built relying on an Earth Fire spiritual vein. Within the formation, ridges of fields crisscrossed, and buried beneath every ridge was Earth Fire essence. Those entering the formation needed to use the power of the formation to guide the Earth Fire within twelve hours, transforming a piece of barren wasteland into a spiritual field.

It sounded simple, but doing it was extremely difficult.

Because Earth Fire was violent and hard to tame; the slightest carelessness would draw fire upon oneself. Furthermore, transforming the spiritual field required precise control of the heat - too much would result in scorched earth, too little would be ineffective.

"The Earth Fire Abundant Field Formation... tests the control over Fire Element power. The cultivator must coordinate the relationship between the formation and the earth vein, and ideally, possess agricultural skills as well."

Agriculture was also one of the hundred arts of cultivation.

As soon as Ning Zhuo appeared, he obtained the qualifications to participate.

He soon stepped into the formation.

Scorching heat continuously transmitted from beneath his feet. Deep underground, flames roared and surged, ready to erupt at any moment.

Ning Zhuo was in no rush to act. He closed his eyes, his divine sense probing deep underground to perceive the flow patterns of the Earth Fire.

After the time it takes to burn a stick of incense, he opened his eyes.

He had figured out the general situation.

He took out a formation plate and began to lay the formation.

The first layer of the array guided the Earth Fire out from underground to designated positions.

The second layer of the array split the violent Earth Fire into dozens of thin streams to avoid a concentrated eruption.

The third layer of the array precisely regulated the temperature of each stream of Earth Fire, stabilizing it within a suitable range.

The fourth layer of the array converted the power of the Earth Fire into the nutrients needed for the spiritual field, seeping it into the soil.

The four layers of arrays were interlinked, operating in succession, maintained together.

A muffled sound came from underground, followed by countless tongues of fire spewing out. However, as soon as they broke the surface, they were restrained by the formation, immediately splitting into dozens of thin streams flowing along the veins of the array.

Wherever they passed, the barren land began to change.

The originally dry and cracked soil became moist, and the barren color turned dark. Wisps of steam rose from the dead ground - that was vitality, and also a sign that the spiritual field was about to take shape.

An hour later, the flames gradually subsided.

Before Ning Zhuo appeared a neat and orderly spiritual field. The soil in the field was shiny black, containing rich spiritual energy; grabbing a handful, one could feel that warm power.

The cultivators presiding over the trial immediately gathered around to conduct an objective and thorough evaluation.

Moments later, a Golden Core cultivator actively walked up to Ning Zhuo, his face full of praise: "As expected of Ning Zhuo! Your grasp of the heat was actually this outstanding, so precise that even I feel amazed."

"Your current score is tentatively ranked first. If no one surpasses you later, once the time is up, you will be the top ranker of this session."

Ning Zhuo nodded and rose to take his leave.

One day later, Ning Zhuo was at Frost Peak.

Here, ice and snow covered the land year-round, and the temperature was so low that even spiritual energy would be frozen. The formation used Ten-Thousand-Year Profound Ice as a foundation, creating a frozen world.

Participating cultivators needed to find the "Ice Heart" at the core of the formation within three hours and refine it.

The instant Ning Zhuo entered the formation, he felt a bone-piercing chill.

This chill was not ordinary coldness, but the cold of Profound Ice that could penetrate spiritual energy and erode divine sense.

A layer of white frost instantly formed on Ning Zhuo’s eyebrows, and even breathing became difficult.

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, circulating the Five Elements spiritual energy within his body, solely mobilizing the spiritual energy from his middle dantian to resist the invasion of the chill.

Ning Zhuo closed his eyes, spreading his divine sense with full force. At the same time, countless treasure mirrors flew out, causing the range of his divine sense reconnaissance to skyrocket.

One hundred zhang, three hundred zhang, five hundred zhang...

In the boundless ice and snow, a single Ice Heart was imperceptible, like searching for a needle in the ocean.

It wasn't until he approached the final time limit that Ning Zhuo’s formation intuition provided assistance once again. After using several formation-breaking treasures in rotation, he successfully fished out the Ice Heart.

The Peak Master personally said to Ning Zhuo, "My trial allows only one attempt. With your current score, you only rank third. However..."

"If you agree to join my peak, I can grant you one more chance."

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but be curious. "Can the rules of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial be amended like this?"

The Peak Master smiled. "Of course, they cannot be amended arbitrarily at any time, but I have long reserved this rule for the most suitable cultivator."

Ning Zhuo came to a realization, then declined the Peak Master without hesitation.

Previously, in the Earth Fire Abundant Field Formation, Ning Zhuo could rely on his profound Fire Element realm to achieve an excellent score. But the Ice Sealed Ten Thousand Li Formation tested not only formation skills but also the Ice Element.

Even though Ning Zhuo’s Ice Element realm had recovered, it was only at the Artisan level.

After a day of rest, Ning Zhuo arrived at the Scripture Library.

He was led before an ancient painting.

In the painting, the mountains and rivers were magnificent, the state grand and vast. The sun, moon, and stars, the birds and beasts, everything was lifelike, as if they would walk out of the painting at any moment.

The Mountain and River State Map!

A Void Refinement-level supreme treasure, one of the foundations of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

Ning Zhuo entered the world within the painting.

Endless mountains and rivers. Ning Zhuo trekked continuously.

A thousand li, ten thousand li - he lost count of how many steps he had taken.

With his divine sense, intuition, various formation-breaking treasures, and the amplification from his extraordinary realms in the Earth Element and Water Element, Ning Zhuo finally stopped his steps.

An ordinary, low hill blocked his path.

He reached out his hand and pressed it against the mountain body.

Spiritual energy was slowly injected.

The mountain began to tremble.

Then, it collapsed.

In an instant, Ning Zhuo left the world within the painting and returned to the spot where he had stood previously.

Before his eyes was still the Scripture Library, and still that ancient painting.

The Scripture Library elder came before Ning Zhuo, his gaze complex. "One hour, and you have already succeeded in refining. Kid, you are the second person in nearly a hundred years to achieve such a result."

"Barring any accidents, you are the top ranker of this trial."

"But we still must wait until half a month later, when this trial reaches its time limit and completely concludes."

"Understood." Ning Zhuo nodded immediately, expressing his understanding.
