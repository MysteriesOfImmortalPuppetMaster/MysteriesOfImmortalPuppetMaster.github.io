Chapter 213: Divine Constable's Interrogation

"Speak! Why did you kill Yuan Dasheng?" Zhu Xuanji suddenly spoke, his voice as cold as iron, devoid of any warmth.

"Huh?" Ning Zhuo's face showed a look of astonishment.

"Speak!" Zhu Xuanji commanded, his voice like a thunderclap, as he unleashed a tremendous pressure, akin to an invisible mountain, suddenly pressing down on Ning Zhuo.

The pressure was so immense that Ning Zhuo, caught off guard, almost fell to his knees.

He staggered, his back inevitably bending, but he did not kneel.

Instead, he struggled to maintain his standing posture, a stubborn glint in his eyes as he looked at Zhu Xuanji.

Zhu Xuanji's eyes shone with a golden light, his gaze piercing through Ning Zhuo with unprecedented intensity.

The sharpness of his gaze made Ning Zhuo feel as if he were completely naked, standing in a frozen wasteland.

Ning Zhuo frantically channeled his peak ninth-layer magical power, injecting it into the Cloud Shadow Hidden Bud at the base of his tongue.

The Cloud Shadow Hidden Bud activated, temporarily resisting Zhu Xuanji's penetrating gaze.

But it was clear that this resistance had a time limit.

Sweat poured down Ning Zhuo's face as he gritted his teeth and spoke with difficulty, "Yes, I had personal motives."

"I wanted to do business with the Mechanical Fire Monkeys, to expand my business. The Monkey Head Gang was my biggest obstacle. Yuan Dasheng's existence blocked my financial path."

"So when I saw him gravely injured and near death during the Fire Persimmon Festival, I harbored murderous intent. I approached Fei Si and obtained a token. Using this identity token, I entered the Monkey Head Gang and convinced Yuan Er to abandon treating Yuan Dasheng. Yuan Dasheng eventually succumbed to his injuries, and I am indeed the true culprit!"

"Heh heh heh." Zhu Xuanji laughed coldly three times, "And what else?"

His questioning was like a cold blade pressed against Ning Zhuo's neck.

Ning Zhuo looked at Zhu Xuanji with shock and fear in his eyes.

Zhu Xuanji's gaze was as sharp as an eagle's, locking onto Ning Zhuo, "Don't tell me you killed Yuan Dasheng for just this one reason! Speak clearly."

"Confess and you'll be treated leniently; resist and you'll face severe consequences."

"You should understand: if you continue to hide the truth, you know what fate awaits you."

"You must know, I am a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, part of the Divine Constable Division."

"If it comes to a reckoning, your Ning family is nothing more than a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Even the Meng family is insignificant!"

Ning Zhuo was drenched in cold sweat, his face pale, his body swaying.

His mind was in turmoil, countless thoughts and questions swirling.

"What has Zhu Xuanji discovered to suddenly interrogate me?"

"What should I say? What do I need to say?"

"How much can I gamble?"

Seeing Ning Zhuo hesitate, Zhu Xuanji snorted coldly, increasing the pressure.

Ning Zhuo could no longer hold on.

Under the immense invisible pressure, he fell to one knee.

Seeing Ning Zhuo's defeated posture, Zhu Xuanji asked again, "Where is the Demonic Scripture?"

Ning Zhuo raised his head with difficulty, his confusion genuine.

He truly did not know about any Demonic Scripture!

"I don't know. What kind of Demonic Scripture is it?" Ning Zhuo immediately responded, "I've never seen any scripture, nor have I heard of any scripture."

This was the truth!

Zhu Xuanji had a strong ability to detect lies; he could distinguish between truth and falsehood.

Zhu Xuanji frowned, "If you don't have the scripture, how did you cultivate your skills? How did you collect your clan members' flesh and blood?"

Ning Zhuo quickly replied, "Sir, I'm innocent!"

"I've always been researching substitute puppets."

"Collecting clan members' flesh and blood for this purpose is quite normal. You can check my research records; they're right here."

Zhu Xuanji's gaze swept around, and the next moment, he used his spiritual power to retrieve several drawings and jade slips.

Indeed, they contained records of substitute puppet research and experiments, as well as many small directions and achievements Ning Zhuo had envisioned.

Ning Zhuo was naturally cautious.

When he declared his intention to develop substitute puppets, he had already prepared these pieces of evidence.

Zhu Xuanji examined the evidence, pondering silently.

Ning Zhuo, having reached his limit, spat out a mouthful of blood.

He let out a bitter laugh, changing his posture to sit directly on the ground.

He looked at Zhu Xuanji, gasping for breath, adopting a posture of admitting guilt and accepting punishment.

He said sorrowfully, "This day has finally come. I always knew this day would come, I just knew..."

Seeing Ning Zhuo's defeated and cooperative posture, Zhu Xuanji slightly reduced the pressure, giving Ning Zhuo some breathing space, "Are you finally willing to talk?"

But this small gesture gave Ning Zhuo a crucial piece of information.

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth in secret, deciding to take a gamble!

He swallowed hard and shook his head at Zhu Xuanji, "Divine Constable, you know the truth, and I've been exposed, but I can't say anything."

"I'm just a small figure. If I reveal the truth, I will surely die!"

"Hmm?!" Zhu Xuanji raised an eyebrow, "You still dare to resist?!"

He scrutinized Ning Zhuo from head to toe, "Ning Zhuo, you've come a long way. You should cherish it."

Ning Zhuo laughed bitterly, "Of course I knowâ€”I've come a long way, and no one understands that better than I do."

"I was born at the bottom, a marginal branch of my family, just a small figure."

"I'm like a weed growing out of the mud, rooted in filth and manure."

"I have to fight with all my might to absorb every bit of nourishment I can get, just to grow."

"Even when I learned to control the black market, I knew it was dirty, something righteous cultivators wouldn't touch."

"But what choice did I have?"

"No matter how foul the manure, if it nourishes me, I must seize it with all my strength."

At this point, Ning Zhuo looked up at Zhu Xuanji, his eyes filled with jealousy.

"Lord Zhu, you will never understand me!"

"You were born into the royal family, always superior."

"Your cultivation is at the Golden Core Stage, easily crushing me."

"Just like now, you only need to extend a foot to easily stomp me to death, like an ant on the roadside."

"But why must someone as noble as you make things difficult for me?"

"You know the truth, so why make things difficult for a small figure like me?!"

The more Ning Zhuo spoke, the more aggrieved and angry he became.

His face twisted with a terrifying look of hatred.

"I just want to live well and cultivate properly!"

"But I have no choice. At critical moments, I'm too weak, with no one to rely on. I have to do some unsavory things to gain others' support."

"I expected you to come for me. As long as you present my crimes, I will admit them."

"But if you want me to testify, to be a witness and break the case, I absolutely cannot do it."

"You might as well kill me."

"Because I'm not just one person; I have my family, my friends. I don't want to implicate them."

"I'll take responsibility for my actions alone!"

With that, Ning Zhuo showed a resolute expression, ready to face death.

Zhu Xuanji fell silent.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, which had been watching the spectacle, now looked puzzled.

It couldn't understand what Ning Zhuo was saying.

"What are you talking about?"

Though it didn't understand, it sensed something ominous.

Because Zhu Xuanji was slowly withdrawing his pressure, no longer exerting it on Ning Zhuo.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but roar, "Zhu Xuanji, what are you doing? You've already discovered him!"

"Yes, the young cultivator before you is the culprit, the one who bombed the Immortal Palace!"

However, Zhu Xuanji now looked down at Ning Zhuo with a hint of compassion in his eyes.

He was Zhu Xuanji, known as the one who sees through and brings peace.

He had always harbored great sympathy and compassion for the lower-level cultivators.

In Xuanlin City, he risked his life for a bowl of sugar water from an old village elder to investigate the corruption of the Su family.

In the capital, he boldly told the King of the Southern Bean Kingdom to curb the powerful cultivation clans and actively support talented lower-level cultivators.

He was tricked by Li Leifeng before his death, but instead of anger, he felt sorrow and willingly allowed himself to be manipulated to find the most suitable headmaster for the orphanage.

He had a natural wariness of the deeply entrenched powerful forces in the Southern Bean Kingdom.

But for the lower and middle-level cultivators, he had a deep-seated compassion.

Looking at Ning Zhuo, who was sitting on the ground, drenched in sweat and in a sorry state, Zhu Xuanji sighed, his expression showing a rare hint of emotion, "You little rascal, you're too good at scheming. Such scheming will only lead to your own demise."

"You clearly have talent, so why are you so eager for quick success?"

His tone carried a sense of disappointment.

Ning Zhuo laughed bitterly, "Sir, I only discovered my talent after entering the Immortal Palace and finding the puppet's head to be large. Only then did I realize I had potential."

Zhu Xuanji remained silent.

In his eyes, Ning Zhuo appeared even more as a pitiful and laughable figure, a victim of fate's cruelty.

"Ning Zhuo, you have talent, you're an excellent young man."

"I'll give you a chance."

"Think carefully. In three days, give me an explanation."

"Remember, the explanation you give will determine your future."

Zhu Xuanji clasped his hands behind his back, ascended into the sky, and transformed into a streak of light, flying away.

Ning Zhuo remained seated, motionless for a long time.

The noise grew closer; it was the guards near his residence rushing over.

But what use was that?

Facing Zhu Xuanji, the forces Ning Zhuo had built were like paper, utterly unreliable.

"Too weak, too weak!"

"My strength is still too weak."

Ning Zhuo clenched his fists tightly, his fingers digging deep into his flesh.

Lava Immortal Palace, main hall.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was dumbfounded!

Even as Zhu Xuanji flew away, it continued to watch, hoping he would turn back and capture Ning Zhuo.

"You're just leaving?"

"He's the culprit, the real culprit!"

"But why do I feel like you pity him?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't understand, feeling extremely frustrated.

It had wanted to see Ning Zhuo captured, but instead, it saw Ning Zhuo survive another deadly crisis.

Even the esteemed Divine Constable Zhu Xuanji had been fooled by Ning Zhuo.

"Are you really a Divine Constable?"

"You must be a fake!"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was furious.

It shifted its gaze back to Ning Zhuo, who was being helped up and comforted by many cultivators.

"He's such a good actor!"

Seeing Ning Zhuo being consoled, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit felt a chill.

"This young man is truly cunning and terrifying!"

"Is he really only sixteen?"

"Could he be a five-hundred-year-old monster reincarnated?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit grew increasingly wary of Ning Zhuo.

It warned itself that if it ever encountered this young cultivator again, it must be extremely cautious!

Extremely cautious!
