Chapter 716: Crafting the Bamboo Puppet and Obtaining Azure Wind

Inside the Mechanical Dragon, Ning Zhuo had been working tirelessly at the Mechanism Platform for nearly half a day.

He only needed to craft one final type of Vowel Reed.

According to the Primordial Reed Book, this was the "Shadow Bee Needle." When activated, it would emit an extremely brief "yi" sound, granting the Mechanical Carrier a sudden burst of speed.

All the necessary materials were laid out on the table: Thunderstruck Jade Bamboo, its color like frozen fat and veined with lightning patterns; Golden-Ringed Venom Bees, their abdomens containing fiery threads and wings shimmering with golden light; North Ice Crystal Sand, its touch as cold as stardust; and Vernal Equinox Rootless Water, stored in an Azure Jade Lotus Leaf Cup.

Ning Zhuo activated the Mechanism Platform, unleashing a sharp golden beam that split the Jade Bamboo lengthwise along its natural lightning patterns.

Instantly, the hollow interior was revealed, its walls spiraling upward and covered in intricate lightning patterns.

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but recall the Primordial Reed Book's description: "Lightning patterns guide Qi, carved by heaven and earth with thunder as their blade, forming the sonic tracks of primordial melodies."

He retrieved the North Ice Crystal Sand and poured it all into the Azure Jade Lotus Leaf Cup, thoroughly mixing it with the Vernal Equinox Rootless Water.

Following the detailed instructions in the Primordial Reed Book, Ning Zhuo channeled his Five Elements Spiritual Power to facilitate the mixing process. He alternated between the Fire, Water, and Earth Elements, demonstrating the broad applicability of this fundamental energy.

Ultimately, Ning Zhuo obtained a translucent, slightly greenish paste.

He carefully filled the Jade Bamboo wall with this paste, leaving only the final cavity empty to serve as the vibration source chamber.

"The natural sonic pathways carved by lightning within the bamboo have saved me considerable manual labor," Ning Zhuo mused, secretly admiring Qing Huangzi's ingenious material selection.

Next, he turned his attention to the Golden-Ringed Venom Bee.

As soon as the restraints were released, the bee buzzed into flight, its stinger aimed directly at Ning Zhuo's forehead!

Without flinching, Ning Zhuo channeled a surge of Wood Element spiritual energy to intercept the bee.

The stinger pierced three inches into the Wood Element energy before suddenly bursting into Poison Fire.

The Poison Fire intertwined with Azure Qi, and the bee's body rapidly disintegrated into ash, leaving only its venom-coated sonic needle hovering in mid-air, humming ominously.

Racing against time while the Poison Fire still burned, Ning Zhuo immediately proceeded to the next step.

Using the bee's needle as a stylus and the Poison Fire as ink, he pierced the ice-sand paste three millimeters deep before withdrawing. He repeated this process, creating a series of fine perforations along the surface.

Where the ice and fire clashed, a hissing sound arose, each hole varying in depth and angle.

The first hole was as wide as a grain of wheat. The seven holes in the middle section were as fine as needle tips, while the final hole pierced the cavity wall at an angle.

The Poison Fire had already been extinguished by the ice paste.

Ning Zhuo inserted the Shadow Bee Needle into the final cavity.

He bit his fingertip, letting a drop of blood fall into the cavity while channeling his spiritual energy.

A buzzing sound erupted!

Ning Zhuo flipped his palm, pressing the two halves of the bamboo joint tightly together.

The buzzing was forcibly suppressed within the cavity, reflecting repeatedly through the eight sound holes. When the ninth echo overlapped, the buzzing suddenly clarified into a single, short note, followed by complete silence.

Under Ning Zhuo's blood refinement, the Jade Bamboo fused back into a seamless whole.

He held the warm, jade-like bamboo in his palm, noticing a faint golden needlepoint emerging from its tip.

Ning Zhuo stroked the bamboo joint, then casually tossed it into the air. The joint spun in mid-air, emitting a series of short, staccato sounds: "One-one-one-one-one..."

The bamboo joint's speed surged, becoming almost a blur.

Ning Zhuo reached out and caught it again.

The lingering sound vanished instantly.

"With this, all twenty components of the Vowel Reed Mechanism are now complete."

"Next, it's time to create the Bamboo Puppets."

According to the information Qing Huangzi had disseminated, the prerequisite for participating in the second Rising Cloud Minor Trial was for cultivators to bring their own crafted Bamboo Puppets.

"But Qing Huangzi didn't specify the number of these puppets."

"Perhaps this is a deliberate test of the participating cultivators' ability to design mechanisms and analyze situations."

There were two extreme approaches.

The first extreme was to concentrate all the Vowel Reed components into a single, massive Bamboo Puppet.

The second extreme was to craft each Vowel Reed component into a separate Little Bamboo Puppet. When assembled, these puppets would form a small combat team of twenty.

Ning Zhuo didn't hesitate.

"Since I don't know the exact circumstances of the second Rising Cloud Minor Trial, a balanced approach is best."

He decided to follow his inspiration and create seven Little Bamboo Puppets, each equipped with an average of three Vowel Reeds.

Ning Zhuo stood before the Mechanism Platform, motionless.

Soon, the time it takes to brew a cup of tea had passed, and Ning Zhuo had completed his first Little Bamboo Puppet.

The third reed was meticulously crafted into the handle of a bamboo whip.

For the whip's body, Ning Zhuo used Ice Silkworm Crystal Silk, weaving it with the aid of his divine sense. The whip's surface was etched with numerous grooves, designed to generate sound through air friction.

Spiritual Energy Thread Suspension!

Ning Zhuo extended his five fingers to manipulate the whip.

Crack! The Little Bamboo Puppet snapped the whip.

The air rapidly swirled into a vortex, a brief whoosh echoing in his ears. The sound traveled down the whip's length, amplified tenfold within the hollow handle.

From there, the vibrations coursed through the puppet's arm, reaching its torso and activating the remaining two Vowel Reed components.

In the next instant, a semi-transparent sonic web erupted from the puppet's body, expanding outward to cover a ten-foot radius.

This sonic web, imbued with triple-layered power, was the Little Bamboo Puppet's trump card.

Ning Zhuo placed a piece of Profound Iron within the sonic web to test its effects.

First, the iron's descent slowed dramatically, almost halting mid-air.

Then, countless fissures crisscrossed its surface.

Finally, the iron vibrated violently before exploding with a resounding bang!

Over the next two days, Ning Zhuo completed all seven Little Bamboo Puppets, meeting Qing Huangzi's initial requirements.

"Now comes the constant practice," he muttered.

Ning Zhuo trained for another full day.

His extensive experience in manipulation allowed him to master the seven puppets quickly, achieving proficiency in no time.

"Based on my studies, I can already anticipate one aspect of Qing Huangzi's Minor Trial."

"His method of controlling the Bamboo Puppets relies primarily on musical rhythm, with Magic Thread Suspension as a secondary technique."

"To avoid being caught unprepared, I should focus on mastering musical rhythm now. Only through diligent practice can I achieve true proficiency."

Thunder Sound Peak.

Mute Pool nestled atop the mountain peak, resembling a shattered piece of ink-jade mirror dropped by a careless deity.

The pool's edge was ringed with jagged, thunderstruck rocks. Many of the dark stones had been tempered by Heavenly Fire, their surfaces now gleaming with a glazed sheen.

The pool's surface remained perpetually still, reflecting the drifting clouds and the twinkling stars, yet it swallowed all sound. Even when massive boulders crashed into its depths, only a silent ripple spread across the surface before vanishing into the abyss, as if falling into the bottomless Void Return.

At the pool's center stood a small sandbar, upon which grew a solitary Gu Qitong tree.

Its trunk, barely three spans in circumference, twisted like a dying dragon.

Resin, amber-like tears, oozed from every fissure in its bark.

The leafless tree's dense, gnarled branches formed a hollow nest within their tangled embrace.

In ordinary times, the pool lay deathly still. Mountain winds, colliding with the branches and hollow nest, were shredded into wisps by the tree's sharp, solitary aura. Frequent lightning strikes shattered into weeping gusts of Qi, while lingering Heavenly Fire tempered the surrounding rocks, creating a lonely spectacle of silent fireworks.

Only during the Flying Cloud Assembly did this place come alive.

The Formation on Thunderstrike Peak would activate, shielding the area from the descending thunderbolts.

A large number of cultivators had gathered by the Mute Pool, eagerly awaiting Gu Qitong's Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

As Ning Zhuo arrived, Gu Qitong stirred slightly in the wind, preparing to begin transmitting the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual.

The assembled cultivators sat cross-legged or stood around the pool, poised and ready.

Ning Zhuo immediately found an empty spot and settled onto a stone.

At first, he went unnoticed.

But when he pulled out a hemp rope and a wooden awl, he drew attention.

Hang one's head from the rafters, prick one's thigh with an awl!

Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo tied his hair to the rope and simultaneously stabbed his thigh with the awl.

"Is this a Confucian cultivator's technique?"

"Using Confucian cultivation methods before it's even started?"

Indeed.

Ning Zhuo had decided to inflict pain on himself first, to sharpen his focus and enter the proper state of mind.

Gu Qitong began to emit sound, performing the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual for all to hear.

Hanging his head from the rafters cleared Ning Zhuo's mind of distractions, while the awl's piercing pain brought him penetrating clarity.

He poured his entire being into listening.

He heard the sound of trees growing and joints expanding, his entire body bathed in the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual, experiencing a subtle, tingling sensation of growth.

Ning Zhuo marveled inwardly, "This is what it means to grow!"

During the first iteration, he gained a comprehensive but superficial understanding of the entire Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual.

By the second iteration, the hemp rope had tightened around his scalp, causing a constant, dull ache. His right thigh was already mangled beyond recognition, forcing him to switch to his left leg.




Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!

The wooden awl plunged down repeatedly, each strike delivered without the slightest hesitation.

Some observers watching Ning Zhuo's ordeal couldn't help but twitch at the corner of their eyes, inwardly marveling, "How can this hulking youth be so merciless toward himself?"

The earlier sounds of growth and sprouting now seemed amplified, revealing countless intricate details.

These were distinct rhythms and tempos of growth, each note audible to Ning Zhuo's ears.

"The Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual uses musical principles to awaken the innate vitality of trees, granting them power and accelerating their growth."

By the third repetition, a small pool of blood had formed beneath Ning Zhuo's feet.

The excruciating pain at his scalp had begun to numb. Large clumps of hair were being torn out by the hemp rope.

Ning Zhuo's vision blurred, his upper body swaying uncontrollably.

As he listened, all the sounds merged into a cacophony - a torrential downpour, croaking frogs, and thunderous drums - a chaotic symphony that left him dizzy and disoriented.

"Trying to swallow too much at once!"

"I wanted to achieve perfection in one step, but my mastery falls short."

Life Hanging by a Thread!

Luoshu Page!

His vision swimming, Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity presented by his position at the edge of the crowd. Summoning his Divine Art, he secretly channeled the power of the Dao Artifact.

Under the influence of the Luoshu Page, Ning Zhuo's mind instantly became remarkably organized. The sounds he heard were immediately categorized by source, sequence, and volume, no longer a chaotic jumble.

Moreover, the various sounds of growth and sprouting coalesced into a natural, free-flowing melody, unfolding in Ning Zhuo's ears.

In that moment, Ning Zhuo was entranced.

He heard the pulse of life itself, flowing and surging.

Through this, he grasped the core essence of the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual.

Mastered in just three repetitions!

Ning Zhuo retrieved his hemp rope and wooden stake, healed his injuries, and quietly left the scene.

According to the established pattern, Gu Qitong would perform the same musical score at least twenty times.

Though some noticed his movements and glanced at him, seeing his pale face, bloodstained clothes, and disheveled appearance - looking defeated and disheveled - they dismissed him as a failure and paid him no further attention.

Gu Qitong was originally a Demon Cultivator who had devoted his life to saving his Dao Companion, his soulmate. He had defied fate, only to fail in the face of divine retribution, watching helplessly as his beloved perished in the thunderous Calamity.

Severely wounded in body and spirit, Gu Qitong's cultivation was nearly shattered. He reverted to his true form - a Phoenix Tree - and in the Calamity-scarred ruins, he endlessly performed different musical scores.

This was a rather unique participant in the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Soaring Cloud Minor Trial.

If a cultivator could respond to Gu Qitong's mournful melodies with a high-quality musical piece, they might receive Amber Tree Tears from the Phoenix Tree as a reward.

"I'll pass on this spectacle!" Ning Zhuo had already mastered the technique but chose to remain reserved, unwilling to show off unnecessarily.

He secretly rejoiced, "Among all the musical scores, the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual is the most suitable for the Bamboo Puppet."

"Though I've mastered it, I still need to practice this manual."

"In the future, I might even be able to control an entire Bamboo Puppet army using the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual."

As Ning Zhuo considered this, he couldn't help but marvel again at how wonderful the Flying Cloud Assembly and Rising Cloud Minor Trial were. Here, one could freely learn all sorts of things without worrying about external factors.

"Hmm, what's this?"

While riding his cloud past a mountain peak, Ning Zhuo unexpectedly discovered a group of cultivators gathered, discussing the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

"There's a trial involving a Mechanism here. Why not give it a try?" Ning Zhuo's interest was immediately piqued.

With his newly acquired techniques - the "Head-Hanging, Thigh-Stabbing" method, the "Meaning-Conveying Brush," the "Bitter Ink," and the Luoshu Page - Ning Zhuo now possessed a comprehensive learning system that fueled his curiosity and drive to master all sorts of skills.

A mere minor trial! Moreover, Xingyun Ningzhuo, a master of mechanism arts, descended from the clouds to the mountainside, joining the other cultivators in the competition.

The stone gate at the mountainside opened, revealing a burly man with a massive black beard that nearly encircled his face.

The bearded giant grinned, revealing a set of stark white teeth. "I am Che Zhuzi," he boomed. "Come in, everyone!"

"Che Zhuzi, do you stand by your word?" someone immediately asked. "Will whoever passes your Rising Cloud Minor Trial truly receive a magic treasure or another item of equal value?"

Che Zhuzi nodded emphatically. "Of course, of course! My word is my bond - absolutely!"

"Then I'll go first!" The cultivator who had asked the question stepped forward.

The other cultivators, now fully roused, surged forward, scrambling to enter the gate.

Ning Zhuo chuckled inwardly. This hired shill is a bit rough around the edges.

But he was wrong.

This wasn't a shill at all.

Deep within the cave, Lady Spiderweb trembled with anticipation. He's here. That little brat Ning Zhuo has finally taken the bait.

All my efforts to have Che Zhuzi spread the word and offer generous rewards to entice cultivators to participate in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial have paid off!

"Come on, hurry in!"

Lady Spiderweb licked her crimson lips, her eyes gleaming with malice.
