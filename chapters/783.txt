Chapter 783: Exorcising Demons and Defending the Dao, We Are Duty-Bound!

Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng could not help but fall into silence.

Li Guanyu did not look favorably upon Ning Zhuo, believing he was not a match for Gu Qing.

There was good reason for this. The Rising Cloud Minor Trial was concerned with paper-making. This process required the participation of many Confucian cultivator methods, such as utilizing Literary Qi, Literary Heart, and even the Literary Palace.

Ning Zhuo was not an orthodox Confucian cultivator, but Gu Qing was.

The latter was not only a Confucian cultivator but had been nurtured as one since childhood, receiving a classic Confucian education. His teacher was none other than the Great Scholar Zhao Hansheng! It could be said that in terms of Confucian cultivator cultivation, Gu Qing had received far more guidance than Ning Zhuo.

Now that he had come to participate in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, his advantage was clear at a glance - it was truly immense.

Even though Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng were inclined toward Ning Zhuo, they could not deny this advantage.

Furthermore, Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng could not possibly stop Gu Qing from participating.

There were many things that could only be done in secret; on the surface, fairness and impartiality had to be upheld.

This was why the Profound Armor Cave faction had been so furious upon seeing Ban Jie bury traps and manipulate the minor trial. Ban Jie had paid a huge price afterward to obtain the forgiveness of the Profound Armor Cave faction.

Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng could not show excessive bias toward Ning Zhuo; otherwise, the credibility and reputation of the Confucian cultivator community would be ruined!

So, what should be done next?

After a moment of silence, Song Taosheng said, "Actually, this doesn't matter. We previously wanted to support Ning Zhuo because we didn't understand him. Now we know that Ning Zhuo is a first-rate genius. Relying on his own strength, he can make a name for himself in the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

"In the previous two Confucian cultivator minor trials, he took first place in both. To be honest, this has already aroused considerable suspicion."

"We only need to ensure that in the next two Confucian cultivator minor trials, we provide him with precise assistance. That will be enough."

Song Taosheng's meaning was very clear.

Even without their help, Ning Zhuo could rely on himself to seize the top spot in other Rising Cloud Minor Trials.

Therefore, even if he did not become the head scholar in this specific Confucian cultivator minor trial, it did not matter!

In fact, there were benefits.

At the very least, it would verify that the Confucian cultivator community's minor trial was not designed exclusively for Ning Zhuo, completely dispelling potential suspicions and risks.

Song Taosheng paused, then added, "With Gu Qing participating, I feel there are also quite a few benefits."

"This child comes from the Huazhang Kingdom and is a young genius known throughout the country. That he has come to participate in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial we organized signifies that we have allies outside the Myriad Manifestations Sect. This can greatly boost our reputation!"

Hearing this, Chu Xuangui and Li Guanyu nodded simultaneously.

Chu Xuangui suddenly thought of Situ Gu. "Looking at it this way, Situ Gu almost actively joining this Rising Cloud Minor Trial earlier... he must have met with Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing beforehand, and perhaps even reached an agreement."

Li Guanyu interjected, "If that's the case, then Gu Qing's intention is also clear. He wants to seize the top spot in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial!"

Confucian cultivators always had a few tricks up their sleeves when it came to politics.

During their discussion, the three easily saw through Situ Gu's stance and Gu Qing's intentions.

Li Guanyu looked at the two before him with a teasing expression. "When a Great Scholar makes a move, it really is extraordinary. We worked hard to set up this layout, and in the end, someone comes from afar and tries to pick the fruit right away."

Song Taosheng smiled freely. "How can worldly affairs always go as we wish? In the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect, the three of us only possess Golden Core cultivation. And the entire Confucian academic group only possesses a certain amount of volume within the middle stratum of the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

Chu Xuangui's expression was calm, his voice indifferent. "Zhao Hansheng is a Great Scholar on par with old Mr. Duanmu Zhang. It would be very difficult for us to obstruct him, and there is no need to."

"Gu Qing is traveling the world, wanting to accumulate battle achievements everywhere; this is understandable."

"Since he wants this top spot so badly, it wouldn't be justifiable if he didn't pay some price, right?"

At this point, Chu Xuangui had already abandoned the original plan of supporting Ning Zhuo to charge for the top spot.

Since the matter was no longer feasible, they would go with the flow and modify the plan.

In the end, the relationship between Chu Xuangui and Ning Zhuo was not that tight; it was more about appreciation and optimism. Within the entire Confucian cultivator community, the only one who would truly give more for Ning Zhuo was Wen Ruanyu.

However, that person was still under house arrest.

Ning Zhuo was ultimately not an orthodox Confucian cultivator. In the hearts of the Confucian cultivators, there was always a layer of separation between him and "their own."

Li Guanyu and Song Taosheng wore faint smiles.

It was excellent that Chu Xuangui could change his mind.

Li Guanyu laughed. "As a Great Scholar, Zhao Hansheng surely has substantial family assets. It is only right that he adds some luster to this Rising Cloud Minor Trial for the sake of his own student."

"Haha, I'll participate in this good show as well. I'll go with you two to pay a visit to this Great Scholar who has traveled from afar."

Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng immediately expressed their welcome.

Song Taosheng said, "Once we have settled the discussion, we will spread the relevant news."

Li Guanyu nodded. "Given Ning Zhuo's attainments, he will naturally be able to understand the message we want to convey."

He had also gained a lot of understanding regarding Ning Zhuo.

The reason for this result was that Ning Zhuo's entire performance in the Profound Armor Cave had been recorded in Jade Slips and sold extensively through the Commerce Hall.

It was as if Li Guanyu had witnessed Ning Zhuo's various performances in the Profound Armor Cave minor trial with his own eyes.

What impressed him most was Ning Zhuo's grasp of the human heart. At the final critical moment, Ning Zhuo had used only words to persuade the others to actively back down. This even included Golden Core cultivators like Tie Zheng.

This behavior made Li Guanyu appreciate Ning Zhuo greatly.

Because Confucian cultivators basically all advocated the policy of "a gentleman uses his mouth, not his hands."

Ning Zhuo retreating the enemy with words happened to hit the behavioral preference of the Confucian cultivators right on the mark.

Duanmu Zhang changing his view of Ning Zhuo previously also stemmed from this reason.

Green Stone Cave Abode.

Ning Zhuo was studying painstakingly, comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.

With the computational support of the Luo Shu, the blood meridians were continuously magnified, magnified again, until the most microscopic secrets were revealed within Ning Zhuo's Divine Sense.

This time, what he saw was no longer spirals, layers, and other complex structures, but the most basic element - Blood Qi Threads!

"Constructing blood meridians is merely the result; it is the most outward appearance."

When a blood meridian was stretched purely and longitudinally, it did not simply become longer. Under the infusion of blood qi, countless Blood Qi Threads were like countless tightened bowstrings. This was the most fundamental principle!

The simple action of pulling could accumulate terrifying recoil force.

And when this force erupted, it could be used anywhere in the body!

One Blood Qi Thread was very simple, but when two or three were interwoven, it became complex. Some threads provided the main power, called main lines. Others were responsible for guiding direction or restriction, called auxiliary lines.

Countless blood threads interwoven together formed the various structures of the blood meridians.

For example, layering: countless Blood Qi Threads arranged in parallel allowed the whole to withstand or accumulate pulling and recoil forces in a certain direction, appearing quite astonishing and manifesting a more macroscopic "toughness."

Misalignment, on the other hand, involved countless tiny pulling and dragging lines continuously superimposing in a displaced manner within the space, causing the blood qi to be pressurized and refined within.

The comprehension process this time was quite smooth!

To use an analogy, Ning Zhuo comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art before was like trekking through sand. Now, it was like sitting on a wooden board and sliding all the way down a sand dune.

Although Ning Zhuo was not surprised, he was happy. "My realm in Mechanism techniques has leaped to the master level. Comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art, I instantly captured the core."

"The core foundation is understood; next is to understand and memorize the various combination methods of the Blood Qi Threads."

Although this learning content was quite massive, Ning Zhuo only needed to proceed step by step, and he would not encounter learning obstacles.

"The Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art is quite compatible with Mechanism techniques!"

"By cultivating it, a cultivator can condense blood qi into blood meridians. These are alternative Mechanism parts that can be attached to flesh and bones. From this perspective, the Three Sects Immortal treated the human body as a Mechanism."

Sun Lingtong quietly returned to the Green Stone Cave Abode.

"Put them away safely, Little Zhuo. These are the Demonic Cultivator souls bought this time." He brought back a large number of Demonic Souls, including two at the Golden Core level.

There was no soul of Qin De.

However, Ning Zhuo had known this for a long time.

When Sun Lingtong was acting in the black market, Ning Zhuo had been observing through Life Hanging by a Thread. Once Sun Lingtong was in any danger, he would use his methods to quickly pull him away and escape the danger.

Ning Zhuo had even watched the entire process of Sun Lingtong negotiating with the grey-robed cultivator.

Sun Lingtong : "I'm going back first."

He had mostly been comprehending the Luo Shu formation recently and had made considerable progress. His comprehension was extremely high, and with the two Confucian techniques taught by Ning Zhuo, it was simply like adding wings to a tiger.

"I'll strive to finish the Luo Shu formation within one or two months and collect this Dao Artifact!" Sun Lingtong left quietly after leaving this instruction.

Just as he left, bad news was delivered to Ning Zhuo's hands.

"Zhao Hansheng, Gu Qing..." Ning Zhuo frowned slightly.

Someone was disrupting the situation!

In Ning Zhuo's plan, the upcoming Confucian cultivator minor trial was equivalent to his guaranteed first place. He hadn't expected a problem to arise in this aspect.

"Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing come with malice. First, to pick the peaches; second, they want to step on me to establish their reputation."

"The greater my fame, the higher my value, and opponents like this will emerge one after another."

Back then, if Ning Zhuo had chosen to endure silently, there was a high probability that such events would not have happened.

But by the same token, he would have suffered losses in other aspects.

There was no option in life that was perfect. There were always pros and cons; gaining something meant losing something else.

"Sigh, it's a pity. If I could have obtained the soul of the Demonic Dao Confucian cultivator Qin De, I would be more confident about this Confucian cultivator minor trial."

"I don't know why Zhong Dao suddenly attaches importance to Qin De and guards him strictly."

Ning Zhuo carefully pondered the intelligence and soon figured out the attitudes of Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng.

"Their attitude toward me has also undergone a subtle shift."

Facing Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing, the assistance they provided to Ning Zhuo would be greatly reduced.

"In the final analysis, I am not truly one of their own."

Ning Zhuo was not disappointed.

This move by the Confucian cultivator community was also reasonable and fair. They couldn't possibly throw away their own reputation just for Ning Zhuo, could they?

In fact, if the Confucian cultivator community supported Ning Zhuo that strongly, Ning Zhuo would have felt troubled.

The current situation was just right.

This was a two-way choice.

Ning Zhuo had also always regarded the Confucian cultivator community merely as one of his entry points into the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

"Refining these papers requires utilizing various Confucian cultivator resources."

"Although for outsiders, anyone participating in this minor trial can be provided with these resources, it is ultimately not as good as using one's own."

"Gu Qing possesses too great an advantage in this regard."

"Never mind that the Confucian cultivators don't favor me; even I feel that the hope of seizing the top spot is too slim."

Ning Zhuo gave a wry laugh but still decided to participate.

Even if he didn't get first place, as long as he could obtain the corresponding precious paper, it would be fine.

Having settled his mood, Ning Zhuo began to utilize these Demonic Cultivator souls to commence his cultivation.

Innate Talent True Self, Burning Boat Soul Ferrying Technique!

Under the interplay of the two, the Demonic Cultivator souls howled miserably one after another, pouring the memories and experiences of a lifetime into Ning Zhuo's body.

Several hours later, Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes.

Almost all the Demonic Cultivator souls had dissipated.

"Exorcising demons and defending the Dao, we are duty-bound!" Ning Zhuo said with awe-inspiring righteousness.

His eyes shone as he recalled the harvest this time, discovering that in the second round of purchasing, the quality of the souls was obviously not as good as the first wave.

"It seems that the grey-robed cultivator's supply capability is not that great judging from this."

"For the souls I need in the future, I still have to start with White Paper Immortal City."

The memories and experiences of countless cultivators were like a massive amount of nutrition, covering many aspects of Cultivation.

But for Ning Zhuo to digest them, there still had to be a process. Just like when he was in the Profound Armor Cave, facing various bronze weapons, he only rapidly digested the experiences and memories regarding Martial Art and truly turned them into his own through repeated sparring sessions.

"Most of the souls are either Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment. They just fill in the foundation, and there is a lot of overlap."

"Continuing to absorb this type of soul in the future will yield lower and lower returns."

What were truly useful were the experts.

What made Ning Zhuo's eyes light up the most this time was a Demonic Cultivator named Ling Mo.

This person was born in the North Wind Kingdom. His appearance was ordinary, he had no Innate Talent, but possessed an Ice Spiritual Root, so he joined a local small Sect.

A conspiracy led to the Sect being exterminated. He witnessed his benevolent teacher and Fellow Sect Members being slaughtered with his own eyes. During his escape, he was forced to flee into Frost Roar Valley.

Inside Frost Roar Valley, he came close to death several times, struggling with difficulty while dragging his heavily injured body.

Finally, with no way out, amidst extreme cold and despair, he relied on his astonishing talent and willpower to create a technique of his own.

In the world of ice and snow, he used his own meridians as a furnace, Ten-Thousand-Year Profound Ice qi as material, and the obsession with revenge as the flame to re-forge his own Physical Body.

After the fact, he named this technique the Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Casting Demonic Art!

Traditional Ice Techniques often pursued changes in spells and long-range manipulation; Ling Mo discarded all of these. He used the power of cold ice to transform and enhance himself, making his own body the most powerful weapon.

"Frost Roar Valley..."

Ning Zhuo had once passed by there with Sun Lingtong.

It was a danger zone among danger zones, a desperate situation among desperate situations.

But Ling Mo was able to survive in it and even found a blessing in disguise.

And this Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Casting Demonic Art was precisely the reliance that allowed him to stay in Frost Roar Valley for a long time!
