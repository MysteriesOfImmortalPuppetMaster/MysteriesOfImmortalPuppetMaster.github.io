Chapter 745: The Ning-Ban Gambit

The Zhu Family's messenger made no attempt to conceal his presence. His voice, amplified by a technique, erupted into a thunderous roar that reverberated in all directions.

Immediately, Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong saw Situ Xing fly out.

Situ Xing's brow furrowed as he glared at the messenger, a cold sneer twisting his lips. "Such audacity! Has Zhu Fenxiang gone mad from her blind faith? Does she truly believe she can defeat me?"

"Hmph, very well, very well."

"Since she so overestimates her abilities, I accept her challenge!"

Situ Xing had no choice but to accept.

The Zhu and Situ Clans were mortal enemies. At the Flying Cloud Assembly, Situ Xing and Zhu Fenxiang were the leading Foundation Establishment cultivators representing their respective families.

If Situ Xing were to avoid the battle, it would inevitably tarnish his clan's reputation. In his position, he couldn't afford to back down, allowing the world to look down on him and the Situ Clan, bringing shame upon his family.

The messenger slowly pushed the challenge letter forward, watching as it landed in Situ Xing's hand.

His expression remained impassive as he turned and flew away.

Situ Xing's divine sense swiftly scanned the challenge letter. The message was simple, conveying Zhu Fenxiang's fury and fierce determination to fight.

Yet even now, Situ Xing couldn't understand why she had suddenly erupted in anger and sought to confront him.

"Zhu Fenxiang and I have clashed many times, with victories and defeats shared between us."

"What new confidence has emboldened her to challenge me this time?"

Situ Xing pondered aloud, his gaze shifting between Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong.

The two men slowly flew forward until they stood before him.

Lin Jinglong said with concern, "Fellow Daoist Situ, since you've accepted Zhu Fenxiang's challenge, you should postpone your conflict with Ning Zhuo. There's no need to fight on two fronts, needlessly increasing the risk."

Situ Xing snorted coldly. "Zhu Fenxiang and I exchanged Stone Tablets in the same batch. Her sudden challenge is not to be underestimated. Ning Zhuo is fortunate! I'll spare him for now."

Forced to change course, Situ Xing focused his full attention on the formidable enemy who had come knocking.

His lips pressed into a tight line, betraying his resentment. After a moment of silence, his eyes narrowed as he secretly mused, "What madness has seized Zhu Fenxiang? To interfere just as I was about to settle scores with Ning Zhuo?"

"First, I must uncover the truth behind this!"

Situ Xing's plan mirrored Shen Xi's own.

After parting ways with Situ Xing, Shen Xi immediately dispatched his subordinates to investigate the reason behind Zhu Fenxiang's proactive challenge.

Zhu Fenxiang had made no attempt to conceal her actions; the messenger delivering her challenge had done so with great fanfare.

Shen Xi quickly uncovered the reason behind Zhu Fenxiang's challenge.

Lin Jinglong chuckled, "Fellow Daoist Situ has paid the price for his true nature. Ha ha!"

Situ Xing fell silent upon learning the cause.

He had never imagined that Zhu Fenxiang would come after him because of a poem he had inscribed.

He did recall the poem.

It had been written after he secured first place in his third Rising Cloud Minor Trial, confirming his eligibility for the Stone Tablet. In a drunken fit of inspiration at a tavern, he had scrawled the verse on the wall:

"Ancient sheath still bears the night flame's mark,

New blade thirsts to drink the starlight's spark."

This verse, with its taboo implications, had enraged Zhu Fenxiang, who happened to be at the tavern that night. She immediately destroyed the wall and publicly vowed to make Situ Xing pay dearly.

"So, Ning Zhuo had nothing to do with this," Situ Xing muttered, resigning himself to his misfortune. "For now, I must deal with Zhu Fenxiang first, then turn my attention to eliminating Ning Zhuo's threat."

Lin Jinglong felt he had witnessed a good show.

Shen Xi, however, remained suspicious and secretly continued his investigation, delving deeper into the details of that fateful night.

He discovered that a waiter from the tavern had been loudly reciting the poem, proclaiming to the surrounding diners how Situ Xing had composed it in a drunken fit of inspiration. The waiter then publicly recited the poem.

Zhu Fenxiang, who was in a private room, hadn't seen the poem. Hearing the commotion outside, the waiter, proud of Situ Xing's poetic feat, had burst out of the room and angrily smashed the wall.

"Investigate this tavern waiter for me," Shen Xi secretly ordered.

------
Peak of Foolishness.

In the quiet chamber of the cave residence, stood an altar dedicated to the Foolish Thunder God, complete with a divine statue and ancestral tablet.

Incense smoke curled lazily from the burner, casting the room in dim light.

The Blind Foolish Old Man, clad in simple hemp robes, knelt on a meditation cushion, his withered hands pressed together in prayer. He murmured softly, his voice filled with devout reverence.

After a moment, the Blind Foolish Old Man ceased his murmuring and raised his voice: "You've been standing at the entrance for quite some time. If you have something to say, come in and speak."

A middle-aged man and woman pushed open the door and entered.

"Father," they said in unison.

They were the Blind Foolish Old Man's biological children.

The son spoke first: "Father, I heard you're considering allowing Ning Zhuo to join the Rising Cloud Minor Trial midway?"

The Blind Foolish Old Man remained kneeling, facing the altar, his posture unchanged.

Seeing their father's lack of response, his children immediately understood and knelt behind him.

Yu Gong finally spoke, "Indeed. Ning Zhuo has passed the Demon Subjugation Hall's Three Trials of the Heart and Qing Huangzi's Trial, earning four first-place titles. His reputation matches his righteous aura. Such a rare talent, a gem among men, would be a testament to our god's glory if he were to receive the Blind Fool Divine Art."

"Isn't the purpose of our family's Rising Cloud Minor Trial to spread the name of our divine lord?"

"The stronger Ning Zhuo becomes, the greater our god's influence will grow."

Hearing this, the children exchanged worried glances.

The son tensed, took a deep breath, and strove to keep his voice steady and earnest. "Father, we must reconsider this matter carefully."

"Ning Zhuo is undoubtedly a prodigy, riding the crest of his fame, but... Ban Ji is no ordinary talent either!"

"Since our first Rising Cloud Minor Trial, Ban Ji has participated with unwavering devotion, tirelessly cultivating his skills, all for the sake of earning our god's favor. For Ning Zhuo to cut in line now would be the greatest injustice to Ban Ji!"

"Ning Zhuo's public rejection of Ban Jie's mediation reveals his youthful arrogance and utter disregard for others. His meteoric rise is like pouring oil on a raging fire - one misstep could lead to his own destruction."

"He's a foreigner. How could he possibly oppose the Ban Clan?"

"Father, it's a clash between two powerful forces. We have no need to get involved," his son said.

Before the Blind Foolish Old Man could speak, his daughter leaned forward, her voice sharp: "My brother speaks the truth! Father, rules are the foundation of our clan's standing. If we make an exception for one person during the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, how will outsiders view our family in the future?"

The Blind Foolish Old Man remained silent for a moment. "Anything else?"

His son gritted his teeth, his tone deepening: "Father, you've always taught us to consider the future of our descendants and the Mountain-Moving plan!"

"Our clan has endured generations of blood feuds, and our path forward is strewn with thorns. What we need isn't to make more enemies, but to cultivate alliances and accumulate every ounce of potential strength! Even if the Ban Clan can't be allies, they must never become enemies!"

The Blind Foolish Old Man: "Then how can you be so sure Ning Zhuo and his backers are weaker than the Ban Clan? Wouldn't refusing his request also make an enemy?"

His daughter's expression turned severe: "Father, the Ban Clan is right here in our territory. Whether Ning Zhuo's support comes from a family or a sect, their reach is limited. And..."

At this point, she switched to divine sense communication: "Father, you want to spread the name of our god, but there's no need to risk our entire family for it."

"The Foolish Thunder God has indeed greatly aided our clan, serving as a crucial force in our Mountain-Moving plan. But..."

"He only recently ascended to godhood, retaining much of his humanity. His lingering ties to our bloodline and old affections still influence him."

The daughter paused, then continued with newfound courage, "Divinity is eternal, while humanity fades! What will happen after decades, even centuries?"

"When his humanity dissipates, leaving only cold, detached divinity, will the Foolish Thunder God still help our clan against the Mountain God?"

The son interjected, his divine sense conveying his impassioned words, "Father, if we truly want to move the mountains and fulfill our ancestors' unfinished ambition, we can't rely on divine favors or fleeting whims. Ultimately, it depends on the enduring bloodline of the Yu Clan! It requires generations of resilience, meticulous planning, and unwavering determination!"

"By introducing Ning Zhuo to spread the God's name, are we truly advancing our clan's grand strategy?"

"Making an exception for Ning Zhuo and antagonizing the Ban Clan - at best, it diminishes our clan's prospects for growth. At worst, it undermines the very foundation of our clan!"

The Blind Foolish Old Man, his back turned to his children, felt a vein bulge on his forehead.

He remained silent for an agonizingly long time, so long that the incense ash in the burner formed a thick, elongated layer.

In the oppressive atmosphere, his children dared not speak.

Only the heavy sound of breathing filled the silent chamber.

"Heh." The Blind Foolish Old Man suddenly chuckled softly, his laughter dry and desolate, like withered branches scraping against each other in the cold wind.

Without turning around, he transmitted his thoughts through divine sense: "You two grew up right under my nose. How could you possibly have such an understanding?"

"Tell me, what benefits did the Ban Clan offer you?"

His son and daughter both flinched.

The daughter swallowed hard and forced out a strained voice: "Father..."

The son, however, immediately dropped to his knees, his voice choked with sobs as he pleaded: "Father! We... we did accept their offer. We wouldn't dare hide it from you!"

"But we truly believe this is for the good of the clan!"

"How many years has the Yu Clan been living under the Myriad Manifestations Sect's roof? We've been relying on others, and our clan has stagnated!"

"The Ban Clan's power is immense. Their envoy spoke to us with... less than friendly words."

"Father! You are the pillar of our clan! As long as you're here, the Ban Clan will still show some restraint. But... once you ascend to immortality, the Yu Clan will be like a dilapidated house without its main support beam, tossed about by wind and rain! The Ban Clan could topple us with a single push... How could we possibly resist?"

The Blind Foolish Old Man froze at these words.

His daughter began to wail, "Father! I beg you, for the sake of our ancestors, for the sake of the Mountain-Moving legacy, please spare us, your unworthy descendants... a path to survival! We... we can't afford to oppose the Ban Clan now!"

The Blind Foolish Old Man's usually ramrod-straight spine slumped an inch under the weight of her words.

His empty eye sockets "gazed" toward the incense altar, now betraying a hint of confusion and bitterness.

The statue of the Foolish Thunder God loomed over him with cold indifference. The blue smoke from the incense burner swirled before him, mirroring his own chaotic and icy state of mind.

After a long silence, he finally let out a sigh.

The sigh was long and heavy, as if it had drained every last ounce of his vitality.

The sound echoed through the quiet chamber, deepening the already dim room into an even darker gloom.

"With children like you, how can our clan ever prosper?" The Blind Foolish Old Man's words flushed his son and daughter with shame.

"Very well. My days are numbered anyway. The clan's future rests in your hands. Do as you see fit."

His daughter's sobs gradually subsided.

His son's Adam's apple bobbed as he forced out a strained whisper, "Father..."

Several hours later.

Green Stone Cave Residence.

Chen San stood with his hands pressed tightly against the seams of his trousers, his upper body slightly bowed, his head lowered in respectful deference as he faced Ning Zhuo.

He had just finished his report.

He brought Ning Zhuo both good news and bad news.

Ning Zhuo pondered aloud, "The Blind Foolish Old Man has rejected my invitation. It seems Ban Ji will undoubtedly claim first place in their Rising Cloud Minor Trial."

"With this, he'll have accumulated three first-place finishes, enough to exchange for a Stone Tablet."

Chen San quickly interjected, "Even so, Ban Ji is still behind schedule. He's no longer considered among the first wave of achievers, and he can't compare to you, Young Master."

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "Ban Ji's talent and skill are undoubtedly first-rate. There's no question about that."

Chen San immediately seized the opportunity to flatter, "Still, Young Master, your methods are far superior. You managed to kick him out of Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Minor Trial. This humble servant exhausted every effort, yet couldn't even meet the Blind Foolish Old Man. I've failed to fulfill your trust and performed poorly. I am truly ashamed. Please punish me, Young Master!"

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but chuckle softly. "Chen San, you're a lone-cultivator by origin. Why are you acting so... restrained?"

"This is... 'restraint'?"

Chen San seized the opportunity to flatter Ning Zhuo. "For ordinary people, I might be a bit lax. But before you, Young Master, I find myself utterly devoted and dare not slacken my efforts in the slightest."

Ning Zhuo raised a hand. "Enough. Do you think I'm so foolish as to misunderstand the situation? I don't blame you for the incident. The Ban Clan must have moved preemptively to block our efforts."

"Just as I anticipated Situ Xing's actions."

Chen San tilted his head back, "bravely" meeting Ning Zhuo's gaze to ensure his face radiated admiration. "Young Master, your strategic brilliance allows you to orchestrate victory from a thousand li away. By following your instructions, I provoked Zhu Fenxiang's anger, driving her to confront Situ Xing. Your schemes are truly profound - beyond comprehension!"

Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly, his gaze piercing as he studied Chen San. "I merely gave you the orders. The specific execution depended entirely on your improvisation."

"You handled this well. You timed the tavern workers' poetry recitation perfectly, subtly nudging events into motion with minimal traces. Now, what reward do you desire?"

Chen San immediately knelt on one knee. "Young Master, this subordinate dares not claim any credit. The idea of using Situ Xing's poem came entirely from your instructions. When you issued the order, you pointed out several exploitable opportunities, and this poem was one of them!"

"I merely ran errands and followed your orders, which led to effortless success."

"How could this subordinate possibly ask for a reward? To continue serving under your command is the greatest reward imaginable!"

Chen San's flattery flowed smoothly, each compliment delivered with practiced ease.

His tone shifted, revealing a hint of hesitation. "However, the innkeeper's assistant who recited the poem was publicly knocked unconscious by Zhu Fenxiang. The inn suffered losses and dismissed him. Now, severely injured and bedridden, he presents an ideal opportunity to strike..."

Ning Zhuo's expression turned stern, his voice hardening. "Absolutely not."

"As a member of a reputable sect, I refuse to stoop to such vile tactics."

"Arrange for the assistant's relocation. Send him away from the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main gate, preferably abroad. I will cover all expenses - spare no expense in this matter!"
