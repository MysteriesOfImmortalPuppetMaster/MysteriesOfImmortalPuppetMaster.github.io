Chapter 799: Snow Bud, Frost Blade

Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly, putting away his wandering thoughts to refocus on the problem at hand. 

"Based on what I previously learned, even the Myriad Manifestations Sect doesn't have a collection of methods regarding the nourishment and growth of spirituality."

"In that case, I can only wait for them to grow."

"Before that, I need to select suitable ice and frost techniques to add to the body of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui."

"What should I choose?"

Ning Zhuo had previously added a large number of technique talismans to the body of Snow Pivot Guard Xie. However, after the actual combat with Zhu Guizhi, Ning Zhuo had a deep realization - he needed more powerful Ice Path techniques.

The spell talismans he had inscribed allowed Snow Pivot Guard Xie to perform frost techniques that were relatively ordinary and common.

If they were Five Elements techniques, Ning Zhuo would have no obstacles at all. He could entirely create them himself on the spot, and the techniques would be quite powerful or unique.

Unfortunately, it was the Ice Path...

"I could purchase some powerful frost techniques from the Commerce Hall."

"However, if I do that, the information is very likely to leak. Furthermore, techniques circulating on the market are quite common. In battle, there is a higher probability of them being countered."

Just like Ning Zhuo's recent battle with Zhu Guizhi, the Earth Deity and Lightning Mother were familiar with those frost techniques, which saved them the process of testing and made the combat quite straightforward.

"It's a shame; as a disciple of the Ning family, I am actually not proficient in the Ice Path," Ning Zhuo said with a bitter smile.

But in reality, he was only eighteen years old; his level of understanding of the Ice Path for his age was already excellent.

It was only reasonable that someone like Ning Xiaohui, who possessed relevant Innate Talent, had deeper achievements in the Ice Path than Ning Zhuo.

When Ning Zhuo compared the Ice Path to his own Five Elements realm, an immediate gap like heaven and earth was revealed.

"Wait, don't I still have two Dao Comprehension Paintings?"

With a stir of his heart, Ning Zhuo immediately probed into his Storage Belt with his divine sense and took out two scrolls.

One was the Proud Snow Painting, and the other was the Lingering Frost Painting. Both were part of the Ning family's heritage, and each painting contained an Ice Path technique.

Although Ning Zhuo had obtained these two paintings and attempted to study them several times, he had never made a breakthrough.

His time and energy had to be allocated to other important matters. Spending a lot of time and effort on these two paintings just to obtain two techniques felt like the expected return was too low, so Ning Zhuo had never truly taken it to heart.

But this time, he felt a spark of inspiration. He took out the two scrolls and examined them closely once again.

First, he unfurled the Proud Snow Dao Comprehension Painting.

He saw a snow-covered plain, silver-wrapped and white-clad, with distant mountains like dark eyebrows, completely covered in white veils. The sky was a heavy leaden gray, and fine grains of snow swirled in the wind like hundreds of millions of pieces of shattered jade.

On one corner of the scroll, there was a gnarled old plum tree with branches like iron, piercing through the vast emptiness in an almost rebellious posture. Layer upon layer of frost and snow were condensed upon the plum branches, looking like a cold, cruel seal.

In the past, when Ning Zhuo viewed this painting, his eyes and mind would be drawn to the plum tree, and a doubt would naturally arise in his heart: This is clearly a Dao Comprehension Painting for ice and snow techniques, so why is the protagonist a plum tree?

Doesn't a plum tree represent the Wood Element? 

This time, however, as he viewed the painting, he had a sudden realization.

"So that's how it is."

"If the plum tree were truly the protagonist, it could have been placed right in the center of the painting. By placing it in the corner, its nature as a supporting character is already highlighted."

"What the painter truly wanted to depict are precisely these hundreds of millions of snow grains."

"The depiction of the plum tree is an expression of the emotion of pride. It is as if a cultivator is looking up at heaven and earth, facing the drifting snow, yet still using their own way to take root, persevere, and bloom their own flowers."

The growth of the plum tree is tranquil, not as fierce as fire, nor entirely as cold and stern as mountain rock.

Ning Zhuo stared at the snow beneath its branches, as if seeing its root system buried deep within the frozen soil.

It was full of a kind of vitality, but instead of being radiated outward, it was covered by the frost and snow.

But it was precisely this covering that highlighted the internal vitality, showing it was so strong and abundant.

Ning Zhuo looked again at the layers of frost and snow covering the branches and petals, feeling truly that it was not just cold, but also a kind of silent nourishment.

Spring, summer, autumn, and winter are just the rotation of the four seasons. Icy cold is not the end of life, but rather pregnancy and preservation - the accumulation of vitality.

Techniue - Snow Bud!

In an instant, the essence of this technique flowed into Ning Zhuo's divine sea like a trickling icy spring.

In the span of about twenty breaths, Ning Zhuo had already mastered the Snow Bud technique.

Ning Zhuo was somewhat surprised. He had always thought the technique shown in this painting would be an offensive one, but he hadn't expected it to be a special technique.

The Snow Bud technique could increase a cultivator's vitality.

On a small scale, it could allow one to recover from fatigue or injuries more quickly. On a large scale, it could extend one's lifespan! 

However, this required long-term persistence, daily practice, and constant accumulation, like gathering sand to form a pagoda.

"It is not yet a defensive technique, whereas the Ice Grease Jade Hand can provide both defense and healing at the same time."

"By performing this technique, a cultivator consumes spiritual energy to cover their entire body in a layer of frost, forming something like a flower bud to nurture and accumulate more vitality."

This had the flavor of bitter cultivation, which made Ning Zhuo naturally think of the Bitter Cold Art.

"This technique is useful to me; it can expand the upper limit of my life force."

"It's different from using the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat to cultivate the physical body."

"However, I would have to practice it every day, and the practice time is quite long. I'm afraid I don't have that kind of time..."

"Wait." Suddenly, an inspiration flashed through Ning Zhuo's divine sea.

By the time he wanted to catch it, it was already too late.

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel a sense of loss.

It seemed like a wonderful and ingenious idea.

Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly, letting that thought go for the moment. He carefully put away the Proud Snow Painting.

After Ning Zhuo successfully comprehended it, the painting clearly became a bit dimmer, and the lines of the plum tree on the scroll also became somewhat blurred.

Dao Comprehension Paintings were essentially consumables.

Once the number of times they could impart knowledge reached the limit, they would be reduced to ordinary objects.

Ning Zhuo naturally thought of one thing: "If I could easily comprehend the Proud Snow Painting, then what about the Lingering Frost Painting?"

His interest was piqued. He pulled out the Lingering Frost Painting and unfurled it to take a closer look.

As the scroll opened, there was a vast expanse of white killing intent between heaven and earth!

Goose-feather snow fell from the sky, each snowflake having distinct angles and edges as sharp as a knife, whistling and swirling in the gale, cutting through everything between heaven and earth.

The snowflakes were as dense as a curtain, their edges flashing with cold light, seeming as if they could cut space itself apart.

The heavy snow falling was like countless miniature blades dancing wildly between heaven and earth!

Unlike before, after Ning Zhuo stared intently for a few breaths, it was as if he were placed within this storm of hundreds of millions of snow blades. His entire physical body felt as if it were being subjected to a thousand cuts, and even every breath he exhaled felt as if it were being chopped into countless fragments.

Ice Path - Frost Blade Technique!

The profound meaning of this technique flowed into Ning Zhuo's heart.

Clearly, this was an offensive technique. Frozen Qi served as the edge, and gathered ice became the blade.

Once performed, countless frost blades as thin as a cicada's wing and nearly transparent would rotate and fly, like slaughtering spirits possessed of life, sweeping toward the target in a whistling sound.

Such an offensive would surely involve repeated cutting and be continuous!

"Cut! Cut! Cut!"

Wherever the frost blade storm passed, it would be a grand and terrifying execution by lingering death, cutting and peeling the target inch by inch in the coldest and most cruel manner!

Ning Zhuo's breathing was slightly rapid. He couldn't help but slowly close his eyes, regulating his breath for a moment before opening them again.

Comprehending two brand-new techniques in succession had left his mind exhausted.

Looking at the Lingering Frost Painting again, it was just like the Proud Snow Painting - the image had become somewhat blurred.

"These are family heritages; now that they've fallen into my hands, I've finally comprehended them."

"The Proud Snow Painting contains an air of pride, while the Lingering Frost Painting is filled with a sense of overbearing aura." As Ning Zhuo looked back now, his grasp of the two paintings was even deeper.

Although they were Dao Comprehension Paintings, what they contained was not "True Intent" but "Emotive Intent."

If it were True Intent, it would be much more convenient, as there would be no threshold - one could just directly absorb and comprehend it.

But True Intent is very difficult to store for a long time. At the same time, if a cultivator consumes True Intent to create cultivation art manuals, their own corresponding realm would shrink and drop.

Because of these two important reasons, manuals that store True Intent are extremely rare in the world.

Ning Zhuo had received infusions of True Intent twice before - once from the Five Elements Divine Lord and once from the artifact spirit of the Mystic Soldier Armor; both were imparted and infused in person.

Using Emotive Intent to express it allows a person to be more immersed in it. There is a threshold, but if a cultivator can cross it, entering the path is equivalent to entering the inner chamber.

After Ning Zhuo comprehended them, he had a very thorough mastery of these two techniques.

Ning Zhuo lowered his head in thought and soon confirmed one point.

"My Ice Path realm has already risen to the Artisan level."

"It is precisely because my realm has improved that these two Dao Comprehension Paintings posed no difficulty and were easily comprehended by me."

Ning Zhuo looked back for a moment.

The most important contributor to the improvement of his Ice Path realm was Ling Mo. To be precise, his lifetime of experience and memories had become Ning Zhuo's nourishment.

Ling Mo was extraordinary; he was able to create the Eternal Silent Profound Ice Body-Forging Demonic Art and could live freely within the Frost Howl Valley. His lifelong accumulation was the primary factor in the elevation of Ning Zhuo's Ice Path realm. 

Secondly, Ning Zhuo had been refining equipment and crafting new mechanical bodies. Both Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Snow Pivot Guard Xie were related to the Ice Path.

During the refining process, Ning Zhuo verified what he had learned. The same was true during his battle with Zhu Guizhi.

Finally, his deep attainment in the Water Element realm, along with his past accumulations like the Eternal Silent Profound Ice Body-Forging Demonic Art, Bitter Cold Art, and Ice Sculpture Secret Record, also provided a solid foundation for the improvement of his Ice Path realm.

"These two Ice Path techniques have come at just the right time."

"The Snow Bud technique is quite compatible with Snow-Colored Maiden Hui. As for the Frost Blade technique, its quantity can be adjusted, so both mechanical puppets can use it."

Next, Ning Zhuo set to work on the new mechanical bodies.

Ten hours later, Ning Zhuo walked out of his bluestone cave residence in a hurry, sporting a pair of dark circles under his eyes.

He had been so immersed in the modification of the puppets that he had almost forgotten the time, but fortunately, the Old Chef had notified him in time.

He flew into the air on a cloud, slapped his Storage Belt, took out the Green Python Forest-Piercing Carriage to sit in, and sped away.

A short while later, he landed on a mountain peak and found that the schoolhouse on top was already packed with people, so he could only choose a corner to sit down.

This was Zhao Hansheng's second public lecture. Compared to the first one, the scale of the second was even larger, with the number of attendees nearly tripling.

Although Ning Zhuo was among the last group of people to arrive, his appearance still sparked widespread attention.

"Look, it's Ning Zhuo!"

"He's Ning Zhuo? One of the first-rate geniuses who emerged in this year's Flying Cloud Assembly?  This is my first time seeing him in person. He is indeed a man of striking appearance."

"He made Gu Qing look bad last time, and now he actually dares to come and listen to Teacher Gu Qing's class."

"What's there to be afraid of? Ning Zhuo has won the top spot in the Confucian junior examinations twice and is widely praised by the Confucian cultivator community. Gu Qing is the outsider here, alright? "

"I like someone like him! Gu Qing's sparring was lukewarm, but after Ning Zhuo stirred things up, it became much more exciting."

"Hahaha, yes, yes. I even went to see the battle between Gu Qing and Zhu Fenxiang myself. Man, they used their trump cards right from the start; it was so intense! Quite spectacular."

"Really? Then I want to see it too. Who is Gu Qing fighting in the next match?"

"He sent out so many challenges before and now he can't back down. He'll probably have a round of matches with all the first-rate geniuses of this year."

"Tsk tsk, that's a bit miserable..."

The crowd discussed animatedly.

Gu Qing was sitting upright in the very front row. As the discussions reached his ears, he did his best to control his expression, striving to maintain a look of indifference.

Zhao Hansheng also heard the commotion and swept his gaze across the entire scene, unobtrusively scanning the corner where Ning Zhuo was located.

He saw that Ning Zhuo had already taken out a hemp rope to tie up his hair and a wooden awl, which he gripped tightly in his hand, ready to stab it into his thigh at any moment.

"This kid..." A ripple also appeared in the pond of Zhao Hansheng's heart.

The time had come, and the bell rang.

The entire venue fell silent.

Zhao Hansheng coughed a few times, and his voice, slow and clear, spread throughout the hall: "Gentlemen, according to what was discussed in the last class, today we will focus on exploring the 'Unity of Knowledge and Action' in the Study of the Heart."

"Here it comes." Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up.

In the first class, he had keenly sensed that this Confucian technique would be extremely useful to him.

"People today often separate 'knowledge' and 'action' into two parts, which is a great mistake. The Instructions for Practical Living states: 'Knowledge is the intent of action; action is the effort of knowledge.' The two are inherently one, just like the moon reflected in a thousand rivers; the moon itself is one, but its light and shadow are myriad."

"'It is not that knowing is difficult, but that doing is difficult.' This saying seems reasonable, but in fact, it does not reach the ultimate truth. If one truly knows the suffering of hunger and cold, one will surely think of providing porridge and clothes; if one truly knows the importance of cultivation, one will surely practice with diligence. This is the essence of knowledge and action."

"What is 'True Knowledge'? It is like loving a beautiful color or hating a foul odor. Seeing a beautiful color belongs to knowledge, while loving that beautiful color belongs to action; smelling a foul odor belongs to knowledge, while hating that foul odor belongs to action. This is the essence of knowledge and action."

...

Zhao Hansheng's teaching left some of the cultivators in the hall in a trance, while others had their brows furrowed. Some felt that every word was a gem and were overjoyed, while others felt as if they were lost in a thick fog, unable to see the brilliance.

Even though Ning Zhuo employed the techniques of "hanging his hair from a beam and stabbing his thigh with an awl," he still found it difficult to break through the mental fog in his heart.

When it came to the final Q&A session of the class, he stood up and bowed: "Teacher, you just discussed 'Sincerity and Rectifying the Heart.' May I ask how to maintain this essence of knowledge and action when stray thoughts are frequently arising?"

Zhao Hansheng stared at him for a long time before speaking slowly: "Years ago, Master Xinyue was discussing learning with his disciples and once showed them gold dust, saying: 'Only when gold is in the sand can its value be seen.' If gold is mixed with sand, how is it different from grit?"

He paused slightly, and literary Qi flowed between his fingers: "For instance, when you are practicing the sword, as soon as a thought stirs, the blade has already arrived. There is no sequence of before and after in this. It is like a bright pearl in turbid water; one must use 'settling power' to clarify it."

Zhao Hansheng suddenly turned profound, "To ask about the way of 'Sincerity and Rectifying the Heart' is just like polishing a mirror."

"The Instructions for Practical Living says: 'It is like polishing a mirror; once the mirror is polished bright, it naturally takes no effort.'"

"However, this 'no effort' part is precisely where the most effort is required. The Dao De Jing says: 'Reversion is the movement of the Dao.' Have you all grasped the hidden meaning within this?"

The entire hall fell silent.

Everyone looked dumbfounded.

Ning Zhuo's brows were tightly furrowed, and he was about to continue asking.

Clang, clang, clang...

The bell rang.

Zhao Hansheng flicked his sleeves and slowly stood up: "You may all depart for now. Wait until the third class to return."

Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and the others were deeply impressed and shouted in unison: "We respectfully see you off, Teacher."

Zhao Hansheng first cupped his hands to the surroundings and then strode away.
