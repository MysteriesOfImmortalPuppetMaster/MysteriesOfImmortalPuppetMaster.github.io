Chapter 697: Life-or-Death Battle?

The registration process was astonishingly simple.

Ning Zhuo wasn't surprised. He had proactively gathered intelligence on the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

The complete registration process was divided into multiple stages. This was merely the first phase.

After a period of time, the second phase would begin, and the wooden identity tokens would be replaced with stone tokens. The recorded information about the cultivators would also be more detailed.

The identity tokens progressed through tiers: wooden, stone, bronze, iron, silver, golden, and finally jade. Each tier represented the Myriad Manifestations Sect's assessment of a cultivator's current and future potential.

As for how to successfully register and advance to a higher-tier token, that would depend on each cultivator's performance in the upcoming Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

Having successfully registered, Ning Zhuo, Shen Xi, and Su Lingkou departed on their clouds, each carrying their wooden tokens.

Shen Xi asked, "Brother Ning, where are you headed now?"

Ning Zhuo replied, "Naturally, I'll choose a Martial Arts Hall to experience the atmosphere. After all, this is my first time at the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

Shen Xi stroked the jade token at his waist and smiled slightly. "It seems our paths align!"

Noticing Ning Zhuo's slow cloud-riding pace, Shen Xi directly invited, "Brother Ning, why not ride with me?"

Ning Zhuo readily agreed.

Shen Xi summoned a vehicle-shaped Magic Artifact. It wasn't a Mechanism but rather a seamless, bronze-colored chariot with non-rotating wheels.

After Su Lingkou activated it, the Bronze Flying Chariot accelerated rapidly and maneuvered with remarkable agility, quickly reaching the nearest Martial Arts Hall.

From the chariot, the trio observed the scene below: the hall was packed with cultivators, the atmosphere buzzing with excitement.

Ning Zhuo remarked, "Now that everyone has their identity tokens after the first phase of registration, participating in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial is the only way to accumulate merit. That explains this frenzy."

Su Lingkou's face clouded with concern. "With so many people, should we even bother going down?"

Shen Xi remained silent, his gaze fixed on Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo suggested, "Let's try another hall."

The Myriad Manifestations Sect's Main Mountain Gate spanned a vast territory, housing hundreds, if not thousands, of Martial Arts Halls.

The Bronze Flying Chariot sped through the air, soon arriving at a Martial Arts Hall located away from the registration areas. As a result, it was significantly less crowded than the others.

As the trio disembarked from the chariot and stepped onto the plaza before the hall, a cultivator emerged, sneering, "Who do we have here? It's the Shen Clan brat!"

Shen Xi, the Shen Clan's renowned prodigy, was being addressed with such contempt. The speaker clearly knew Shen Xi's background yet maintained this hostile attitude, signaling ill intentions.

Ning Zhuo remained impassive, sizing up the cultivator.

Though appearing young, the man had a full head of gray hair, his eyes sunken like a skull's. He wore a wide robe crafted from Hundred-Python Skin, his expression arrogant, his gaze sharp as a blade, deliberately provoking them.

Standing beside the gray-haired young cultivator was a towering nine-foot-tall man with the body of a tiger and the head of a human. His massive frame was rippling with muscles, and a pair of wings sprouted from his back. His entire body was covered in tawny tiger fur.

He was unmistakably a ferocious tiger demon cultivator.

Shen Xi's expression darkened. "Pi Fujie?"

The Shen Clan of Nine Palaces Immortal City wielded immense power and had several formidable enemies, the Pi Clan being one of them.

The Pi Clan's cultivators primarily cultivated the demonic art known as the Seven Talisman Demonic Skin Sutra. They were also renowned for their mastery of talisman crafting and paper effigy techniques, boasting not only vast influence but also numerous vassals.

The gray-haired young cultivator before them, Pi Fujie, occupied a similar position within the Pi Clan as Shen Xi did within the Shen Clan. However, due to his mid-grade Innate Talent and having undergone three Calamity Transformations, he enjoyed far greater expectations and support than Shen Xi.

Pi Fujie narrowed his eyes as he surveyed Ning Zhuo, Shen Xi, and Su Lingkou. His voice dripped with cold disdain as he said, "Shen Xi, I've heard you were sent by the Shen Clan to participate in the Flying Cloud Assembly."

"Hmph! Meeting you here ahead of time? Consider yourself unlucky!"

Anyone hearing these words would immediately recognize the deep-seated animosity between the two clans.

Shen Xi sneered. "Your words echo my own. This is the Martial Arts Hall, Pi Fujie. I'll gladly face any challenge you throw at me. Let's settle this with a Martial Arts duel - life or death!"

Within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, matters in the Martial Arts Hall were considered beyond life and death.

During martial arts demonstrations between cultivators, accidents were inevitable, and deliberate sabotage was not uncommon.

The Myriad Manifestations Sect permitted such incidents to occur without intervention.

This policy stemmed from the sheer number of cultivators within the sect.

Only the most exceptional could be selected for advancement.

An Elder of the Myriad Manifestations Sect once bluntly stated, "Anyone slain in the Martial Arts Hall simply lacked the fortune to survive. Such individuals were never meant to join the sect in the first place."

This remark, though brutally honest, sparked a public outcry, leading to the Elder's immediate demotion. Years later, he returned to the Sect and regained a high-ranking position.

This incident revealed the Sect's true stance on the matter.

This attitude and operational principle were accepted by the Sect's upper echelons and other major powers, all of whom understood the Myriad Manifestations Sect's predicament.

Completely eliminating such incidents would be an impossible task.

The Sect's management simply couldn't handle it. The administrative costs would be astronomical, and the potential for corruption would be even greater.

If the Sect attempted to regulate these matters, they would have to grant immense authority to the Martial Arts Hall referees. What power could be greater than the power over life and death?

Such authority would inevitably lead to corruption - massive corruption.

Corruption was inevitable.

This would severely damage the Myriad Manifestations Sect's reputation.

Even if the judges were impartial, the side that lost a loved one would inevitably resent the sect, perceiving the judgment as unfair. This would create deep internal conflicts within the sect, accumulating immense karmic debt and consequences.

It would be better for the sect to remain neutral. That way, the conflict would remain confined to the two combatants, allowing the Myriad Manifestations Sect to maintain its aloof position.

Shen Xi's unwavering resolve, immediately adopting a life-or-death duel stance, momentarily stunned Pi Fujie.

How can you, Shen Xi, possibly compare to me? Pi Fujie thought to himself.

We both hold equal status within the Shen and Pi Clans, constantly being compared as the faces of Foundation Establishment and future hopes. But I possess Innate Talent, while you lack it. How could your future ever rival mine?

A life-or-death battle now? Pi Fujie felt he would be at a severe disadvantage.

Why would I agree to this?

He couldn't find a good reason.

He could simply cultivate to a later stage, allowing his Innate Talent to fully manifest its value and achieve a massive advantage in strength. Then, he could settle accounts with Shen Xi on his own terms!

Therefore, Pi Fujie had no intention of accepting the death match, yet he was unwilling to forfeit the opportunity to compete.

This contest wasn't just about personal ambition; it was also a clash of deep-seated grudges between the Shen and Pi Clans. Their animosity ran too deep, a blood feud that had long since passed the point of no return.

Shen Xi and Pi Fujie served as the public faces of their respective clans, and both placed immense importance on their rivalry. This wasn't merely a personal feud; it was a proxy war between the Shen and Pi Clans, steeped in political significance.

The outcome of each competition carried enormous consequences for both Shen Xi and Pi Fujie, as their families had invested heavily in their success.

Pi Fujie had no desire for a life-or-death duel with Shen Xi, but he couldn't afford to back down now. Retreating would be an admission of defeat born from fear, a catastrophic blow to the Pi Clan's reputation. Moreover, given their origins in the Demonic Path, Pi Fujie would face severe repercussions from his family.

Seeing Pi Fujie's silence, Shen Xi and Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with sharp insight. Both were shrewd observers who immediately recognized Pi Fujie's dilemma.

A faint smile curved Shen Xi's lips before quickly vanishing. Pressing his advantage, he taunted, "Pi Fujie, are you afraid? What's the matter? Don't dare to face me in a life-or-death martial arts duel?"

Su Lingkou was deeply worried and couldn't resist tugging secretly on Shen Xi's sleeve.

She feared Pi Fujie might actually accept the Martial Arts Hall challenge, putting her cousin's life in danger.

"Cousin is too brave!" she thought. "He's forgetting his noble status and bright future. Why rush into a life-or-death duel right away?"

Pi Fujie scoffed coldly. "Such a shallow provocation! Hmph! I'm no reckless fool. Besides, I bear a heavy responsibility this time, representing my clan in joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Shen Xi, just wait! Our life-or-death duel is inevitable, but let's postpone it for now."

This declaration alone wouldn't suffice. Pi Fujie had already devised a plan, turning his gaze toward Ning Zhuo.

"Is this the cultivator you've recruited?" Pi Fujie mistakenly assumed the relationship between Shen Xi and Ning Zhuo.

"Heh, this one's quite handsome. Shen Xi, do you have a taste for this kind?" Pi Fujie attempted to tarnish Shen Xi's reputation and divert the blame.

He couldn't easily counter Shen Xi's challenge, but Ning Zhuo, standing beside Shen Xi, was dressed plainly and radiated only a weak aura of spiritual energy, making him seem like an easier target.

Pi Fujie knew about Su Lingkou. If he targeted Shen Xi's cousin, Shen Xi would never let it go.

The unfamiliar cultivator beside Shen Xi hadn't been mentioned in the intelligence reports, suggesting he was an outsider.

Pi Fujie planned to bully this outsider, using it as an excuse to withdraw from the conflict and satisfy his family's demands.

He had miscalculated.

Hearing Pi Fujie's words, Ning Zhuo's eyebrows arched slightly, a faint smile appearing on his face as he released a chilling wave of killing intent.

Narrowing his eyes, he sized up Pi Fujie and said slowly, "This is quite amusing. A Foundation Establishment cultivator dares to speak to me like that. Heh, it's been a long time since anyone has tried such a thing."

Pi Fujie was inwardly startled, his mind racing with questions: Who is this man? Why is he so arrogant? His spiritual energy... it's clearly only mid-Foundation Establishment.

Shen Xi, witnessing Ning Zhuo's forceful response, was both surprised by the latter's assertiveness and secretly delighted. This was exactly the scenario he had hoped for.

Su Lingkou smiled faintly, her impression of Ning Zhuo improving instantly.

She suddenly recalled how Ning Zhuo had effortlessly dealt with Yu Heye and Lin Jinglong, leaving her and her cousin constantly speculating about his true capabilities. Now's the perfect opportunity to test his mettle, she thought.

She immediately stoked the flames, saying to Ning Zhuo, "It seems Young Master Pi Fujie is trying to bully a weak opponent, seeing your cultivation level as low."

Though her words were true, Shen Xi's expression immediately darkened, his heart sinking. Damn it! How could Ning Zhuo, a man of such discernment, fail to see through my cousin's intentions?

Shen Xi quickly tried to salvage the situation. "Brother Ning, Pi Fujie is blind to reason. Why bother arguing with such a fool? Besides, this is an old feud between the Shen and Pi Clans. The Pi Clan are practitioners of the Demonic Path. Years ago, they slaughtered innocents to collect souls for their cultivation..."

Pi Fujie couldn't stand to hear any more and interrupted, "Lies! My Pi Clan is a pillar of the Righteous Path! The Flying Cloud Kingdom itself issued a decree to clear our name! This may be the Myriad Manifestations Sect, but it's still part of the Flying Cloud Kingdom. How dare you, a mere servant, twist the truth and slander the righteous and virtuous?"

Shen Xi sneered coldly.

Ning Zhuo's gaze remained icy.

He was well aware of the history between the Shen and Pi Clans.

During the banquet he hosted for Lin Jinglong, he had inquired about the Shen Clan and confirmed that Shen Xi's account was accurate.

Before the Pi Clan was established, they were a band of Demonic Path cultivators, notorious for their cruelty and wickedness.

They roamed far and wide, committing atrocities by slaughtering living beings to harvest their souls. These souls served as the primary material for carving talismans onto their own skin, enhancing their power.

During this process, the Demonic Cultivator group clashed with the Shen Clan. They repeatedly attacked villages within the Shen Clan's territory, provoking the clan to launch a full-scale investigation and dispatch pursuers.

As the conflict escalated, with both sides trading blows and suffering losses, the animosity between them deepened.

The Pi Clan had enemies beyond the Shen Clan, but their feud with the Shen Clan ran deepest.

The Shen Clan began forging alliances, while the Pi Clan, after enduring prolonged and brutal battles, realized their precarious position. They then spent a fortune to "persuade" the Flying Cloud Kingdom's government to recognize them, effectively laundering their reputation and joining the Righteous Path.

However, this meant the Pi Clan could no longer engage in their former slaughtering practices.

To obtain souls, they were now limited to constructing Gates of the Underworld and hunting in the Underworld.

Ning Zhuo's display of unwavering resolve was deliberate.

Pi Fujie immediately tempered his demeanor, his gaze locking onto Ning Zhuo. "May I ask your esteemed name and origins?"

Ning Zhuo sneered, tilting his head slightly. "You're not worthy of asking. Come, the Martial Arts Hall is right here. I'll take Brother Shen's place in this life-or-death duel. If you're afraid of Brother Shen, are you also afraid of a nobody like me?"

"What 'nobody'? How dare you speak to me with such arrogance, revealing such hidden depths?" Pi Fujie seethed, nearly rolling his eyes in exasperation.

"Why does everyone keep resorting to life-or-death duels at the slightest provocation?"

"Are you even worthy of being called disciples of great clans? Don't you know a gentleman avoids standing beneath a crumbling wall? Is all this constant brawling and bloodshed truly meaningful?"

"Shouldn't such violent matters be left to thugs and subordinates?"

Though Pi Fujie didn't know Ning Zhuo's true background, Shen Xi's respectful demeanor toward him made it clear that Ning Zhuo was no ordinary person.

Pi Fujie had no desire to fight him.

Fighting him would be far more troublesome than fighting Shen Xi.

At least I understand Shen Xi well enough. But this man... he's utterly unpredictable.

As these thoughts raced through his mind, Pi Fujie gritted his teeth in frustration.

Damn it! Why couldn't you at least dress properly?

Ning Zhuo's attire was understated, lacking the ostentatious flair of Shen Xi and Su Lingkou. Even the Hundred-Python Skin he wore - a magic treasure-grade garment - was considered extravagant for a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"What's wrong? Afraid? You can't even accept a challenge from a mere mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator like me?" Ning Zhuo sneered.

Having exposed Pi Fujie's weakness, he pressed his advantage relentlessly.

Pi Fujie barely suppressed his anger, clasping his hands in a formal gesture. "May I ask your esteemed name and origins, sir?"

Ning Zhuo retrieved his Five Elements Mechanical Fan, unfurled it, and gently fanned himself. "Curious, are you? That's fine."

"Let's have a life-or-death duel. I'll tell you the answer before I kill you."

"Don't worry, I'll make sure you die knowing everything."

Ning Zhuo had no intention of revealing his identity or background. The Ning Clan had fled the Northwind Kingdom and currently relied on the Zhu Clan to maintain a foothold in the Southern Bean Kingdom.

The Ning Clan's overall strength paled in comparison to the Pi Clan's.

Therefore, his Ning Clan affiliation was best kept hidden.

Ning Zhuo maintained his aggressive stance, largely because he genuinely didn't take Pi Fujie seriously.
