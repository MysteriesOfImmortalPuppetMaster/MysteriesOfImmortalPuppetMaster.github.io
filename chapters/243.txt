Chapter 243: Beast Tide Frenzy

At the summit of Fire Persimmon Mountain.

Meng Kui's entire body surged with magical power. At this moment, he exerted all his strength and unleashed his techniques!

He took out a treasured seal and threw it forward.

The magical artifact-level seal rapidly expanded in mid-air, transforming into a mountain that crashed down with a thunderous force.

The Treasure Seal Mountain blocked the volcano's opening, forcibly halting the eruption of lava.

In an instant, the lava flow was reduced by half, significantly alleviating the pressure on the front lines of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Meng Kui then retrieved a magical artifact-level gourd.

He opened the gourd's stopper and poured out a vast river.

The river water poured down like a deep cloth, flooding into the volcano's summit.

Steam rose, and for a moment, the smoke spread like a sea of clouds.

This river water was not ordinary; it was a special material Meng Kui had gathered from nature and refined multiple times, reaching the Foundation Establishment level!

After sacrificing a large amount of river water, Meng Kui successfully slowed the spread of the lava by another thirty percent.

Once the gourd was emptied, Meng Kui put away both the gourd and the Treasure Seal.

The Treasure Seal had withstood the lava's eruption, and its surface was nearly half-damaged.

Meng Kui couldn't afford to feel heartache. He spread his arms, his sleeves billowing, and performed another of his signature techniques.

Divine Ability—Universe Within the Sleeve!

In the next moment, his two sleeves rapidly expanded, their openings as large as houses, dark and deep.

From within the sleeves, a powerful suction force erupted.

Countless streams of lava were drawn in by this force, converging into two torrents that flowed into Meng Kui's sleeves.

Meng Kui diverted the lava at its source, single-handedly suppressing thirty percent of the lava flow.

Through his and the entire city's relentless efforts, the spread of the lava slowed more and more, eventually coming to a complete stop after devouring a few peripheral buildings on the city's outskirts.

"We won, we won, we won!"

"Fire Persimmon Immortal City is saved, my home is saved!" "Hahaha..."

The city was filled with cheers.

People were jubilant, shouting and celebrating with extreme excitement, but a few still wore worried expressions, their faces somber.

Among them were Zhu Xuanji and Fei Si.

Zhu Xuanji's eyes glowed with golden light as he tried to peer into the mountain's interior through its surface.

He knew very well that the lava problem wasn't the biggest issue.

The real challenge lay within Fire Persimmon Mountain. More precisely, it was the countless Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts within the mountain.

Roar, roar...

The roars gradually drowned out the city's cheers and shouts.

Some people, hearing this commotion, showed puzzled expressions.

But more people realized what was happening, their faces turning pale.

"Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts!"

"This is bad. The volcanic tremors have triggered a beast tide of unprecedented terror." "What should we do? What should we do?"

Panic spread among the crowd once more.

A few breaths later, as the lava subsided, an endless horde of Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts surged out from the lava.

They were all in a state of rage!

Who wouldn't be furious if their peaceful life was suddenly turned upside down by an unexpected bombardment?

The Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts charged towards the Lava Immortal Palace like a tide.

They had pinpointed the source of the bombardment.

If one could hear their thoughts, it would undoubtedly be—revenge, revenge, revenge!

Leading the charge were the Fire Snakes.

The Fire Snakes' bodies were slender, like flowing flames, almost merging with the lava, seemingly omnipresent.

Following the snake horde were the Fire Velvet Mice.

These small yet ferocious demon beasts charged towards the Lava Immortal Palace in packs, like a red river.

The spherical barrier of Fire Persimmon Immortal City was being fiercely gnawed at by the mouse horde!

Among the mice, giant mice the size of elephants acted as leaders. Each of these giant mice was at the Golden Core Stage.

Even larger were the Stomping Flame Lizards, whose bodies, at the Golden Core level, were as massive as small hills.

Their limbs were thick, their skin covered in a layer of hard Scarlet Flame scales, and their tails burned with fire. Each breath they exhaled could stir up a fiery storm.

The Stomping Flame Lizards hissed and charged at the Lava Immortal Palace.

But the true kings among the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were the Fire Fusion Demon Apes!

These demon apes stood one to two zhang tall, their bodies covered in thick fur. The fur was a pure red, as if ablaze.

The demon apes bared their fangs, their eyes wide, each one burly and strong. Many of them beat their chests, roaring, their cries shaking the heavens.

Among all the demon beasts, the demon apes were the most intelligent, making them the most threatening beast horde.

Besides these three main forces, there were also numerous Red Rock Demons.

They emerged one after another from the lava, slowly floating in the air, surrounding the Lava Immortal Palace from above.

These stone heads were densely packed, numbering in the thousands, an unprecedented quantity.

The demon beasts knew the source of the bombardment and targeted the Lava Immortal Palace for revenge. But the beast tide was too massive, and in their rage, many lost their senses, blindly charging in all directions. A significant portion of them headed straight for Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

There was no time for words. Zhu Xuanji and the other Golden Core cultivators stood at the front lines, fighting fiercely.

For a moment, the battlefield was in a stalemate.

Ning Zhuo's cannon shot had stirred up a hornet's nest!

He had thoroughly enraged the massive Scarlet Flame Demon Beast horde within Fire Persimmon Mountain.

At the mountain's summit, Meng Kui continued to make moves, his Nascent Soul-level spells covering the area, slaying many Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.

But more demon beasts emerged endlessly from the lava, impossible to kill them all.

"Damn it!"

Meng Kui cursed harshly, for he sensed a Nascent Soul-level life force among the beast horde.

It seemed to be a Fire Snake!

It hid within the lava, its presence flickering. And it was precisely this unsheathed blade that exerted the most psychological pressure.

In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the citizens' cheers had vanished.

They watched in terror as the massive beast horde spread towards them.

The demon beasts were so numerous, they blotted out the sky! Under such a tide, a person seemed so small and helpless.

Ding-character, underground secret base.

Amidst the battle above ground, this underground base occasionally shook violently.

Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu were hiding inside.

"The volcano erupted, and the demon beasts are attacking the city!" Yang Chanyu hadn't severed her connection with the outside world.

Such a significant event, she was naturally aware of it.

"Sun Lingtong, what exactly is going on?" Yang Chanyu looked at Sun Lingtong, her intuition telling her that this matter seemed related to him.

Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes and spread his hands: "I don't know either, why bother with these things?" "Now the whole city is in chaos, almost everyone is doing their best to defend their homes."

"This opportunity is rare! Let's think about where it's most suitable to make a move?"

Yang Chanyu wasn't easily diverted, her eyes narrowing as she stared at Sun Lingtong with deep meaning: "Why do I feel like you're not surprised at all?" Sun Lingtong nodded: "Surprised, of course I'm surprised, but does it have anything to do with us?" "We're not from Fire Persimmon Immortal City, even if it gets destroyed, we can just leave." "Now is when all the major forces are at their weakest, if we're going to act, we should aim big. What do you think about those newly arrived Cloud Merchants?"

Yang Chanyu remained unmoved: "Your constant topic shifting is really suspicious. Tell me, what's your relationship with Ning Zhuo?" "During the previous Golden Core melee, I didn't notice anything."

"But the more I think about it, the more something feels off. You've done so much, had me play disguises, and even create a fake Demonic Dao Scripture." "Yet after the Golden Core melee, there was no follow-up treasure theft, the melee seemed more like a show." "Where's the big operation, the grand plan you mentioned?"

"Why do I feel like our actions were just to clear Ning Zhuo of suspicion, to ease his pressure?" "After all, the previous rumors were quite unfavorable for him."

Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes again: "What, you're overthinking it, aren't you?" "During the Golden Core melee, I wanted to act too, but the melee didn't fully break out." "Zheng Danlian's mechanical sickle was too fierce! Even the Golden Core true disciples of the Great Purity Palace had no power to resist." "In such a situation, how could I dare to make a big move?"

Sun Lingtong explained up to this point, then continued: "But this time, these Cloud Merchants and the three major families are different." "They're outsiders, and the magical artifacts they can carry are strictly regulated."

"Even if they have a Nascent Soul-level Cloud Whale, that giant creature is far outside the city, not suitable for capturing us." "I found out: this group of Cloud Merchants plans to hold an auction soon, with many high-end cultivation resources among the items." "For example, the water element treasure, Wirtuous Water, has three drops!" "Aren't you tempted by this?"

Yang Chanyu chuckled coldly: "Of course I've heard of this news. But those three drops of Virtuous Water, if you want to steal them for yourself, to cleanse our marriage, it's far from enough." Sun Lingtong sighed: "What are you talking about, I...

Just as he was speaking, Sun Lingtong's expression suddenly changed drastically, turning his head to look in a certain direction.

He shouted: "Who's there?!"

Yang Chanyu instantly became alert, taking out a magical artifact and holding it in her hand, but the entire underground base was empty, with no one in sight.

She showed a puzzled expression and glanced at Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong murmured: "Was it an illusion?"

He wasn't entirely sure either.

Immediately, his eyes flashed with cold light, and he said seriously: "In any case, this Ding-character underground secret base can't be used anymore, we need to move immediately!" Yang Chanyu had no objections.

Before leaving, Sun Lingtong took a moment to set up many traps in the Ding-character underground secret base.
