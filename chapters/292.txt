Chapter 292: Ning Zhuo vs. Meng Chong

"Bombard the Golden Furnaces?" Ning Zhuo shook his head, decisively refusing the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's suggestion. 

"Although this is possible for me, the cost is too great! The Golden Furnaces are the essence of the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest. If I bombard it, my merits will be deducted into the negatives again. It's not appropriate, very inappropriate!"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was anxious, trying its best to persuade, "But it's just the ruins of the Golden Furnaces, young master. The intact Golden Furnaces have strong defenses and might survive the bombardment!" 

Ning Zhuo shook his head again, "You can't be sure of that. It's too risky!"

"Are we just going to let Zhu Xuanji obtain clues about the Golden Furnaces?!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit glared, unable to understand why Ning Zhuo was so calm.

Ning Zhuo replied, "Calm down, I have already made arrangements. Just watch!"

Soon, a large number of mechanical constructs began to mobilize, forming several forces that proactively charged towards the invading Scarlet Flame Beasts.

This scene left Zhu Xuanji and others astonished.

They had anticipated this phase in advance and had instructed all respecialization team members who received duties from the Command Platform to ignore the defense tasks concerning the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest as much as possible.

Zhu Xuanji and others quickly contacted the cultivators holding relevant positions.

They found that no one had made such a deployment of forces.

Zhu Xuanji quickly believed their words.

The reason was simple: such a large-scale deployment of forces was unprecedented. A cultivator capable of such a feat must hold a very high position.

With the interception of the mechanical constructs, the Scarlet Flame Beasts were blocked at the periphery and unable to approach the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest.

Zhu Xuanji and others were also unable to make a move.

Ning Zhuo then mobilized the Five Elements Cannon Tower for continuous bombardment.

Even though many mechanical constructs were within the bombardment range, Ning Zhuo did not hesitate.

After all, these were not cultivators but mechanical constructs.

Even if they were destroyed, they could just be rebuilt.

In fact, these mechanical constructs, positioned as cannon fodder, only truly fulfilled their value by sacrificing themselves here!

With the Command Platform deploying forces and the Five Elements Cannon Tower attacking from afar, Ning Zhuo swiftly resolved the crisis in the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest.

Zhu Xuanji's hopes were dashed, but he showed no sign of disappointment.

He gazed with interest in the direction of the Command Platform.

After this battle, how could he not understand that the Command Platform had also been infiltrated by the enemy? And the enemy who acted was most likely the Void Sect!

"The cultivators secretly controlling all this do not even need to enter the Cannon Tower or the Command Platform to manipulate everything. Do they hold high positions, or have they mastered the loopholes in the Lava Immortal Palace?"

"No matter who they are, whether they hold high positions or have mastered loopholes, I understand that there must be important clues hidden here! The enemy is wary of my innate talent and the Origin Tracing Technique, so they are doing everything possible to obstruct me."

"Interesting, hehe."

Ning Zhuo's actions only further fueled Zhu Xuanji's determination to scour the Golden Furnace ruins for clues.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit paced about in the main hall.

It breathed a sigh of relief. The pressure in its heart eased somewhat, but it still felt like a giant stone was pressing down it.

As long as Zhu Xuanji was not eliminated, or the Golden Furnace ruins not destroyed, its grand plan for freedom was in danger of collapsing.

"Ning Zhuo was surprisingly reliable this time!"

"But it's still not stable."

"Why not just fire the cannon and destroy the Golden Furnace ruins? A decisive blow would be best!" 

So, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit contacted Ning Zhuo again, bringing up this suggestion.

Ning Zhuo shook his head, "I've already handed over the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. If I don't become the palace master, I definitely won't get it back. I must become the master of the Lava Immortal Palace!"

"Once I become the palace master, the entire Lava Immortal Palace will be mine. The Golden Furnace is too valuable; how can I destroy my treasure?" 

These words left the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit speechless.

It couldn't help but think, "What level are you at? You're just at the Qi Refining Stage! What makes you so confident that you can achieve ultimate victory in such a perilous situation?" 

"Ning Zhuo, you're overconfident."

"No, perhaps it's not confidence. This gambler has already lost his mind. He's betting on the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, betting on his life, and he can only gamble on winning in the end!" 

"This damned gambler!!"

"You're gambling with your life; don't drag me, the dragon turtle, into it."

At this moment, Ning Zhuo sent another message, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, I need your help! There will definitely be schemes against me emerging one after another."

"Since the Lava Immortal Palace is your territory, you need to keep an eye on those who are against me. You must report to me on time!" 

"If I'm caught off guard, it's your fault." 

"You need to perform well and help me win the position of palace master. Have confidence; the future is ours!" 

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit snorted angrily.

It felt that Ning Zhuo was becoming increasingly rude to it. Previously, there was a tone of negotiation, but now it was recieving outright orders.

"If you really become the palace master, commanding me here and there every day, will I have any good days left?" Just thinking about such a future made even a fire spirit shiver.

Ning Zhuo continued, "Did you hear me? We must cooperate fully."

"You alert me, and I'll fend off Zhu Xuanji while also preemptively countering any schemes against me." 

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shouted in frustration, "Such an annoyance!"

It took a few deep breaths, then pretended to be weak and agreed to Ning Zhuo's request, while also encouraging him to strive with all his might to win the position of palace master as soon as possible.

The second stage of the palace examination.

The eighth round.

Ning Zhuo stepped through the teleportation circle and onto the platform, immediately spotting his opponent.

Today's first opponent was unexpectedly Meng Chong.

Meng Chong also saw Ning Zhuo and gritted his teeth, "It's you! You narrowly won the last few times, but this time, I'll make you taste defeat!" 

Meng Chong's mechanical skills were very low, and he naturally had a complete losing record against Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo cupped his hands with a smile, "Brother Meng Chong, it's a pleasure to meet you in the first battle today."

Meng Chong waved his hand, "Spare me the useless, hypocritical nonsense. Huh? I can actually see you?" 

It was still the preparation phase, but everyone's vision was clear.

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, "It seems today's competition rules have changed slightly." Each round's content would undergo minor changes.

Over these days, all the cultivators had become accustomed to it.

Sure enough, new information came, announcing that this round would not conceal the refining process, allowing others to watch.

The palace examination officially began!

Meng Chong dashed to the table, starting to analyze and inspect the materials.

Ning Zhuo, with his hands behind his back, walked slowly to the table, scanning the materials and observing the surroundings.

There were many materials, some at the Qi Refining Stage level, others at the Foundation Establishment level.

The supply of materials had already evolved continuously from before.

Innate Talent - Wild Sprint Thunderclap!

After completing his inspection, Meng Chong boldly unleashed his most powerful trump card.

His entire body flickered with electric light, making each of his actions at least twice as fast!

Whether melting or cutting, these actions were also accelerated under the influence of his innate talent.

In the same amount of time, others could only create one mechanical construct, but Meng Chong could create two.

It was precisely this trump card that allowed him to win more than he lost by fighting two against one.

"His innate talent has been developed to such an extent; truly worthy of being a favored child of heaven." 

Even though Ning Zhuo had long been aware of Meng Chong's abilities, he couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration at this moment.

One must know that in the process of refining mechanical constructs, many steps and details require meticulous control.

Meng Chong achieved this even while doubling his speed.

His development of his innate talent had progressed incredibly fast.

Ning Zhuo clearly remembered that when Meng Chong first used Wild Sprint Thunderclap, he could only charge straight ahead. Unable to stop, his entire construct body crashed into the thread trap, cutting it into countless pieces.

Now, he was at ease.

"However, you still refuse to use your brain."

"Today's round isn't about being faster." 

Ning Zhuo's lips curled slightly, his whole demeanor relaxed.

Meng Chong's movements were swift, his progress surpassing Ning Zhuo's, and the entire refining process was clear for Ning Zhuo to see.

Thus, during Ning Zhuo's refining, he deliberately adjusted his design plan, specifically crafting mechanical components to counter Meng Chong's constructs.

Once the battle began, Ning Zhuo fought two against one, using the mechanical components to counter, and easily won.

"Ahhh!" Meng Chong grabbed his hair, somewhat frantic.

He had hoped to defeat Ning Zhuo and salvage his reputation after a series of losses, but unexpectedly, this time he lost even more decisively!

"Alright, alright, Ning Zhuo! Next time, we'll compete again!" Meng Chong was not discouraged and left harsh words before stepping off the platform.

This scene was witnessed by several cultivators below the platform.

Among them was a member of the Meng family.

He frowned, "This Qi Refining Stage junior, Ning Zhuo, seems to be winning a bit too often."

Realizing this, he quickly checked the battle records and was surprised to find that it wasn't his imagination; Ning Zhuo's personal battle record was indeed among the top!

Ning Zhuo's previous battles were always close calls, often narrowly winning, which easily led to misunderstandings.

But this time, his decisive victory over Meng Chong made him noticed by those with keen eyes.

That night.

Ning Zhuo received bad news - multiple security incidents had occurred in the black market. Even though the former stewards of the Ning family collectively mobilized, they suffered counterattacks from the assailants.

The black market was in chaos. Various merchants and vendors suffered varying degrees of loss.

These people quickly banded together, collectively demanding compensation from the black market!

In the black market, no one could make a decision. The City Lord's mansion also made an inquiry. Facing such immense pressure, they had no choice but to send a message to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo saw the message and felt a sense of realization, "It seems someone has finally noticed my outstanding battle record." Although he wanted to continue hiding, his exceptional talent in mechanical constructs could no longer be concealed.
