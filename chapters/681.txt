Chapter 681: Cultivation Doesn't Determine Victory

The Thousand Peaks Forest Campaign and the Lord of the Forgotten River Battle had allowed Ning Zhuo to accumulate over a hundred Golden Cores.

Most of these came from the Black Cloud Battlefield.

Luo Si's betrayal had been the turning point in that battle. After the two Nascent Soul-level leaders fell, the Golden Core-level Imperial Guard cultivators also met their demise.

As a result, the majority of Golden Cores in Ning Zhuo's possession were cultivated using Ghost Dao and Soul Dao techniques.

Faced with Shen Xi's skepticism, Ning Zhuo smiled and replied, "The Five Elements Technique is the most common. Therefore, Five Elements Golden Cores won't be scarce, which suits my needs perfectly."

Inwardly, he was planning: Golden Cores cultivated with Ghost Dao and Soul Dao techniques aren't suitable for the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel. Perhaps I can trade them for Five Elements Golden Cores.

In this regard, the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Trade Hall should be able to meet Ning Zhuo's needs.

Of course, I won't make any trades in the near future.

Even when I do trade, I'll use aliases and disguises, or have Old Sun help me.

As a newcomer, I can't afford to draw unnecessary attention.

Su Lingkou glanced at Ning Zhuo, finding his tone rather arrogant. You're only at the Foundation Establishment Stage, yet you treat Golden Cores so casually. My cousin is far more humble and grounded.

Ning Zhuo turned to Shen Xi, pressing him for his thoughts on the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel.

"Intriguing," Shen Xi replied, his interest piqued as he shared his insights.

Obstacles, Ning Zhuo mused, carefully considering the challenges and posing a series of probing questions.

Shen Xi answered each one in detail, their conversation growing increasingly animated.

Shen Xi gained a deeper understanding of Ning Zhuo. "While Ning Zhuo's mastery of the Formation Dao may not rival mine, his foundational knowledge is remarkably solid. Of course, as a scion of a Great Clan, his grounding in the Four Great Arts of Cultivation would naturally be exceptional."

This realization only enhanced Shen Xi's respect for Ning Zhuo.

"It seems Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo has devoted decades of cultivation to the Five Elements," Shen Xi observed.

"This explains why he's only at the mid-Foundation Establishment Stage."

"Given his focus, his progress in the Formation Dao is perfectly understandable."

Had Ning Zhuo displayed exceptional proficiency in the Formation Dao, Shen Xi would have begun to suspect he was an ageless cultivator who had mastered the art of preserving his youth.

Yu Heye watched the exchange with fascination.

Throughout the conversation, Ning Zhuo maintained an exceptionally humble demeanor, showing no trace of arrogance and consistently seeking guidance with genuine sincerity.

This revealed a completely different side of Ning Zhuo to Yu Heye.

Su Lingkou, however, found this entirely natural. During her time with her cousin, she had witnessed countless cultivators seeking Shen Xi's counsel and engaging in scholarly discussions.

Shen Xi's enthusiasm for the conversation grew steadily.

He no longer merely answered but began to expound on his understanding of the Formation Dao.

"Among the Ten Great Still Formations, I am most proficient in the Nine Palaces Formation."

"In my humble opinion, the Nine Palaces Formation possesses a unique and ingenious mechanism, setting it apart significantly from the other nine formations!"

Formations can be broadly categorized into Static Formations and Dynamic Formations.

Static Formations comprise the Ten Great Still Formations, the classics among classics, their status unshakeable. Dynamic Formations, on the other hand, are diverse in type, with a history far shorter than that of Static Formations, and are primarily used in battle formations. Examples include the Iron Bucket Formation, the Red Flower Formation, and Sun Lingtong's Thief's Gentle Breeze Formation.

The Ten Great Still Formations are: Primordial Chaos Formation, Primordial Qi Formation, Dual Polarity Formation, Three Realms Formation, Four Symbols Formation, Five Elements Formation, Six Harmonies Formation, Seven Stars Formation, Eight Trigrams Formation, and Nine Palaces Formation.

Shen Xi explained his reasoning: "Most Dual Polarity and Three Realms Formations emphasize mutual generation and restraint, establishing cycles based on directional positioning. Their Formation Cores typically serve as central nodes for converging spiritual energy, divine power, and similar forces."

"The Nine Palaces Formation, however, relies on mathematical calculations! The nine palaces resonate and rotate in harmony. Each palace independently gathers spiritual energy or divine power, maintaining relative autonomy. The Formation Core of the Nine Palaces Formation must therefore bear the computational and deductive functions."

Knowing Ning Zhuo's expertise in the Five Elements, Shen Xi deliberately avoided mentioning the Five Elements Formation in their discussion.

Ning Zhuo nodded. "Among the Hundred Crafts of Cultivation, Formation Deployment is one of the Four Great Arts. Among the Ten Great Still Formations, the Nine Palaces Formation truly amplifies combat power the most."

Shen Xi, mindful of Ning Zhuo's feelings, didn't mention the Five Elements Formation. But Ning Zhuo, being naturally humble and eager to learn, never took such considerations to heart.

His solid foundation in Formation principles allowed Ning Zhuo to fully appreciate the Nine Palaces Formation's advantages.

He continued with examples: "Let's start with the basic prototypes of the Ten Great Still Formations. The Five Elements Formation's mutual generation amplification is only three to five times, while the Eight Trigrams Formation's trigram amplification is approximately six to eight times. The Nine Palaces Formation, however, offers a nine to twelve times amplification."

"And these are just the most basic prototype formations."

After a pause, Ning Zhuo added, "I've done some calculations in my spare time."

"If you use the Five Elements prototype formation to create a light shield to withstand a single attack from a Nascent Soul cultivator, it would cost at least 50,000 Spirit Stones."

"But if you use the Nine Palaces Formation and transfer the Nascent Soul cultivator to the Xun Fourth Palace before absorbing the attack, the cost drops to just over 9,000 Spirit Stones - an 80% reduction in cost!"

"Similarly, trapping three Golden Core cultivators with the Eight Trigrams Formation requires 3,000 Spirit Stones. But for the same duration, the Nine Palaces Formation saves 75% of the Spirit Stones."

Su Lingkou muttered inwardly, "Why does Ning Zhuo always use Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators as examples? Has he forgotten he's only at the Foundation Establishment Stage?"

Why can't cultivators with lower cultivation levels use examples of those with higher cultivation levels?

Ning Zhuo had never held such a rigid mindset.

As early as his time in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, his hypothetical enemies had been the City Lord's Mansion, Nascent Soul-level cultivators like Meng Kui, and his Golden Core-level subordinates.

From a young age, he had pondered how to overcome the strong with the weak. This spirit of inquiry had become deeply ingrained in his very bones.

Ning Zhuo's explanation made Shen Xi realize that Ning Zhuo wasn't merely flattering him; he genuinely held this perspective.

Shen Xi clapped his hands and laughed, "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo truly understands me!"

His enthusiasm surged. "There are many examples of using the Nine Palaces Formation to overcome the strong with the weak. Let me give you an example from our own Flying Cloud Kingdom."

"Fifteen years ago, the Azure Cloud Sect was attacked by Demonic Cultivators."

"The Azure Cloud Sect was a small sect, its strongest member being Chu Ping, a peak Golden Core cultivator renowned for his skill in Formation Deployment."

"Chu Ping, along with twenty-seven Foundation Establishment disciples, defended the sect's mountain gate."

"Their opponents were the infamous Nascent Soul Demonic Cultivator, Blood Corpse Old Demon, and his three thousand Blood Coagulation Corpses."

"Chu Ping had his Foundation Establishment disciples guard the Nine Palaces, while he himself entered the Central Fifth Palace as bait, luring the Old Demon into the formation for a decisive strike."

"Once the Blood Corpse Old Demon entered the formation, Chu Ping immediately shifted the palace positions, locking the main battlefield between the Li Ninth Palace and the Kun Second Palace."

"The final burst of flames, amplified eighty-one times by the Li Ninth Palace and then quadrupled by the Kun Second Palace, instantly incinerated the Blood Corpse Old Demon's physical body, forcing his Nascent Soul to flee. All three thousand Blood Coagulation Corpses were also reduced to ashes."

Shen Xi continued, "Over seventy years ago, the Chess Maniac, one of the Four Great Rogue Cultivators of the Flying Cloud Kingdom, fulfilled his dying friend's final wish by designing a formation trial. He intended to entrust his friend's legacy to the cultivator who successfully passed the test."

"The Chess Maniac arranged nine mystical stones in a valley to form the Nine Palaces Formation, and the sword cultivator Ling Xiao charged into the formation."

"Though both the Chess Maniac and Ling Xiao were Nascent Soul-level cultivators, Ling Xiao was widely acknowledged to be just a step away from the Transformation God-level, practically a quasi-Soul Formation cultivator."

"Initially, Ling Xiao advanced with unstoppable momentum, breaching four palaces in succession. But after the palace positions shifted, the Chess Maniac lured him into the Dui Seventh Palace."

"The Chess Maniac rearranged the Qian Six Palace to the rear, creating a cycle of marsh qi rising to the heavens and heavenly thunder returning to the marsh."

"Ling Xiao fought fiercely, forcibly breaking this cycle, but this destabilized the Zhen Three Palace. The resulting backlash from the Qian Six Palace amplified Ling Xiao's sword qi thirty-sixfold, then redirected it back at its original master."

"Ultimately, Ling Xiao was defeated, coughing up blood as he retreated from the formation."

Ning Zhuo listened intently, his eyes widening with understanding.

He nodded in agreement and added, "As far as I know, the most famous example of the Nine Palaces Formation allowing the weak to defeat the strong is the story of 'Child Traps the Dragon.'"

This tale was frequently recounted in formation manuals.

Xiao Man, a Foundation Establishment Stage fisherman's son, was being pursued by a Flood Dragon when he accidentally stumbled upon a peculiar place at the bottom of the river.

There, buried in the riverbed silt, lay a page from the Luoshu, lost long ago.

Over time, the surrounding environment had gradually transformed according to the principles recorded on the Luoshu page, forming a natural Nine Palaces Formation with the river's water veins as its defensive lines.

When Xiao Man was chased into this area, he obtained the Luoshu page and used his only nine Water-Repelling Copper Coins to activate the Nine Palaces Formation. Then, he daringly lured the Evil Flood Dragon into the trap.

The Evil Flood Dragon, unfamiliar with formations, had severely injured Xiao Man but found itself trapped within the Nine Palaces Formation. With each desperate struggle, its Nascent Soul was sealed to one-twentieth of its original strength. After repeated attempts to break free, the dragon was thoroughly sealed by the Nine Palaces Formation, ultimately becoming the villainous supporting character in the legendary tale of a Foundation Establishment cultivator defeating a Nascent Soul-level opponent.

This event had occurred long, long ago.

Yet its widespread dissemination ensured the story was repeatedly recorded in historical texts.

"The Luoshu?" Yu Heye finally found an opening to interject after listening for some time. "I know about that. It's the source of mathematics and holds immense value for studying formations, divination, and other disciplines."

"The Luoshu was shattered long ago. The page Yu Xiaoman obtained vanished after his failed Calamity Crossing."

How shallow! Yu Heye's understanding of formations paled in comparison to Ning Zhuo's.

Born of humble origins, he had lacked foundational training in his youth and had never developed a personal interest in the subject.

Ning Zhuo and Shen Xi were engrossed in their conversation, nearly causing Yu Heye to yawn. Finally seizing the opportunity to speak, he felt his spirits lift.

Using this opening, he began describing the delicacies on the table, attempting to steer the conversation back to food.

Although Shen Xi was a complete novice when it came to Spirit Chef techniques, his advanced age and extensive consumption of Spirit Stones meant he was at least familiar with the realm of culinary arts.

However, after a few bites and sips, Shen Xi steered the conversation back to the Nine Palaces Formation.

His expertise in formations stemmed from both his clan's early training and his own deep-seated interest.

Passion is often the best teacher.

Without this passion, Shen Xi would never have achieved such mastery in formations. He had devoted countless hours and immense energy to this pursuit, sacrificing opportunities to cultivate other techniques.

"Speaking of the Nine Palaces Formation," Shen Xi said, "we are currently within one."

Ning Zhuo looked puzzled. "Fellow Daoist Shen, are you saying the Protective Formation surrounding Vine-Clasping Cliff is a Nine Palaces Formation?"

Shen Xi nodded slightly. "Precisely."

"No, no," Yu Heye shook his head. "The Protective Formation of Vine-Clasping Cliff is called the Thousand Vines Drinking Clouds Formation. I'm certain of it."

To their surprise, Shen Xi nodded again. "That's correct."

This only deepened Ning Zhuo and Yu Heye's confusion.

Shen Xi smiled and explained, "Have you two noticed how unusually close the surrounding mountain peaks seem to Vine-Clasping Cliff?"

"This is actually a deliberate arrangement."

"The nine mountain peaks - Vine-Clasping Cliff, Profound Darkness Peak, Thunderclap Isle, Cloud-Scraping Summit, Jade Marrow Hill, and the others - each possess their own mountain-protecting Grand Formations, yet collectively they form the Nine Palaces Formation."

Ning Zhuo's heart stirred slightly.

His late mother's cave abode, Jade Rinse Retreat, had been located on Cloud-Scraping Summit.

Yu Heye raised an eyebrow. "Is that so?"

Shen Xi nodded. "This Nine Palaces Formation was deployed by Minister Xie Tang, the Pivot of Formations, from Heavy Formation Peak..."

After Shen Xi's explanation, Ning Zhuo and Yu Heye finally understood the full context.

Xie Tang was a Nascent Soul-level cultivator who had once served as a high-ranking official in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, earning him the title "Minister Xie Tang, the Pivot of Formations."

Renowned for his mastery of Formation Deployment, he retired from his official duties to return to his sect and devote himself entirely to cultivation.

During an exchange event, he visited Nine Palaces Immortal City to give a lecture. The case study he used in his lecture was none other than this very Nine Palaces Formation.

Shen Xi recalled, "Senior Xie Tang's mastery of formations left me in awe. This Nine Palaces Formation was indeed his magnum opus. He even mentioned during the lecture that he had hidden a Formation Dao Treasure within the formation - one he no longer needed - for a destined individual to find. That detail left a particularly deep impression on me."

A glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he feigned piqued interest. "Oh? What kind of Formation Dao Treasure?"

Shen Xi shook his head. "Fellow Daoist Ning, this treasure is a hot potato. It cannot be casually claimed."

Ning Zhuo feigned ignorance. "Why is that?"

Su Lingkou covered her mouth with a smile. "It's actually Senior Xie Tang's method of selection. He uses it to identify cultivators with significant Formation Dao aptitude, making it easier for him to recruit them to Heavy Formation Peak."

"Many seniors within the Myriad Manifestations Sect employ similar tactics, like baiting a fishing hook."

"Taking his Formation Dao Treasure establishes a karmic connection with him, creating a debt that marks you as affiliated with Heavy Formation Peak."

"That's why cultivators with other ambitions never actively seek to claim this treasure."

Ning Zhuo nodded. "Thank you for clarifying. It aligns with my suspicions."

He turned to Shen Xi and casually asked the question he truly wanted answered: "Fellow Daoist Shen, you undoubtedly possess the capability to claim this treasure, yet you haven't done so..."

Shen Xi nodded. "Senior Xie Tang's scheme isn't difficult to unravel. However, I'm not a rogue cultivator; I represent my clan."

"Before coming here, my clan elders repeatedly warned me against prematurely aligning with any faction. I'm sure Fellow Daoist Ning understands this well."

This was not the case for Ning Zhuo.

As the head of his branch clan, the entire Ning clan branch answered to him.

Moreover, he wielded considerable influence within the Two Note Kingdom, particularly among the Three Generals Camp. His identity as the "Old Stone Monster" also commanded respect within the Thousand Peaks Forest.

He was even the Vice City Lord of White Paper Immortal City.

Shen Xi paused, visibly hesitant, before finally saying, "This year's Flying Cloud Assembly may differ from previous sessions. We plan to establish a small foothold first and observe the situation."

Ning Zhuo's heart stirred, immediately understanding Shen Xi's veiled reference to the clash between the old and new factions, and the incidents at Purple Thunder Peak and Flowing Cloud Peak.

Yu Heye, however, stared wide-eyed, his face a mask of confusion. "What's different?"

As the oldest member and longest-serving member of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he should have noticed such nuances. Yet his origins as a rogue cultivator had left him oblivious to these political currents. His cultivation art, the Inverted Five Elements Demonic Art, was a Nascent Soul-level technique with limited potential. His greatest achievement had been nearly qualifying as a Golden Core True Disciple.

It's worth noting that the Myriad Manifestations Sect had a considerable number of Golden Core True Disciples.

Yu Heye had never held a position of power within the sect, his experiences were narrow, and his primary focus had always been on avoiding cultivation deviation.

The world of cultivation was vast and varied, encompassing a hundred crafts and a thousand paths of life.

Cultivation level alone did not determine victory.

There were countless ways for the weak to overcome the strong.

Formations were one such method, and strategic planning another.

No matter how high one's cultivation, ignorance of the political landscape could lead to manipulation, reducing one to a mere pawn or enforcer.
