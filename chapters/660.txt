Chapter 660: The Prefecture Lord's Scheme Succeeds

An indescribable explosion erupted!

Buddhist Light shot skyward, while the terrifying Earth Lung Turbid Qi formed a shockwave that surged in all directions.

The Klesha Extinction Buddha Intent rose, swiftly weakening and ultimately extinguishing the shockwave, turbid qi, and Buddhist Light.

Rain fell from the sky, its vapor swirling and churning.

The Branch of the Wangchuan River, now reduced to less than one percent of its original size, carried shattered prayer beads and an Ice Coffin that froze the surrounding water.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom's shattered body floated silently.

Its form had shrunk by more than eighty percent from its original size, covered in horrifying wounds. From these wounds, specks of Buddhist Light continuously seeped out, its aura plummeting to the lowest depths, as if on the verge of disintegrating at any moment.

Yet its right hand firmly grasped half of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's ruined divine body.

Unattended, the Branch of the Wangchuan River was easily crossed by the Nirvana Buddha Phantom.

Holding the half-destroyed body of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, the Buddha's phantom stepped onto the Sacrificial Altar, one foot in front of the other.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God reacted slowly, reaching out to grasp the Nirvana Buddha Phantom's arm.

But that was his limit.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let out a defiant roar, then disintegrated into a massive yellow haze of smoke and dust that enveloped the sacrificial altar, using its last shred of strength to hinder the enemy.

The Buddha's phantom shook his head with a faint smile. "You'd rather dissipate your Divided Spirit and body to stall me with your final strength?"

"Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, you've lost your composure."

"If you maintained your Divided Spirit, it would have drawn upon the last reserves of my Lifebound Buddha Wheel to suppress you."

He released his grip, spreading his fingers, and let the yellow haze disperse.

With his withered, crumbling feet that seemed ready to fall apart at any moment, the Buddha ascended the steps, one by one, climbing toward the highest point of the altar.

The crimson glow that once shrouded the altar had dwindled to a millstone-sized mass.

Within this bloodlight, the Heavenly Ghost Skull had dissolved into a deep blue liquid.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom raised his remaining right hand to his chest, palm upright, and intoned:

"Sunken ships sink deeper, withered trees turn green in death.

Defeat hides in the Heavenly Game, a faint light becomes a star in the fight."

He ascended to the summit of the sacrificial altar and stood firm. Extending his right hand, he plunged his fingers into the blood-red glow, making contact with the dark blue liquid.

In an instant, the liquid abruptly transformed, coalescing into a deep blue skull.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom, whose countenance had remained as tranquil as an ancient well, underwent a sudden, dramatic change. His eyes widened, radiating an expression of incredulous joy.

He continued chanting the second half of the verse:

"Having climbed the heavenly stairs, I now behold your true form. In this fleeting moment of forgetting, the Buddha reveals his original name."

"So this is it!"

Before going to battle, the Soundless Ghost Monk had successfully prayed to the Buddha and received this Revealing Word. Only now did he finally grasp its meaning.

"The Buddha reveals his original name" directly pointed to this Acquired Talent!

This was both the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long plan, a Dao Path designed to complement his innate talent, and the Soundless Ghost Monk's own gamble - a sacrificial battle that had won him this Buddhist Affinity!

This talent would bring a qualitative leap to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, and for the Soundless Ghost Monk, it offered tremendous potential for soaring success.

Even the Soundless Ghost Monk couldn't suppress his overwhelming joy, causing the Silent Extinction Buddha Intent to grow increasingly dim.

In fact, the entire Buddha's phantom was fading, like dense fog exposed to sunlight, visibly thinning before their eyes.

"Has the True Form still not arrived, even after all this fighting?"

"Even though it was far away earlier, that was likely to lull the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and others into complacency. By now, it should have arrived."

"What could be holding it up?"

A flicker of concern crossed the Nirvana Buddha Phantom's face.

"Hmm?"

His gaze paused, catching sight of Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and Luo Si.

Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi had been patiently waiting for Luo Si to recover as much as possible. But then they heard a deafening explosion, followed by silence - no further sounds of battle.

Ignoring his injuries, Luo Si opened his eyes and urged Ning Zhuo to move.

As the trio emerged from the passage, they saw the Nirvana Buddha Phantom clutching the Heavenly Ghost Skull, his delight barely concealed.

Huff!

Luo Si exhaled a cloud of turbid qi. "I never expected the Soundless Ghost Monk to be the ultimate victor!"

"Soundless Ghost Monk?" Ning Zhuo asked curiously.

Qing Chi frowned, scanning the Altar Battlefield. "Where did the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord go? Could the Great Buddha have eliminated him?"

Driven by a desire for revenge, she urgently searched for her enemy.

Hack! Cough! Cough!

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was racked with violent coughs.

In an instant, he had traversed thousands of miles, harnessing the power of the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Grand Formation to teleport back to Forgetful River Immortal City.

The surrounding cultivators hurriedly prostrated themselves upon seeing him.

The Prefecture Lord first glanced behind him, his pupils constricting as he saw the empty Formation Core of the Earth Aspect Formation. Fury surged within him.

"You worthless fools!"

"You couldn't even defend the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier!"

"Where is he?"

The cultivators stammered, pleading for forgiveness.

"Get out of my sight," the Prefecture Lord snapped, dismissing them without a second thought.

Alone at last, he settled into a cross-legged meditation, simultaneously recuperating and using the Grand Formation to remotely monitor the Sacrificial Altar.

Though he had retreated to his stronghold, he hadn't abandoned his plans entirely.

When the Nirvana Buddha Shadow ascended the altar to perform the bone-crushing ritual, the leader of the Forgetful River Prefecture smirked, his scheme coming to fruition. He murmured, "Soundless Ghost Monk, this altar isn't as easy to ascend as you think."

As the words left his lips, the Nirvana Buddha Phantom's expression abruptly shifted. It lowered its head to gaze downward.

Chunks of the Buddha's body began to disintegrate.

This sacrificial altar was no ordinary structure; it served as the core of the Heavenly Aspect Formation, a formidable artifact. To ascend it, three conditions had to be met simultaneously:

First, a foundation of at least a million souls was required.

Second, sufficient demonic qi was needed to suppress the altar.

Third, one must possess a Fate Attribute capable of enduring Divine Retribution.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom, being a temporary Divine Buddha body manifested through the Silent Extinction Buddha Power of the Lifebound Buddha Wheel, naturally lacked any soul foundation.

This phantom radiated the terrifying Silent Extinction Buddha Intent, which made it difficult for other realms of consciousness to coexist with it. This was evident in battle, where even the most potent Earthly Fiend Qi of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God proved incapable of corrupting the Buddha's body.

Thus, the phantom also lacked any demonic qi.

As for a Fate Attribute, that was even more absent. If the Nirvana Buddha descended personally, or even the true form of the Soundless Ghost Monk, they might have met this requirement. But the Lifebound Buddha Wheel was merely a magic treasure - what Fate Attribute could it possibly possess?

Without a Fate Attribute, how could it withstand Divine Retribution?

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had sacrificed the Underworld Celestial Heavens, channeling the Netherworld Azure Heaven Power into the Heavenly Ghost Skull to nurture its growth. In other words, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had secured the support of the Nether Heavens.

Having obstructed and defeated the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, the Nirvana Buddha Phantom naturally incurred divine retribution.

The power of the Heavenly Azure Heaven descended!

This caused the Nirvana Buddha Phantom to collapse on a massive scale.

"Trapped!" In an instant, the Soundless Ghost Monk's divine sense finally realized the deception.

Earlier, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's withdrawal of his True Form had been both a strategic retreat to avoid annihilation and the beginning of his scheme.

He even deliberately dispersed the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God to lull the Soundless Ghost Monk's divine sense into a false sense of security.

By commanding the Buddha's phantom to ascend the sacrificial altar, the Soundless Ghost Monk had unwittingly triggered the trap.

Unlike the Ash Bone Elder, who had warned him of the altar's dangers, the Soundless Ghost Monk remained unaware of the hidden perils.

Had his physical body been present, with its boundless divine sea and lightning-quick thoughts, he might have sensed the conspiracy and avoided the altar.

But within the Buddha's phantom resided only a fragment of his divine sense, already drained to its limits after prolonged battle, both his Buddha power and divine sense depleted to critical levels.

As the saying goes: "Even the wisest man makes mistakes."

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had seized this weakness to craft his scheme.

And he had succeeded!

The power of Divine Retribution coiled around the Buddha's phantom, impossible to dispel.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom sighed, clutching the Heavenly Ghost Skull as it rose into the air.

It knew its destruction was inevitable, but the ultimate winner wasn't necessarily its opponent.

"As long as I use all my strength to escape this place, I might be able to reunite with my True Form."

Its essence was the Lifebound Buddha Wheel, so it couldn't directly use the Heavenly Ghost Skull. But if it could reunite with its True Form and deliver the skull before the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord returned, it would secure victory!

"If I can't reunite, I'll bury the skull halfway and buy as much time as possible."

"In that case, I'll have to rely on my True Form to find it sooner."

Just as the Nirvana Buddha Shadow flew off the sacrificial altar, there was a splash.

Waves surged again as a branch of the Wangchuan River, like a massive water python, surged forward in pursuit.

The Nirvana Buddha Shadow focused its gaze and swiftly spotted the ice coffin and beaded string within the river branch.

The ice coffin had already been eroded by more than half, but the Nether Dragon Scissors inside trembled slightly, radiating power outward. The beaded string was severely damaged, only about thirty percent remaining, yet under the Nether Dragon Scissors' power, it still propelled the Wangchuan River branch.

Of course, none of this would be possible without Lord Wangchuan's true form. He was currently stationed within the Forgetful River Immortal City, remotely controlling the situation from a position of invincible advantage!

The Nirvana Buddha Shadow's heart sank.

The battle had once again devolved into a stalemate, and it was impossible to predict who would ultimately emerge victorious.

Would He collapse first, or manage to temporarily shake off the Branch of the Wangchuan River?

"Regardless, we must eliminate them first," the Nirvana Buddha Phantom suddenly veered course, turning towards Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and Luo Si.

"Damn it," Ning Zhuo instantly felt a surge of malicious intent bearing down on them.

"This great Buddha harbors ill intent!" Qing Chi, also sensitive to such things, agreed.

"Quick, retreat!" Luo Si shouted, his condition deteriorating rapidly, his combat strength now comparable to that of an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.

In the blink of an eye, the Nirvana Buddha Phantom had already extended a finger, pointing at the trio.

He had refrained from attacking Ning Zhuo and the Qing-Jiao Army earlier because he had just escaped confinement and recognized them as the Human Tribulation sent by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord - a tribulation manifesting from the Heavenly Mandate of the Mortal Realm.

Enemies of one's enemy are one's friends, so He had held back, focusing solely on the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

But now that the larger situation had clarified, He needed to renew his struggle against the Prefecture Lord.

Whether it was the Soundless Ghost Monk or the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord himself, both were in a wretched state, their power diminished to a critical point.

Under these circumstances, Ning Zhuo and his companions became a tremendous threat.

"These people are the Human Tribulation of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, backed by the Heavenly Mandate of the Azure Sky in the Living Realm. If we let them run unchecked, they might become the greatest beneficiaries!"

The Soundless Ghost Monk had come here to wage war, to halt the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Dao Path. This was partly due to their mutual blood feud, and partly because the Revealing Word hinted at a Buddhist Affinity.

He would never willingly relinquish that Buddhist Affinity!

In that instant, alarm bells went off in the minds of Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and Luo Si, their hair standing on end.

Luo Si shoved Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi aside. "I'll take the hit..."

But before he could finish speaking, the phantom's finger pierced the air and descended.

At the critical moment, a beam of Buddhist Light suddenly erupted from Ning Zhuo's divine sea!

The Buddhist Light shot skyward, radiating from Ning Zhuo's body.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom's finger, sensing the Buddhist Light, instantly dissipated without a trace.

"What... is this Buddha treasure?!" The Soundless Ghost Monk's divine sense trembled violently, utterly baffled.

Then, something even more horrifying occurred.

The Nirvana Buddha Body abruptly lost control. The Buddha himself had descended his will, casting an inquisitive gaze upon Ning Zhuo.

"Who is he? To warrant such attention from My Buddha?!" The Soundless Ghost Monk's divine sense trembled violently, overwhelmed by shock.

The Buddha Heart Demon Seal!

Ning Zhuo was equally astonished, never expecting the Precious Seal within his divine sea to be activated at this moment.

"No!" The Soundless Ghost Monk gritted his teeth, horrified as he realized the out-of-control Buddha Body was about to hurl the Heavenly Ghost Skull toward Ning Zhuo.

"This is mine! This is my Buddhist Affinity!!"

The Soundless Ghost Monk remained the Soundless Ghost Monk, and the Nirvana Buddha remained the Nirvana Buddha.

To preserve his Buddhist Affinity, the Soundless Ghost Monk dissolved the Divine Summoning Art embedded within his Lifebound Buddha Wheel.

The Nirvana Buddha Body completely disintegrated.

Yet the Divine Retribution power, like a relentless shadow, continued to descend upon the Lifebound Buddha Wheel.

Crack... Crack...

The Buddhist Wheel slowly spun, cracks spreading across its surface.

As its radiance dimmed, the Soundless Ghost Monk mustered his last shred of power, forcefully hurling the Heavenly Ghost Skull away.

Enveloped in a surge of Buddha power, the skull shot forth like a meteor, vanishing into the heavens in an instant.

Under the relentless assault of Divine Retribution, the Buddhist Wheel shattered, its fragments scattering. The Soundless Ghost Monk's divine sense was utterly exhausted, leaving the wheel reduced to an ordinary copper artifact that plummeted from the sky.

Luo Si instinctively activated his fishing technique, casting out half of the Netherworld Ferrying Line. He wrapped it around the severely damaged Buddhist Wheel and reeled it into his hands. The Buddhist Wheel, too badly damaged to resist, offered no resistance.

"We must hurry after it!" Qing Chi activated the Night Wanderer Divine Art and chased after the Heavenly Ghost Skull.

"Wait, get on my Mechanical Dragon!" Ning Zhuo slapped his belt, unleashing the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon!

The trio dove into the dragon, and it immediately took flight.

The Ten Thousand Li traversing Dragon instantly pierced through the air, vanishing from its original position.

Within the Forgetful River Immortal City, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's eyes glimmered with a cold light, a sharp smile curling his lips. "In the end, the ultimate victor remains this lord!"

Inside the Ten Thousand Li traversing Dragon, Qing Chi groped around in wonder. "Little Ma, how did you get such a treasure? When did you acquire it?"

Luo Si, usually composed, spoke with a hint of excitement. "This is the Ten Thousand Li traversing Dragon, capable of traversing the Void. With it, we can cover thousands of miles in moments, arriving ahead of the Heavenly Ghost Skull and ambushing it!"

Ning Zhuo sighed. "It's a pity the Ten Thousand Li traversing Dragon can't penetrate Formation barriers. Otherwise, that battle would have been far easier."

Ripples spread through the void as the Ten Thousand Li traversing Dragon materialized out of thin air.

After waiting for a moment, the trio still saw no sign of the Heavenly Ghost Skull.

"How is this possible?" Qing Chi frowned.

Luo Si and Ning Zhuo's gazes met in mid-air, and they spoke in unison: "The Sacrificial Altar!"
