Chapter 513: War Readiness

"Ning Zhuo?" Lu Hongtu’s heart stirred, and he felt that the name was somewhat familiar.

Immediately, he recalled the intelligence regarding Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo first came into his sight during the initial ambush battle. Before the ambush, the Thousand Peaks Forest faction had already learned of the ominous prophecy Ning Zhuo made before the battle.

Because of this, Lu Hongtu devised his scheme.

After the ambush battle, in which both sides had their victories and defeats, the old stone monster, Shi Zhong, openly declared that he was very interested in Ning Zhuo.

Therefore, Lu Hongtu and the others did not set their sights on this mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, yet one who could produce a relatively accurate prophecy, an exotic cultivator.

However, although the old stone monster was active, repeatedly ambushing and plundering the convoys of the two national forces at the rear near the Green Forest Immortal City, he had never acted against Ning Zhuo.

The latest military intelligence Lu Hongtu received stated that Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan had become husband and wife.

At first, Lu Hongtu thought that this was false intelligence.

But later, after obtaining more details and understanding many of the underlying facts, he realized that the intelligence was true.

At that moment he exclaimed, "This Ning Zhuo really does have some luck!"

Lu Hongtu knew that Ning Zhuo was his enemy.

He also knew the true story behind the conflict between the Ning family and the Six Caves Sect.

Although it was his own side that was at fault, in this world, strength mattered more than right or wrong.

After some deliberation, Lu Hongtu immediately said to the two ghost cultivators before him, "Ning Zhuo, is it? He is also my enemy."

"Oh?" The white-robed ghost cultivator, Tian Shuang, voiced his doubt.

Lu Hongtu then explained in detail, immediately drawing him closer to the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth.

The black-robed ghost cultivator, Di Hui, said guardedly, "On Ning Zhuo, he took the life of one of our disciples from the Soul Devouring Sect. We must capture him alive and take him back."

Lu Hongtu replied, "I have no intention of competing with you two."

"He is merely a Foundation Establishment minor cultivator; if he were at the Golden Core stage, I would have already acted and eliminated him."

"To provoke the two of you to capture him alive, Ning Zhuo must be extremely lucky."

"However... this person is actually also the prey of the old stone monster."

"If you two wish to capture him alive and take him away, you’d best obtain the old stone monster’s consent."

Tian Shuang immediately shook his head, "Impossible, the old stone monster is only interested in him, while we bear a grudge against him for killing our fellow sect members.

"For this matter, the old stone monster should yield for us!"

Di Hui even shrugged, speaking in a nonchalant tone, "I feel that you are placing too much importance on the old stone monster. Although he possesses the Earthwalking Art and can freely traverse the battlefield, he has never shown any remarkable performance in direct combat."

"Such a demonic cultivator is of little use. It is quite possible that by the next battle, the enemy forces will have already prepared measures to counter his Earthwalking Art."

Upon hearing this, Lu Hongtu was slightly astonished.

He subconsciously turned his gaze toward Lord Long.

Lord Long smiled at him.

Lu Hongtu immediately understood - the information that the old stone monster was of the Soul Formation Level was deliberately concealed from the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth by Lord Long.

In fact, this military intelligence was known only to the top echelon of the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance.

Had the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth known that the old stone monster was of the Soul Formation Level, their attitude would have been entirely different.

After some thought, Lu Hongtu understood Lord Long’s intention.

"It seems that the Ginseng Beard Dragon King side intends to provoke a conflict between the old stone monster and the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth."

The old stone monster was a newly promoted Soul Formation Level cultivator, and although the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth were merely two Nascent Soul cultivators, both were true Immortals.

Moreover, the divine abilities they had each mastered could combine to form an extremely powerful strike.

Because of this, the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth were renowned far and wide; even Lu Hongtu from the Thousand Peaks Forest had heard much about them.

"Even if the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth are not a match for the old stone monster, let us not forget that behind them is the Soul Devouring Sect."

"This time, Ginseng Beard Dragon King Temple has employed the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth with a heavy price not only to counter Du Tiechuan’s Iron-Flow Flatland Military Strategy, but also with a hidden plan to manipulate the old stone monster."

In the eyes of Lord Long and Lu Hongtu, the old stone monster had always been a native Soul Formation Level of the Thousand Peaks Forest, a natural demon who had once probed the earth veins of the Thousand Peaks Forest in an attempt to reveal them blatantly.

Therefore, the old stone monster posed a tremendous threat to the status of the Dragon King.

However, now that the two national armies were on the move, the GinSeng Beard Dragon King was also likely quite troubled; wanting to deal with the old stone monster but unable to act, he had no choice but to employ such measures.

After Lu Hongtu grasped the intention of the Ginseng Beard Dragon King Temple side, he immediately chose to cooperate with Lord Long.

After further discussion, Lord Long called over his servants to lead the two ghost cultivators out, to give them proper hospitality.

Lu Hongtu and Lord Long then found themselves alone in a room.

Lu Hongtu respectfully said, "Lord Long, as of now, Du Tiechuan’s intentions are quite clear - he aims to end everything in one decisive blow!"

"Therefore, whether our side can withstand his Iron Flow Flatland Military Strategy is of utmost importance!"

"Once we succeed, our morale will undoubtedly soar, our army will be unified, and we will hold a tremendous advantage."

Lord Long sighed, "Du Tiechuan truly deserves his title as the top general of the two nations. If he proceeds gradually and engages in successive battles, with us holding the advantage of terrain, we will be able to continually bleed his army."

"Now that he has played this move, our side must respond. This time, employing the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth has come at an extremely high cost."

Seeing that Lord Long also understood the key to this grand battle, Lu Hongtu continued, "Lord Long, based on my thoughts, perhaps we should again request that Young Master Xianxu take action."

"If Du Tiechuan is injured once more, the balance of victory in this grand battle will undoubtedly tip further in our favor."

Lord Long sighed once more and shook his head slightly, "I have already exercised that method."

"But Young Master Shengxu is too greedy; his price this time is as high as fifty times the previous one! It is absolutely an outrageous demand."

"Fifty times?" Lu Hongtu was equally shocked, drawing a quiet breath in astonishment.

He then mused, "Is this quotation perhaps part of his negotiation strategy?"

Lord Long sighed, "Perhaps. Since Master Lu of the Great Cave has shown interest, why not have you go as an envoy to persuade Young Master Shengxu to take action once more."

"I will offer you a lower price."

"Twenty times!"

"If it exceeds this price, our side will find it impossible to pay."

Lu Hongtu accepted the order and withdrew.

He wasted no time and immediately departed quietly. In a mountain courtyard, he met with Young Master Shengxu.

Although both of them were at the Nascent Soul level, Young Master Shengxu’s strength far exceeded that of Lu Hongtu.

Lu Hongtu adopted a humble attitude, "Young Master, I have come here today to make a request."

"The enemy is strong, and if we do not act swiftly, our army may fall into dire straits. Therefore, I wish to once again ask Young Master to take action to assassinate the enemy commander. If you could be a bit lenient with your fee, my Thousand Peaks Forest will do its utmost to repay you."

Young Master Shengxu lay on a reclining chair, his face ashen and devoid of color, his eyes barely opening a slit as he looked at Lu Hongtu.

In a very weak voice, as if like a gentle drizzle in the wind, he said, "Master Lu... regarding the last matter, this young master successfully dealt a heavy blow to Du Tiechuan, but you did not lead your troops in time."

"This time, if another assassination is to be carried out, must the price surge a hundredfold? I raised my price by fifty times, which is already half off."

Lu Hongtu then indicated that offering fifty times was indeed too much of a hardship; the military expenses were enormous every day.

If other materials could be used for offset, would that be feasible?

If payment were made in installments to settle the debt, that would also be a more practical solution.

Young Master Shengxu sighed softly and said lightly, "Other materials for offset would be too troublesome. I generally only accept spirit stones; it is much more convenient."

"I will never accept payment in installments."

"If your side is defeated in this battle, whom am I to collect the debt from?"

"If you wish for me to act, it must be in one lump sum, and the funds must be received in advance."

After Young Master Shengxu finished speaking, he slumped on the reclining chair like a sheet of rice paper, his very breathing noticeably weakened.

Lu Hongtu was astonished.

Without witnessing it firsthand, it would be hard to imagine that such a person, usually extremely frail and even struggling to speak a sentence, could possess combat power capable of threatening a Soul Formation Level.

Lu Hongtu, with no other choice, had to take his leave.

His persuasive ability was strong, but in front of Young Master Shengxu, he had no room to maneuver.

As the military strategist of the alliance, his time was extremely tight.

Upon returning to Dragon King Pillar Mountain, he immediately held a secret meeting with a group of key figures.

An old man, dressed in a long robe woven with patterns of green pine, with a beard as green as pine needles, was the Qing Song Mountain Spirit.

A young and handsome man, wearing a crown of white jade, was the Bai Shi Mountain Spirit.

There was also the Tie Lu Mountain Spirit with a pair of deer antlers, and the Zi Ying Mountain Spirit, who constantly emitted a purple light.

"This time, in dealing with the Iron Flow Flatland Military Strategy, all of you are our main force. Any losses will be compensated by the alliance at double the amount," Lu Hongtu said.

The Qing Song Mountain Spirit stroked his beard in silence.

The Bai Shi Mountain Spirit remained silent.

The Tie Lu Mountain Spirit was very direct, "If it is just such a benefit, then I won’t do it."

The Zi Ying Mountain Spirit snorted coldly, revealing an attitude of disdain and derision towards Lu Hongtu’s offer.

Lu Hongtu was undeterred; he smiled and said patiently, "Please, all of you, state your demands so that we can discuss them properly."

While the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance was actively preparing for battle, the final parade in Wooden Wheel Town was also underway.

On the tall parade stage, banners fluttered and swayed, rustling in the wind.

Only Du Tiechuan stood proudly on the stage, constantly maintaining this gigantic magical artifact.

In his sweeping view, one army after another advanced slowly, displaying a magnificent military formation!

Every single unit that had lasted until now was equipped with heavy armor, without exception.

The soldiers clad in heavy armor moved in unison, and the ground trembled slightly with every step they took.

The heavy armor, under the sunlight, reflected a cold metallic luster. The clashing and colliding of the armor plates produced sounds that blended with every step, continuous and awe-inspiring.

The formidable armor, along with swords, spears, halberds, and other weapons, as well as shields and even heavily armored mounts, together formed torrents of steel.

Among these, each army also had its own distinctions.

The Red Flower Battalion’s red flag fluttered high, with soldiers standing upright. Half wore jade-steel heavy armor and the other half ordinary heavy armor, their morale united behind the vanguard led by Mu Lan.

The White Jade Battalion’s soldiers were outfitted splendidly, each heavy armor as white as snow, the surface of the armor smooth like a mirror. The soldiers all wielded long spears, their spearheads numerous and gleaming with a cold light. At first glance, the entire White Jade Battalion appeared like a moving white wall.

The Fire Cloud Battalion’s heavy armor was self-equipped; each piece of copper-red heavy armor was designed to be open and flamboyant, most conducive to the release of magical abilities.

In the Three Generals Battalion, the heavy armor was also half jade-steel and half ordinary heavy armor. The three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang rode at the forefront, and slightly behind, Ning Zhuo also rode a demonic horse of the Foundation Establishment level.

Unlike his previous disheveled state, this time his expression was calm and composed.

Since refining the Fire-Traveling Heart in the Temple, he had devoted himself entirely, hiding within the Embryonic Breath Spirit Ship, actively advancing the cultivation of his physical body.

In the subsequent consecutive parades, he gradually overcame the increasing difficulties, adapting step by step until he became completely at ease, with progress that was extremely rapid.

Seated on the horse, Ning Zhuo even began to daydream a little.

"With the grand battle imminent, exactly how much combat strength do I have at my disposal?"

First was Ning Zhuo’s own cultivation level.

He specialized in the three supreme doctrines, cultivating essence, spiritual energy, and spirit simultaneously. His cultivation was at the early Foundation Establishment stage, having already surpassed the stage of Opening the Field Unhindered and entered the stage of Nourishing the Treasure Medicine.

His physical foundation had surged greatly recently, with a specific strength fully capable of resisting mortal soldiers and repelling a small portion of magical weapons.

His soul foundation had not seen much improvement since leaving the Fire Persimmon Immortal City; it remained at the normal standard of two hundred times.

In terms of talent, his early wisdom had not been further developed; his other innate talent remained shrouded in mystery.

After his inexplicably strong streak earlier, Ning Zhuo’s luck had returned to an ordinary level.

"But my Five Elements Realm is at least at the level of a Grandmaster; I can found my own sect and create spells on the battlefield."

"The divine abilities include 'Life Hanging by a Thread' and 'Stone-Cast Earth Treasure.'"

After some events, Ning Zhuo became even more cautious in using the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability, for once unleashed it would undoubtedly cause his combat power to surge greatly.

As for the Stone-Cast Earth Treasure divine ability, its specific effect was to transform all things under heaven into stone, then temper the stone with time, gradually turning it into a precious material. Since its effect was extremely slow and had little practical combat value, it was currently used mainly to cooperate with the Embryonic Breath Spirit Ship for physical cultivation, as well as a means to disguise as the old stone monster.

Judging solely by what Ning Zhuo had mastered, his cultivation progress was astonishing. At the age of sixteen, he had reached the stage of Treasure Medicine Sprouting, leaving his peers far behind.

His shortcomings in the physical aspect were largely compensated for, and he had also achieved a modest success in the realm of the soul.

His innate talent was yet to be fully developed, but for now, it was sufficient.

The changes in his luck made Ning Zhuo feel inexplicable. The typical young man was completely an amateur.

Although the two divine abilities were not the main battle abilities, their auxiliary functions were extremely strong.

Especially the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability, which had marvelous applications in daily interactions. It was just too marvelous, so Ning Zhuo had to conceal it to prevent himself from becoming a target of everyone's vigilance and attacks once discovered.

As for the Stone-Cast Earth Treasure divine ability, although it was obtained easily and was not widely applied at present, it was an excellent tool for management and had a bright future.

In terms of cultivation realms, it was outstanding. This made Ning Zhuo’s magical techniques extremely diverse. Coupled with his top-tier Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual, Ning Zhuo’s long-range spellcasting capabilities were quite impressive.

Compared to his long-range abilities, his close-combat skills were rather mediocre.

Previously, in the Thousand Medicines Sect, Ning Zhuo had compensated for his shortcomings in close-combat techniques. And with the recent rapid advancement of his physical foundation, he had compensated for that shortcoming a bit more.

But compared to his long-range abilities, the gap was truly more than just a little.
