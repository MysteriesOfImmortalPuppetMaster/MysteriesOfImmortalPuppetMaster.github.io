Chapter 388: Rock-Paper-Scissors (Two-in-One)

Great Contention Peak.

In the Myriad Demon Cave at the back of the mountain.

Ning Zhuo stood up, swaying slightly, and cupped his hands in gratitude towards Linghu Jiu.

"Little brother has gained this opportunity all thanks to Elder Brother Ling Hu. This kindness, Ning Zhuo will engrave in his heart and never forget!"

The Five Organs Temple Divine Art!

The entire set of techniques reached the level of Refining Void. It was evident that the Five Elements Divine Lord was an existence on par with the Three Sect Masters.

Although the Three Sect Superior Techniques that Ning Zhuo practiced came from the Three Sect Masters, they were currently only at the Foundation Establishment level. But now, Ning Zhuo had obtained the complete Five Organs Temple Divine Art.
This gain was extremely astonishing!

Linghu Jiu shook his head with a smile: "My role was very small; this is your destiny. You must know that to obtain the legacy of an ancestor, you must catch the eye of that ancestor. If they don't like you, they absolutely won't pass anything on to you."

"Ning Zhuo, the fact that you could continuously receive the inheritance for a long time shows that the ancestor who passed on this technique to you favors you greatly. This is the first point."

"Secondly, if your comprehension ability was poor, the ancestor would have stopped the transmission after passing on a part of it, feeling that you couldn't understand."

"So, all you've gained is due to your own strength. The role I played is far less significant than you imagine."

Saying this, Linghu Jiu looked at the two empty wine jars and sighed: "When I obtained the Lonely Sword Scripture back then, I only used up one jar of Pensive Nether Brew."

"The technique you've gained is priceless. Congratulations. Have you considered restarting your cultivation?"

Ning Zhuo, however, shook his head.

The Five Organs Temple Divine Art was an ancient method. Ning Zhuo had never heard of the Five Elements Divine Lord.

It should be known that Ning Zhuo was well-read and had knowledge of the capable individuals and ancestors of the current and past few generations.

The fact that Ning Zhuo was certain he had never seen the title of Five Elements Divine Lord meant that this person must have been from an even earlier era.

Ning Zhuo spoke frankly: "My main cultivation technique comes from the Lava Immortal Palace, originating from the Three Sect Superiors. In terms of rank, it's not at all inferior to this technique."

"I have a fondness for mechanism arts, and the Three Sect Superior Technique is particularly suitable for me."

"Moreover, this new technique I've obtained is an ancient method, with a style and terminology that differ greatly from contemporary use. In ancient times, magical power was scarce, but nowadays it's abundant. Ancient methods are probably inferior to modern ones.
There seems to be an issue of adapting to the environment here, and another is that in the cultivation world, the inheritance of techniques is orderly and constantly innovating.

Even if a sect is destroyed or an entire family is wiped out, ancestors in the netherworld still possess the techniques. Once a descendant with a thin bloodline performs a ritual, they might receive the ancestor's transmission.

Of course, the Three Sect Superior Technique also has its flaws. That is, Ning Zhuo only knows the Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining parts. For the later parts of the technique, he would need to go to the Lava Immortal Palace to obtain them.

Additionally, the rank of the Three Sect Superior Technique might not reach the Void Refining level. Although it was created by the Three Sect Superiors, not all techniques created by the Void Refining level Three Sect Master necessarily reach the Refining Void level.

However, the Five Organs Temple Divine Art only cultivates a single dantian, while the Three Sect Superior Technique cultivates all three dantians. From this point alone, it was already far superior.

"I will use this technique as a reference, which will be very helpful for my future cultivation of the Three Sect Superior Technique."

Ning Zhuo told Linghu Jiu: "This technique is called the 'Five Organs Temple Divine Art', originating from the ancestor Five Elements Divine Lord. Brother Ling Hu, why don't we study it together?"
Then, Ning Zhuo began to recite the opening content of the technique.

Linghu Jiu quickly raised his hand in refusal: "Hold on, Young Master Ning Zhuo, this is your destiny, not mine."

"Techniques should not be lightly transmitted!"

"This technique delves deeply into the mysteries of the Five Elements and is not suitable for me either."

"I've already said, I only contributed some Meditative Brew. It doesn't deserve such a heavy reward!"

Lin Bufan's Nascent Soul level divine sense was violently fluctuating: "Foolish! Jiu'er is being foolish!"

"In the past, the Five Elements Divine Lord roamed the world freely, commanding the five elements like a heavenly ruler over the world. This was his main cultivation technique, and even though it's ancient, it contains profound principles of the five elements."
"Even today, it still has immense value. If it were in our sect, it would be a sect-guarding inheritance!"

Lin Bufan couldn't help but become anxious.

His divine sense spread to the Great Contention Peak, and the first thing he saw was his big disciple pouring Meditative Brew for Ning Zhuo, an outsider.

And Ning Zhuo, this kid, was drinking it without restraint, gulping it down with great pleasure!

Lin Bufan watched, his eyes darkening.

Then, he saw Ning Zhuo wanting to share the divine technique, but being directly refused by Linghu Jiu. This angered him so much that he wanted to rush to the Great Contention Peak and hang his big disciple up for a good thrashing.
"Who told you to be so noble and upright? Is this how I taught you?"

Lin Bufan locked onto Ning Zhuo, still harboring some hope.

But Ning Zhuo loudly praised Linghu Jiu's elegant demeanor and no longer mentioned sharing the divine technique.

Lin Bufan's eye twitched: "This rascal Ning Zhuo is really too insensitive."

"The Meditative Brew is one thing, but the Five Organs Temple Divine Art..."

"I went along with the flow and let Ning Zhuo come see Jiu'er, but who would have thought he'd get such a big advantage! Ah, what kind of situation is this?"

Ning Zhuo also knew that this time, he had gained a huge advantage.

He couldn't help but feel emotional: "First Lin Shanshan, now Linghu Jiu, the Myriad Medicine Sect is truly a good place, really my lucky spot."
He never expected to gain such an enormous benefit!

Originally, Ning Zhuo only wanted to meet Linghu Jiu and test out this future leader of the Myriad Medicine Sect.

As a result, his opportunity arrived.

"Ah, when opportunity comes, it really can't be stopped."

Ning Zhuo wanted to immediately go into seclusion to carefully ponder over the newly acquired divine technique. But leaving now would be too awkward and inappropriate.

Ning Zhuo suppressed his urge, took out some Ice Jade Wine, filled Linghu Jiu's cup, and then his own.

He sat down, raised his cup to Linghu Jiu, and actively engaged in conversation, wanting to inquire about what Linghu Jiu might need, to see if he could satisfy it and repay this enormous favor.
Linghu Jiu spoke frankly, saying he had a fondness for fine wine. In the future, if Ning Zhuo had the chance to search for some fine wines to gift him, that would be most welcome.

Ning Zhuo expressed that he would remember this, and today he invited Linghu Jiu to drink the Ice Jade Wine to his heart's content.

"If that's not enough, I'll just have my family's ancestor make some more. I just returned the Ice Heart Jade Bottle to him."

Ning Zhuo's casual attitude towards Ning Jiufan made Linghu Jiu quite curious.

He immediately sighed: "Young Master Ning Zhuo's relationship with his family's Golden Core ancestor is so close, it's truly enviable."

Ning Zhuo, having drunk his fill and feeling relaxed, and with Linghu Jiu having just helped him successfully obtain the complete divine technique, spoke truthfully: "Although I lost my parents at a young age, suffered others' harsh treatment, and had little family support, I have my mother's legacy and have made great progress with the help of the Lava Immortal Palace."

"Don't be fooled by my Foundation Establishment level. In terms of combat power alone, even Golden Core cultivators would find it hard to defeat me."

"My family's ancestor is no match for me."

"Of course, that was before. Now that he has the Ape Grandmother by his side, he's completely surpassed me!"

Ning Zhuo's cultivation was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, but his true combat power had already surpassed his own cultivation realm, reaching the Golden Core stage.

Linghu Jiu showed a slightly strange expression, but not much.

This was because he too was only at the Foundation Establishment level, yet possessed combat power at the Golden Core level!

Ning Zhuo continued: "However, Ancestor Ning Jiufan does treat me well. When I started the branch family, I had his support."
"He really appreciates me!"

"Among the younger generation of the Ning family, I'm the only one who has shown promise. It's not surprising that he treats me this way."

"In the future, when the old ancestor passes on, the big family business will still need me to inherit it."

"Hmph! Those worms in the main branch, how could they manage the family well if we coexist? Splitting off is just my first step. Next, I will work hard to develop, and in the future, I will swallow up the main branch."
"At that time, I will be the main branch, and that will be the true Ning family!"

Ning Zhuo rarely revealed his schemes and ambitions like this.

Linghu Jiu raised his wine bowl and laughed heartily, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, your spirit soars to the clouds. I toast you!"

The two drained their bowls. Ning Zhuo looked at Linghu Jiu and said, "To be honest, Elder Brother Ling Hu, I envy you. I can only start from scratch, but you have a master at the Nascent Soul level who loves you like a son. In the future, you'll inherit the great enterprise of the Myriad Medicine Sect."

Linghu Jiu smiled bitterly, "I've long known my master's expectations of me, but I'm lazy by nature. Taking care of these junior brothers and sisters already exhausts me. What I truly want is a life free as a cloud and wild as a crane."

Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head, "That won't do. Any kind of cultivation requires resources. The higher the cultivation, the more resources are consumed."

"Elder Brother Ling Hu, if you want a life as free as a cloud and wild as a crane, you must have strong abilities to ensure it. Otherwise, a slightly more powerful demonic cultivator could make your life worse than death."

"And to have strong abilities, you need a continuous supply of cultivation resources. It's precisely because you want a life as free as a cloud and wild as a crane that you should manage the Myriad Medicine Sect even more excellently."

Linghu Jiu snorted lightly and gazed at Ning Zhuo intently.

Ning Zhuo's face was flushed red, and he stared with drunken eyes, "What?"

Linghu Jiu pointed at Ning Zhuo and laughed loudly, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, you're truly genuine by nature. After drinking so much, I find you even more adorable."

Ning Zhuo was silent for a moment, struggling to control his tongue, "Elder Brother Ling Hu, we hit it off at first sight. You've helped me so much, truly assisting me with all your might! How could I not repay you?"

"However, right now, my family's resources are meager. I have several important treasures that I can't part with to repay you, Brother. I can only remember it in my heart and plan to repay you in the future."

"Therefore, hearing your words earlier, I felt urgent and wanted to advise you. My words might have been..."

Linghu Jiu waved his hand, stopping Ning Zhuo's apology, "Boring, Young Master Ning Zhuo has become boring again."

Despite his words, Linghu Jiu couldn't help but admire Ning Zhuo.

Even though Linghu Jiu knew well that the young man before him had some unclear entanglement with his junior sister, he didn't let personal feelings make him hostile towards Ning Zhuo.

He had his own perspective and could view Ning Zhuo correctly, knowing that the young man before him was indeed outstanding.

Not only for his past achievements but also for his nature.

Hearing Linghu Jiu's evaluation of "boring," Ning Zhuo decisively changed the subject, "Just drinking like this is indeed boring. Elder Brother Ling Hu, do you know how to play drinking games? How about 'Guess the Source'?"

Linghu Jiu: "I've heard of it and seen it as a curiosity. It seems to be some kind of game."

Ning Zhuo was surprised, "Brother, you're a wine hero, yet you don't know how to play 'Guess the Source'?"

Linghu Jiu smiled and put on a suffering expression, complaining to Ning Zhuo about how his love for wine had already become a negative example. He was often criticized and punished with confinement. Under such circumstances, who would dare to drink with him? Moreover, he had to maintain the air of a senior brother in daily life, convenient for teaching the junior brothers and sisters.

There wasn't a single true peer or drinking buddy within the sect.

And outside the sect, Linghu Jiu's identity was special. He feared that any misconduct would implicate his master and the sect, making people look down on them.

"An experience like drinking with Young Master Ning Zhuo is truly rare in my life!" Linghu Jiu sighed deeply.

"I see." Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up, "Being able to drink like this with Young Master Ling Hu is also my honor."

"Brother, please don't call me Young Master anymore. Just call me by my name."

Linghu Jiu: "Haha, then I won't be polite."

Saying this, he cupped his hands in salute, "Brother Ning Zhuo."

Ning Zhuo returned the gesture, his tone high-spirited, "Elder Brother Ling Hu!"

Having changed their forms of address, their relationship advanced another level.

Both were very happy and couldn't help but raise their bowls, clinking them together before draining them directly.

Linghu Jiu put down his wine bowl, and Ning Zhuo immediately filled it with Ice Jade Wine.

As he poured, Ning Zhuo said, "Since Brother doesn't know how to play 'Guess the Source,' let me teach you."

"It's actually very simple. We both stretch out one hand at the same time, making a gesture to represent numbers from zero to five. At the same time, we speak, guessing the sum of the numbers represented by both our gestures."

"Whoever guesses correctly wins. The loser has to drink a cup of wine as punishment."

Linghu Jiu exclaimed in surprise, "What? Isn't that punishment actually a reward?"

Ning Zhuo paused, then burst into laughter.

Lin Bufan saw his senior disciple earnestly learning to play 'Guess the Source' and became increasingly speechless.

Soon, Xiao Ju hurried to the Ten Thousand Demons Cave.

She was shouldering the important task given to her by Lin Shanshan, to watch over Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu, preventing them from fighting irreconcilably, getting red-faced and angry, and escalating conflicts.

However, before she even entered the cave, she heard the sounds of 'Guess the Source.'

"Six, six, six, who drinks first?"

"Five chiefs, who drinks first?"

"Haha, I lost." Linghu Jiu raised his wine bowl and drained it in one go. He rolled up his sleeves, "Let's continue."

"Six, six, six! (Four joys and wealth!)"

"Seven tricks! (Nine connected rings!)"

Suddenly, Ning Zhuo's eyes widened.

He had lost.

Linghu Jiu laughed loudly, raising his voice high, "Drink, drink quickly!"

So Ning Zhuo drained a bowl.

Xiao Ju stood at the cave entrance, watching this scene with disbelief, her mouth hanging open, her jaw about to drop in shock.

"What's going on?"

"Young Master Ning Zhuo and Senior Brother are indeed fighting intensely and red-faced, but there doesn't seem to be any conflict at all."

"Are they really getting along so well?"

Xiao Ju found it inconceivable, completely different from what she had imagined.

"Someone's coming," Ning Zhuo's spiritual sense spread out, and he had long known of Xiao Ju's arrival.

The two invited Xiao Ju to come in and report. Upon learning of Lin Shanshan's concerns, Linghu Jiu and Ning Zhuo exchanged a smile.

Linghu Jiu waved his hand, "Junior Sister is overthinking. Go on, go on."

But Xiao Ju didn't dare to leave, still remembering Lin Shanshan's instructions. She worried that if she left now, and the two had a conflict later, it wouldn't be good.

So she said, "Why don't I pour wine for the two gentlemen?"

Linghu Jiu thought for a moment, immediately understanding Xiao Ju's thoughts, "Fine, you can pour the wine."

He and Ning Zhuo started "competing" again.

At first, the two were just sitting on stone stools. Gradually, they stood up. Linghu Jiu rolled up his sleeves, put one foot on the stone stool, and shouted loudly every time they played 'Guess the Source.'

Ning Zhuo leaned forward with one hand on the stone table, launching "strong attacks" towards Linghu Jiu.

After drinking three jars of wine continuously, they both couldn't stand anymore. They sat on the stone table, arm in arm, swaying their heads.

Linghu Jiu was in high spirits and started singing mountain songs.

After listening to a few verses, Ning Zhuo learned to sing too and joined in.

"Hahaha!" The two laughed together, both drunk.

Linghu Jiu, with his hair disheveled, ran around the stone cave like a monkey. His long sleeves fluttered, swift as the wind, extremely graceful.

Ning Zhuo sat on the ground, head bowed and shoulders drooping, silent.

Suddenly, Linghu Jiu stopped, looked up at the sky outside the cave, and recited a poem.

Ning Zhuo immediately responded with a matching poem!

Linghu Jiu clapped his hands and exclaimed, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, what great talent!"

Ning Zhuo shook his head and smiled bitterly, "What kind of young master am I? Compared to me, you're the real young master."

He cupped his hands in salute, quite jokingly.

Linghu Jiu raised his head and nodded, grunting: "Ning Zhuo, young master."

Ning Zhuo was already dizzy: "I'm just a petty thief, nothing more."

After joking, he could no longer support himself and fell to the ground, falling into a deep sleep.

Linghu Jiu shook his head: "Ning Zhuo, little thief, what did you steal? Did you steal my junior sister's heart?"

Xiao Ju's heart trembled, and she immediately looked at Linghu Jiu.

Linghu Jiu leaned against the mountain wall, slowly sitting down on the ground, looking at the sky outside the cave, a melancholic mood appearing on his face.

He softly hummed a mountain song and also fell into a deep sleep.

Xiao Ju: ?!

The two men eventually didn't fight, they just had a drinking contest and played finger-guessing games.

Xiao Ju began to take action.

She came here to take care of Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu.

She dragged both of them onto the stone bed and kept watch by the bedside, constantly attending to them.

Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu slept foot to foot for a day and a night.

On the second morning, Linghu Jiu woke up first. Through sleepy eyes, he saw Ning Zhuo and laughed heartily, his voice hoarse.

Seeing Xiao Ju, he thanked her.

Xiao Ju hurriedly stated that if thanks were due, they should go to Lin Shanshan, as she had come on orders.

By noon on the second day, Ning Zhuo also woke up. He eagerly chatted with Linghu Jiu for a while before reluctantly parting.

He returned to the cave dwelling on Little Contention Peak and immediately began rewriting the "Five Organs Temple Divine Art."

Soon, he had written down the entire text.

Ning Zhuo sighed in relief, grateful that he hadn't messed things up while drunk!

"It seems that after drinking the Meditative Brew, the things passed down from the ancestors are deeply ingrained in the heart and not easily forgotten."

"Boss, come quickly and help me look at this divine technique!"

Sun Lingtong emerged from the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, took the jade slip, and muttered: "What does the Meditative Brew taste like anyway? Little Zhuo, you didn't even leave a bit for me to try!"

Ning Zhuo chuckled: "Next time I go to ask, given Brother Linghu's character, he'll surely spare some for me."

"I plan to give Linghu Jiu the premium cloud tea from our storage compartment. What do you think, Boss?"

Sun Lingtong shrugged: "It's up to you."

His expression gradually became solemn: "Good technique. The Five Organs Temple Divine Art is definitely a top-tier technique. Your branch family now has a technique to keep as its treasure, far surpassing the main family's Ice Heart Technique by several levels."

"It's just a pity you can't cultivate it."

"Come to think of it, Little Zhuo, your five elemental spirit roots are perfectly balanced. You're extremely suited to cultivate this type of five elements technique. Perhaps this is also an important reason why you gained the favor of that Five Elements Divine Lord."

Ning Zhuo said: "Boss, you study it first. I'll go under the Spirit Concealing Willow to ponder and see how much I can learn from the Five Organs Temple Divine Art."

Ning Zhuo came to the spirit plant compartment and had a long chat with the Spirit Concealing Willow, completely calming his mood.

He sat cross-legged under the tree and began to contemplate.

Suddenly, he "saw" the Five Elements Divine Lord again.

"Spirit Concealing Willow?" The Five Elements Divine Lord smiled slightly at Ning Zhuo, "Young one, you actually don't switch to cultivating my divine technique, still clinging to old things. The 'Spirit Concealing Willow' is indeed a treasure plant."

"Watch carefully, this is the way and principle of the five elements!"

"Alas, it's still too early for you. You can comprehend as much as you can."

In an instant, Ning Zhuo once again received the teachings of the Five Elements Divine Lord.

The way that can be spoken of is not the constant way!

He tightly closed his eyes, his brows deeply furrowed, his body swaying as if about to fall, his seven apertures bleeding, his head boiling, sweat evaporating into white smoke.

The willow branches of the Spirit Concealing Willow dried up at a terrifying speed, countless willow leaves falling and scattering, looking quite miserable.
