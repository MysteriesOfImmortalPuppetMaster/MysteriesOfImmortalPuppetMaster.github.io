Chapter 772: Continuing to Soar

Ning Zhuo's flying letter flew straight into the cave abode.

Old Chef opened the letter and read it, a look of pleasant surprise immediately appearing on his face. He muttered to himself, "I didn't expect the Young Master to actually take first place in the Profound Armor Cave minor trial!"

Regarding this operation, Ning Zhuo had explained beforehand, stating the expectation - he only wanted to intercept Ban Ji, and didn't have high expectations for the results.

Now, however, the result far exceeded expectations.

Old Chef brought the flying letter to Qing Chi.

Qing Chi was in the internal space of the martial arts formation, sparring with Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.

The two sides fought back and forth, evenly matched.

Upon learning of Ning Zhuo's flying letter, Qing Chi immediately abandoned the sparring. After reading the letter, she wasn't surprised at all: "Young Master Ning Zhuo is a genius; naturally, one cannot use common sense to think of him."

"He said 'only to intercept Ban Ji', but I knew long ago, this is his excellent quality of being modest!"

Qing Chi was full of goodwill towards Ning Zhuo; her confidence in him was even more sufficient than Old Chef's, or even Ning Zhuo's own.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui stood nearby and gave a soft, cold snort.

Old Chef chuckled: "Give me the letter, I'll go notify Gongsun Yan."

Qing Chi, however, put the flying letter away, keeping it close to her body: "The news that the Young Master won and will stay in Profound Armor Cave for a few days, Old Chef, you just tell Gongsun Yan directly. No need to use this letter."

"Besides, he is selecting materials to make a divine statue. This is the task the Young Master assigned him; let him be busy."

Old Chef naturally saw through Qing Chi's little thoughts. He didn't expose them, nodded, and left, the smile on his face growing a bit more.

The "Rising Clouds Minor Trial" in Profound Armor Cave settled to dust. Information regarding this trial began to spread following Ning Zhuo's letter.

Deep in Shuji Cave.

Ning Zhuo continued to accept the infusion of True Meaning and the blessing of Principles.

Things he once regarded as standards were broken one after another, then reorganized, revealing multiple optimized directions in Ning Zhuo's Spirit Sea.

How to neutralize certain extreme material properties, how to harmonize and guide the attributes of the vessel embryo, what methods to use to pursue extreme sharpness, how material flaws can become advantages - turning the rotten into the miraculous.

"The logic of artifacts is cyclical!"

"The foundation of spirit endowment is determined at the very beginning of refining."

"How the spiritual energy flow inside the artifact can be more stable and efficient..."

Renowned Artisan level Artifact Refining realm!

Ning Zhuo successfully leaped into it. To this point, previous standards were crushed and reorganized along with Ning Zhuo's will. To achieve a certain standard of refining, there are too many paths to choose from.

Amidst these various choices, Ning Zhuo's own aesthetics and values were embodied, causing every artifact he refined personally to begin bearing his personal style.

The irrigation of True Meaning came to an abrupt halt.

A few breaths later, the addition of principles also stopped.

Ning Zhuo opened his eyes and looked doubtfully at Qing Wu Langjun.

Qing Wu Langjun had a look of joy and nodded slightly at him: "That's it. I have passed on all my True Meaning and Principles regarding Artifact Refining to you."

He subconsciously moved his body, feeling an unprecedented lightness.

The burden was reduced by thirty percent; he suddenly felt space to advance in the other three paths. This was a wonderful feeling he didn't have before.

A gleam of disappointment flashed in the depths of Ning Zhuo's eyes.

This was much less than he imagined.

Only Renowned Artisan level Artifact Refining realm, and that's it?

"Thinking carefully, this is normal."

"The Five Elements God Lord was on a much higher level than Qing Wu Langjun. Back then, He even attracted Divine Retribution because of his own cultivation."

"His attainments in the Five Elements once compared to Heaven and Earth. With him imparting the Five Elements True Meaning, it naturally could make my Five Elements realm change heaven and earth!"

Having experienced more, Ning Zhuo increasingly realized the immense value of the opportunity he gained at the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect.

"Compared to the Five Elements God Lord, Qing Wu Langjun transformed from an Artifact Spirit to a Deity; all his foundation was accumulated passively."

"If He wants to go further, He needs to purify one path and cultivate it deeply."

Thoughts rose and fell in Ning Zhuo's Spirit Sea, feeling that Qing Wu Langjun choosing the Martial Path was quite correct.

He participated in Profound Armor Cave's Rising Clouds Minor Trial and personally used the Profound Weapon Armor, gaining deep insights.

The Profound Weapon Armor possesses cultivation technologies of both Mechanisms and Artifact Refining. It was developed to deal with great wars, thus it also contains Military Strategy profundities.

A cultivator using multiple Profound Weapon Armors can form a battle formation; this is the embodiment of the Military Strategist school.

The Shou Zhuo Wheel Slash Formation created by Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong was, in fact, the correct usage of the Profound Weapon Armor.

But compared to these three aspects, the true greatest value of the Profound Weapon Armor is the Martial Path!

They undergo a qualitative change because of the Martial Path contained within. A Profound Weapon Armor containing a profound Martial Path can rival Golden Core combat power, Nascent Soul combat power, or even higher!

"Letting the Profound Weapon Armor fight on its own, although less agile than a cultivator, is more reliable and practical from another angle."

Profound Weapon Armors won't have as many thoughts as cultivators, nor will they make choices to defect in battle. So they are more reliable.

Rules between countries require Nascent Soul cultivators to publicly report their movements. But a Profound Weapon Armor rivaling Nascent Soul combat power can freely enter and exit various national borders. This is one embodiment of being more practical.

A question couldn't help but surface in Ning Zhuo's heart: "In Profound Armor Cave, exactly how many Profound Weapon Armors possess Nascent Soul level combat power?"

Undoubtedly, this was a key number that largely determines this faction's voice within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

"Conversely, one can infer the number of Profound Weapon Armors from Profound Armor Cave's status in the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate."

"The faction of Profound Armor Cave is a self-contained sect within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, with sufficient foundation, possessing a calmness and composure to watch the changing winds and clouds."

"Realistically, there should be at least three Nascent Soul level Profound Weapon Armors in Profound Armor Cave. Do they have Soul Formation level combat power Profound Weapon Armors?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head secretly.

This possibility was very low.

The significance of a Soul Formation level is very major, not something the Nascent Soul level can compare to.

"This opportunity is not small!"

"Even if the next two paths don't improve much, just the force of Profound Armor Cave itself has enough value for me to maintain a good relationship."

Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo took the opportunity during the break to thank Qing Wu Langjun.

Qing Wu Langjun nodded slightly. Superficially saying this was for his own Dao path, but inwardly feeling: This junior Ning Zhuo is indeed from a great clan; he knows the way, understands the rules, and knows gratitude. It is undoubtedly lucky for me to meet him. He surely has a great future. With this cooperative relationship, and him joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect, it is necessary for me to keep close contact with him in the future.

After resting, Qing Wu Langjun started again: "Little friend Ning Zhuo, next is the Military Path, receive it well!"

Ning Zhuo looked solemn, his confidence a bit higher than before: "Please make your move, Langjun!"

In an instant, Ning Zhuo felt like he was thrown into an Asura battlefield.

Bloody, chaotic, deafening shouts of killing, blinding flashes of swords, flying severed limbs, the aura of death pressing on every inch of his nerves like a solid substance.

His vision blurred, countless scenes flashing by.

Infantry, cavalry, archers, scouts... countless troop types flew past his eyes.

Square formations, circular formations, wedge formations... various formations flashed like lightning and thunder.

Flags, drum beats, provisions, water sources, camps... various concepts came flooding in.

Besides True Meaning, there were Principles.

Principles adding to his body made Ning Zhuo feel like he was sliced by blades, pierced by arrows, and crashed into by warhorses.

He felt illusory exhaustion, as if he had experienced an extremely tragic bloody battle, his muscles sore and soft, even spasming and twitching from hacking and killing too many times.

Ning Zhuo's face was pale, his whole body trembling, sweating hot sweat.

When this round ended, the sounds of killing, wailing, and clashing metal still lingered in his ears. Strong feelings of vomiting and dizziness impacted his mental defenses like a tide.

The second round was much more uncomfortable than the first.

After Ning Zhuo calmed his breathing slightly, he felt heartfelt joy.

His Military Path realm reached the peak of Apprentice!

In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he rarely dabbled in this aspect. The Battle of Thousand Peaks Forest made him make up for it significantly, but even after the battle of White Paper Immortal City, his realm in the Military Path was still only Apprentice level.

He had also tried hard to study military manuals, but while Qing Chi comprehended them, Ning Zhuo didn't gain much.

The battle formation he realized relying on "Ancient Shared - Battle Armor" and Gao Sheng's Lost Writings, he still hadn't completely mastered.

"My talent in the Military Path seems not to be outstanding."

"Perhaps because of this, bearing the True Meaning and Principles of the Military Strategist is harder than before."

When Ning Zhuo was thinking deeply, his face regained its rosiness, his breathing returned to normal, and his mental fatigue received visible relief.

Qing Wu Langjun had been observing carefully. Seeing this scene, he was very happy and appreciated Ning Zhuo even more.

Even Sun Lingtong, who was secretly observing Ning Zhuo's condition via Life Hanging by a Thread, felt surprised and said in his heart: "Little Zhuo's body has great peculiarities, actually able to bear so many foreign principles without suffering disaster."

"I have never discovered this point before."

"Is it related to that mysterious innate talent of his?"

Qing Wu Langjun continued the True Meaning infusion and Principle blessing.

It was still the Military Path.

Ning Zhuo felt he was on the battlefield again. But this time, his nervousness reduced a lot, and the chaotic battlefield scenes became orderly.

Battles played out in his heart: scout reconnaissance, analyzing enemy situations, designing tactics, choosing formations, commanding combat, battlefield adjustments, post-war inventory...

Arrowhead formation is good for breakthroughs, Crane Wing formation excels at outflanking, terrain advantages and disadvantages have huge influence... various insights flooded Ning Zhuo's heart like a rising tide.

The Military Strategist realm thus easily broke through the Apprentice level, reaching the Artisan realm.

While Ning Zhuo was wantonly collecting True Meaning and Principles, intelligence about him had also spread.

-----

Demon Subjugation Hall.

Zhong Dao was buried in handling affairs.

On the corner of his desk, among the piled-up jade slips, there was an intelligence jade slip recording information about Ning Zhuo and others.

Commerce Hall.

Cao Gui thought about the intelligence he just learned and sighed softly: "Ning Zhuo..."

Previously, after Ning Zhuo revealed his reputation as a genius, friends in the clan suggested he contact Ning Zhuo again to establish a connection as capital for advancement.

Cao Gui knew well that behind the friends were instructions from higher-ups.

"This time, Ning Zhuo defeated Ban Ji and even took first place. I'm afraid it will trigger the clan's higher-ups to personally come and lobby me."

Green Bamboo Peak.

Qing Huangzi placed the intelligence jade slip beside him, laughed aloud, drank a sip of tea, stood up, and walked out of the bamboo building.

He entered the depths of the bamboo forest.

Not long after, sounds of a flute came from the bamboo forest, melodious and pleasant.

Autumn Pear Cave.

"Congratulations to Young Master Pi on moving to a new residence!" At the banquet, many cultivators surrounded Pi Fujie to congratulate him.

Pi Fujie laughed heartily, raising his wine cup: "Come, drink up, drink up."

A flying letter arrived in his hand at this moment.

He swept it with his divine sense, his heart skipping a beat: "Ning Zhuo..."

The joyful look immediately restrained a lot.

"This kid really took action to intercept Ban Ji. He even took first place in Profound Armor Cave, defeating Ban Ji again!"

"This time is different from the one at Green Bamboo Peak."

"Let them fight each other, as long as it has nothing to do with me."

Pi Fujie secretly rejoiced.

Originally, he provoked Ning Zhuo but diverted the trouble to Ban Ji. He thought Ban Ji could teach Ning Zhuo a lesson. The reality was the opposite; Ning Zhuo had taught Ban Ji a lesson twice now.

This wasn't just different from his plan; it was completely opposite!

Martial Arts Hall.

Two groups of people confronted each other, the atmosphere tense.

Yan Linglong whispered to Situ Xing, informing him of the new methods revealed by Situ Xing's opponent for this martial arts performance - Zhu Fenxiang - recently.

The duel between the two officially started today!

Both sides engaged in intense intelligence warfare.

Shen Xi suddenly received a flying letter. He unfolded it, eyebrows raising slightly.

This expression caught Situ Xing's attention.

Situ Xing: "Is there any latest intelligence regarding Zhu Fenxiang?"

Shen Xi shook his head: "It's not about Zhu Fenxiang."

Coincidentally, Yan Linglong also received a flying letter. After reading it, she looked at Shen Xi, eyes flickering, expression subtle: "I suppose Young Master Shen's letter should be intelligence regarding Ning Zhuo?"

Shen Xi immediately said 'not good' in his heart.

Situ Xing's heart moved: "Oh?"

Yan Linglong handed the letter to Situ Xing.

A cold glint flashed in Situ Xing's eyes: "Ning Zhuo eliminated Ban Ji in the Profound Armor Cave minor trial? And took first place!"

"This person... is indeed outstanding."

"Hmph! Wait for me to defeat Zhu Fenxiang first, then suppress this person, completely controlling the situation."

Finishing these words, Situ Xing tossed the letter, held his head high, and strode into the martial arts arena.

On the other side, a female cultivator also walked out, equally full of fighting spirit.

Commerce Hall.

Che Zhuzi came here every few days to inspect the market and facilitate pricing for his spider silk.

At the same time, he listened for other intelligence.

"Ning Zhuo eliminated Ban Ji in Profound Armor Cave?"

"This kid's comprehension is a bit excessively strong, isn't it? Indeed a genius!"

"Profound Armor Cave..."

Che Zhuzi's face darkened, a heavy scene from deep in his memory surfacing.

He was invited to Mystic Master Dunjia's residence, finding his good friend on his deathbed.

Che Zhuzi was pale with fright, hurriedly trying to save him, but to no avail.

He asked his friend, why fall to this state?

Mystic Master Dunjia said: "I was forced by Profound Armor Cave to perform a divination, paying the price of my lifespan. You are my only good friend; I called you here to entrust my legacy."

Che Zhuzi exclaimed "Ah", filled with resentment towards Profound Armor Cave.

Mystic Master Dunjia: "I have hidden all my legacy inside a tortoise shell. I trouble you, old friend, to cremate my body after I die, and keep this tortoise shell for a destined person."

Che Zhuzi held Mystic Master Dunjia's hand, eyes red: "Old friend, I will certainly carry out your dying request. But who is your destined successor? I don't know how to distinguish."

Mystic Master Dunjia smiled faintly: "I have already calculated it. You leave the tortoise shell in the storage. Do not move it. One day, it will be stolen. That person is the successor I place my hopes on."
