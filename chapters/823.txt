Chapter 823: The Bronze Token

The gates of the Azure Stone Cave Abode slowly groaned open.

Ning Zhuo stepped out at a measured pace.

"Ning Zhuo is coming out!"

"I really envy him. Not only did he gain Zhong Dao's appreciation, but now he's also held in such high regard by the Peak Master of Myriad Beasts Peak. His future is simply limitless."

"If only I were him..."

Various gazes filled with complex emotions - envy, jealousy, and awe - focused entirely on Ning Zhuo.

Contrary to the public's perception and mood, however, Ning Zhuo’s heart was heavy.

I deliberately didn't select an entry point because I wanted to create a situation where I was widely welcomed, allowing me to play all sides to my advantage, he thought.

But why does every single one of them want me to relinquish my initiative?

Not long ago, at the headquarters of the Demon Subjugation Hall, Zhong Dao had treated him this way. Now, the Peak Master of Myriad Beasts Peak was doing the same.

The former used the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone to tempt him, while the latter had brought out a massive gift.

If I accept this heavy gift, my situation will become quite volatile.

Although the envoy from Myriad Beasts Peak emphasized there are no strings attached - that it's a pure gift - the truth is that free things are often the most expensive!

If Ning Zhuo were to accept, then whenever any other person or power wanted to invite him, they would subconsciously use today's lavish gift as the benchmark. If they couldn't match its value, they would have to reconsider even approaching him.

The Peak Master of Myriad Beasts Peak wants to inflate my 'market value.' If I accept, I will instantly lose the broader market and be left with only a few options - the Eight Peaks and Sixteen Halls - as my future entry points.

But Ning Zhuo looked forward to the "broader market."

During the various minor trials of the "Rising Clouds" and the subsequent Flying Cloud Assembly, those who could benefit Ning Zhuo the most were often not the Eight Peaks or Sixteen Halls, but figures or powers similar to Qing Huangzi or Young Master Qingwu.

Ning Zhuo’s gains from the Demon Subjugation Hall were, in fact, not that substantial. Zhong Dao was entirely focused on using the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone to entice Ning Zhuo into making a premature choice to join his hall.

In contrast, almost the entirety of Qing Huangzi’s wealth had fallen into Ning Zhuo’s hands. Several strands of Young Master Qingwu’s true intent had become part of Ning Zhuo’s own cultivation foundation.

The Flying Cloud Assembly had not even truly begun, yet just a few minor trials had already allowed Ning Zhuo to make several massive leaps forward. His previous realization was correct - this was likely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

Furthermore, the Peak Master's specific instruction that there are 'no conditions' is very subtle. It's likely a direct response to Zhong Dao’s offer regarding the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone.

Ning Zhuo, possessing deep experience in the ways of the Righteous Path, keenly perceived the deeper meaning.

Is there some sort of conflict between the two of them?

Ning Zhuo shook his head inwardly.

Although purchasing information was very convenient within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, intelligence regarding the sect's high-level officials was treated with extreme caution. Information on whether there was a grudge between Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang was absolutely not for sale in the Logistics Hall.

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath. He cupped his fists toward the envoy from Myriad Beasts Peak and then toward the direction of the peak itself, offering his thanks to Tuoba Huang from afar.

"To be held in such high regard by Lord Tuoba Huang, this junior is truly overwhelmed with trepidation."

"This junior has only recently arrived in this precious land and is focused solely on joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect. However, the sect is so vast and profound that I am dazzled and unable to make a decision."

"After all, this concerns my Dao path. My family elders have instructed me since childhood to be extremely cautious when making major decisions."

Ning Zhuo paused here on purpose, leaving time for the surrounding crowd to react.

The expressions of the onlookers changed slightly. Many caught the hidden meaning in his words and were surprised. "What? Hearing this... Ning Zhuo isn't dead-set on joining the Demon Subjugation Hall?"

"No wonder Myriad Beasts Peak suddenly brought out such a heavy gift. Did they hear some rumors?"

"The Hall Master of Demon Subjugation even lent Ning Zhuo the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone, and yet it didn't move him? This kid is a bit ungrateful, isn't he?"

However, an even more "ungrateful" act was yet to come.

Ning Zhuo focused his expression and looked at the envoy. "As the saying goes, one should not receive a reward without merit. While I am overwhelmed by Lord Tuoba Huang's appreciation, I will certainly do my best to perform and not disappoint his expectations."

"However, I cannot accept these lavish gifts."

"Since childhood, my elders have taught me that accepting such things would violate our family's principles!"

Ning Zhuo refused cleanly and decisively on the spot, his attitude firm.

Hiss...

For a moment, the sound of people sucking in cold air could be heard everywhere. Many thought they had misheard.

The envoy’s face turned very ugly. For Ning Zhuo to refuse this gift was to refuse the goodwill of Myriad Beasts Peak. Strictly speaking, it was a slight against Tuoba Huang’s honor!

The envoy felt a surge of anger and glared at Ning Zhuo, about to snap.

But Ning Zhuo’s steady gaze met his, unblinking and grave.

Meeting that gaze, the envoy felt a sudden chill in his heart and couldn't help but think: I only have the combat power of a Golden Core. Ning Zhuo also displayed Golden Core-level power in the martial arena. If I pick a fight, who would win and who would lose?

The envoy had no confidence.

In his mind, Ning Zhuo’s move was incredibly disrespectful. According to custom, he should strike immediately to teach the boy a small lesson and uphold his peak’s prestige.

But Ning Zhuo was special!

A genius like this, even if only at the Foundation Establishment stage, certainly had Golden Core-level strength. The envoy wasn't just afraid of losing face if Ning Zhuo defeated him; he was afraid that if he lost, he would bring even greater shame upon Myriad Beasts Peak.

Once the peak was shamed, his return to report his mission would surely be met with severe punishment.

I must endure!

Lord Tuoba Huang clearly wants to show favor to Ning Zhuo.

Such a grand gesture is rare.

If I carelessly offend Ning Zhuo and ruin the Peak Master’s plans, how will I answer for it?

Yes! When I go back, I’ll report it exactly like that.

The more the envoy thought, the calmer he became.

Ultimately, with a stiff face, he packed away the various treasure chests. He offered a few curt words of praise for Ning Zhuo, then stowed the chests, restarted his beast-drawn carriage, and led the convoy away.

Ning Zhuo returned to the Azure Stone Cave Abode and immediately shut the gates.

The onlookers dispersed, spreading the news as they went. For a time, the discussion regarding Ning Zhuo reached a new fever pitch.

Countless people talked about his refusal of the Myriad Beasts Peak Master’s gifts. Some lamented the missed opportunity, some were baffled, and others couldn't help but secretly admire the poise and character Ning Zhuo had displayed.

Ban Jie sat in the high seat, clutching a recently delivered jade slip.

Her brows, thin as blades, were slightly furrowed.

"Ning Zhuo refused the gift from Myriad Beasts Peak?"

Ban Jie put down the jade slip. The two mystic bronze brow-nails at the center of her forehead slowly rotated, the movement almost imperceptible.

Standing below her was a Ban Clan cultivator responsible for gathering intelligence and smoothing over relations.

The cultivator nodded. "Yes, milady. The news has spread throughout the sect. It's said that Myriad Beasts Peak prepared ten chests of high-grade spirit stones, a pair of Scarlet Flame Tiger eggs, the remains of a Soul Formation demon beast, and the Hundred Beasts Battle Array Diagram - the total value is at least three million high-grade spirit stones. Tuoba Huang specifically noted there were no strings attached, and it was pure appreciation for Ning Zhuo."

"No strings attached..." Ban Jie chewed on those words, a complex look flashing in her eyes.

"What’s even more intriguing," the man added, "is that not long ago, Ning Zhuo also refused Zhong Dao’s recruitment. Zhong Dao’s condition was for him to achieve three Grade-A top merits in the Demon Subjugation Hall to earn the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone."

Ban Jie sighed. "The White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone... that is a foundation of the Demon Subjugation Hall, long known to the world. For Zhong Dao to even promise that publicly just to recruit Ning Zhuo..."

"Zhong Dao, Tuoba Huang... these two are the pillars of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, one a master of a hall, the other a ruler of a peak. Anyone else would have been kneeling in gratitude long ago."

"But Ning Zhuo refused them both."

"How should I put it? He truly lives up to the reputation of a King's Mandate Calamity."

The Ban Clan cultivator continued, "Ning Zhuo is clearly holding out for a better price. Although we haven't made progress in investigating his background, his actions within the sect make his goal quite clear - "

"He is holding out for the best offer while simultaneously absorbing as much nourishment as possible. Every trial is an opportunity. Every refusal is a way to raise his 'asking price.' Once he has accumulated enough fame and results, he will choose the most advantageous entry point to join the sect."

"In this way, through a single Flying Cloud Assembly, he can bypass decades or even centuries of slow progression, accumulating wealth and status rapidly. His future is incredibly bright."

Ban Jie nodded. "Your analysis is sound."

"However, his refusal of both Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang is actually a good thing for our Ban Clan."

If Ning Zhuo had accepted Zhong Dao’s offer, he would be a member of the Demon Subjugation Hall. For the Ban Clan to move against him, they would have to face Zhong Dao and the entire hall. The same applied to Tuoba Huang.

"But now, Ning Zhuo hasn't chosen anyone. He is still a 'free agent,' wandering through various trials and waiting for the right price."

"What does that mean?"

Ban Jie toyed with the jade slip, answering her own question: "It means he has no backer yet. It means we still have a chance. It means - "

"Ban Ji still has a chance to personally break his 'Human Tribulation'!"

Since his great defeat, Ban Ji had been in secluded cultivation, fully refining the Hundred-Refined Golden Body Pill. Once he emerged, his strength would surely have increased immensely.

"At that time..." Ban Jie narrowed her eyes, hiding the sharp glint within.

-----

At almost the same time, in the Autumn Pear Cave.

Pi Fujie also received the latest intelligence.

He stood by the window, gazing at the bamboo forest outside for a long time in silence. After a while, he suddenly let out a laugh. The laughter was soft, carrying a hint of surprise, relief, and even a touch of - luck.

"Interesting..."

He turned around, the gloom that had weighed on his heart for days mostly lifting, replaced by a thoughtful light.

"I thought he was a pure, Righteous Path madman. Now it seems - "

He walked back to his couch and sat down slowly, a playful smile curling his lips.

"Ning Zhuo, that fellow, has his own calculations."

What he had feared most was the "purity" of a typical Righteous Path cultivator. A truly pure righteous cultivator, upon seeing someone like Pi Fujie - who came from a demonic background and was trying to "wash clean" his family’s name - would naturally feel hostility. It was like a cat seeing a mouse or an eagle seeing a snake; an instinctive, life-and-death opposition.

But now it seemed Ning Zhuo wasn't that kind of person.

My plan to shift the trouble onto Ban Ji to block the disaster was undoubtedly the right choice!

As long as I don't proactively provoke him, and as long as I don't stand in his way, he won't necessarily come looking for trouble with me.

Originally, as Ning Zhuo rose to fame, Pi Fujie had been unable to eat or sleep in peace. He had been plotting how to use his available resources to suppress Ning Zhuo, to kill his momentum and block his progress. He hadn't expected the situation to change, causing the threat he felt from Ning Zhuo to plummet.

-----

The next day, at dawn.

The stone platform was usually deserted at this hour, but cultivators were on duty day and night.

Ning Zhuo, wearing a simple disguise, arrived.

The duty cultivator didn't recognize him. Startled by Ning Zhuo's arrival, he opened his drowsy eyes. "Fellow Daoist, are you here to register or to exchange your token?"

"Exchange my token," Ning Zhuo said, taking a stone plate from his robe and placing it on the desk.

The cultivator was startled. At this stage, not many people possessed a stone token. Those who did were naturally of the genius level.

"Fellow Daoist, please wait a moment." The cultivator's attitude shifted instantly. He reached out to take the token and began the verification process.

A moment later, the cultivator’s eyes widened, and he snapped his head up to look at Ning Zhuo. "You... you are Ning Zhuo?!"

Ning Zhuo nodded.

The cultivator whispered in shock, "The Ning Zhuo who refused both Hall Master Zhong Dao and Peak Master Tuoba?!!"

Ning Zhuo nodded again.

The cultivator looked him up and down with a face full of wonder, as if saying, I finally get to see the legend in person!

Ning Zhuo had anticipated this. He chose this time specifically to minimize the impact. After a brief exchange, he managed to calm the duty cultivator down.

By taking first place in the Profound Armor trial, the three Confucian trials, and the two Demon Subjugation trials, Ning Zhuo had more than enough qualifications to upgrade his token.

"Your results are incredibly solid," the cultivator remarked sincerely.

Those trials were all extraordinary and had widespread influence. In every single one, Ning Zhuo had given a stunning performance. His victories over Ban Ji, Gu Qing, and others were already the talk of the sect.

"Congratulations, Lord Ning Zhuo, on obtaining your new identity token. I believe this good news will spread throughout the Myriad Manifestations Sect very soon," the cultivator said, cupping his fists.

He then added, "Please register some new information, Fellow Daoist, so I can keep the records up to date."

Ning Zhuo agreed. This was a standard sect regulation.

The last time Ning Zhuo had exchanged his token, he had registered his primary cultivation art, the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art. Now, he needed to register his secondary craft.

Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo reported: "Mechanical Arts."

Ning Zhuo returned to the Azure Stone Cave Abode.

He continued his daily cultivation of the Three Sects' Supreme Methods, focusing specifically on the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.

With the help of the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, he tempered his physical body. He consumed the spirit food prepared by Old Chef, accumulating strength day by day. By studying the Ice Sculpture Manual, Ning Zhuo brought his Ice-attribute attainment back up to the Artisan level.

The trade was successful; Gongsun Yan had brought back more Dao-Bearing Jade Pages from Xiao Juxia.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Qing Chi were practicing against each other with great intensity.

One more trade, and I'll have enough Dao-Bearing Jade Pages, Ning Zhuo planned meticulously. I should see if there are any minor trials related to formations that I can use for my purposes.
