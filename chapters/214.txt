Chapter 214: Divine Constable Explains

Zhu Xuanji arrived with thunderous momentum and left with the wind howling, drawing everyone's attention.

His cultivation was at the Golden Core Stage, and he was a member of the royal family, a renowned divine constable whose every move attracted attention.

Now, his grand actions had already stirred up a storm in the entire city.

People were curious and doubtful: What exactly happened to make Lord Zhu Xuanji act so ostentatiously?

Soon, rumors spread wildly, and Ning Zhuo entered everyone's sight in this manner.

Although Ning Zhuo was just a small cultivator at the third level of Qi Refining, upon closer inspection, his identity was not ordinary.

He possessed a mysterious innate talent and had recently made a name for himself, gaining significant attention.

Not only did he dethrone the young clan leader of the Ning family's main branch, but he also achieved remarkable results in exploring the Lava Immortal Palace, impressing everyone.

Even the Golden Core ancestor of the Ning family, Ning Jiufan, highly regarded Ning Zhuo and publicly stated that Ning Zhuo was a great asset to the Ning family.

On one side was Zhu Xuanji, and on the other was Ning Zhuo.

What exactly happened between these two to make Zhu Xuanji act in such a manner?

For a time, everyone in the city was extremely curious about the inside story.

After returning to his residence, Zhu Xuanji issued an order to summon the three Golden Core ancestors.

The three Golden Core ancestors were curious about Zhu Xuanji's actions and gladly accepted his summons.

Soon, they all gathered in front of Zhu Xuanji.

After the expedition to the Fire Fusion Demon Ape's lair, their relationship had become even closer.

They were natural allies with Zhu Xuanji.

Because the stance of the three major cultivation families in Fire Persimmon Immortal City was to unite with the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family to resist the Ji family!

If Zhu Xuanji from the royal family could become the master of the Lava Immortal Palace, then Fire Persimmon Immortal City could maintain its current state.

If the Meng family controlled the Lava Immortal Palace, the entire Meng family's power would greatly erode Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Eventually, this city would become the private property of the Meng family.

At that time, the three families would have no space to survive and would be squeezed out.

In the reception hall.

Zhu Xuanji, with a solemn expression, scanned the room and said in a deep voice, "Everyone is here."

"I know everyone has questions in their hearts."

"Before we discuss in detail, please sign this oath first." As he spoke, Zhu Xuanji took out a scroll from his bosom.

The scroll was of high quality, a magical artifact, resembling a royal decree from the Southern Bean Kingdom.

When the scroll was unfolded, one could see that its surface was covered with extremely fine formations.

Occasionally, under certain light angles, dense formation patterns would flash and disappear.

Even the three Golden Core ancestors were seeing such a high-quality contract artifact for the first time.

Zhu Xuanji continued, "Please, everyone present, use this scroll to swear that you have no secret dealings with the Shadow Demon Cultivator."

Upon hearing this, the three Golden Core ancestors were astonished.

Recently, Zhu Xuanji had stopped investigating the explosion at the Immortal Palace.

His focus had shifted to exploring the Immortal Palace and gaining more merits and contributions.

Why suddenly involve the Shadow Demon Cultivator again?

Although they didn't understand Zhu Xuanji's intentions, the three Golden Core ancestors still followed his request, each holding the decree scroll and swearing their oaths in public.

Seeing the oath established, Zhu Xuanji's expression softened a bit.

"Just as I thought."

He slowly put away the decree and said to everyone, "Since you all have no secret dealings with the Shadow Demon Cultivator, I will speak frankly."

"The source of all this is this Blood Path Diagram." Zhu Xuanji took out the Blood Path Diagram and handed it to everyone for inspection.

This Blood Path Diagram was of high quality, a magical artifact, with a smooth surface.

Zheng Danlian, a Golden Core cultivator from the Zheng family, was the first to notice something unusual, showing a hint of surprise in his expression.

"Such a high-quality Blood Path Diagram should originally contain a true scripture."

"True scripture?!" Everyone was astonished.

Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly and admitted, "Yes."

"This Blood Path Diagram is a mechanical component that I retrieved from the Mechanical Demon General's body."

"The Mechanical Demon General itself has no spirituality. But with this diagram and the true scripture, it can operate the true scripture's content and perform techniques."

"The Mechanical Demon General is confirmed to have Golden Core level combat power, which means the demonic technique recorded on this diagram is at least Golden Core level."

Upon hearing this, everyone was greatly excited.

Ning Jiufan stroked his beard and said, "The Three Sects Master had a life full of extraordinary experiences and practiced three different techniques, which is rare in history. It's not surprising that he left behind some demonic techniques."

A Golden Core ancestor from the Zhou family said, "I've heard of the so-called Three Sects Master. He left behind mechanical legacies in the Lava Immortal Palace, the most valuable being the Three Sects Techniques. Besides the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, there are two other techniques corresponding to the three dantians of the human body."

"As long as one practices all three techniques, they can form a foundation for the three dantians."

"Now that the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique has emerged, perhaps the demonic technique on this Blood Path Diagram is one of the Three Sects Techniques?"

Zhu Xuanji nodded, showing a faint smile.

"I think the same as you."

"I am also very curious about the content of the true scripture once recorded on this Blood Path Diagram."

"If I can obtain it, I might be able to glimpse the Three Sects Techniques and confirm whether the rumors are true."

"Moreover, if I retrieve the true scripture, it will greatly benefit me when I submit the Mechanical Demon General, earning more merits and contributions."

"So, I used the Tracing Origin Technique on this Blood Path Diagram."

"I obtained a crucial clue - years ago, a small ape accidentally came into contact with the damaged Mechanical Demon General."

"Upon contact, the demonic technique's true scripture voluntarily embraced the small ape and entered its body."

"I wanted to retrieve the true scripture but didn't know the current appearance of the small ape."

"So, seven days ago, I secretly wrote to the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family for help."

"The royal family's cultivators helped me deduce the appearance of the small ape in adulthood and old age."

"With this image clue, I could enlist the help of the Fire Fusion Demon Ape tribe in Fire Persimmon Mountain to assist in the investigation and search."

At this point, Zhu Xuanji couldn't help but look at Ning Jiufan.

Ning Jiufan's face darkened slightly, and he immediately understood Zhu Xuanji's meaning.

Since the last exploration of the bottom of Fire Persimmon Mountain, he had become a distinguished guest.

In the largest Fire Fusion Demon Ape tribe, he was highly welcomed.

If he took the lead with this image clue to seek help, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape tribe would likely assist.

Simply relying on verbal communication, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape tribe's intelligence might not clearly understand.

But with this image, they would have a clear and unmistakable investigation target.

Zhu Xuanji continued, "Today, I received a reply from the royal family."

"I also learned the appearance of the small ape in adulthood and old age."

"The result surprised me - the small ape turned out to be Yuan Dasheng!"

"Yuan Dasheng?" The Golden Core ancestors looked at each other, having never heard of this small figure.

Ning Jiufan asked, "Since Lord Zhu knows him, where is this ape now?"

"Yuan Dasheng!" The Golden Core ancestor from the Zhou family frowned, showing a strange expression, "He is already dead."

The other Golden Core ancestors looked at him.

So, the Zhou family's Golden Core ancestor detailed the series of events that occurred during the Fire Persimmon Festival.

At that time, the Shadow Demon Cultivator was nowhere to be found.

The city lord's mansion led the Golden Core ancestors to dig three feet into the ground but couldn't find the demon cultivator, causing the high-levels of Fire Persimmon Immortal City to lose face.

The Zhou family's Golden Core ancestor suspected that Yuan Dasheng's body hid someone, so he, Fei Si, and Zhu Xuanji went to the Monkey Head Gang to investigate.

They learned that Yuan Dasheng was dead and then went to the Flying Disc Workshop to confirm Yuan Dasheng's corpse.

"So, Yuan Dasheng's body ultimately ended up in Ning Zhuo's hands?" Ning Jiufan was stunned.

Zheng Danlian then said with a smile, "I see! So, after Lord Zhu learned it was Yuan Dasheng, he immediately went to find Ning Zhuo to retrieve the true scripture."

Zhu Xuanji nodded, "But I didn't retrieve it. Ning Zhuo told me he knew nothing about it."

The three Golden Core ancestors looked at each other.

The Golden Core ancestor from the Si family pondered, "Lord Zhu has innate golden eyes and many techniques to detect lies. We cannot deceive him."

"Ning Zhuo is just a small cultivator at the third level of Qi Refining. If he says he knows nothing, it should be true."

"Then, where did the true scripture go?"

Zheng Danlian was full of doubts, "Yes, if the true scripture is not with Ning Zhuo, where is it?"

At this moment, Zhu Xuanji said, "This is the main reason I called you here and had you sign the oath."

With that, Zhu Xuanji held the contract decree and swore in public, "What I am about to say may not be the absolute truth, but it is mostly based on my personal experience, without any falsehood."

After saying this, Zhu Xuanji took a deep breath and began to speak slowly.

"We all know that Ning Zhuo is the inventor of the Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkey. He once took an incomplete Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkey to consult with Chen Cha, the master of the Flying Disc Workshop. And Chen Cha was recruited by Fei Si. After that consultation, Chen Cha reached an agreement with Ning Zhuo, where his workshop would produce the Mechanical Monkeys for sale."

"Shortly after, the Shadow Demon Cultivator attempted to approach the Lava Immortal Palace and was discovered by Daoist Zheng Danlian. A fierce battle ensued. During the battle, a Fire Explosive Monkey carrying a large amount of fire essence bombed the Immortal Palace, causing the Lava Immortal Palace to emerge prematurely, with the transmission bell ringing throughout the city."

"Daoist Zheng Danlian personally saved Ning Zhuo and other Ning family cultivators. Shortly after, the Shadow Demon Cultivator appeared near the dungeon, and Fei Si intervened to protect the Fire Persimmon Forest, preventing further pursuit."

"I began investigating the Mechanical Monkeys but found that these mechanical constructs were everywhere in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, with sales booming. I also investigated the sale channels of fire essence and found no large-scale purchase records in the market."

"When I was at a loss for clues, Fei Si invited me to take action against the Shadow Demon Cultivator during the Fire Persimmon Festival, and I agreed."

"During the Fire Persimmon Festival, everyone present participated and saw Yuan Dasheng of the Monkey Head Gang being attacked by over a dozen Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys. The attack failed."

"But after that, Yuan Dasheng made a mistake while picking persimmons, causing a terrifying explosion. During the explosion, I observed with my golden eyes that Yuan Dasheng tried to use demonic techniques to protect himself but suppressed it, seemingly unwilling to implicate his former master's son."

"I admired his loyalty and appeared in public, ordering Fei Si to open the formation. Fei Si was reluctant at first but complied under my insistence. I entered and treated Yuan Dasheng, giving him a chance to survive. He fell into a coma and was taken back to the Monkey Head Gang's base by its members."

"Fei Si handed his waist token to Ning Zhuo. Ning Zhuo, with the token, entered the Monkey Head Gang's base and persuaded Yuan Er to abandon Yuan Dasheng. Yuan Dasheng eventually died, and Ning Zhuo took his body."

"We searched for the Shadow Demon Cultivator in the Fire Persimmon Forest but never found him. Daoist Zheng Danlian suspected that Yuan Dasheng's body hid someone, so he, Fei Si, and I went to investigate."

"We first went to the Monkey Head Gang's base and learned that Yuan Dasheng was dead and his body was taken by Ning Zhuo. We then went to Chen Cha's workshop. When we arrived, Yuan Dasheng's body had already been drained of all its essence and blood."

Hiss...

The three Golden Core ancestors gasped.

They all understood!

"Is it the City Lord's Mansion!?" Zheng Danlian's face was full of disbelief, "So, the Shadow Demon Cultivator is from the City Lord's Mansion, and they bombed the Immortal Palace. But why?" Zheng Danlian was puzzled, "Before this, the Meng family had secretly allied with my Zheng family and the Zhou family, and we had already reached an agreement in private."
