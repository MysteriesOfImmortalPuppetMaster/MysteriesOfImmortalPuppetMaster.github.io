Chapter 317: The Great Chaos (Part 2)

Zhu Xuanji frowned deeply, "Within the Lava Immortal Palace, there are three Golden Core stage mechanical puppets: the Demon General, the Dao Master, and the Buddha Healer." The Dao Master always remained within the Immortal Palace.

The damaged puppet was abandoned outside, eventually acquired, repaired, and returned to the Lava Immortal Palace by Zhu Xuanji.

Only the whereabouts of the Buddha Healer remained unknown...

Now, Zhu Xuanji had found clues regarding the Buddha Healer.

"It has already been acquired by someone else! Who could it be?"

The mystery deepened.

Zhu Xuanji originally thought he could find some clues about the mechanical scythe from the Fourth Golden Furnace. If he could discover its flaws, that would be even better.

But there were none.

The situation was tense, leaving him no time for careful consideration.

Zhu Xuanji could only memorize this clue and press forward with all his might.

The Secret Pavilion of Opportunities stirred once more.

The buzzing sound of electricity echoed.

Another minor opportunity had already occurred, and this time it was a major opportunity!

Minor opportunities widened the gap between the cultivators in the palace examination, while major opportunities did the opposite, increasing the likelihood of clashes among cultivators.

"Zhu Xuanji!!" The Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator shouted, "Where do you think you're going?" Zheng Danlian revealed a twisted smile, "Why do you keep avoiding battle?"

Zhu Xuanji snorted coldly.

He was not afraid of battle but had seen through the schemes of the City Lord's Mansion. On one hand, they wanted to use Zheng Danlian and the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator to hold Zhu Xuanji back. On the other hand, they aimed to leave more steps for Meng Chong, increasing his chances of breaking through the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.

After all, with each opportunity, everyone only had thirty-six door attempts to take.

Zhu Xuanji retreated, continuing his previous tactics.

Behind him, Meng family's Golden Core  cultivator and Zheng Danlian pursued relentlessly, greatly slowing Zhu Xuanji's pace.

"Very well. It's better to deal with you two first." Zhu Xuanji turned around, expressionless, and faced Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator and Zheng Danlian head-on.

Zheng Danlian laughed wantonly, "Wouldn't it have been better to do this earlier, Lord Zhu?" He wielded his scythe and slashed fiercely.

At the same time, the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator attacked from the left, his fist breaking through the air with immense force, carrying terrifying power.

Boom!

After a violent collision, Zheng Danlian and the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator spewed blood and were sent flying backward.

The two quickly adjusted their stances and landed on the ground.

They saw Zhu Xuanji enveloped in the light of a golden mountain, with a forest of golden branches and jade leaves swaying gracefully, jingling melodiously.

"Three divine abilities?!"

"Golden Mountain Stance, Jade Pillar Body... This is outrageous! Aren't you a divine constable?" Zheng Danlian and the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator exclaimed in succession.

Zhu Xuanji remained expressionless, clenching his fists and launching an attack.

Boom boom...

The clash at the Golden Core stage caused the Secret Pavilion, serving as the battlefield, to tremble violently, its amplitude growing increasingly larger, almost to the point of madness.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was directing the charge.

After the major opportunity, it excitedly discovered that Meng Chong's position was not far from the exit.

"The door on the left." "The door straight ahead." "The door above!"

Under the guidance of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Meng Chong finally reached a Secret Pavilion.

Apart from the door Meng Chong entered through, there was only one other door in the Secret Pavilion.

A massive door.

The door was covered with numerous wooden blocks, which were interlocked and constrained within the door frame.

Each wooden block bore inscriptions.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit continued to transmit messages, "Use these blocks to piece together a correct version of the 'Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique,' and you can open the door and leave the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities!" Meng Chong was overjoyed, rubbing his hands together as he ran to the door.

The next moment, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit transmitted another message, "Be careful! The enemy has arrived."

Meng Chong felt a sudden sense of danger and turned around abruptly, only to see the small door he had entered through being pushed open and then closed again.

"Who is it?"

"A coward hiding in the shadows!"

Meng Chong cast a spell, immediately covering the area around the door.

Under normal circumstances, Ning Zhuo could evade the spell's attack, but Meng Chong, when casting the spell, also combined it with the Innate Talent Wild Sprint Thunderclap.

As a result, the spellcasting speed increased dramatically, enveloping Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo chuckled softly, enduring the spell and revealing his true form.

"Ning Zhuo?" Meng Chong was surprised; he had thought it was Sun Lingtong.

"You've returned here because you're unwilling to give up, right? But if it were me, I would do the same!" Meng Chong nodded.

Then, he showed a fierce expression, "However, if you think you can stop me, you're just dreaming. Stand aside; this is not the second stage of the palace examination's arena."

With that, he raised his fist towards Ning Zhuo. Lightning crackled around his fist, a sign of the Innate Talen Wild Sprint Thunderclap being activated.

Ning Zhuo smiled and stepped forward, saying only, "Let's fight."

Meng Chong laughed heartily, "Ha! Then I'll finish you in ten breaths!" In a flash of lightning, he charged towards Ning Zhuo.

However, before his fist could land on Ning Zhuo's cheek, frost flowers bloomed on the surface of his body. Especially on the leading fist, a layer of ice formed.

Mechanical Ice Snow Weather Sphere!

"Interesting." Meng Chong temporarily retreated.

Grasp Fire Technique!

He was enveloped in flames, dispelling the frost, and his body became hot and agile once more.

Innate Talent—Wild Sprint Thunderclap.

He charged forward, only to be knocked back again.

A massive mechanical ape appeared beside Ning Zhuo.

Golden Core stage mechanical construct!

Ning Zhuo gently patted the mechanical ape beside him, "I've named it Heavy Armored Blood Ape, please appreciate it, Brother Meng." Meng Chong once again assessed Ning Zhuo, his expression different from before.

"You are a worthy opponent, haha, let's fight!" Meng Chong charged forward once more.

In the Lava Immortal Palace's inner circle.

Zheng Shuangjun spat blood as he ran, frantically transmitting messages to Ning Jiufan, "Clan Leader Ning, Brother Ning! Return the Moon Hook to me, and I'll agree to any conditions you set!" Ning Jiufan snorted coldly, "Despicable scoundrel, launching a sneak attack, what face do you have to negotiate with me? No return!" The refusal plunged Zheng Shuangjun into deep despair.

With just a single hook, he was no match for the two Golden Core cultivators of the Great Purity Palace.

He was already in a desperate situation!

"Even if I die, I won't let you have it easy!" In his despair, Zheng Shuangjun charged towards Ning Jiufan.

Ning Jiufan laughed heartily in anger and decisively cast an attack spell, targeting Zheng Shuangjun.

Zheng Shuangjun's body froze from the cold, revealing a massive flaw.

The experienced Golden Core cultivators of the Great Purity Palace, working in perfect harmony, pursued Zheng Shuangjun and struck him down mercilessly.

Zheng Shuangjun let out a tragic cry and fell on the spot!

He was the first Golden Core cultivator to die on the battlefield since the great chaos began.

He was only the first, certainly not the last.

Subsequently, more Golden Core cultivators either died or fled.

The intensity of the battle was simply too great, and the battlefield was too chaotic.

Those who were once revered as sect leaders and ancestors became as insignificant as grass in this chaotic battle.

The scarlet flame beast tide continued to press forward.

The Golden Core cultivators were engaged in fierce internal strife, and the three families and the City Lord's Mansion had dispatched a large number of low-level elites into the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, leaving the inner circle's defenses empty and unable to withstand the beast tide's impact, causing them to collapse one after another.

The three Nascent Soul-level scarlet flame beasts were still being held back by Meng Kui.

But in the next breath, the five-tailed fire fox of the Great Purity Palace reappeared, unleashing five flying flames.

The flying flames were as swift as shooting stars, with Meng Kui's mana hand blocking three of them, but two still fell into the inner circle of the Immortal Palace.

One flying flame landed on the Medical Pavilion, where Ning Jiufan happened to be nearby.

The flying flame exploded with a roar, and fierce flames spread in all directions.

Ning Jiufan found himself in a Nascent Soul-level sea of fire, desperately trying to save himself. But the ice and frost melted away, unable to resist.

"My life is over!" As Ning Jiufan lamented, a mother ape suddenly scooped him up and swiftly carried him out of the sea of fire to safety.

Seeing the Nascent Soul-level Fire Fusion Demon Ape that saved him, Ning Jiufan's expression was extremely complex!

Another flame struck the main hall, absorbed by the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities that surrounded it.

Boom!

In the explosion, the fire burned, destroying large swathes of the purple-blue current, revealing empty spaces.

A large portion of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities was engulfed in flames, with countless cultivators inside suffering casualties.

The related restrictions were thus greatly weakened.

"We can go in!" A Golden Core cultivator noticed this and immediately dove into the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.

His success immediately sparked a wave of imitators.

Book Master, the Golden Core true disciples of the Purple Dawn Pavilion, Luo Shang, Yang Chanyu, many Golden Core cultivators of the Meng family, and several Shadow Demon Cultivators all charged into the Secret Pavilion.

The addition of Golden Core reinforcements saved the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator and Zheng Danlian.

With three divine abilities, Zhu Xuanji maintained a firm upper hand in this confrontation.

The mechanical scythe, however, was selective, allowing Zhu Xuanji to endure multiple attacks, but Zheng Danlian was too weak. In terms of martial skills, he was far inferior to Zhu Xuanji. Even with a sharp weapon, he struggled to make an impact.

The Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator was in an even more miserable state, with multiple fractures and a swollen face, barely clinging to life!

"Zhu Xuanji, don't be arrogant!" "Attack together, no need to hold back."

Several Golden Core cultivators unleashed spells and magical artifacts, converging into a torrential downpour of attacks.

Zhu Xuanji fully activated his three divine abilities, the golden mountain's mysterious light surged, the golden branches and jade leaves clanged, and the jade pillar body remained unmoved.

While enduring the relentless bombardment from numerous enemies, he also harnessed his innate talent.

Innate Talent—Golden Time.

Spell—Weapons of War.

Innate Talent Spell—Sharp Will Golden Weapons!

Golden weapons surged upstream, cutting through thorns and brambles, their sharpness unmatched. They accurately struck their respective enemies, causing the Golden Core cultivators to fall one after another, severely injured.

The ferocity of the assault on Zhu Xuanji was thus greatly reduced.

"Hahaha, die, all of you!!" Zheng Danlian's eyes turned blood-red as he suddenly threw the mechanical scythe in his hand.

The scythe transformed rapidly in mid-air, becoming a massive mechanical snake, launching a surprise attack on the Meng family's Golden Core cultivator.

It opened its maw wide and swallowed a Golden Core cultivator whole!

Then, it turned its deadly attention to the other Golden Core cultivators.

The Meng family's Golden Core cultivators had not anticipated Zheng Danlian's madness, attacking his own allies. By the time they reacted, the second victim's leg had already been bitten and swallowed by the mechanical snake.

In their shock and anger, the Meng family's Golden Core cultivators launched a frenzied assault on the mechanical snake.

But this Night Rain Demon Weapon withstood the terrifying attacks and devoured the second victim!

It then lunged at the third Golden Core cultivator.

The Meng family's Golden Core cultivators scattered in panic.

Zheng Danlian wore a bloodthirsty smile and immediately pursued with the mechanical snake.

His gaze was filled with madness, sending chills down Zhu Xuanji's spine.
