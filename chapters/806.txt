Chapter 806: Ning Zhuo Returns the Treasure

Afterward, there was no suspense left. The quantity of Righteous Xuan Paper Ning Zhuo produced was far ahead of the rest, and its quality was as high as the heavens, leaving the other cultivators to only gaze in awe.

Even after Gu Qing regained his composure, he lost his will to compete. He stopped wasting his precious Noble Qi and instead began to exercise restraint.

Ultimately, with an absolutely staggering lead, Ning Zhuo won the first place of this trial without any dispute!

When Situ Gu made the announcement, he looked at Ning Zhuo with complex emotions. He had wanted Gu Qing to win, but Ning Zhuo’s performance was so stunning that he could not show any bias.

However, though this trial was over, Ning Zhuo’s actions were not yet finished.

He once again brought out the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone, holding it up in his hand for everyone to see. He informed the crowd that the reason he could produce so much Noble Qi was entirely thanks to the Demon Subjugation Hall lending him this heavy treasure.

He asked rhetorically: what merit did he have to hold such a treasure for long?

Therefore, now that he had won, he intended to return this item immediately and express his gratitude to the Demon Subjugation Hall!

"Fellow Daoists, if you are interested, you may come with me to act as witnesses," Ning Zhuo said with a smile, inviting the public.

"We shall go together! Together!" many cultivators responded.

Seeing that there was more excitement to behold, a large number of cultivators stayed.

The three trials had already made Ning Zhuo the most popular cultivator. Initially, it was the top-grade Mountain and River Pages Ning Zhuo refined that made many want to purchase them - profit is what moves hearts. Then, despite not being a Confucian cultivator, he managed to make an outsider like Gu Qing look pathetic, winning over many people. Now, Ning Zhuo had recited poetry in public, his Noble Qi piercing the sun like a white rainbow - what a righteous person!

In dealings with Ning Zhuo, everyone felt at ease and wanted to make such a friend. The cultivators watching the commotion also wanted to forge a good affinity!

Ning Zhuo intentionally rode a cloud, flying at the very front of the group, heading straight for the headquarters of the Demon Subjugation Hall.

Zhong Dao’s subordinate was already among the spectators. Seeing Ning Zhuo’s public declaration and proactive movement, he trembled with excitement and quickly used his methods to send a message ahead.

-----
The Demon Subjugation Hall

Inside the main hall of the Demon Subjugation Hall, Zhong Dao listened to the core members continuously exchanging ideas and discussing ways to resolve their current predicament.

A message arrived.

Zhong Dao’s heart stirred. "Ning Zhuo actively announced that he is coming here to return the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone in public?"

Originally, Zhong Dao had intended to reclaim the treasure after this small trial of Righteous Xuan Paper ended. This was one of the foundations of the Demon Subjugation Hall, a true core treasure. Lending it to Ning Zhuo previously had been an exception, primarily because Zhong Dao wanted to test him.

Now, Ning Zhuo’s proactive return made him seem very sensible in Zhong Dao’s eyes.

"The key is that he is returning it publicly and specifically brought a crowd to witness it..." Zhong Dao immediately grasped Ning Zhuo’s intent.

"This kid indeed has a heart of exquisite jade."

"This is a political show."

"He wants to utilize the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone to its absolute limit!"

Zhong Dao knew of Ning Zhuo’s performance in the Profound Armor Cave. Sensing Ning Zhuo’s intentions this time, he no longer felt the suspicion he had before. The White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone provided Ning Zhuo with the most powerful proof of character!

On this basis, Zhong Dao appreciated Ning Zhuo even more.

To defeat evil, righteousness must naturally be stronger and wiser. Ning Zhuo’s talent was so excellent - only at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment, yet already so extraordinary. He would surely be even more powerful in the future. And since he possessed such sophisticated righteous methods, was that not a manifestation of wisdom?

"If this youth does not go astray, he will surely be a pillar of our Righteous Path in the future!" Zhong Dao’s expectations for Ning Zhuo’s future rose significantly.

"In that case, what harm is there in me cooperating with him for a show?"

Thinking of this, Zhong Dao sent a divine sense transmission, ordering the guards at the main hall entrance to begin preparations.

Ning Zhuo’s procession was grand, and the size of the crowd continued to grow as they approached the Demon Subjugation Hall headquarters.

Three cultivators stood outside early, waiting for Ning Zhuo’s arrival. Upon seeing him, they quickly moved to welcome him, stating they already knew his purpose and led Ning Zhuo and the many cultivators inside.

When Ning Zhuo and the others reached the main hall, Zhong Dao had already activated the hall's formation, creating a vast space within.

Ning Zhuo stepped into the hall and looked up to see Zhong Dao sitting in the primary seat on the high platform. Two rows of cultivators stood to the left and right, their auras ranging from Golden Core to Nascent Soul. Their expressions varied, but an air of elite sharpness was palpable.

Ning Zhuo stepped forward steadily, his wide sleeves flowing like clouds. He bowed to Zhong Dao, his voice as clear as jade striking stone: "Junior Ning Zhuo was graced by the Hall Master’s favor and lent a supreme treasure of the Demon Subjugation Hall. Having obtained first place today, I have come specifically to return it. The White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone is here, returned intact to its rightful owner!"

Zhong Dao stroked his beard, a smile on his face, his voice booming through the hall: "Good! Little Friend Ning Zhuo’s Noble Qi today pierced the clouds and illuminated all phenomena. Such grace is rare even for this old man to witness."

Ning Zhuo bowed again, his gaze as clear as autumn water: "Junior’s talent is dull, and I was fortunate to receive this opportunity from the Hall Master. While holding the staff, I felt a surge of righteousness in my chest, as if seeing the heroic figures of past sages subjugating evil and defending the Dao, and hearing the teachings of past philosophers upholding justice. I shall never forget the Hall Master’s guidance!"

With that, he presented the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone with both hands.

Zhong Dao reached out, using divine sense to pull the staff back into his hand. He looked at Ning Zhuo with even more approval in his eyes: "Good."

"Do you know? The flourishing of righteousness lies in sincerity; the strength of the Dao Heart is valued for its permanence. Though your Noble Qi today has shocked the world, the road ahead is long. You must remain diligent and cautious, as if standing on the edge of an abyss or walking on thin ice. Improve yourself daily like a sprouting spring seedling, and only by preserving your original intent can you reach the end!"

Ning Zhuo responded solemnly: "Junior shall keep the Hall Master’s teachings in mind. I shall take the past sages of the Demon Subjugation Hall as my models, take the protection of the common people as my responsibility, and seek the upholding of the Righteous Path as my lifelong pursuit. Even if I must face death nine times, I shall not repent; even through ten thousand hardships, I shall move forward!"

"Good." Zhong Dao’s appreciation for Ning Zhuo grew even richer.

Then, he looked toward the crowd outside the hall who had followed Ning Zhuo to witness the event: "Three days from now, the Demon Subjugation Hall will begin the second round of the Rising Cloud Trials. This time, compared to the past, the rewards will be even more bountiful, and the opportunities even greater than before. All who aspire to eliminate demons and defend the Dao may come and try!"

Ning Zhuo looked up and promised, his voice shaking the rafters: "Junior will certainly be there!"

Zhong Dao nodded and smiled: "In that case, go and prepare for battle. I shall await the good news."

Ning Zhuo then calmly exited the main hall, his posture as upright as a pine and his white robes as elegant as clouds.

The many cultivators watching outside were all shaken in their hearts.

"To receive such high regard from Hall Master Zhong Dao, Ning Zhuo’s future is bright indeed!"

"How come I don't have such good luck?"

"To be able to burst forth with such astonishing Noble Qi, Ning Zhuo is truly a piece of unpolished jade and refined gold. He will surely become a great talent in the future! It is only normal for him to be valued by Zhong Dao."

"The second round of the Demon Subjugation Hall trials is about to begin. I’m starting to get interested. Haha, what a coincidence, I participated in and passed the first round already!"

"I’m more interested in seeing Ning Zhuo’s performance."

Due to Zhong Dao’s intervention, the Confucian trial had become Ning Zhuo’s stage.

Not only did Ning Zhuo use the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone to leave a stunning impression on the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect, but he also won first place with an indisputable and massive advantage. Finally, he led a crowd to the headquarters to return the treasure publicly.

In the main hall, Ning Zhuo expressed his reverence and gratitude toward the Demon Subjugation Hall and Zhong Dao, declaring his ambition to uphold the Righteous Path. Zhong Dao, in turn, praised him publicly, expressed his expectations, and promoted the second round of the trials.

The influence of both parties increased because of this, especially Ning Zhuo’s.

If Ning Zhuo’s previous fame was just that of a top-tier genius, he had now shown something different. In the eyes of the public, he was beginning to pull away from the likes of Situ Xing and Zhu Fenxiang.

For a time, topics surrounding the sun-piercing Noble Qi and Ning Zhuo himself buzzed throughout the Myriad Manifestations Sect headquarters.

The news reached Pi Fuje.

Pi Fuje’s expression was ugly: "Ning Zhuo is actually this powerful!"

"This is disastrous."

"Such a righteous person - isn't he a natural enemy to me and my Pi family?"

"I previously tried to shift the trouble onto Ban Ji, but even so, Ning Zhuo likely won't let me off."

Pi Fuje fell into a state of distress and anxiety.

Ban Ji also received the intelligence. He snorted coldly and crushed the message talisman into a ball. His gaze was sharp and filled with hatred: "Humph, Ning Zhuo!"

"I'll let you be arrogant for a moment. Once I finish using the Hundred-Refined Golden Body Pill, I’ll come to settle the score with you!"

The Ban family soon obtained the news as well. That night, the Supreme Grand Elder summoned many Nascent Soul-level high-ranking members and once again activated the Clan Pivot Chain.

The chain spun rapidly, and the scenery of their fortune rose like misty clouds and light. They saw that Ning Zhuo’s "fortune arm" was still entangled by thorny vines and eroded by ink rain from book pages. However, this time, the arm was noticeably sturdier, and its struggle against the vines and rain seemed much more powerful.

The fortune arm even emitted a faint platinum glow, strikingly similar to Noble Qi.

The secret chamber was silent. After a long time, the Supreme Grand Elder broke the silence with a raspy voice: "I didn't expect Zhong Dao to interfere and suddenly lend a hand to help Ning Zhuo through this crisis. Alas..."

What was supposed to be a favorable situation had now become a stalemate.

One Supreme Elder analyzed: "Ning Zhuo participated in the first round of the Demon Subjugation Hall trials long ago and performed brilliantly. It could have been predicted that Zhong Dao favored him. It's just..."

Another Supreme Elder picked up the thread: "It's just that no one expected Zhong Dao to favor the boy this much! That was the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone; he just lent it out like that. This shows what kind of status Ning Zhuo holds in Zhong Dao’s heart!"

A third Supreme Elder sighed: "In previous sessions, figures like Ning Zhuo never appeared. Additionally, during the Flying Cloud Assembly, demons have been appearing everywhere. Zhong Dao hates evil with a passion; one can imagine his state of mind. At such a time, Ning Zhuo’s appearance would naturally earn his strong appreciation."

The Supreme Grand Elder’s face was as cold as water: "Judging by his Noble Qi, Ning Zhuo is almost like a young Zhong Dao. Perhaps Zhong Dao saw his former self in Ning Zhuo."

"It was right that we didn't interfere earlier."

"Otherwise, the Ban family dealing with Ning Zhuo would not only violate the rules of the Myriad Manifestations Sect but would also provoke a formidable enemy like Zhong Dao!"

Meanwhile, Zhu Fenxiang said with a face full of impatience: "Mother, it's so late and I still have to cultivate. Keep it short."

Zhu Guizhi had proactively sought out her daughter, and she was currently smiling: "You know about Ning Zhuo’s situation, right?"

Zhu Fenxiang’s expression softened slightly: "Of course. Ning Zhuo has truly become famous throughout the headquarters this time."

Zhu Guizhi nodded: "This youth is full of righteousness and is brilliantly talented. Listen to the poem he recited on the field..."

"Why must one leave grand chapters in history books..." She interpreted, "He was mocking the teacher-student pair of Zhao and Gu who came from the Kingdom of Huazhang."

"The Myriad Manifestations' gates add a new talent..." "He compared himself to a 'new talent,' expressing his desire to actively join the Myriad Manifestations Sect. It resonates well with people."

"Sharpening one's edge before the Demon Subjugation Hall..." "He even hinted at joining the Demon Subjugation Hall. Tsk tsk, no wonder Zhong Dao cooperated with him for a political show."

"This person is indeed excellent. It's rare for me to see such an outstanding individual among the younger generation."

"Being so righteous, it's very reassuring to be his friend. More importantly, his righteous methods are so mature and experienced. If it were me, I might not have been able to pull it off so perfectly."

Zhu Guizhi showered Ning Zhuo with praise in front of her daughter.

Zhu Fenxiang’s brow furrowed tighter and tighter: "Mother, what exactly do you want to say? Just say it."

Zhu Guizhi chuckled: "Don't you fancy Little Friend Ning Zhuo? I was thinking, since his performance was so stunning today and he’s at the height of his fame, why don't we show more goodwill to build a better affinity? What do you think?"

Zhu Fenxiang turned her face slightly: "How does Mother suggest we do that?"

Zhu Guizhi said: "I’ve thought about it deeply before coming here. We must grasp the right balance - too much is counterproductive, too little is ineffective."

"In my opinion, don't we already know the content of the next Confucian trial? Why don't we pass this secret to Ning Zhuo? What do you think?"

Zhu Fenxiang: "..."

Seeing her daughter’s strange expression, Zhu Guizhi couldn't help but ask.

Zhu Fenxiang waved her hand: "I already did that before the trials even began."

Zhu Guizhi: "Ah?"

Zhu Fenxiang reached the limit of her patience. She stood up and walked toward the door: "I haven't finished my lessons for today. Mother, I won't see you out."

Zhu Guizhi was stunned for a moment and subconsciously replied: "Okay, okay."

Watching Zhu Fenxiang’s departing back, Zhu Guizhi finally reacted and thought to herself: "Fenxiang really does like Ning Zhuo. She was already in secret communication with him before the trials!"

"However, by doing it then, the effect is several times better than doing it now!"

"Could Fenxiang’s eye for talent really be better than mine?"

-----
In a mountaintop tea room, Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing sat opposite each other.

Zhao Hansheng stroked his beard and smiled: "This Ning Zhuo is extraordinary! Qing'er, it is indeed fitting for him to be your opponent this time."

Gu Qing sighed: "Though he relied on external power, his heart holds righteousness, and he could release such staggering Noble Qi. To be honest, I admire him."

He had recovered from his initial shock. After true reflection, he couldn't help but feel a sliver of admiration for a righteous person like Ning Zhuo. Unlike demonic or heretical practitioners, Ning Zhuo’s righteous halo made it hard for even an opponent like Gu Qing to hate him.

Zhao Hansheng tested him: "In that case, how do you plan to respond next?"

Gu Qing replied: "Next is the Heart-Fire Paper, which involves the Strange Path. I am not very confident; Ning Zhuo’s foundation is extraordinary, so he might make me lose another round."

"But!"

"In the fifth round, for the Inheritance Jade Page, it is impossible for Ning Zhuo to defeat me."

"From the very beginning, I am the final winner of this Rising Cloud Minor Trial!"

As he said this, Gu Qing displayed an expression of absolute certainty.
