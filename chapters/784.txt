Chapter 784: The Truth of Qi Luck

Cold.

A coldness that penetrated deep into the marrow.

Boundless, endless cold.

Meridians completely shattered, Dantian destroyed...

The sect gate collapsing amidst raging flames...

The figures of fellow disciples falling one after another, and the Master's final shout...

Inside the Frost Howl Valley, everything was destined to be buried in deathly silence and glacial ice. But deep within, that intense unwillingness and resentment, that obsession with survival, continued to surge, like lava beneath an iceberg that could not be extinguished.

Splash.

Ling Mo fell into the glacial river. His entire body knotted with frost, turning into a thin swaddling of white ice that temporarily wrapped around his broken body and soul.

Dead silence.

Emptiness.

No hope, no sound, no warmth; even his own pain became blurred. The thirst for revenge, the extreme craving for power, became his sole spiritual pillar.

He gradually heard other sounds - the sound of his own blood flowing, nearly stagnant, and the beating of his heart, faint as the collision of ice chips.

The Ice Spirit Root within his body was echoing the principles and power of the Frost Howl Valley, and the seeds of a future drastic change were slowly germinating.

...

Standing on the bank of the glacial river, Ling Mo successfully came ashore.

He looked down at his hands and checked his injuries; they had actually healed for the most part.

His body had undergone a mutation.

His skin had become pale, faintly revealing the texture of ice crystals. When his fingertips touched the air, a slight swipe would bring forth tiny icicles.

He felt power!

A power that was cold, hard, and pure to the extreme, like solid ice mixed into his flesh and blood.

He faced a nearby ice hill, slowly clenched his fist, and then struck out.

Bang.

The ice hill exploded, turning into a cloud of the finest ice dust that scattered in all directions amidst the shockwave.

Yet, Ling Mo’s face twisted. He felt that using his past cultivation arts created a violent conflict with his physical body. That simple punch just now had actually caused him internal injury.

A thought flashed through his mind: "I must adjust everything properly before I can leave this place."

Outside, there were surely people still hunting him.

Thus, he went into hiding and began to digest this mutation.

Several years later.

He stood on a hill looking back. In his field of vision, the Frost Howl Valley remained only as a blurry outline.

His heart was filled with excitement. During the adjustment process, he had modified his cultivation art and created the Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Forging Demonic Art. His combat power soared, and his cultivation base had risen to the Golden Core level.

Now, it was time for revenge!

He sought out his former enemies. No wasted words, only the most primal slaughter.

His physical body, his fists, were the most terrifying weapons. Extreme cold froze countless people to death. Wherever he walked, a trail of frost would automatically spread beneath his feet.

One faction after another was annihilated.

Men, women, cultivators, mortals... all turned into ice sculptures in various postures, their expressions frozen in terror.

The success of his revenge caused his humanity to be lost rapidly. Ling Mo's heart grew colder, and his attitude toward all living beings became increasingly indifferent.

The pained roars and hateful curses of living beings, and even their scalding blood, could not stir a single ripple of emotion in his eyes.

He was like a humanoid blizzard; wherever he went, he brought calamity.

The pursuit from the Righteous Path naturally followed.

"Ling Mo, you have fallen into the Demonic Path! The technique you created is incomplete; it has affected your mind!"

"Surrender. Perhaps there is still someone who can cure you."

Ling Mo simply raised his hand like a blade.

Battle commenced.

Fight after fight...

Eventually, he was captured, imprisoned, and reached the end of his life.

At the moment of death, his eyes became vivid for a split second.

"Finally... free."

In a very short period, Ning Zhuo experienced Ling Mo's entire life.

His eyes flashed with brilliance: "Using the spine as the pillar of heaven and earth to bear the weight of Profound Ice! Using the meridians as the old channels of a glacial river to guide the torrent of cold energy! Using flesh and blood as fertile soil to nurture an imperishable demonic body!"

"This is the Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Forging Demonic Art!"

"But... it is incomplete and has a major flaw. That is, the person who masters it will gradually lose their humanity, turning into a heartless blizzard. Even their reason will be eroded, eventually becoming almost entirely lost."

Ning Zhuo felt as if he were there, clearly perceiving the entire process. Humanity was like flowing water, constantly draining from Ling Mo's heart. At first, it was just human emotions - joy, sorrow, fear - being replaced by absolute rationality and calmness.

Then came indifference. He felt no distinction between all living things and the human race; his soul could no longer be moved.

"He didn't kill people intentionally. It was just the blizzard sweeping through; all living beings received the same treatment."

Amidst his sighs, the more Ning Zhuo pondered, the more he gained.

He was now completely certain that in this second wave of Demonic Path soul procurement, Ling Mo was definitely the greatest harvest!

"His comprehension was actually just average, but inside the Frost Howl Valley, by a stroke of luck, his Spirit Root and physical body underwent a mutation."

"This mutation allowed him to survive. In the process of adjusting and improving his original cultivation art, he took advantage of the situation to create the Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Forging Demonic Art."

It wasn't strange for a mutation to occur.

Frost Howl Valley was one of the world's wonders, equally famous as the Burning Star Pit. The former was filled with the principles of frost and sound.

At that time, Ling Mo's body and soul were broken, but his Ice Spirit Root resonated with the outside world, drawing the principles of the Frost Howl Valley to erode his physical body.

Such a transformation would usually cause death, but Ling Mo was very lucky.

He survived and even improved the Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Forging Demonic Art, further excavating and utilizing his mutated flesh and Spirit Root.

In essence, Ling Mo and Ning Zhuo were the same.

Ning Zhuo received the blessing of Lord Qingwu's principles, adding principles from three aspects - Military, Mechanism, and Artifact Refining - to his body.

Ling Mo, on the other hand, was eroded by the environment of the Frost Howl Valley, adding principles of Ice and Sound to his body.

But for Ning Zhuo, it was beneficial without harm. For Ling Mo, that was likely not the case. His subsequent descent into the demonic path was likely largely due to the blessing of these principles.

When he was pursued and captured, his entire person was almost an ice sculpture; the remaining flesh and blood were quite scarce.

The influence of the Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Forging Demonic Art was only a small part; it was mostly caused by the principles weighing upon him.

It was like in the Jade Rinse Pavilion, where ordinary stones would transform into various beautiful jades in that environment. For a stone, becoming beautiful jade was equivalent to completely losing its original self.

Ling Mo was the same. He eventually became a humanoid blizzard, or rather, a subsidiary body of the Frost Howl Valley capable of moving outside.

This reminded Ning Zhuo of the battle between Situ Xing and Zhu Fenxiang.

At the end of that battle, Zhu Fenxiang's divine statue underwent Dao Transformation, nearly causing huge trouble. Fortunately, the formation of the Martial Arts Hall was powerful and directly suppressed it. But as a result, that Martial Arts Hall was unusable for a long time.

"Gods use Divine Power, Divine Arts, and so on, which are expressions of related principles."

"The so-called 'Dao Transformation' should be a massive amount of principles being added to a certain object. But the object cannot bear it, causing the principles to vent outwards. Like water overflowing from a cup."

In short - "Ling Mo wasn't cut out for it"!

He couldn't withstand it.

But Ning Zhuo could.

"Is it because of my Innate Talent? Does it allow me to accept external principles?" Ning Zhuo became more curious about his mysterious Innate Talent.

The experience and memories of Ling Mo's life provided Ning Zhuo with a rich foundation.

In the later stages of his life, after completely falling into the demonic path, Ling Mo's combat power rivaled that of a Nascent Soul.

"It's a pity it isn't Yin-attribute."

If this harvest had been Yin-attribute, Ning Zhuo felt there would be at least a sixty percent chance of rescuing Yuan Dasheng.

"I've had enough. Two waves of Demonic Path souls, and not a single expert cultivating Yin-attribute techniques."

"If they aren't experts, they can't provide help for Yuan Dasheng's problem."

"It seems I can't completely rely on the black market here."

"The Myriad Manifestations Sect is a Righteous Path force after all; the scale of the black market here is limited."

Ning Zhuo had a premonition that to obtain Yin-attribute demonic souls, he would have to start with the White Paper Immortal City.

However, the entire Qing-Jiao Army was loathed by the Underworld Celestial Heavens and had forged a feud with the Forgetful River Prefecture. It was not suitable for large-scale capturing of Yin-attribute demonic souls.

In this regard, Ning Zhuo still needed to be patient.

Ning Zhuo recorded the Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Forging Demonic Art. Utilizing the Luo Shu, the Confucian techniques of "head suspended from a beam" and "needles piercing the thigh," and so on, he re-learned and rapidly digested this foundation.

After studying it several times, he gained significant insights, triggering frequent bursts of inspiration.

He took out the Ice Sculpture Secret Classic (gifted by Ning Jiufan) and read it twice more.

Still not satisfied, he took out the Ling Shuang and Ao Xue Wisdom Maps to view.

Finally, he took out the Snow Pivot Imperial - Xie, researched it thoroughly, and then buried himself at his desk. Writing as if possessed by a god, he rapidly drew up relevant new mechanism blueprints.

Meanwhile.

Ban Family Ancestral Hall.

In a secret chamber, many Grand Supreme Elders were gathered, their gazes focused on the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain in the center.

The Clan Destiny Pivot Chain was in operation.

Streaks of spiritual light flowed and intersected between the tracks. The spiritual pivot slider occasionally struck the secret pattern copper bells, creating clear, melodious chimes that contained unfathomable heavenly secrets.

Spiritual rhyme rose, transforming into a vision of Qi Luck.

At first, it was just a blur, but as the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain continued to operate, it became clear.

A Grand Supreme Elder felt surprised: "Is this the manifestation of Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck? We can already calculate it?"

The person beside him clarified: "Last time we used the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain to engage with him on the level of Qi Luck, we received the aid of the Royal Mandate. Now, my Ban Family, Ban Ji's Royal Mandate, and the Qi Luck of Ning Zhuo's Human Tribulation are even more deeply entangled."

"Therefore, the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain can clearly calculate part of the truth."

Since it concerned the Royal Mandate and Human Tribulation, the Grand Supreme Elders summoned twelve-tenths of their spirit to observe carefully.

They saw that in the center of the vision, there was an arm. Seemingly void yet not void, existing between reality and illusion - it was the manifestation of Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck.

The Qi Luck arm's five fingers were spread wide. Between the flexion and extension of the knuckles, it seemed to contain infinite profound mysteries. Its momentum was like a dragon extending its claws, constantly grasping and seizing in the void.

Every grasp could retrieve a bit of frost qi, taking it into the palm. With every bit absorbed, the arm became a bit more substantial.

"Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck is in the shape of an arm; what is the principle behind this?"

"With every breath, it is constantly growing stronger. This speed of growth is simply terrifying!"

"What does this frost aura represent? The Mystic Armor Cave has little relation to the ice attribute."

While everyone was discussing, another change occurred.

A page of plain white paper appeared out of thin air. Thin as a cicada's wing, yet it seemed to carry a weight like a mountain.

The paper vibrated silently, scattering countless pitch-black ink dots. Like a sudden rainstorm pouring down, they dripped onto the Qi Luck arm.

Sizzling sounds arose. The ink dots were like living things, rapidly penetrating into the arm.

Immediately after, tiny fly-head standard script characters emerged on the surface of the arm, all formed from the black ink.

The ink characters gathered, forming articles one after another.

Once the articles were complete, they lifted open on their own. The "skin" of the Qi Luck arm curled and changed along with them. In an instant, it actually transformed into flipping pages of a book.

The crowd seemed to hear a rustling sound as the outermost pages peeled away from the arm like fallen leaves.

The eyes of the Grand Supreme Elders suddenly brightened. Someone exclaimed in a low voice: "This is someone making trouble for Ning Zhuo. By the looks of it, they are using articles - is it a Confucian cultivator?"

"Doesn't the Confucian cultivator community think highly of Ning Zhuo?" More people were puzzled.

The changes in the Qi Luck continued.

A thorny vine, looking as if painted with red lacquer and covered in barbs, crept over.

The thorns, like living creatures, wrapped around the arm. They coiled and tangled around the ring finger of the five fingers, turning into a thorny ring.

The ring tightened continuously, firmly constricting the finger.

The thorns pierced deeply into the finger, and wisps of Qi Luck dispersed, quickly absorbed by the thorny spikes.

The Grand Supreme Elders were puzzled, muttering in their hearts: "Which faction is this, secretly making trouble for Ning Zhuo?"

At the end of the transformation, clouds gathered from all directions around the Qi Luck arm, assuming a posture of enveloping it.

The clouds condensed into a whole. At first, they looked like magnificent jade towers and celestial cities, breathtakingly beautiful. Then, the outline of the cloud city gradually twisted, turning into a gigantic plain white coffin!

The coffin descended, slow but heavy as a mountain. Even though the Grand Supreme Elders were merely onlookers, seeing this scene made them feel a deep oppression, even suffocation.

The vision of the truth of Qi Luck dissipated completely.

The many Grand Supreme Elders looked at each other in dismay.

"Why does it feel like Ning Zhuo is facing layer upon layer of calamity?"

"It seems if left to develop, he will bring about his own destruction..."

"Then what should we do next?"

The Head Grand Supreme Elder took action, activating the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain to produce another transformation.

After the transformation, the Qi Luck vision appeared again, turning into three stars. One star was orange-yellow, with mechanisms flipping on its surface. One star was crimson red, with demonic energy rising. And one star was deep purple, the celestial body constantly shape-shifting strangely, resembling smoke and mist.

The Head Grand Supreme Elder said in a deep voice: "Previously, when we dealt with Ning Zhuo with all our might, the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain produced a strange change. The answer has now been deduced."

"This is the germination of the Royal Mandate on Ban Ji's side. It joined forces to deal with Ning Zhuo, helping our clan's Clan Destiny Pivot Chain turn danger into safety."

"We have achieved our original goal. We have caused Ning Zhuo's good luck to flourish violently and be consumed drastically. In the future, when it weakens, let Ban Ji take action to resolve his Human Tribulation."

Speaking to this point, some Grand Supreme Elders immediately understood why three stars had manifested.

Ban Ji's Immortal Talent was the Myriad Puppet Demon Freak, representing three types of Qi Luck: Mechanism, Demonic Path, and Strange Path.

This corresponded exactly to the three stars before them.

The Head Grand Supreme Elder continued: "The Royal Mandate germinated, aiding the success of our luck technique."

"The three stars before us are precisely the crux of Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck."

"They represent the explosion of his Qi Luck in the three aspects of Mechanism, Demonic Path, and Strange Path."

"Once the three stars have finished exploding, his Qi Luck will turn from peak to decline, falling into a slump."

"At that time, it will be the opportunity for Ban Ji to strike!"
