Chapter 668: Water Burial Accumulates Virtue

After signing the alliance with the White Paper City Lord, the entire Qing-Jiao Army breathed a collective sigh of relief.

Their situation had been precarious.

In the Underworld, the army was despised by the Nether Heavens and could no longer remain there. Returning to the Living Realm, the Ghostly Black Marshlands offered the best refuge.

Firstly, this was the Qing-Jiao Army's ancestral homeland, providing ample resources for survival. Secondly, the Qing Clan within the army were Ghostfolk, and living under the sun was deeply uncomfortable for them. They thrived in the damp, dark environment of the marshlands.

With the Divine Contract signed, the Qing-Jiao Army had gained the White Paper City Lord's recognition, eliminating any hidden threats and allowing them to settle here in peace, continuing their cultivation and lives.

Ning Zhuo summoned Jiao Ma's biological father and the current leader of the Qing Clan, instructing them to oversee the reorganization of their respective families.

The Qing-Jiao Army also included a significant number of ghostly creatures.

These creatures had been directly converted on the battlefield using Qing Chi's Art of War: Ghost Currency Exchange. Discarding them would be a waste, and slaughtering them even more so.

Fortunately, Luo Si, a Nascent Soul-level Ghost General, had recently joined their ranks. Ning Zhuo entrusted him with the task of reorganizing these ghostly creatures.

Qing Chi remained unconscious.

Ning Zhuo, Luo Si, and Sun Lingtong discussed her condition without success. None of them were skilled in medicine, but they all suspected it was related to the Nether Dragon Scissors, a National Artifact.

Ning Zhuo possessed the Lord of Forgetful River Seal, but he hadn't refined it.

The Nether Dragon Scissors, also a National Artifact, had been forcibly refined by Qing Chi. The Azure Flame's domineering power left Ning Zhuo and the others secretly astonished.

Qing Chi, still at the Foundation Establishment stage, had taken on an immense burden by forcibly refining such a powerful artifact.

Her blood burned, transforming into raging Azure Flames that scorched the Nether Dragon Scissors.

The artifact had only been partially refined, still far from being completely subdued.

Had she been a normal Human, Qing Chi would have long since perished. But within the Ghostfolk, life Qi and Death Qi existed in equal measure. The Azure Flame, a power that unified life and death, could both heal and destroy.

Her current state resembled a python that had swallowed an elephant, now lying motionless, desperately trying to digest the massive creature within its belly.

Ning Zhuo carefully examined her with his divine sense and found that Qing Chi's condition was slowly improving.

After all, the Nether Dragon Scissors had no external support, and the longer time passed, the weaker it became.

Ning Zhuo's task was to periodically tend to Qing Chi, replenishing her body and soul with nourishment to sustain the Azure Flame's scale and heat within her.

With the environment now stable, this proved remarkably straightforward.

Despite his lingering injuries, Ning Zhuo began studying the Water Burial Harmony Accumulation Virtue Sutra.

"The highest good is like water, benefiting all things without strife. Burial is not an act of annihilation, but the pivot of harmony, correcting imbalance and restoring equilibrium. Through water as the medium, it connects yin and yang, transforming turbidity into purity, circulating ceaselessly. Thus, accumulating virtue is like rivers converging into the sea, a continuous, self-sustaining process..."

"Water possesses four virtues: First, gentleness - bending to conform, circumventing obstacles, flowing unhindered; Second, capacity - distinguishing clarity from turbidity, remaining unfazed by floating or sinking, neither rejecting nor welcoming; Third, constancy - dripping through rock, trickling into ravines, its persistence enduring; Fourth, purity - cleansing dust, reflecting truth, returning to the Void, revealing the heart of Heaven..."

Ning Zhuo's brow furrowed deeper as thoughts shattered like bubbles in his divine sea. Occasionally, lightning-like insights flashed across the sky of his Divine Sea Dantian.

Lost in the sutra, he forgot the passage of time. Only after a full day and night did he awaken from his immersed state.

Looking utterly exhausted, Ning Zhuo hastily consumed some Spirit Food before collapsing into a deep sleep.

After a thorough rest, he took a Medicinal Pill to heal his injuries and immediately resumed studying the Water Burial Harmony Accumulation Virtue Sutra.

This sutra, like the Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra, consisted of only a few hundred characters, yet contained profound meaning, embodying both Dao and principle.

Relying on his advanced mastery of the Water Element, Ning Zhuo made rapid progress in the initial stages of comprehension.

By the third day of study, he was confident he could successfully perform the sutra's techniques.

After a brief period of meditation to refine his state, he instructed his men to prepare the Ceremonial Barracks, arranging piles of Ghost Corpses.

Ning Zhuo stood before the Ghost Corpses, performed the necessary hand seals, and activated the Water Burial Harmony Accumulation Virtue Sutra.

Water mist materialized from the Void, rapidly spreading to envelop the entire pile of Ghost Corpses. Soon, droplets of dew condensed, some slowly drifting downward from the mist, while others formed within and upon the ghostly remains.

Ning Zhuo waved his arms, his fingers tracing a Taiji symbol in the air.

Simultaneously, he intensified his spiritual energy infusion, causing the water mist to boil and continuously dissolve the Ghost Corpses.

The mountain of ghostly creature corpses gradually diminished.

As the corpses dissolved, faint specks of merit-laden light, like tiny fireflies, drifted out and converged into Ning Zhuo's body.

The entire process lasted an hour. By the end, Ning Zhuo had completely cleared away the mountain of ghostly creature corpses.

Luo Si and Sun Lingtong observed the entire process.

Sun Lingtong asked curiously, "What does it feel like to have merit enter your body?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head, indicating he felt nothing at all.

Luo Si explained, "This technique was left behind by the Ash Bone Elder, specifically taught to you. It's bound to be extraordinary. This is just your first time using it. With practice and accumulation over time, the benefits will undoubtedly grow immensely."

Ning Zhuo frowned slightly. "But if we're going to perform the Water Burial for Senior Greybone, I'm afraid this level of merit won't be enough."

Sun Lingtong reassured him privately, "Little Zhuo, don't worry. Since your mother left a special message in the Jade Slip instructing you to first practice on these ghostly creatures before performing the Water Burial of the Ash-Boned Elder by the Forgetful River in the Underworld, this arrangement must be feasible!"

"From now on, you'll learn through practice, constantly refining your skills and deepening your understanding."

"I'll help you too."

This task had been specifically entrusted to Ning Zhuo by the Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin, who urged him to complete it as soon as possible.

After completing the Water Burial of the Ash-Boned Elder, Ning Zhuo needed to immediately head to the Myriad Manifestations Sect's headquarters.

Although the Flying Cloud Assembly was still some time away, Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin had left a message urging Ning Zhuo to arrive as early as possible.

"Before the Soaring Cloud, first Flourish the Cloud."

Ning Zhuo, being a dutiful son, naturally heeded his mother's advice.

He returned to the commander's tent, closed his eyes, and sat in meditation, carefully contemplating the profound sensations that eluded his grasp.

Ning Zhuo then resumed studying the Water Burial Harmony Accumulation Virtue Sutra, finding it clearer than before.

"Ah, if only Spirit Hidden Willow were here," Ning Zhuo sighed, missing his precious treasure.

Unfortunately, he now had to rush back to the Southern Bean Kingdom, a journey far too long.

A round trip would likely cause him to miss most of the Flying Cloud Assembly.

Ning Zhuo continued to study and practice, deepening his understanding.

Sun Lingtong also assisted him in his contemplation, communicating with Ning Zhuo in secret.

"...Burial is not burial of form, but return of Qi to the Void; Surge is not opposition, but harmony with the dust. Dewdrop clarity, mirror-like self-illumination; Virtue like clouds and water, passing through peaks without a trace..."

When they reached this passage, Sun Lingtong shared his interpretation: "This is the essence of Harmony: freedom from intention and attachment. Forced burial harms Harmony; forced accumulation diminishes Truth."

Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up instantly. Sun Lingtong's words sparked a series of inspirations, each insight building upon the last, deepening his understanding of the Water Burial Harmony Accumulation Virtue Sutra by several orders of magnitude.

Two days later, standing before a mountain of ghostly corpses, he once again invoked the Water Burial Harmony Accumulation Virtue Sutra.

This time, the water vapor rapidly coalesced, condensing into a fine drizzle that soon transformed into a steady rain. Under this gentle downpour, the mountain of ghostly corpses vanished completely within the time it takes to burn an incense stick.

Strands of merit, like wisps of smoke, continuously flowed into Ning Zhuo's body.

Luo Si, witnessing this, praised Ning Zhuo's astonishingly rapid progress.

Ning Zhuo returned the compliment, noting the immediate and remarkable effectiveness of Luo Si's recent training of the ghost soldiers.

This was no small feat!

These ghostly creatures were the survivors of countless Grand Formations, each a formidable warrior. Among them were numerous Ghost Kings, painstakingly nurtured and cultivated by the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts herself.

Two more days passed.

A mass of ghostly creatures, tightly bound together, stood before Ning Zhuo. He raised his hands, forming sword-like gestures with his fingers, and traced the Taiji symbol across his chest.

As soon as he activated the Water Burial Harmony Accumulation Virtue Sutra, clouds surged into the sky, coalescing into heavy rain clouds. A torrential downpour followed, dissolving countless ghostly creatures.

The rainwater gradually formed puddles on the ground, their surfaces rippling endlessly. In deeper pools, tiny waves began to form.

These ghostly creatures were still alive, forcibly subjected to a Water Burial that took only the time it takes to brew a cup of tea.

Vast amounts of merit, like countless silken threads, converged upon Ning Zhuo's body. Yet, using his Divine Sense Projection, he redirected these threads of merit to Sun Lingtong and Luo Si.

After a moment, Ning Zhuo exhaled a long breath of turbid qi, his robes billowing as he slowly withdrew from his stance.

Turning to Sun Lingtong and Luo Si, who had been observing, he said, "It's time to return to the Underworld."

Ning Zhuo summoned Jiao Ma's biological father and the Qing Clan representative, instructing them to guard the camp diligently, forbidding them from venturing out without permission, and assuring them of their safe return.

The trio traveled light, plunging deep into the Underworld Flood Dragon River to re-enter the Underworld.

Upon entering, they were immediately caught in a powerful underwater vortex. After a fierce struggle, they finally broke free.

Knowing they were despised by the Nether Heavens, they hurried toward the nearest Forgetful River without stopping.

Their journey was fraught with continuous disasters.

By the time they reached the Forgetful River, two days had passed, leaving them covered in dust and grime.

The Forgetful River roared ceaselessly, its surging waves seeming to carry the wails of countless Wailing Souls.

With a solemn expression, Ning Zhuo retrieved the Ash Bone Elder's remains and pushed them into the river's churning waters.

Ning Zhuo formed a hand seal, and a misty vapor billowed from his sleeve, coalescing into a rain cloud in mid-air. A torrential downpour cascaded onto the river's surface, dissolving the Ash Bone Elder's remains.

Suddenly, a bone-chilling yin wind swept across the river, its corrosive force lashing out at Ning Zhuo.

Luo Si and Sun Lingtong, already prepared, immediately countered, shattering the yin wind with their combined might.

But the yin wind was merely a prelude. Dark clouds churned overhead, unleashing bolts of lightning that crashed down in rapid succession.

Sun Lingtong ducked his head, leaving Luo Si to bear the brunt of the assault. He clicked his tongue inwardly, realizing that the Water Burial of the Ash-Boned Elder had provoked the Nether Heavens' deeper, more intense animosity. The calamities unleashed far surpassed those encountered during the Qing-Jiao Army's retreat!

Ning Zhuo traced the yin-yang taijitu with his hands, channeling the rain's momentum into surging waves. Countless waves crashed over the Ash Bone Elder's remains, accelerating their dissolution tenfold.

Streams of merit, shimmering like carp, flew toward Ning Zhuo before vanishing into thin air.

Guided by his divine sense, Ning Zhuo diverted sixty percent of the merit carp to Luo Si and Sun Lingtong, where they merged into their bodies like water filling a well - not stored, but dissipating into nothingness.

The Ash Bone Elder's skeleton crumbled inch by inch, wisps of green smoke rising into the air despite the relentless rain.

Finally, the Ash Bone Elder vanished completely, marking the successful completion of the Water Burial!

Ning Zhuo closed his eyes slightly, standing at the edge of the River of Forgetfulness, his mind racing to grasp the fleeting spiritual light that had flashed through his consciousness.

After a long moment, his eyes snapped open, a sharp glint flashing through his pupils like lightning.

The Water Burial of the Ash-Boned Elder had yielded him great rewards.

He turned to Luo Si and Sun Lingtong. "I've finally grasped Senior Greybone's true intentions."

"He was the mastermind behind the plot, one of the culprits who sabotaged the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme. Like us, he was despised by the Underworld Celestial Heavens."

"By performing his Water Burial here, I acted on behalf of Heaven, earning the Underworld Celestial Heavens' approval and accumulating merit in the Underworld."

"These merits have now neutralized the hatred clinging to us."

"From now on, the more merit we accumulate, the less hatred will cling to us. Eventually, we'll shift from negative to positive favor, perhaps even earning the Nether Heavens' favor!"

This good news only deepened Luo Si's sorrow for the Ash-Boned Elder.

He sighed deeply, gazing at the surging river. "Even in his final moments, Senior Greybone was still looking out for us. He sacrificed his own corpse, maximizing its value to help us!"

The three bowed deeply in unison toward the Forgetful River.

The return journey was far easier than the initial one, with less than thirty percent of the previous mishaps and calamities.

Luo Si pondered aloud, "It seems we need to do something for the Nether Heavens in the future - redeem ourselves through meritorious service."

Sun Ning and the other cultivator nodded in unison.

This was indeed necessary.

In her Jade Slip message, Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin had already made arrangements for the Qing-Jiao Army.

To continue expanding, the Qing-Jiao Army needed to do more than just recruit more soldiers; they needed to train in the Underworld!

Although crossing the Underworld Flood Dragon River would lead them directly into the territory of their mortal enemy, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, the Forgetful River Prefecture would inevitably be fully engaged in repelling the Ghostfire Prefecture's fierce offensive, leaving them little capacity to crush this small army.

Moreover, the Qing-Jiao Army's base was located within the Seventh Paper Soldier Army's hidden stronghold.

This location, meticulously chosen by the Profound Primordial Scholar, was exceptionally well-concealed.

Upon returning to the Ceremonial Barracks, Ning Zhuo received joyous news - Qing Chi had awakened!

"But..." The Qing Clan cultivator's face clouded with sorrow as he slowly shook his head.

Knowing Qing Chi's condition, Ning Zhuo quickly asked, "Does she remember anything?"

The Qing Clan cultivator shook his head again, his voice heavy with sorrow. "The clan leader remembers nothing."

Ning Zhuo fell into a long silence.

In that silence, the three of them reached the camp tent. Lifting the curtain, they saw the young woman, Qing Chi, huddled in a corner, wielding a wooden stick like a sword. She swung it fiercely, shouting and driving away anyone who dared approach her.

The surrounding cultivators tried to calm her down, but the Ghost-Human Clan girl remained stubbornly defiant, causing everyone to feel overwhelmed.

Then, the overwhelmed young man appeared.

Qing Chi's expression instantly softened. She gazed at Ning Zhuo with a dazed tenderness, her voice unusually gentle. "Who... are you? Why do I feel such warmth towards you?"

Guilt gnawed at Ning Zhuo's heart. He sighed deeply, met Qing Chi's gaze, and spoke softly, "Don't be afraid. It's me."

Ning Zhuo parted his lips slightly, wanting to introduce himself, but found himself unable to speak.

For a fleeting moment, he considered telling Qing Chi that his name was Jiao Ma.

But in the end, he gritted his teeth and faced her directly. "Hello, Qing Chi. I am Ning Zhuo."
