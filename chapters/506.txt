Chapter 506: Dragon Shadow Nine Pillars

When Ning Zhuo heard Song Ji’s comments, his heart stirred slightly.

His first thought was not of the Dice Bone Demon God, but of the Marrow of the Void Demon God.

Though a Demigod was merely at the Golden Core level, the Marrow of the Void Demon God was of the Soul Formation level.

“The marrow was the greatest benefit I gained from expending my fortune!”

“Before reaching Bi Kong Mountain, I also impersonated the Old Monster in the Stone and robbed the transport convoy of the Two Notes Country, acquiring countless military supplies. Even now, that storage pouch at the treasure-grade level remains unopened.”

“There must be many good things inside!”

“Furthermore, I later used talismans to teleport to the Red Flower Camp, assisting Mulan in killing Di Lu and driving away the Cang Yue Ancient God. This military merit also counts as my gain.”

“Calculating it all… hiss…”

Ning Zhuo couldn’t help but secretly draw a cold breath.

The more he tallied this muddled account of fortune, the more alarmed he became.

This surge of powerful fortune had brought him too many benefits, and even after the fierce battle at Moon Hook Mountain, much of it still lingered.

“How immense must this fortune have been initially?!”

“Who was so kind as to secretly support me?”

“If I ever get the chance to find them in the future, I must repay them in some way.”

To this day, Ning Zhuo still did not know the truth.

Song Ji’s divination also verified Ning Zhuo’s earlier suspicions.

“My fortune is currently declining. I must keep this change firmly in mind. If I grow complacent or rely on my strong fortune, I might suffer a blow.”

“Thus, humility and caution remain the best strategies for navigating the world and conducting oneself over the long term.”

“I must continue maintaining these excellent habits!”

Ning Zhuo silently reminded himself.

Upon learning of Ning Zhuo’s fate, Du Tiechuan set aside some of his hidden worries.

He spoke calmly: “Song Ji, take Ning Zhuo away and interrogate him for detailed information about the enemy’s internal affairs.”

Hearing this, Ning Zhuo immediately stood up and clasped his fists: “Commander Du. In this recent battle, I assisted General Mulan in killing one Nascent Soul cultivator, repelling another, and gaining some military merit.”

“Now, with a major battle imminent, if I could use my merits to withdraw some rare elixirs in advance to enhance my physical foundation, it would allow me to serve the army more effectively!”

“Hmm?” Du Tiechuan raised his eyes to look at Ning Zhuo, his gaze stern and displeased. “My military governance has always been strict in rewards and punishments, applied uniformly.”

“According to military discipline, now is not the time for awarding merits.”

“The entire army —including myself and all soldiers —must strictly adhere to this.”

“This is no trivial matter! If I agree, it would undoubtedly corrupt the kingdom’s systems, harm military discipline, be unfair to other officers, shake morale, weaken fighting spirit, and cause immense harm.”

Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly: “Commander, it’s just withdrawing some elixirs to enhance my physical foundation.”

“Your Excellency may already be aware of my situation.”

“As you can see, I am merely at the Foundation Establishment stage. Charging into battle carries too great a risk.”

“If my physical body could advance rapidly in a short time, I would surely add a quasi-Nascent Soul level combat strength to our army!”

Du Tiechuan shook his head slightly, his expression icy: “How much benefit could a mere quasi-Nascent Soul level bring to the overall war situation?”

“Speak no more of this.”

“Leave!”

Ning Zhuo had no choice but to salute: “As you command, I take my leave.”

Song Ji saluted and prepared to follow him out.

Du Tiechuan sent a psychic message, communicating privately: “Who granted Ning Zhuo such powerful fortune? Can you divine it, Song Ji?”

Song Ji replied covertly: “Extremely difficult.”

“I, too, find it strange.”

“By normal principles, such vast external fortune would require the caster to pay an enormous price.”

“Who would sacrifice so much to prop up Ning Zhuo?”

“Even if he were a favored scion of a great clan, such support would be excessive.”

“Additionally, there is another oddity.”

Du Tiechuan: “Oh?”

Song Ji continued: “Normally, externally bestowed fortune of this kind would be consumed violently and could not last.”

“But my recent divination shows that the fortune on Ning Zhuo is not being consumed so fiercely.”

“In fact, there are even signs of recent nourishment.”

Du Tiechuan pressed: “Why is that?”

Song Ji shook his head: “Fortune is an obscure study; my knowledge is but superficial. Methods to nourish external fortune are bizarre and varied. I cannot judge.”

Du Tiechuan: “Then let it be.”

“Next, I must trouble you to thoroughly probe the enemy’s situation.”

“With your methods, I trust you will detect any concealment from the Dice Bone Demon God or Ning Zhuo.”

Song Ji immediately accepted the order, vowing to spare no effort in executing it.

Song Ji led Ning Zhuo alone to a tent.

Ning Zhuo released the Dice Bone Demon God: “Old Dice, you must speak all you know without reservation. But if it concerns your own safety, do not force yourself.”

Ning Zhuo specially instructed.

The Dice Bone Demon God said: “Master, this old servant was never close to those from Thousand Peaks Forest. All I know, I have already told you.”

Ning Zhuo nodded: “Now, repeat it here in front of Lord Song.”

He then sent a psychic message to Song Ji: “I must trouble you to cast detection spells to prevent the Dice Bone Demon God from misleading our army with false information.”

“To be honest, my subduing him was entirely coincidental.”

“Even now, I remain somewhat uneasy.”

Seeing Ning Zhuo’s proactive request, Song Ji openly employed numerous divination methods.

After the time it took to drink two cups of tea, Song Ji escorted Ning Zhuo out.

Ning Zhuo, having failed to obtain body-enhancing elixirs from Du Tiechuan, showed no dejection.

Returning to the Three Generals Camp, he briefly reported the situation to the three generals.

All three generals sighed in relief.

Zhang Hei: “So we slipped through?”

Guan Hong shook his head silently.

Liu Er said: “Shen Qinghe has been secretly following us. But since we subdued the Dice Bone Demon God and returned victorious, Commander Du, for the greater good, has not settled accounts with us yet.”

“From my understanding of Du Tiechuan, this reckoning will come eventually.”

Ning Zhuo nodded, agreeing with Liu Er’s analysis.

Among the three generals, Liu Er was the most astute in discerning others.

After bidding farewell to the generals, Ning Zhuo returned to his tent, entered the Mechanical Wandering Dragon, and resumed crafting mechanical puppets.

Sun Lingtong watched and learned, gaining much.

By the next afternoon, Sun Lingtong could operate one of the mechanical platforms, saving Ning Zhuo considerable time and effort.

Ning Zhuo entered the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, enveloped in thick stone skin via the Great Arts Of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing, to enhance his physical foundation.

Late at night, he broke free of the stone skin and resumed his relentless work repairing Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu.

Though these Golden Core-level puppets had been split into pieces, their spiritual cores remained intact, making repairs manageable.

“The effect is truly remarkable, boss!” After his first cultivation session, Ning Zhuo clenched his fists, feeling unprecedented power brewing within.

He praised Sun Lingtong sincerely: “To invent this cultivation method, boss, you’re a genius!”

Sun Lingtong, overjoyed, planted his hands on his hips and laughed heartily: “Of course! I am your boss, Little Zhuo!”

After several days of cultivation, Commander Du issued a new order.

He commanded the Red Flower Camp, Three Generals Camp, and other troops to relocate several miles outward.

He then ordered the dismantling of Woodwheel Town’s walls, replacing them with defensive lines formed by a dozen armies, and commenced large-scale construction.

Logistical units—array masters, artifact smiths, and even a few mechanic masters—collaborated, employing diverse methods.

With ample resources, hundreds of cultivators worked day and night, swiftly erecting the foundation of a colossal structure.

As Du Tiechuan did not forbid observation, the project drew the entire army’s attention from the start.

Everyone wondered —what was the purpose of such a grand, lavish construction?

At dusk, Ning Zhuo took a break to inspect the foundation.

He saw a square, vast base, imposing even in its unfinished state.

Built from Dragon Chant Stone, each block bore shifting dragon patterns. Pressing an ear to the stone revealed faint draconic roars, growing clearer and mightier as the structure expanded.

The base was bordered by thick railings of Thunderbolt Iron, sturdy and capable of absorbing and storing lightning.

At the center stood a giant pillar topped with a basin-sized Dragon Soul Pearl. With his naked eye, Ning Zhuo saw a dragon soul swirling and roaring within the pearl.

“Dragon Chant Stone is a dragon-vein material, refined over time by national energy. It’s an excellent medium for channeling a kingdom’s power.”

“The dragon soul within the pearl must have been at least Soul Formation level in life. Dragon souls best resonate with dragon-vein energy.”

“This seems like an altar to sacrifice a Soul Formation-level dragon soul?”

“Truly a commander’s handiwork—grand from the outset!”

Ning Zhuo marveled before returning to cultivate.

In three days, his strength surged over tenfold, his skin now tough and resilient as if clad in artifact-grade armor.

Hearing the “altar” was 60% complete, with rampant speculation among the troops, he went to observe again.

The structure now revealed a trapezoidal shape, still primarily Dragon Chant Stone.

Workers began laying Glazed Golden Light Tiles at the base—typically used in palaces, their radiance exuding regal majesty.

Ning Zhuo grew puzzled: “Using glazed tiles doesn’t fit an altar.”

He noted eight pillars around the structure, each half the height of the central pillar. Their tops were carved with auspicious clouds and golden roc patterns.

Squinting, Ning Zhuo discerned complex talismanic and formation patterns on the pillars.

“At least eight defensive talismans and twelve auxiliary formation talismans.”

“As for the formations… without seeing the whole, I can only detect four layers.”

Here, Ning Zhuo realized his formation knowledge was insufficient.

He remained calm.

“Though well-read, my studies were limited to clan schools and their public libraries.”

“Among cultivation arts, formations are famed for complexity and depth.”

“I’ve only scratched the surface —my accumulation here has just begun.”

Though unclear on Du Tiechuan’s aim, Ning Zhuo knew the commander was investing heavily.

“What is he planning?” The question echoed among all.

Three days later, the structure was complete.

The trapezoidal platform stood flat-topped, centered on the dragon soul pillar.

Surrounded by railings and eight golden roc pillars, activated formations fused the glazed tiles into a seamless whole. A dragon shadow from the pearl roamed the tiles, its vigorous form radiating power.

Soldiers heard dragon roars resonating in their hearts —loud when focused on, faint otherwise.

Two military banners flanked the central pillar, fluttering as formations harmonized, exuding awe-inspiring might.

The answer was revealed: a Reviewing Platform.

The Dragon Shadow Nine Pillars Reviewing Platform!

The day after completion, Du Tiechuan ordered a military review.

The next day, fully armed, he stood atop the platform, activating military tactics.

Looking down, he watched troops march past the platform. The Three Generals Camp and Red Flower Camp were among them.

As Military Adviser, Ning Zhuo rode beside the three generals.

During the review, he felt layers of invisible force sweeping over him, accumulating relentlessly.

By the end, Ning Zhuo was drenched in sweat, muscles aching.

Had he not enhanced his physique, he might have fallen from his horse in disgrace.

Grateful, he also gleaned more of Du Tiechuan’s intent.

Others shared his deductions.

“So that’s it!”

“The commander is deploying his trump card.”

“To think he’d use it before the battle even begins! How thrilling!”

“Iron Torrent Flattens the Plains! How many years has it been since he last used this move?”
