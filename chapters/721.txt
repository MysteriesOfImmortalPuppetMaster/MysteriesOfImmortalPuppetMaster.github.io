Chapter 721: Lady Spiderweb: Woof! Woof! Woof!

Che Zhuzi asked Ning Zhuo what kind of magic treasure he desired.

Ning Zhuo quickly considered his options.

I'm only at the Foundation Establishment stage. Many magic treasures are beyond my reach, consuming too much spiritual energy.

"Actually, I already have two defensive treasures. What I really lack is a proper offensive one."

But the same problem remains - magic treasures drain spiritual energy too quickly. How many times could I even use it consecutively?

The Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art, my cultivation art, excels in control rather than raw spiritual energy reserves.

So, instead of an offensive treasure, I'd be better off sticking with my mechanical constructs.

"Whether it's the Heavy-Armored Blood Ape Dasheng, the Phantom Blade Night Tiger, or the Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Snow Pivot Imperial Song, all are Golden Core-level constructs - far more practical than any magic treasure!"

Perhaps... I should ask for a treasure that aids in learning.

Ning Zhuo had always been a diligent student.

However, instead of answering immediately, he countered with a question: "Senior Che, what kind of Method do you specialize in?"

Che Zhuzi gave Ning Zhuo a meaningful smile. "Come with me," he said, turning to leave.

After a moment's hesitation, Ning Zhuo followed closely behind.

This was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, generally considered safe. Che Zhuzi was risking violating sect rules by luring Ning Zhuo into a trap.

The threat posed by Che Zhuzi was likely minimal.

More importantly, Ning Zhuo believed that even a swarm of spider puppets would only amount to a single Golden Core-level opponent.

Having weathered countless grand battles, Ning Zhuo felt utterly confident.

He followed Che Zhuzi to a stone chamber.

"This is my treasure vault," Che Zhuzi said, his expression calm but subtly proud, "where I store many of my magic treasures."

Ning Zhuo's gaze was immediately drawn to the chamber, his eyes sweeping across its intricate details.

The octagonal vault was lined with massive bronze wall panels, their surfaces embossed with intricate mechanical patterns and interlocking gears.

The vaulted ceiling, translucent and deep blue like glazed glass, was embedded with 360 Star Pearls, collectively emitting a natural starlight.

The floor was paved with luminous tiles, between which blue spiritual light occasionally flowed, shifting and reforming in mesmerizing patterns.

Recognizing the tiles, Ning Zhuo immediately surmised, "There must be a secret chamber beneath this floor."

The treasure vault appeared empty, but with a wave of Che Zhuzi's sleeve, the bronze wall panels unfolded, revealing the scenes hidden within.

Behind one panel lay a crystal lattice cage. Inside hung several storage pouches, their spiritual patterns faded or riddled with holes.

More than a dozen mechanical postal spiders, varying in size, hung suspended within the crystal lattice cage. Even the largest among them was no bigger than an adult's Origin.

They clung to the storage pouches, their metallic joints clicking crisply as they moved.

Drop by drop, Void Spider Silk oozed from their spinnerets, carefully filling the tears in the storage pouches.

Then, the honey spiders' delicate legs tapped around the edges of the tears, deploying temporary reinforcement talismans.

This single scene held Ning Zhuo spellbound for a long time.

Against the wall opposite the honey spider cage stood a Starlight Dipper Rotation Instrument. Three bronze rings interlocked and rotated, their surfaces constantly flowing with shimmering silver starlight.

Ning Zhuo recognized this mechanical construct from his books - a device used for calculations.

He instinctively looked up at the Star Pearl piercing the ceiling, immediately understanding the treasure chamber's fundamental design: "The Star Pearl collects natural starlight, serving as both the chamber's light source and the primary fuel for the Starlight Dipper Rotation Instrument."

Natural starlight contained the principles of heaven and earth, its true essence.

When consumed by the Starlight Dipper Rotation Instrument, it yielded computational power.

This computational power, in turn, drove the dozen mechanical postal spiders in the adjacent chamber to meticulously repair the storage pouches.

This also explained why the Starlight Dipper Rotation Instrument and the Spider Collapse Cage were positioned so close to each other - they required close coordination.

On the other side of the Spider Collapse Cage stood another mechanical construct: the Yellow Crystal Spider Cluster.

The spider cluster resembled a honeycomb, as if cast from amber, divided into numerous small compartments. Many of these compartments housed mechanical butterflies.

The cluster emitted a hazy yellow light, its luminous pupils expanding and contracting like breathing.

Ning Zhuo could faintly discern dense layers of Magic Restrictions within the yellow glow: "It seems to be the manufacturing method for these mechanical spiders, along with some blood refinement techniques?"

Positioned against the three walls were magic treasures.

One was the Heavy Mountain Shovel, its shovel head as large as a door panel. The upper and side edges of the shovel head, as well as its long handle, were riddled with large and small steam vents.

At a single glance, Ning Zhuo felt an overwhelming aura of aggression and destruction wash over him.

Another treasure was the Pure White Wandering Cloud.

The cloud floated within a Glazed Bell. At the bell's apex, a spinning wheel whirled ceaselessly, generating a vortex. Precious cloud materials were drawn in from outside and pulverized into mist by the vortex.

The Formation within the Glazed Bell operated continuously, consuming Spirit Stones to replenish the bell's spiritual energy while simultaneously applying invisible pressure.

The intertwined spiritual energy and cloud mist within the bell created a high-pressure environment for the Pure White Wandering Cloud.

The third item lay in a pool of earth. At the center of the pool's bottom rested a turtle shell, most of its surface worn smooth, with only about forty percent of its original patterns remaining.

Around the pool, a vast array of jade stones were arranged: Kunlun Jade, Shangtian Azure Jade, "Inaccessible Human Gold", and more. These jades were slowly being refined, their essence absorbed by the turtle shell, gradually replenishing its lost patterns.

Ning Zhuo, uncertain, asked, "Senior Che Zhuzi, could this turtle shell be the Profound Turtle's Heavenly Armor?"

Che Zhuzi cast an admiring glance at him. "Young man, your discernment is remarkable. You're exactly right - this is indeed the Profound Turtle's Heavenly Armor!"

Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up with envy.

Part of his reaction was a deliberate attempt to cultivate a connection with Che Zhuzi, but the emotion was also genuine.

Xuan Gui turtles were born with an innate Method, possessing an extraordinary ability to find escape routes from desperate situations, allowing them to emerge unscathed. As spiritual beasts naturally inclined toward fortune and averse to misfortune, they were notoriously difficult to capture, making every part of their bodies exceedingly rare.

The turtle shell was the most valuable treasure material from a Xuan Gui. It could be considered a natural Method talisman, reusable multiple times. Each use would help a cultivator unleash a Tong Jia technique, often enabling them to escape mortal peril. The cost, however, was the gradual erosion of the shell's patterns, with each activation consuming a portion or section of them.

The Profound Turtle's Heavenly Armor was undoubtedly a life-saving artifact.

It could even be used several more times!

Ning Zhuo's heart stirred at the sight of it, and he nearly blurted out his choice.

Yes, it was merely a natural treasure - a part of the Xuan Gui's body from its lifetime - not a magic treasure.

But for most cultivators, the turtle shell, imbued with the Method and concealing some mechanism of fate, was far more precious than any magic treasure!

Che Zhuzi, ever observant, noticed Ning Zhuo's gaze fixed intently on the An Turtle Shell and couldn't help but smile slightly.

He clapped his hands and called out, "Come in."

As soon as the words left his lips, Lady Spiderweb pushed open the side door and entered.

She wore a crimson dance dress adorned with pearls and crystal shards that shimmered with dazzling light. Her skin was pale and cold, almost translucent under the starlight, revealing faint blue veins beneath. Her lips, painted with Peng fat, were full and glistening. Her eyes darted nervously, glancing at Ning Zhuo before quickly lowering her gaze, her entire being radiating unease and tension.

Ning Zhuo glanced at the female cultivator with curiosity, unsure why Che Zhuzi had summoned her.

Che Zhuzi, who had been watching Ning Zhuo closely, asked, "So, you don't recognize her?"

The question was odd.

Ning Zhuo studied Lady Spiderweb more closely, his confusion growing. "Should I?"

Ning Zhuo sensed a deeper meaning behind Che Zhuzi's words and immediately inquired, "Senior, what do you mean?"

Che Zhuzi pointed at Lady Spiderweb. "This woman is my slave. You may choose her as your reward."

Ning Zhuo's eyes narrowed slightly as he decided to test the waters further. He shook his head, indicating he would rather receive a magic treasure than a female cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Stage.

Lady Spiderweb's chest heaved with anger. She had feared Ning Zhuo would capture her and make her his dog, but hearing him prefer a magic treasure over her only fueled her fury.

How dare he! she seethed inwardly. Am I, Lady Spiderweb, truly less valuable than a mere magic treasure?!

Che Zhuzi chuckled deeply and explained, "Young friend Ning Zhuo, there's a reason for my suggestion. This woman is deeply connected to you."

Ning Zhuo bowed respectfully. "Please enlighten me, Senior."

Che Diezi then meticulously recounted the entire sequence of events to Ning Zhuo.

"I played along with her scheme and eventually uncovered the truth. It turns out this woman went to great lengths to infiltrate my inner circle, all to use me to frame you..."

"From that perspective, I was dragged into this mess because of you."

Ning Zhuo firmly shook his head, refusing to take the blame. "I'm a victim here too, Senior. Didn't your interrogation reveal that the Ban Clan was behind this, targeting both of us?"

With that, Ning Zhuo pulled Che Zhuzi onto his side.

He then exposed Lady Spiderweb's bluff: "The Ban Clan is a righteous sect, renowned for their mastery of mechanisms. They wouldn't stoop to targeting me personally."

"It must be Ban Ji!"

"Though born into the Ban Clan, he's a disgrace to their name. He hails from the Righteous Path but cultivates demonic arts, his temperament twisted, his greed boundless."

"Lady Spiderweb is merely at the Foundation Establishment Stage. This isn't the work of the esteemed Ban Clan."

"It has to be Ban Ji!"

"For a righteous cultivator to collude with a demonic cultivator and use their connections is perfectly normal."

Lady Spiderweb had previously invoked the Ban Clan's name to protect herself. By directly pointing the finger at Ban Ji, Ning Zhuo aimed to alleviate Che Zhuzi's internal pressure.

Che Zhuzi chuckled softly. "This is a feud between you and Ban Ji. As a man of no principle, I won't meddle in your juniors' squabbles."

With Che Zhuzi's shrewdness, how could he possibly have missed Lady Spiderweb's bluff? He simply chose not to expose it, using the situation to negotiate with Ning Zhuo and secure the best possible outcome for himself.

Ning Zhuo had no concrete evidence to prove Ban Ji was the mastermind, only his own deduction. Yet he spoke with such conviction that his words carried undeniable weight.

This was all to lure Che Zhuzi into the trap.

Ning Zhuo and Che Zhuzi exchanged a glance, each fully aware of the other's capabilities.

Their seemingly casual negotiation had been a silent battle of wits, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of each other.

Che Diezi pressed, "So, what do you choose? The magic treasure or this woman?"

At that moment, Ning Zhuo felt the full weight of Che Zhuzi's cunning.

He gritted his teeth, his brow furrowing into a forced expression of helplessness. "The exchange."

The situation was clear.

Compared to the Xuan Gui and Tong Jia, Ning Zhuo valued obtaining crucial intelligence more.

If Ban Ji was plotting against him, Lady Spiderweb likely knew some of the details. This information was vital to Ning Zhuo.

Even if Lady Spiderweb claimed ignorance, her testimony alone would be a powerful weapon against Ban Ji in the future.

Lady Spiderweb's vision darkened, and she struggled to speak. "Ning Zhuo, I can pay my own ransom!"

Che Zhuzi chuckled. "Little Friend Ning Zhuo is now your master. Everything you own belongs to him. What do you have to offer for your freedom?"

Curious, Ning Zhuo asked directly, "Senior, what are the exact terms of the contract binding her?"

"Rest assured." Che Zhuzi held up the contract for Ning Zhuo to examine. "This is a slave contract. The terms are quite strict."

"Whatever you command her to do, she must obey. Even if she resists, her body will betray her."

"For example... bark like a dog for us."

Che Zhuzi turned to Lady Spiderweb, a mocking grin spreading across his face.

"No! I won't!" Lady Spiderweb's face twisted in terror, her heart churning with defiance.

But the next moment...

Woof! Woof! Woof! Her physical body, beyond her control, barked involuntarily.

Lady Spiderweb's pupils shrank to pinpricks. Shock and horror gave way to overwhelming humiliation and rage.

I... I... I just barked like a dog?!

Her pride lay shattered. She wanted nothing more than to smash her head against the wall and die.

Utter humiliation! Utter humiliation!

Che Diezi, I will kill you! Ning Zhuo, you'll die too!

Lady Spiderweb's silent screams echoed in her mind.

Che Zhuzi laughed heartily, turning to Ning Zhuo as if showcasing his product. "Well?"

Ning Zhuo cupped his hands in a respectful bow. "I'll take her."

"A wise decision." Che Zhuzi beamed with satisfaction, raising his hand. The contract floated toward Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo accepted it, carefully reviewed the terms, and, with Che Zhuzi's cooperation, instantly became Lady Spiderweb's master.

Lady Spiderweb's vision swam with darkness. Her worst nightmare had come true. She had wanted Ning Zhuo to be her dog, but now she was his slave.

The cruel reality left her feeling absurd and utterly hopeless.

Che Zhuzi was immensely satisfied.

By transferring the contract, he had not only saved one of his magic treasures but also rid himself of Lady Spiderweb, while simultaneously forging a connection with Ning Zhuo.

It was like reaping three harvests in a single season.

Che Zhuzi reached out to escort Ning Zhuo away, but the latter smiled and expressed keen interest in the Void Spider Silk, wanting to purchase a large quantity.

Hearing talk of business, Che Zhuzi's spirits immediately lifted. He found Ning Zhuo even more agreeable and directly asked how much "a large quantity" meant.

Given Ning Zhuo's mere Foundation Establishment cultivation, Che Zhuzi remained skeptical of his claims of a "large quantity."

Instead of answering, Ning Zhuo asked about Che Zhuzi's monthly production capacity.

Che Zhuzi raised his head slightly, pride swelling in his chest. "I produce nearly twenty strands of Void Spider Silk daily. Each strand is guaranteed to be Golden Core grade, a top-tier treasure material!"

Ning Zhuo feigned surprise. "I've only ever heard of Senior operating alone. Do you have family or close relatives?"

Che Zhuzi burst into hearty laughter, his chest swelling with pride as he raised his head slightly. "I work alone!"

After his self-castration, his production capacity had skyrocketed seventeenfold!

The past limitations on his output were now a distant memory.

Hmph.

Ning Zhuo's question had struck Che Zhuzi's vanity, further confirming his own brilliance and foresight.

He found Ning Zhuo even more agreeable now!
