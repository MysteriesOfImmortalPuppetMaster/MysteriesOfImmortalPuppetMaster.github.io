Chapter 627: Forgetful River Prefecture Lord vs Lady of Sorrowful Bones

Earth Element - Sand Surge!

Earth Element Spleen Temple!

Ning Zhuo split his consciousness in two - one half focused on the battlefield, the other immersed in his Five Organs Temples.

By utilizing the Earth Element statue's control, Ning Zhuo significantly reduced his spell practice time. His execution now demonstrated exquisite precision and peerless mastery, as if second nature.

Ning Zhuo gaze upward, and instantly, a torrent of yellow sand erupted from the void.

The sand cascade plunged downward in majestic force, cascading along the city walls and engulfing hordes of Withered Bone Dead Soldiers.

The swirling sand vortex at the wall's base devoured two Skeleton Bone Bridges before abruptly dissipating - dispelled by the enemy general's ghost technique.

At least three Ghost Generals combined their efforts, unleashing continuous ghost techniques that coalesced into a massive Ghost Hand, which tore through the air toward Ning Zhuo.

Unflinching, Ning Zhuo remained rooted in place. Suddenly, he extended his right hand, fingers forming a sword-like gesture.

Metal Element - Geng Metal Storm!

Metal Element Lung Temple Amplification!

A massive surge of Geng Metal Qi erupted from his sword-like fingers. The razor-sharp metallic energy collided with the Ghost Hand, instantly halting its advance.

The three Golden Core-level Ghost Generals roared in unison, pouring additional spiritual energy into their technique.

The Ghost Hand, continuously eroded by the golden qi yet sustained by spiritual energy, maintained its colossal form as it lunged toward Ning Zhuo. However, its speed had drastically diminished.

Ning Zhuo scoffed coldly. The statue within his Metal Element Lung Temple came alive with unprecedented vitality, manipulating the spell to execute a subtle yet crucial transformation.

In the next instant, the Geng Metal Qi transformed into a swirling vortex, rapidly circulating to encircle the Ghost Hand completely.

Trapped and immobilized, the Ghost Hand was annihilated by the Geng Metal Storm within mere breaths.

The three Golden Core Ghost Generals each let out muffled grunts as they shared the backlash from their spell's destruction, sustaining only minor injuries.

Despite their combined efforts, three Golden Core cultivators had failed to match even a single Foundation Establishment cultivator - a devastating defeat!

Ning Zhuo pressed his advantage, redirecting the Geng Metal Storm downward to ensnare a Bone Bridge that had nearly reached the city wall's crest.

Shhhk! Shhhk! Shhhk! Shhhk!

The air filled with bone-chilling screeches of metal against bone. The Bone Bridge's hardened skeletons disintegrated like rotten wood under the storm's fury, reduced to a swirling haze of white bone dust.

The tempest swept across the battlefield, erasing the entire Skeleton Legion and its hundreds of Withered Bone Dead Soldiers. Only a carpet of bone fragments remained.

Witnessing Ning Zhuo's overwhelming power, the Flying Spear Ghost General seized a Magic Artifact-grade spear. With a roar, he hurled the weapon toward his opponent.

Ning Zhuo's Mechanism Ring suddenly contracted, but even without its warning, he had already noticed the attack.

Water Element - Vortex Shield Return!

Water Element Kidney Temple activation.

A stream of azure water materialized out of nowhere, instantly encircling Ning Zhuo's body to form a massive water shield.

The Flying Spear struck the water shield, immediately triggering a violent whirlpool within it.

The swirling currents absorbed the spear, constantly altering its trajectory. After circling within the water shield, the spear shot out in a different direction.

Boom!

The spear struck the base of another Skeleton Bone Bridge, demonstrating tremendous power as it completely destroyed the bridge.

The Flying Spear Ghost General glared furiously, never expecting Ning Zhuo to turn the tables and use his own attack to destroy the Netherworld Army's bridge. Fortunately, these Skeleton Dead Soldiers lacked much consciousness; otherwise, their morale would have plummeted.

Having successfully counterattacked, Ning Zhuo maintained the water shield while immediately activating another technique.

Wood Element - Root and Vine Entanglement!

Wood Element Liver Temple activation!

Ning Zhuo, focusing on multiple tasks, performed auxiliary movements to cast the spell while maintaining other techniques.

His left hand formed a finger seal, completing all motions within two breaths. He then flipped his palm downward and made a pushing motion toward the base of the city wall.

The earth shook violently as countless thick, dark green vines burst through the hardened soil, surging forth like living serpents! These vines ignored the skeleton soldiers' hacking blows, instantly coiling around their leg bones, torsos, and arms before mercilessly crushing them.

Wherever the vines passed, sections of the Skeleton Legion collapsed. Before the scattered bones could even hit the ground, the exposed Soulfires were swiftly extinguished by the advancing vines.

In this instant, nearly all the Skeleton Dead Soldiers near the city walls were annihilated. Even the Bone Bridge of skeletons was completely destroyed.

This section of the wall was saved from imminent danger by Ning Zhuo's solitary efforts. The young man's astonishing performance drew countless eyes.

Then, in the next moment, the astonishment in those gazes turned to awe.

Fire Attribute - Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique!

Fire Element Heart Temple enhancement!

Ning Zhuo cycled through the Fire Element again, unleashing his signature area-of-effect technique.

Three Fire Dragons roared to life, soaring from the city walls with devastating force. They charged nearly half a mile away, incinerating countless Skeleton Dead Soldiers before they could even approach the wall.

Five or six Golden Core-level Ghost Generals struck back in unison. Some countered with ghost techniques against the fire dragons, while others enhanced their Withered Bone Dead Soldiers with military strategies.

Ning Zhuo's control over the fire dragon was remarkably precise. He evaded numerous ghost techniques while maximizing his destructive potential.

After considerable struggle, the Ghost Generals finally eliminated the three-headed fire dragon. Their faces twisted with displeasure, they stood panting and thoroughly disheveled.

Within the barracks behind the city walls, Qing Chi turned to look in Ning Zhuo's direction.

She and the Qing-Jiao Army served as reserves, still awaiting their moment to enter the fray. As they stood on standby, they witnessed the fire dragon soaring through the skies, its roars echoing across the battlefield. The final thunderous explosion of the dragon's self-destruction shook the air. "Which powerful cultivator is leading this assault?" she wondered.

The sheer might of the fire dragon's presence lifted her spirits. This style of attack clearly didn't belong to the Netherworld Army - it had to be one of their own cultivators at work.

Ning Zhuo unleashed another round of Five Elements Techniques. Within moments, the stretch of wall before him stood completely cleared of Withered Bone Dead Soldiers, leaving a wide-open expanse.

The cultivators beside him opened their mouths slightly, realizing there was no need for their intervention.

Just as Ning Zhuo prepared to launch a third wave of attacks, the sound of drums echoed across the battlefield. Tie Guzheng's rotation order had been issued!

Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo turned and left. His combat discipline, honed through the Two Note Kingdom wars, proved invaluable.

The moment he stepped down from the wall, the Ink River within White Paper Immortal City began churning violently. Over a hundred towering waves erupted from the waterway, with at least six massive columns rising into the sky. They transformed into six colossal Ink River Water Serpents, their movements now unchecked.

Boom... Boom...

The colossal water pythons wreaked havoc around them, reducing countless buildings to rubble in an instant - crushing, collapsing, and destroying everything in their path.

Ning Zhuo's pupils contracted sharply. "Is this Zheng Shoumo's backup plan? Or is there another Internal Traitor secretly manipulating events?"

He remained on standby, following his training protocol as he entered the barracks for emergency mobilization.

The disturbance within the city had been anticipated by the White Paper Immortal City's leadership all along.

After all, Zheng Shoumo hadn't been captured alive. His escape had severed crucial leads for further investigation.

In truth, if he were the sole Internal Traitor, that would have been the true anomaly. The esteemed Forgetful River Prefecture Lord would never commit such an act.

Underworld.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord standing upon the sacrificial altar suddenly felt a wave of relief wash over him.

The pressure of reciting the sacrificial text diminished, and the altar responded by emitting a bloody glow.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord realized with clarity: "A mass blood sacrifice has been recorded! It seems the Living Realm's assault on White Paper Immortal City is beginning to bear fruit."

At that moment, a mournful melody suddenly emerged.

It began as a soft, lingering tune, then quickly enveloped the surroundings. Within moments, it became the dominant theme on the altar, even causing the swirling yin wind to slow its pace.

The five Nascent Soul cultivators guarding the yin wind roared in fury. Tens of thousands of Imperial Guards sprang into action, activating the grand array.

But the great array spun empty, unable to harm the killer in the slightest.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord sighed softly. "This is empty sorrow, not something you can prevent. Brother Bone, the one you wish to kill is me. Why trouble others? Come, let us fight."

As he spoke, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord activated the great array, lifting a portion of the yin wind to create an opening.

The sorrowful sound coalesced into a beam, piercing through the opening to materialize before the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord as a Bone Cultivator.

It was none other than the Lady of Sorrowful Bones.

Her body was shrouded in gray-white sorrowful mist, her bone form sculpted like white jade, slender and ethereal. The luminous white bone glowed with a warm, iridescent hue, reminiscent of glass or jade marrow. Twelve pairs of ribs formed a protective cage around her chest, guarding the azure Soulfire within. Her spine extended into a long bone tail, with seven jade spikes gently touching the void.

Her entire body was covered in Thousand Sorrows, Ten Thousand Sighs Bone Armor - a garment woven from countless hair-thin sighing bone threads, forming an intricate lace-like structure that clung to her form like a cicada's wing, accentuating her striking silhouette.

Her head was exquisitely beautiful, with blue-tear-shaped bone patterns etched from her cheeks to jawline. The Soulfire in her eye sockets burned icy blue, radiating profound sorrow.

She gazed at the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. "A'Chuan, I became a female cultivator for you, hoping we might be twin birds of paradise. Even now, will you still not change your heart?"

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord sighed deeply, helplessly. "Brother Bone, we were sworn brothers. Must it come to this?"

"You knew my intentions from the start," the Lady of Sorrowful Bones said. "You approached me merely to exploit my courage and innate talent. When it came time to fulfill your promises, you tried to dismiss me with a brotherhood pact."

"I am not your brother. I should be your wife!"

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord looked skyward. "There can be only one wife in my heart."

The Lady of Sorrowful Bones laughed coldly. "Naturally, I knew. That's why I devised a scheme to lure your wife from White Tail Marsh. I wanted her to witness your true heart and character."

"You!" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's face paled, fury rising as he pointed at her.

The Lady of Sorrowful Bones threw her head back and laughed uproariously. "Heh heh heh, ha ha ha! Since I can't have my beloved, neither shall you! A'Chuan, I'll make you feel this anguish!"

Channeling his anger, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord formed a murky water spear that pierced through the void to halt before the Lady of Sorrowful Bones. The spear reeked of stagnant water, carrying a yin wind that howled through its depths.

The Lady of Sorrowful Bones didn't flinch. She raised her slender right hand.

Clang!

The water spear struck her palm with a metallic resonance. The space before her hand folded, revealing countless skeletal wisps that interwove into a shimmering net. The pattern of bones dissolved and reformed endlessly, neutralizing the spear's soul-corroding power, its crushing weight, and its resonance with the Dao of decay.

The water spear dissipated as its power waned, yet the phantom bone lines persisted, emitting waves of mournful resonance.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's eyes, deep as oceanic abysses, narrowed slightly as he recognized: Thousand Sorrows, Ten Thousand Sighs Bone Armor.

Having once shared a close bond with the Lady of Sorrowful Bones, he was intimately familiar with her hidden capabilities.

He shifted his finger seals and murmured: "Heartless Crossing."

As the icy words hung in the air, Profound Netherwater surged forth, merging with Yin Qi spiritual energy to form a vast black tide that spread silently across the battlefield.

The Lady of Sorrowful Bones found herself completely surrounded, unable to retreat.

Under the black tide's influence, her emotions began to fade rapidly. While the loss of other emotions might have been inconsequential, the critical sorrow that formed the core of her combat power was now threatened.

"A'Chuan, you truly do know me," the Lady of Sorrowful Bones said with a bitter smile.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's expression remained impassive as he silently channeled more black tide, tightening his encirclement.

When the black tide reached her, it was completely blocked by the Thousand Sorrows, Ten Thousand Sighs Bone Armor, rendering the attack ineffective.

Yet the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord persisted, knowing that this spell would gradually deplete the bone armor's power without any loss to himself.

Heartrending Lament Flute!

The Lady of Sorrowful Bones understood the gravity of the situation. She produced a bone flute and placed it against her bony lips.

Woo...woo...woo...

A shrill whistle pierced the air, not the melodious trill of a flute, but a wail like a motherless child, a lamenting woman's bloodcurdling cry, the mournful howl of a fallen nation!

Spell - Sorrowful Song Against the Tide!

In an instant, the Lady of Sorrowful Bones' anguish intensified, her combat prowess skyrocketing beyond her pre-battle peak.

Under the whistle's command, the black tide reversed its flow, now harnessed by the Lady of Sorrowful Bones to surge toward the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's face paled as his robes billowed wildly. Spiritual energy drained rapidly from his body as he desperately tried to regain control of the inverted black tide.

Just as he moved to counter, the Lady of Sorrowful Bones' detached pinky finger shot toward her opponent.

Ghost Technique - Sorrowful Bone Pierces the Heart!

The bone fragment moved with such speed it seemed to ignore spatial constraints, striking the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's chest with pinpoint accuracy.

Thud!

A soft sound echoed as the bone fragment pierced through the Prefecture Lord's robes, flesh, and soul, exiting through his back.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord stood frozen, his life force collapsing like an avalanche of snow.

"A'Chuan!" The Lady of Sorrowful Bones' expression shifted dramatically upon realizing her attack had succeeded. Fear gripped her - she had nearly killed the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord by accident.

Suddenly, the Prefecture Lord thrust his palm forward, bellowing a frosty command.

Countless needles erupted from his hand in an instant.

Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul-Devouring Needles!

Each needle carried bone-chilling cold and soul-corroding resentment, swarming toward the Lady of Sorrowful Bones like a vengeful swarm of bees.

Lady of Sorrowful Bones' face twisted with terror as she realized her most prized defense - the Thousand Sorrows, Ten Thousand Sighs Bone Armor - was being severely countered by these hair-thin needles. The bone armor's regenerative ability had been suppressed to near nothingness.

Ten Thousand Bones' Lamenting Escape!

Seeing her situation turn dire, the Lady of Sorrowful Bones retreated in a panic, breaking through the sacrificial altar's whirlwind in a desperate escape.

Before departing, she spat out venomously, "A'Chuan, you're quite clever. You've actually used my concern for you to create an opening through my own panic."

"Heh."

"The wounds you've inflicted on me, I'll keep them, carefully nurturing this sorrow."

"Next time, I'll make you truly understand my power!"

Standing at the edge of the sacrificial altar, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord coughed violently, blood spraying from his mouth with each cough.

Yet his posture remained ramrod straight.

Wiping the blood from the corner of his lips, he cast his icy, authoritative gaze in another direction.

There, a yellow-robed mute monk was walking through the air.

It was none other than the Soundless Ghost Monk!

The Lady of Sorrowful Bones had just retreated when the Soundless Ghost Monk appeared... Clearly, they had already reached some sort of agreement for joint combat.

"I'm afraid there are others hiding behind them," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord sensed a tremendous pressure.

However, at that moment, the sacrificial altar's radiance suddenly intensified.

"Oh?"

"It seems there's been a breakthrough on the battlefield in the Living Realm!"

The Living Realm.

White Paper Immortal City.

With a massive roar, the southern city gate was pushed open, leaving the entrance completely exposed!

The figure who pushed open the door was none other than the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.
