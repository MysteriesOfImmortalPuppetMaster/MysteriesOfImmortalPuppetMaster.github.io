Chapter 836: My Luo Shu

Blue Stone Cave Abode, cultivation chamber.

Formation patterns flowed across the four walls, isolating this cultivation chamber from the outside world. Only a single blue lamp was lit within the room; its flickering flame illuminated Ning Zhuo’s quiet, composed face.

He sat cross-legged on a prayer mat, a single thin sheet of paper floating before him.

The Luo Shu page.

It was neither gold nor jade, neither silk nor stone. It was as thin as a cicada's wing, yet it seemed to carry a weight comparable to a mountain.

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath.

Refining a Dao Artifact was no easy task.

It had to be known that Ning Zhuo was merely a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage.

Ning Zhuo began to regulate his breath.

In his Middle Dantian, a five-colored vortex spun slowly; Five Elements spiritual energy stood like a tornadic pillar, propping up the heavens and pressing down on the earth. In his Upper Dantian, countless mirror surfaces floated silently, with divine intent flowing ceaselessly within them. In his Lower Dantian, the blood pool churned, with blood veins intertwining and winding like vines.

The Three Dantians operated simultaneously.

Ning Zhuo slowly extended his right hand.

His five fingers were white as jade, gleaming with a faint luster under the lamplight.

He inhaled deeply and gently pressed his palm against the Luo Shu page.

Spirit Refinement!

In an instant, the youth's entire divine sea trembled violently.

Countless dots, divided into black and white, surged into his consciousness like a tidal wave. Each dot contained a massive amount of information - the numbers of the heaven and earth’s operation, the laws of the sun and moon’s rotation, the changes in stellar trajectories, and the principles of the birth and death of all things.

The information was too vast, too profound; it was simply not something a Foundation Establishment cultivator could withstand. The mirror surfaces of Ning Zhuo’s divine intent shattered one by one, his thoughts were consumed at a maddening rate, and his entire divine sea felt as if it were about to burst.

He couldn't help but let out a muffled groan as a trickle of fresh blood seeped from the corner of his mouth.

Ning Zhuo did not let go.

Magic Refinement!

He drove his Five Elements spiritual energy to its limit, transforming it into a five-colored hand that flew out of his body and tightly gripped the Luo Shu page. The Five Elements generated one another in an endless cycle, penetrating the page layer by layer.

Blood Refinement!

At the same time, the blood pool in his Lower Dantian surged, transforming into a stream of blood qi. The blood qi spread, condensing into countless tiny blood veins that covered the surface of the Luo Shu page. Each blood vein squirmed like a living creature, initiating an corruption of the page.

Spirit Refinement, Magic Refinement, Blood Refinement.

Ordinary cultivators usually employed one method of refinement, but since Ning Zhuo cultivated the Upper, Middle, and Lower Dantians simultaneously, he could execute three types of refinement at once.

Three Dantians, three forces, refining the Dao Artifact simultaneously.

But even so, Ning Zhuo felt the strain.

The power of the Dao Artifact was too strong.

His face grew paler and paler, beads of fine sweat seeped from his forehead, and his fingers began to tremble slightly. The Luo Shu page vibrated violently in his palm, as if it would break free at any moment.

"Little Zhuo, I'll help you!"

It was Sun Lingtong.

Formally refining a Dao Artifact was a major event fraught with difficulties. Naturally, Sun Lingtong had come personally to assist.

Round after round of stealing techniques were unleashed by Sun Lingtong, covering the Luo Shu.

Ning Zhuo immediately felt the pressure lessen significantly.

The refinement was able to continue.

Sun Lingtong’s face quickly turned pale, and a nosebleed flowed silently. He gritted his teeth, not making a sound, and continued to cast his techniques.

Ning Zhuo’s eyes were wide open, his eyeballs filled with bloodshot veins.

The Three Dantians operated at full capacity. Five Elements spiritual energy, Mirror Platform divine consciousness, and Demonic Contamination essence blood - the three forces poured madly into the Luo Shu page regardless of the cost.

The page trembled violently. Black and white dots constantly emerged, impacting Ning Zhuo’s divine sea. Jade light flowed across the page, resisting the spiritual energy and demonic blood.

The duo of Sun and Ning had given their all right from the start, yet they had only refined thirty percent, and both were already reaching their limits.

"What do we do?" Ning Zhuo frowned deeply.

This was his first time obtaining a Dao Artifact, and his first time attempting to refine one.

Although he was well-read, books did not contain instructions on how a Foundation Establishment cultivator should refine a Dao Artifact.

"Could it be that after all the hardships to obtain the Luo Shu page, we actually have no way to truly make it our own?" Sun Lingtong’s confidence was also shaking violently.

Magic Artifacts, Magic Treasures, Spirit Treasures, Dao Artifacts.

Dao Artifacts were a tier above Spirit Treasures; their level was indeed incredibly high. For Ning Zhuo, with his mere Foundation Establishment cultivation, refining it was naturally extremely difficult.

Just as they were about to fail, a voice suddenly echoed in the depths of Ning Zhuo’s heart: "Foolish child, the Luo Shu is the source of mathematics and logic. How can you refine it by force? If this were not originally your mother’s possession, and if it did not sense the bloodline connection between you and me, you wouldn't have been able to refine even half a percent."

Ning Zhuo was shaken to his core, overjoyed: "Mother, you’ve woken up?!"

But that voice dissipated like an illusion, as if it had never appeared.

Having received the hint, Ning Zhuo’s eyes burst with a sharp gleam.

He understood!

"The Luo Shu is the source of mathematics and logic. I must understand it to refine it."

He calmed his mind and first probed the massive quantity of black and white dots in the divine sea of his Upper Dantian.

Observing carefully, he immediately discovered that the flow of these black and white dots faintly resembled the trajectory of the Five Elements generating one another. Metal generates Water, Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal - every generation caused a reorganization of the dots; every clash caused a separation of the dots.

The Principle of the Five Elements!

Metal is White; the dots condensed like stars, representing "Four and Nine" in the numerology of heaven and earth.

Water is Black; the dots flowed like rivers, representing "One and Six" in the numerology of heaven and earth.

Wood is Green; the dots sprouted like grass and trees, representing "Three and Eight" in the numerology of heaven and earth.

Fire is Red; the dots rose like raging flames, representing "Two and Seven" in the numerology of heaven and earth.

Earth is Yellow; the dots were heavy as mountains, representing "Five and Ten" in the numerology of heaven and earth.

The Five Elements circulated, and the numbers generated one another. Every dot in the Luo Shu corresponded to a Five Elements attribute; every change followed the laws of the Five Elements' generation and inhibition.

Through this understanding, the massive number of dots transformed from black and white into the five colors of the Five Elements: Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.

These five-colored dots were all influenced by Ning Zhuo.

With a sudden flash of insight, Ning Zhuo immediately mobilized these dots, causing them to merge into his Five Elements spiritual energy one after another, finally converging into the five-colored hand.

Bolstered by this powerful aid, the five-colored hand immediately underwent a qualitative change. It brazenly broke through the bottleneck and continued the process of refining the Luo Shu with astonishing efficiency - at least ten times faster than before!

The Five Elements realm, the Ice realm, his Renowned Artisan-level artifact refining realm, his Master-level array formation realm, his Master-level mechanism technique realm...

These realms of expertise helped Ning Zhuo understand the principles of the Luo Shu, turning the abstract into the concrete, and transforming concise summaries into detailed, rich examples.

Spirit Refinement, Magic Refinement, Blood Refinement - the three refinement methods underwent qualitative changes in succession.

One stick of incense worth of time later.

The trembling of the Luo Shu page ceased, becoming completely calm.

In Ning Zhuo’s divine sea, the surviving black and white dots no longer flowed madly. Instead, they silently condensed, outlining the form of the page.

A profound and mysterious connection was established between Ning Zhuo and the Luo Shu.

It was not a master-servant connection, but a connection of "resonance" - he understood the Luo Shu, and the Luo Shu accepted him. From this day forth, he could unleash the full power of the Luo Shu and master a computational power far exceeding his own limits!

"It’s done! Hahaha." Sun Lingtong placed his hands on his hips and threw his head back to laugh. However, the movement was too vigorous; his vision went black, and he nearly toppled over backward.

Throughout the entire refinement process, he had exhausted himself, utilizing various stealing techniques to provide immense help to Ning Zhuo.

"Yes, it is done," Ning Zhuo murmured.

The page remained as white as jade, but in the depths of his heart, it was completely different. Those black and white dots were no longer chaotic but orderly; those flowing trajectories were no longer hazy and variable but clearly visible.

This was now his Luo Shu.

-----

The time had come. Zhao Hansheng ascended the high platform once again.

Dressed in green robes, his face thin and eccentric, he was surrounded by a faint, intangible Literary Qi.

His gaze swept over the dark mass of people below the stage, and Zhao Hansheng nodded slightly.

His gaze paused imperceptibly on Ning Zhuo for a moment.

Everyone was looking forward with anticipation, knowing that today was Zhao Hansheng’s final public lecture on Mind Study.

Zhao Hansheng began to speak. His voice was not loud, yet it traveled clearly into everyone's ears.

The crowd below listened with rapt attention.

Ning Zhuo was no exception. His eyes narrowed slightly, and his divine consciousness operated at full capacity, firmly memorizing every single word Zhao Hansheng said.

Traditional Confucian cultivators emphasized "Extending Knowledge through the Investigation of Things," seeking principles outwardly; Mind Study, however, advocated that "The Mind is Principle," seeking answers inwardly.

After several consecutive lectures, this point no longer shocked the cultivators; it only immersed them further into Mind Study.

Some looked thoughtful, some frowned in deep contemplation, and some nodded frequently.

After two hours, the lecture drew to a close.

It was time for the open question-and-answer session.

Ning Zhuo took the initiative to ask a question, and the Confucian cultivator on duty, seeing him stand up, immediately granted permission.

Everyone's gazes focused on him, their expressions turning somewhat subtle.

Ning Zhuo’s reputation had soared recently, largely by stepping over Gu Qing. And since Gu Qing was Zhao Hansheng’s prized student, the tension between Ning Zhuo and the teacher-student pair was well known to all.

Therefore, the moment Ning Zhuo stood up, he attracted the attention of the entire venue. Everyone looked forward to Ning Zhuo’s question, and even more so to Zhao Hansheng’s response.

Zhao Hansheng’s gaze fell upon Ning Zhuo, his expression calm. "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, what doubts do you have?"

Ning Zhuo cupped his fists in salute, looked straight into Zhao Hansheng’s eyes, and spoke slowly: "This junior is bold enough to ask Sir - how exactly does one cultivate the Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action?"

Countless gazes darted back and forth between Ning Zhuo and Zhao Hansheng.

Some were excited, some curious, some gloating, and some watched coldly from the sidelines.

Zhao Hansheng fell silent for a moment.

He knew very well that if he did not give a correct response, it would inevitably weaken his own reputation, and even his credibility.

And this reputation and credibility were things he had accumulated through painstaking effort and numerous public lectures over these past days.

The Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action requires a Confucian foundation; telling him wouldn't matter, Zhao Hansheng pondered. He knew Ning Zhuo was not a pure Confucian cultivator.

The Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action came from Mind Study and was a newly created technique, existing only in a Confucian version. Unlike techniques such as "Head Hanging from a Beam" or "Thigh Pricked with an Awl" - which had ancient versions suitable for almost all cultivators - this had a Confucian version intended only for Confucian scholars to execute.

But Zhao Hansheng still harbored doubts in his heart.

This was not the first time Ning Zhuo had asked for instruction on the Unity of Knowledge and Action. But last time...

Zhao Hansheng remembered it vividly - his jade pendant had vibrated, warning him!

What if I proclaim the Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action?

The thought arose in Zhao Hansheng’s mind.

And in that instant, the jade pendant hanging at his waist vibrated once again!

Zhao Hansheng’s pupils constricted slightly.

Of course, his expression remained as calm as water, revealing no emotion.

After a moment of silence, Zhao Hansheng spoke slowly, his voice remaining composed: "The Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action... this technique is a secret transmission of Mind Study, not something that can be explained in a few words. Although this old man knows a thing or two, I dare not claim mastery. If Little Friend is interested, you might as well start with the Instructions for Practical Living. After reading it through, we can discuss it further."

"Sir," Ning Zhuo said again, "This junior has already read the Instructions for Practical Living thoroughly. However, it only speaks of the principle, not the method. This junior is dull-witted and does not know how to transform the principle into a method. I implore Sir for guidance."

Ning Zhuo naturally wasn't willing to let this opportunity slip by easily and pressed on relentlessly.

Zhao Hansheng took a light breath, shifting his gaze into the distance to look at the faraway peaks before bringing it back to rest on Ning Zhuo. He said gently, "Little Friend is naturally intelligent; why be obsessed with a single method? When the principle is understood, the method becomes clear naturally. Little Friend might as well read it a few more times and contemplate it carefully; perhaps you will gain your own insights."

Then, without waiting for Ning Zhuo to press further, he waved his sleeve slightly: "Next."

The crowd below couldn't help but whisper among themselves.

Zhao Hansheng’s clearly perfunctory answer caused their impression of him to plummet.

Despite Zhao Hansheng acting as a role model and putting on an air of a selfless expert, when it came to a personal grudge, he would still be petty!

Zhao Hansheng sighed inwardly, having long anticipated the crowd's reaction. It could be said that Ning Zhuo’s question had dissolved at least thirty percent of the results he had achieved over these past days.

But the jade pendant had warned him again; Zhao Hansheng knew he had to take it seriously!

Although he didn't know the underlying reason why teaching Ning Zhuo would trigger a warning, between two evils, he chose the lesser one. Zhao Hansheng did not hesitate to brush off Ning Zhuo’s question once more.

"Sigh!!!" Ning Zhuo sighed deeply in his heart and could only sit back down.

Although he knew hope was slim this time, actually having it fall through still left him feeling somewhat disappointed.

The Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action was very useful to him.

Even the Confucian cultivator version had immense reference value. In the future, it might be possible to modify the technique and complete a version he could use.

Of course, Ning Zhuo’s current foundation was too weak.

"But as long as I absorb some high-grade Confucian demonic souls, these problems can be fundamentally solved."

Thinking of Confucian demonic souls, Ning Zhuo thought of Qin De.

The Confucian cultivators were also discussing Qin De.

"The Saint's Great Thief Sutra uses the name of a Saint to commit the acts of a great thief. He read through all the Confucian classics, yet extracted such an evil book from them." Duanmu Zhang let out a deep sigh.

Situ Gu said, "Qin De’s Saint's Great Thief Sutra has a core argument that 'The Saint is the greatest thief.' He found countless examples in the classics to prove that the sages of past generations were all 'stealing' heavenly principles, the hearts of the people, and destiny. This set of twisted logic and fallacies is indeed very difficult to refute using our traditional Confucian theoretical knowledge."

"However, Mind Study emphasizes seeking inward, extending one's conscience. This is completely opposite to Qin De’s 'stealing from the outside.' I believe that if we can invite Zhao Hansheng to debate Qin De, he will be able to crush him head-on theoretically!"

Song Taosheng added, "And once he is defeated, the obstacles shackling the development of our Confucian cultivator group will be swept away."

Although Zhao Hansheng publicly refusing Ning Zhuo’s request for instruction had damaged his reputation greatly, in the eyes of Duanmu Zhang, Situ Gu, and the converted Song Taosheng, these were minor details.

The development of the Confucian cultivator group within the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s main gate was the major issue!

Discussions like this had actually been going on for several rounds already.

Today was Zhao Hansheng’s final public lecture, and also the moment for the Confucian cultivators to make their decision.

Go find Zhao Hansheng!
