Chapter 652: The Dao Path

Sun Lingtong asked bitterly, "Is there truly no way for me to obtain the Divination Art?"

Zeng Jide gave him a deep look. "Under normal circumstances, you could have someone else perform a divination. Just like how the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord enlisted the Ash Bone Elder's help this time."

"But if you were to obtain the Divination Art, it would mean..."

Sun Lingtong: "Mean what?"

"It would mean that you occupy a crucial role in the Heavenly Script. Heaven has entrusted you with a great mission. The cosmos itself deems you insufficiently strong, willing to risk future consequences of creating an uncontrollable powerhouse just to strengthen you enough to fulfill a specific destiny!"

Sun Lingtong felt a chill in his heart, momentarily speechless.

After a long pause, he frowned and said, "Even if obtaining the Divination Art isn't part of my destined path, I still want to try every possible means to acquire it, to strive with all my might!"

"I desperately want to steal others' Qi Luck! It must be an incredible feeling!"

Zeng Jide laughed heartily again, patting Sun Lingtong on the shoulder. "Little Ghost, you have great ambition!"

"If that's what you truly wish to do, then go ahead and do it."

"Perhaps this is your Dao Path. Heaven requires the Theft Path Methods to renew and evolve the Qi Luck, and it has entrusted this solemn responsibility to you."

Sun Lingtong's heart stirred, and he latched onto a key phrase: "Dao Path?"

Zeng Jide stroked his beard. "This involves the Soul Formation level and the cultivation beyond it."

"Soul Transformation comes after the Nascent Soul stage. As the Nascent Soul matures into the Primordial Spirit, one must naturally choose a direction for cultivation."

"Take the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, for example. He is at the Soul Formation level. His True Form cultivates the Water Element, while his Divided Spirit cultivates the Earth Element. The Water Element and Earth Element represent two distinct Dao Paths."

"You can think of the Dao Path, for now, as the direction of your cultivation. Of course, this simplifies things for your understanding, but it's not entirely comprehensive."

Sun Lingtong recalled the Dao Path conflict between the Ash Bone Elder and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, and his heart stirred. "Could it be that the Dao Path isn't just about what we cultivate, but also about our life philosophies? Some accept their fate as heaven's will, while others seek to defy heaven and change their destiny?"

Zeng Jide let out a surprised sound. "To grasp this layer of understanding is unexpected."

He laughed heartily. "Even geniuses like you and me shouldn't be measured by ordinary standards."

"Sword cultivators often prefer to break rather than yield, while martial artists tend to advance through courage and perseverance. Those on the Demonic Path can be either deeply passionate or ruthlessly cold. The Daoist School includes those who follow the path of effortless transformation and self-cultivation, as well as those who advocate for grand unification, simplification of rites to adapt to common practices, and lenient punishment and streamlined governance. The Buddhist Sect is divided between the Mahayana and Hinayana traditions, focusing on either guiding others or self-cultivation."

"Although the Confucian school is relatively young, it has many branches. These include those who advocate for moral governance and benevolent rule, those who prioritize the people over the ruler, and those who debate whether human nature is inherently good or evil."

"All of these are valid Dao Paths."

Sun Lingtong listened as if hearing celestial music! Such profound and insightful words were far beyond his usual experience.

If his master hadn't passed away, perhaps he could have received such guidance from him.

Every word of this guidance was worth its weight in gold!

Sun Lingtong pondered deeply, completely forgetting that he was in Forgetful River Immortal City, currently committing theft. He asked himself, "Senior, how should I determine my Dao Path?"

Zeng Jide offered direct guidance without reservation. "First, consider your innate talent for cultivation."

"If you possess innate talent, it's a sign of Heaven's expectations for you. Starting from your innate talent will inevitably lead to greater success than other paths."

"Second, consider your cultivation resources. Do you understand the four aspects of Technique, Land, Companion, and Resources?"

Sun Lingtong nodded.

Method refers to cultivation arts, spells, and such. Land refers to Blessed Grotto-Heavens, the places where cultivation takes place. Companion refers to Dao Companions, those who share the same aspirations. Wealth refers to Spirit Stones and other such resources.

Seeing that Sun Lingtong understood, Zeng Jide skipped the second point and continued, "Finally, there's one's personal temperament and aspirations."

"The path you want to walk and the path you don't want to walk feel different. Those who act in accordance with their nature often find their thoughts flow smoothly. At the very least, they won't suffer excessive internal conflict or even Heart Demons during cultivation."

Sun Lingtong finally understood. "So, Senior was encouraging me to persistently seek the Divination Art because it aligns with my aspirations?"

Zeng Jide replied, "I'm your senior Fellow Sect Member, and an expert in the Theft Path Methods. Naturally, I'm also skilled at reading people's expressions."

"When you mentioned stealing others' Qi Luck earlier, your eyes lit up. That told me this is what your heart truly desires."

"This is crucial for you. Treasure it and don't give up easily!"

"Take the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, for example. He's been scheming for a century to advance his Dao Path, fully aware of the obstacles he'd face, yet remained unwavering."

"That's the power of holding fast to your aspirations, walking steadfastly toward the direction you truly want to go."

Sun Lingtong was immediately captivated. "From what you're saying, Senior, it seems you have a deep understanding of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's current objectives?"

Zeng Jide replied, "To steal the River of Oblivion Vortex Eye, I naturally had to prepare thoroughly beforehand. The cost of gathering intelligence alone exceeded half the value of the treasury before you."

"Thus, I have a thorough understanding of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's movements and circumstances."

"He possesses the Innate Talent 'Drowning in Obliteration,' allowing him to immerse himself in the waters of the Forgetful River, reading various memories and experiencing endless emotions."

"However, this talent is merely high-grade, not Immortal Talent. Therefore, it comes with a fatal flaw: oblivion."

"Once he becomes immersed in these memories and emotions and forgets to return in time, he risks being drowned in the River of Oblivion, perishing from excess."

"That's why he has schemed relentlessly for a century, devising countless plans to obtain an Innate Talent from the Heavenly Ghost's skull to compensate for his own deficiency."

"Innate Talent, Innate Talent - these are gifts bestowed by the heavens."

"But any Innate Talent artificially enhanced through human means is almost always a defiance of heaven's will. That's why the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord faces such immense difficulties. He had to accumulate resources and painstakingly prepare for a century before gaining the strength for this decisive move."

Sun Lingtong felt his throat go dry, his heart pounding.

For a moment, Sun Lingtong considered seizing the opportunity to directly reveal his purpose to Zeng Jide - to cause chaos in the Forgetful River Immortal City and coordinate with his comrades to stop the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

But Sun Lingtong ultimately restrained himself.

Through his recent exchange with Zeng Jide, he had realized that despite his bold demeanor, the man was extremely cautious. He had meticulously chosen the timing and conducted thorough reconnaissance. By using Buddhist cultivation methods to enhance his theft techniques, Zeng Jide was taking risks, but it promised a substantial increase in both his cultivation and resources - a highly profitable venture!

Zeng Jide's sole purpose was to advance his own cultivation.

Asking him to help stop the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord would be obstructing the Prefecture Lord's Dao Path - a completely different matter.

Even if Zeng Jide stole items like River of Oblivion Vortex Eyes, it would merely be plucking a few teeth from a tiger's mouth. With so many teeth, losing a couple wouldn't harm the beast.

But if Zeng Jide assisted Sun Lingtong, it would incur the Prefecture Lord's deadly enmity. This was far more severe than plucking teeth - it would be like trying to kill the tiger outright!

Would Zeng Jide help?

Sun Lingtong believed the chances were exceedingly slim.

Would you risk your life to help someone you've just met, angering a Prefecture Lord? A whole cultivation nation in the Underworld?

Zeng Jide had advised Sun Lingtong out of respect for his junior fellow sect member, whom he admired. To actually ask for his help would have offended this senior member of the Thief Sect, ruined this opportunity, and shown a complete lack of tact and propriety.

"Let nature take its course, let nature take its course," Sun Lingtong repeated to himself, remembering Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's counsel. In the end, he didn't mention his request even a little bit.

After Zeng Jide retrieved the three precious materials from the secret chamber, his expression suddenly changed.

"Watch out!" In the next instant, he unleashed his Lifebound Treasure, disregarding the risk of exposure.

It was a monkey-faced Buddha statue, its golden monkey features making exaggerated expressions beneath a pitch-black kasaya.

A furry monkey hand emerged from the opening in the kasaya's chest, but clearly, the monkey's actual hands extended from the kasaya's sides, converging at the Lower Dantian.

This was a three-handed Buddha monkey statue!

The moment it was released, the statue pierced through the roof and soared into the sky, transforming from lifeless to living, from tangible to ethereal. In an instant, it became a towering, several-zhang-tall Buddha monkey phantom.

The phantom brought its two hands together in prayer, while the third hand on its chest stretched upward with great force.

The hand grew longer and longer, its palm expanding until it resembled a dark cloud looming overhead, casting a vast shadow over the City Lord's Mansion.

Boom!

A deafening roar, like thunder, exploded.

What followed was a hurricane-like blast of qi that swept across the surroundings, triggering defensive formations in countless buildings.

A streak of black lightning shot back and was reabsorbed into Zeng Jide's dantian.

He spat out a mouthful of blood, then swept his hand to gather the blood, his face pale as he pulled Sun Lingtong along and fled.

Thieving Art - Shadow Escape!

The two transformed back into a Black Shadow and slipped through the threshold, swiftly moving through the door seams.

Soon after, countless patrolling cultivators swarmed the area.

"Over here!"

"I never thought the Painted Skin Rakshasa had accomplices!"

"The No. 3 warehouse is empty! All the precious materials are gone!"

"I know who it is! That immoral Zeng Jide!"

"He sent a letter of intent earlier, claiming he would steal the River of Oblivion Vortex Eye, and he actually succeeded!"

"Quick, chase them! They haven't gotten far!"

In an instant, a myriad of detection spells were cast, and defensive formations activated one after another. The City Lord's Mansion roared to life like a lion awakened from slumber, revealing the true might of a nation's capital!

Zeng Jide scanned the area with his divine sense, witnessing the array of spells and formations, his heart pounding with unease.

With the City Lord's Mansion fully mobilized, the difficulty of infiltration had increased by dozens of times, practically on a completely different level than before.

If Zeng Jide had been alone, he might have managed. But with Sun Lingtong in tow, things became complicated.

Refusing to abandon his junior fellow sect member, Zeng Jide carried Sun Lingtong and pushed the Shadow Evasion Technique to its limits. He simultaneously deployed over a dozen countermeasures against various detection spells and defensive formations.

Many of these formations acted like fortresses, restricting their movement and forcing them to evade rather than confront.

After a series of twists and turns, Zeng Jide spotted a weakness and slipped through.

They had entered a hidden layer within the Formation Space.

Zeng Jide, having lost his Black Shadow form, knelt half-bent over, gasping for breath. His clothes were soaked with sweat.

Completely exhausted, he was a far cry from the composed mentor he had been moments earlier.

Sun Lingtong also resumed his human form. After checking on Zeng Jide, who waved him off, he immediately sat down cross-legged, closed his eyes, and began regulating his breathing.

Sun Lingtong, however, was in good shape. Having been dragged along by Zeng Jide the entire way, he hadn't expended much physical or spiritual energy.

He carefully examined their surroundings. Behind them was a shimmering emerald membrane, occasionally crossed by hurried figures. Before them lay a dense fog.

From within the mist came intermittent sounds of fierce combat and the shrill cries of female cultivators.

Suddenly, voices echoed from behind:

"How come we can't find that Zeng Que De?!"

"Do you think he might have hidden here?"

"This is the Restraining Wave Formation that entrapped the Painted Skin Rakshasa. If those two were to join forces, we'd be in real danger."

"Right! Void Sect cultivators are experts at breaking formations and infiltrating. If Zeng Que De helps the Painted Skin Rakshasa escape, capturing that Demonic Cultivator again would be much harder!"

Sun Lingtong glanced back and saw a group of cultivators closing in beyond the emerald-green light membrane.

The green membrane rippled as the cultivators approached, their figures and features becoming increasingly distinct.

Sun Lingtong's hair stood on end, his heart pounding in his throat.

Zeng Jide sat with his eyes closed, recuperating, seemingly unable to focus on anything outside. The approaching cultivators were about to discover them.

What should he do?

Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth, just about to use a Theft Path Method to conceal himself, when he received a mental message from Zeng Jide through their shared divine sense: Don't panic, boy. Don't act recklessly!

If you rashly use those Theft Path Methods, you'll only draw attention to us!

Sun Lingtong immediately froze.

The group of cultivators swept past them. Even at this close range, a layer of green membrane remained between the two sides.

The cultivators filed into the mist one by one.

Soon, the sounds of fierce combat within the mist intensified. The Painted Skin Rakshasa giggled coyly: "Hee hee hee! So many gentlemen have come to 'take care' of me? Come on, then! Let me 'take care' of you properly!"

Screams erupted one after another.

Clearly, the incoming cultivators were suffering a crushing defeat.

One of them roared furiously, "You treacherous demoness! May you die a miserable death!"

The Painted Skin Rakshasa laughed. "Whether I die or not remains to be seen, but several of you have already met your end!"

Another cultivator, suppressing his anger, snarled, "Your triumph won't last! Struggle within the Restraining Wave Formation until your strength and spiritual energy are utterly drained. We'll capture you alive, tear out your tendons, and flay your skin to avenge our fallen comrades!"

The Painted Skin Rakshasa retorted, "You can't be certain. Your Prefecture Lord might already be dead outside. After all, I wasn't the only one confronting him. Even Lord Yin Jiuzhu alone would have been a formidable opponent for your Prefecture Lord. And then there's the Soundless Ghost Monk and the Lady of Sorrowful Bones to consider."

The cultivators retreated in disarray, their voices rising in defiance: "You vile demoness! Cease your treacherous lies! We'll settle this later!"

As they fled, they once again brushed past Sun Lingtong, remaining oblivious to the old man and young disciple of the Void Sect.

"Let nature take its course... Let nature take its course..." Sun Lingtong gazed at the swirling mist, his heart swelling with admiration. "That old brother's mother is truly something else!"

Then, he sent a telepathic message through his divine sense to Zeng Jide: "Senior, I've got a brilliant idea!"

"Let's release the Painted Skin Rakshasa. She'll draw all the attention while we make our escape!"
