Chapter 447: "The Old Monster in the Stone" Takes Action!

The military power converged onto him, causing the Blood Dragon Saber to burst forth a gigantic blade of light.

Guan Hong raised the Blood Dragon Saber in his hand.

Military Tactic —Single Saber Thrust!

The blade light was crimson like blood, incomparably sharp, severing the connection between the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect and the military power of the Camp of Three Generals.

The Triangular Arrow Formation suddenly accelerated, shaking off the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect overhead.

In an instant, everyone in Thousand Peaks Forest was astonished.

Ma Feitui was stunned inside the Dharmic Aspect.

He frantically attacked, trying to break through the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect to trouble the Red Flower Camp. He shouted loudly, urging Chen Lingfeng and others to attack the Camp of Three Generals to help him escape quickly.

But Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and others did not do so.

Although they all had divine decrees requiring them to go all out, even full-force combat requires attention to timing.

Obviously, letting Ma Feitui and the Camp of Three Generals wear each other down, and waiting until both sides were exhausted before Chen Lingfeng and Wu Hen made their move —wouldn't that be better?

Firstly, the combat power of the Camp of Three Generals would drop to rock bottom, making them easier to deal with and safer.

Secondly, Ma Feitui would also become weakened, making it more convenient for Chen Lingfeng and Wu Hen to seize battle merits.

As a result, the abrupt choice of the Camp of Three Generals truly exceeded everyone's expectations!

They actually shook off the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect, which was the key item for imprisoning the Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator.

Chen Lingfeng reacted the fastest; a chill rose in his heart, and he immediately flapped his wings, soaring into the sky.

But the Golden Core cultivators on the ground were a beat slower. Zhang Hei rushed over like a whirlwind, gently thrusting out the Black Serpent Spear in his hand.

Kill!

The Black Serpent Spear seemed slow but was actually fast, directly piercing through the Golden Core cultivator's heart, killing him on the spot.

That Golden Core cultivator wanted to dodge but was hindered by Ning Zhuo's spell.

Puff.

Military Tactic —Speed Is of the Essence!

While using the tactic, Liu Er shouted loudly, "Quick, quick, quick!"

Military Tactic —Speed Is of the Essence!

Guan Hong also used the same tactic. The two stacked together, causing the soldiers of the Camp of Three Generals to run like the wind.

After killing the enemy in one strike, Zhang Hei immediately returned.

As one of the sharp edges of the triangular formation, he could not stay away from the battle formation for long.

Military Tactic —Speed Is of the Essence.

He also knew this tactic, and upon using it, the soldiers of the Camp of Three Generals ran so fast that afterimages of their legs appeared.

While casting Five Elements spells, Ning Zhuo secretly envied, "If I also cultivated military tactics, it would be like adding wings to a tiger."

The advantage of the military battle formation was manifested in this aspect.

Everyone casting the same spell could stack together. Although perfect stacking was unlikely due to inherent losses, this effect of uniting many into one made qualitative changes possible.

Strictly speaking, the Five Elements spells that Ning Zhuo cast did not quite fit with the military battle formation.

Because he consumed his own mana, the army's mana pool, and the absorption of natural spiritual energy from the outside world.

The reason why the Five Elements spells' power surged was that Ning Zhuo was in the formation, able to have national power, military power, and battle formation empower himself.

If it were military tactics, the effect of military power's support would be much higher than now.

Moreover, military tactics can directly consume military power, greatly reducing the cultivator's own mana consumption.

With Ning Zhuo's actions, the Golden Core cultivators' speed greatly decreased and were easily pursued and killed one by one by the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang.

Chen Lingfeng only dared to circle in the high sky, constantly attacking from afar; Wu Hen even simply hid in some shadow, not daring to show himself.

Because they knew that they would next be facing a Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator!

Although they gained rich battle merits one after another, Liu, Guan, and Zhang still had grim expressions.

Neigh!

The Pegasus kicked hard with its hind hoof, finally breaking through the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect.

The three generals had already been prepared, commanding the battle formation, and charged forward.

Ma Feitui's eyes were blood-red, just about to kill to vent his anger. Seeing the Camp of Three Generals attacking, he neighed and directly charged over.

His body was huge like a small mountain; lowering his head, he charged, stirring up violent winds, causing the soldiers of the Camp of Three Generals to tremble with fear. Before they even engaged, their morale wavered, and military power dropped significantly.

After all, the Camp of Three Generals was newly formed, not battle-hardened elite soldiers!

In this critical moment, Ning Zhuo shouted sharply and cast Five Elements spells.

One could see golden blades flying, mist and smoke obscuring, vines entangling legs, fire snakes coiling around the body, and earthen bricks tripping feet; Five Elements spells came in waves.

Ning Zhuo was clever, not causing wounds but focusing on restraint.

By now in the battle, he had determined that without using the Great Serpent Sickle, the offensives of the three generals were far sharper than his.

Ma Feitui, subjected to continuous obstacles, even though he blocked the golden blade attacks, crushed earthen bricks, shook off the mist, broke free of vines, and let the fire snakes burn his body, his speed inevitably slowed down.

Liu Er grasped the Xuanhuang Sword with both hands, flew out first, and collided head-on with Ma Feitui.

Ma Feitui took a small step back; Liu Er's grip tore, spitting blood from his mouth, and he flew back into the battle formation.

Zhang Hei roared loudly, "Take my spear!"

Ma Feitui glared at him, performed a demonic spell, attacking offense with offense.

Zhang Hei's spear stabbed Ma Feitui but only left a mark; the horse's hide was tougher than imagined.

On the other hand, Zhang Hei was hit by the demonic spell; his entire chest caved in slightly, and the front of his armor completely shattered.

Ma Feitui was about to pursue, but Guan Hong had already swung his saber with full strength.

Military Tactic —Single Saber Thrust!

The bright red saber light was incomparably sharp, leaving a wound half a zhang (about 1.6 meters) long on Ma Feitui's back; blood spurted like a fountain.

Ma Feitui was wounded; startled, he quickly performed demonic spells to heal, but the blood wouldn't stop no matter what. He could only suppress it from a fountain to a stream.

Turns out, Guan Hong cultivated the demonic art Scarlet Face Blood Calamity Scripture; his mana carried mysterious power—once he caused a bleeding wound, without specific countermeasures, it was very difficult to completely stop the bleeding.

The anger in Ma Feitui's heart was now overtaken by astonishment.

He kept retreating, easily pulling away, and tried various methods repeatedly but still couldn't stop the bleeding.

Liu Er sighed deeply, watching the opportunity appear, but their side couldn't seize it.

"Although we have chosen the Triangular Arrow Formation, which is very fast, we are still at a disadvantage in speed."

After Guan Hong's all-out attack, his aura dropped significantly; he retreated back into the battle formation to urgently adjust his breath.

"It seems this is going to be a battle of attrition!"

Liu Er had also caught his breath, holding the Xuanhuang Sword, he went forward again to block the Pegasus's attack.

Ning Zhuo had been constantly making moves, using various Five Elements spells to restrain Ma Feitui as much as possible.

When he was forced back, Zhang Hei would step up.

The three generals had Liu Er mainly defending, Zhang Hei assisting, Guan Hong mainly attacking, with military advisor Ning Zhuo restraining; the more they fought, the more proficient they became, and their tacit understanding rapidly improved in the fierce battle.

Even though Ma Feitui was a Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator, he was wounded in many places and couldn't gain the upper hand in frontal combat.

The more he fought, the more surprised he became; he began to look at the Camp of Three Generals with new eyes: "These people are not simple! The three generals are all elites among Golden Core cultivators, and the cultivation methods they practice are all suitable for the battlefield. As for that Foundation Establishment mage, his Five Elements realm is extremely profound! Given time, when this group grows, they will certainly become very powerful."

Earlier, he attacked in anger, just bullying the Camp of Three Generals for being weak, wanting to kill to vent his anger.

Ma Feitui felt the desire to retreat.

He had joined the Thousand Peaks Forest side mainly to take revenge on the Red Flower Camp.

As a result, after frontal combat, they were about evenly matched, and it was hard for him to gain any advantage.

At this time, if only Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and others could cooperate, it would be good.

But earlier, after the Camp of Three Generals abandoned the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect, they immediately attacked the Golden Core cultivators like Chen and Wu, killing several of them, making them terrified and fleeing in panic, thus eliminating this hidden danger in advance.

Thinking of this, Ma Feitui directly turned around, flapped his wings, and flew up into the sky.

"Forget it, why should I fight to the death with the Camp of Three Generals?"

"My true enemy is the Red Flower Camp!"

"Don't run!" Zhang Hei became anxious, flew out of the battle formation, and wielded the Black Serpent Spear to pursue.

"Third Brother, don't chase!" Liu Er was shocked.

This is because he was still catching his breath; Guan Hong's recent strike had also caused military power to be in a low state.

Zhang Hei, going into battle this time, could receive little support from the battle formation and military power.

"Eh?!" Seeing this, Ma Feitui was suddenly pleasantly surprised.

He hadn't expected that just as he was about to retreat, the enemy army, which had been coordinating so well, would reveal such a huge flaw.

Ma Feitui suddenly turned around and spouted a blast of metallic qi from his mouth.

Qi Weapon —Cold Light Blazing Shadow Spear!

Martial Art —Turning Back Spear!

The metallic qi instantly condensed into a spear, shooting out like lightning.

Under the enhancement of the "Turning Back Spear" martial art, it was extremely fast and fierce.

Even Zhang Hei couldn't react in time, watching helplessly as the qi weapon spear shot over, brushing past him.

Cold sweat seeped from Zhang Hei's forehead, and he was horrified; he then heard Guan Hong exclaim, "Not good!"

"Liu Er shouted in alarm, but saw that Ma Feitui had shot off target.

Liu Er realized and hurriedly turned back, "Military advisor, be careful!!"

It turned out that Ma Feitui hadn't shot off target; he had aimed at Ning Zhuo, not Zhang Hei.

This person was too annoying, occupying too much of his energy and attention, making him uncomfortable and constrained in battle, extremely frustrated.

By comparison, the three Golden Core generals who fought head-on with hard attacks seemed much more tolerable.

Fast, fast, fast!

As fast as lightning.

The qi weapon had no physical form; Ma Feitui fired it with full power, and with the addition of the "Turning Back Spear," the qi weapon divine spear pierced through the battle formation and reached Ning Zhuo before the latter even reacted!

With a whoosh, the qi weapon directly pierced through the battle formation, killing more than a dozen cultivators along the way, and then stuck straight into the ground.

In the next moment, the qi weapon disintegrated, turning into a mass of icy light, carrying layers of blazing shadows, and flew back into the Pegasus's mouth.

"Military advisor!!!" Only then did Zhang Hei turn his head and saw in the dense battle formation a gap left after the qi weapon spear had pierced through.

For a moment, Zhang Hei was extremely angry, his killing intent soaring.

"Third Brother, calm down! The military advisor is not dead; before the attack reached him, his talisman was triggered, and he escaped." Liu Er hurriedly comforted.

Zhang Hei's anger paused; he looked back at the Pegasus again: "You plague horse, sinister and vicious, almost took my military advisor's life; give me your life!"

Zhang Hei charged over again.

Liu Er hurriedly commanded the soldiers to pursue all the way.

Fortunately, they had just caught their breath; the military power had recovered a lot, no longer as low as before, and could provide Zhang Hei with more support.

Ma Feitui, seeing that he hadn't killed Ning Zhuo, felt regret, and seeing Zhang Hei charging over, felt annoyed again.

"Without that annoying mage, I can exert my full strength!"

"You mere Golden Core cultivators are too arrogant!"

Ma Feitui changed his mind again, deciding to stay and continue fighting, to give the three generals a profound lesson.

Directional Void Escape Talisman!

Ning Zhuo suddenly appeared inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.

After the sudden teleportation, his body staggered, almost falling.

"So dangerous, so dangerous!"

Ning Zhuo looked down and saw that the Directional Void Escape Talisman in his arms had just burned out, turning to ashes.

This kind of Directional Void Escape Talisman was something he had obtained from Ning Jiufan in the Immortal City of Fire Persimmon.

Once encountering danger, the cultivator could actively activate it to lead the target object to escape through the void; it was a classic and common means of escape.

But just now, the qi weapon attack exceeded Ning Zhuo's reaction limit; under normal circumstances, he wouldn't have had time to use his divine sense to activate the Directional Void Escape Talisman.

"Fortunately, thanks to the mechanism ring."

Ning Zhuo's face was pale, filled with lingering fear.

It turned out that, thinking that the battlefield was fraught with dangers, he had proactively constructed defensive and escape measures before the battle.

He connected the mechanism ring, which had the ability of "Piercing Insight," with the Directional Void Escape Talisman, constructing a simple formation. Once the spiritual intelligence in the ring perceived that Ning Zhuo's life was in danger, it would trigger the Directional Void Escape Talisman.

It was this method that allowed Ning Zhuo to save his life.

"Too dangerous!"

"This is what going to the battlefield is like."

"One moment, our side was pursuing victory; the next moment we were caught by a strong enemy exploiting a flaw, almost causing my death."

"Little Zhuo, you're finally here!" Sun Lingtong sensed the movement and immediately came over.

Ning Zhuo wiped his broad forehead.

His forehead was covered with fine cold sweat.

He didn't know that Ning Zhuo had just been on the verge of life and death; at this moment, his face full of excitement: "Didn't expect to wait so long for you to come!"

"Hurry, what should we do?"

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong carried divine decrees, needing to take action against the armies of the two Note Nations to satisfy the requirements of the divine decrees in order to survive this ordeal.

Therefore, after the two of them discussed, they had Sun Lingtong take the mechanism Wandering Dragon away from the army, waiting for a good opportunity.

Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth: "Mulan is too unkind; shall we deal with them this time?"

Ning Zhuo immediately used his divine sense to inform Sun Lingtong of the latest battle situation.

Ning Zhuo shook his head: "What profit is there in the Red Flower Camp? Their bones are still hard!"

He already had a target: "Let's go directly to the White Jade Camp; that group of high-born scions is the richest."

Ning Zhuo was dissatisfied with Mulan but remained calm, not swayed by personal emotions.

He continued: "After participating in the battle for so long, I have confirmed from opponents like Chen Lingfeng that the clauses of the divine decrees are not very strict."

"This time, we can play the role of the 'Old Monster in the Stone,' rob the White Jade Camp's military equipment and weapons, and that should be enough to deal with the divine decrees."

Sun Lingtong was already impatient, rubbing his hands repeatedly: "I'll go bring out the stone sphere; Little Zhuo, quickly recover a bit, we need to depart as soon as possible! If we're any later, we might miss the opportunity!"

Ning Zhuo's condition wasn't bad.

He took some pills to help himself recover, and went to the dragon head cabin.

Sun Lingtong had already moved out the stone sphere, letting the mechanism Wandering Dragon hide inside.

Ning Zhuo opened his mouth and spat out the Earth Element Spleen Temple, making it merge with the stone sphere.

The three of them returned to their previous state; the "Old Monster in the Stone" reappeared.

The power of the divine decrees was instantly activated, like ropes tightening around the necks of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.

With the "Old Monster in the Stone" complete, the divine decrees finally manifested their true binding power!

"Quick, let's go mess with the White Jade Camp!" Sun Lingtong rubbed his fists.

The stone sphere sank into the ground and moved forward rapidly.

With a thought, Ning Zhuo performed the Earth Walking Technique, making the stone sphere's speed increase dramatically, and making it extremely stealthy.

White Jade Camp Battlefield.

Shuang Jing struggled to hold on, relying on military power to resist Lord Long. The deputy generals directed soldiers, sometimes assisting Shuang Jing, sometimes resisting attacks from external Golden Core cultivators.

The White Jade Camp suffered heavy casualties; the soldiers were subjected to internal and external attacks, suffering greatly.

If not for Mulan commanding the Red Flower Camp and arriving in time to help the White Jade Camp share much of the external pressure, the White Jade Camp would have already collapsed.

A stone sphere suddenly emerged from the ground, coming beside a mana pool.

"Wh-what is that?!" The White Jade Camp soldiers guarding the mana pool were stunned.

The mana pool was swallowed by the stone sphere and disappeared.

"Attack!" someone shouted; the people around awoke as if from a dream and began to take action.

But the main military power of the White Jade Camp was focused on dealing with Lord Long; these soldiers' attacks were like scratching an itch for the "Old Monster in the Stone."

The "Old Monster in the Stone" didn't linger in battle; the next moment, it directly burrowed into the ground and ran away!
