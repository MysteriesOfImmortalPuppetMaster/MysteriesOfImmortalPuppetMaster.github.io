Chapter 482: Couldn’t Hold It Anymore

The severe pain made the old demon cultivator bend over.

“Why?” The old man’s eyes bulged.

This was simply too coincidental!

Just as he was about to make his move, Ning Zhuo’s fortune suddenly surged, surpassing his by a small margin.

And the Minor Qi-Breaking Spell of a single thread (“one-thread qi-breaking spell”) depended on the level of fortune between the two sides.

Once Ning Zhuo became the stronger party, that Minor Qi-Breaking Spell of a single thread would take effect on the old demon cultivator instead.

By way of analogy, it was as if the old demon cultivator had raised a hammer to disperse Ning Zhuo’s fortune. But Ning Zhuo’s fortune suddenly became stronger, so the hammer he swung out flew back and hit him on the head.

“Fortunately, I hold an imperial court official position, which offers some protection in this respect. A mere little spell is not enough to shatter my fortune.”

But the backlash after casting the spell was very real.

The old demon cultivator, however, could not heal himself.

Because he was in the middle of performing the Great Curse of Stealing Fortune and Returning Life, he could only conduct this ritual of cursing and was unable to take any other action. Otherwise, even if he interrupted it himself, he would suffer a terrifying backlash and pay a heavy price.

Panting heavily, the old demon cultivator straightened his upper body and once again began brewing the curse.

“Ning Zhuo’s fortune shows no further changes!”

“That just now was probably a coincidence.”

“Next, watch me use the Two-Thread Qi-Breaking Spell!”

A moment earlier.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong looked toward the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.

The spiritual energy pool inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was spewing out massive amounts of spiritual energy, injecting it into the formation on the dragon’s body.

This formation was formed by linking countless talisman scripts.

And Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, who were making these talismans, were currently standing to one side, watching intently, both appearing a bit nervous.

They had expended vast amounts of precious materials at a high cost. If they wanted to do it again, at the very least they would have to go back and make purchases from Jin Li.

Thankfully, the formation continued to operate smoothly without any mishaps.

By the time the formation gradually weakened until it stopped completely, the dragon body of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon had been fully repaired.

At the places that were previously damaged, they were now replaced by layers of cloud clusters.

These cloud clusters were layered and densely packed, serving as the previous dragon scales and providing tight protection for the dragon’s body.

Upon closer inspection, one would notice that the cloud-scale clusters slowly rotated like clouds, and deep within those clusters, one could see faint threads of blue lightning.

This was because they had used the horn of a thunder dragon as the material, thus endowing it with a lightning attribute.

“This is way too extravagant,” Sun Lingtong exclaimed in amazement.

It was the first time he had seen someone throwing in materials in such a lavish manner.

“As expected of you, Little Zhuo.”

“Hee hee hee.”

“I still remember back in those days, when you had just started forging mechanical creations, I brought you nearly every mechanism on the market. You harshly criticized so many mechanical designs as crude, saying they didn’t save on resources at all.”

“How do you feel about that now?” Sun Lingtong teased.

Ning Zhuo sighed and gave a wry smile. “Boss, I’m still hurting inside right now. But luckily, the mechanism ring is no longer shrinking.”

“Based on previous experience, although this time we were extravagant with materials, it should prove to be the right choice, right?”

“Let’s move on to the next step.”

Obviously, the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon could not be perfected in one go.

Although its body surface was now covered with cloud cluster scales, acting as both outer and inner armor, there were still many weak spots left.

These weak points would not matter at all in ordinary circumstances.

But if it crossed through the void, that would be a disaster.

Even a Nascent Soul–level cultivator could only rely on the Nascent Soul to traverse the void. The physical body usually couldn’t make it.

The pressure of void travel was extremely enormous. Though the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon had once been a seamless whole, now that it was repaired, there would inevitably be weak links.

Those weak points were like the thinnest ring in a chain, often bearing the greatest force and most likely to snap. Once it snapped, it would trigger a chain reaction leading to the entire chain’s breakage.

Ning Zhuo needed to detect these weak areas and then reinforce them!

Once again, he faced a choice.

He picked out the precious materials he had on hand, which offered two possible solutions.

Both solutions would yield similar final results, except one was faster but consumed more materials, while the other was slower but used fewer.

“My time isn’t that tight. It doesn’t matter if it’s a little slower.”

Right when Ning Zhuo was thinking this, the mechanism ring on his finger started shrinking again, warning him!

“Huh?”

“So, I need to pick the faster reinforcement plan, huh?”

Ning Zhuo did not hesitate. He proceeded with the adjustments immediately.

Back to the present.

In the mountains and forests.

The old demon cultivator howled inwardly: “Two-thread Qi-Breaking Spell, break for me!”

But Ning Zhuo’s fortune suddenly soared again, this time just slightly stronger than that of the old demon cultivator himself.

Spurt!

The old demon cultivator spat out blood once more, dropping to one knee, clutching his chest, his face contorted in terrible agony from the severe pain.

Apart from the pain, there was also intense anger.

“Another round?!”

Stunned and irritated, the old demon cultivator was at a loss.

“This is too much of a coincidence.”

“No, after two consecutive coincidences, it’s no longer just coincidence.”

“Could it be that Ning Zhuo has already sensed I’m cursing him and is fighting back against me?”

“Or does he inherently have some special means of protecting his fortune?”

The old demon cultivator fell into hesitation.

He suddenly realized that choosing to use the Great Curse of Stealing Fortune and Returning Life might have been too reckless.

“I didn’t investigate thoroughly and cast the great curse rashly!”

“Now we’ve had two unexpected incidents in a row. This is highly unreasonable.”

“At that time, I really was too angry.”

The old demon cultivator felt regretful.

Of course, it wasn’t just due to his anger.

He had mainly considered that by stealing Ning Zhuo’s fortune and giving it back to the rightful path of the king’s fate, Liu Er’s fortune would blossom. Ultimately, Mu Lan would follow the changes in that fortune and become Liu Er’s wife.

“There’s something really big going on with Ning Zhuo!”

“Next comes the Three-Thread Qi-Breaking Spell. If this one fails again, the entire great curse will benefit Ning Zhuo in the end.”

The old demon cultivator felt as if a huge stone weighed upon his heart.

Once the great curse was cast, it could not be stopped midway.

The fortunes of Ning Zhuo and Liu Er would be inextricably linked by this great curse, similar to a life-and-death duel. The loser would lose everything, and the winner would finally take it all!

The old demon cultivator’s eyes bulged, cold sweat dripping from his forehead, as a terrifying guess took shape in his mind.

“Could it be that my act of observing fortune dragged me into it, causing me to act rashly in anger, and I’ll end up harming Liu Er, ultimately helping Ning Zhuo?!”

Fortune was not so easy to observe.

Take the old demon cultivator, for instance. Every time he observed it, he had to rely on precious treasures and pay a heavy price.

And once he observed, it also meant that Ning Zhuo’s fortune had sensed him. Every action the old demon cultivator took would meet with a counter from Ning Zhuo’s fortune.

“No, absolutely not!”

“I came to help Liu Er, not to add to his troubles.”

The old demon cultivator took a deep breath, a look of determination in his eyes.

The third minor spell was extremely crucial.

He could not allow another mistake!

Carrying a powerful resolve, the old demon cultivator continued taking out various precious materials from his storage belt in rapid succession - Nascent Soul–grade, even Soul Formation–grade!

He used these materials to begin setting up a new arrangement.

This was his posture when casting the great curse at full force!

Formations, talismans… all these were etched into the surrounding rocks, the trees, and they even floated in midair.

If Sun Lingtong ever saw this scene, he’d probably be drooling.

These materials were too precious and rare, and their market price was sky-high. For a Nascent Soul–level cultivator, embezzling just thirty percent would be enough to become wealthy beyond measure.

There was no doubt it was a staggering fortune!

“Huh?” The old demon cultivator’s fingers paused slightly, sensing that Ning Zhuo’s arm-fortune had risen another notch.

A cold chill crept into his heart. “Fortunately, I wasn’t in a hurry. I postponed the Three-Thread Qi-Breaking Spell. Otherwise, at this rate, I’d be repeating the same mistake again!”

As Liu Er’s mentor, the old demon cultivator was extremely cautious.

After two consecutive failures, he immediately adjusted his strategy.

This adjustment was quite effective, allowing him to avoid another disaster.

“It’s not over yet!”

“I’ve already seen through your ways. This time I’ll go all out and spend most of my family assets to succeed in one fell swoop!”

On the other side.

Ning Zhuo’s face was solemn as he sensed the mechanism ring steadily contracting, expanding, and contracting again, with a very consistent rhythm.

“Something’s off, Boss,” Ning Zhuo said to Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong stared at the mechanism ring on Ning Zhuo’s finger. “Little Zhuo, could it be your mechanism ring is malfunctioning? Is it really reliable?”

Ning Zhuo stretched out his other hand, using a finger to touch the surface of the mechanism ring, his gaze resolute, his tone firm. “I trust it.”

His eyes were sharp and cold. He pondered out loud, “Earlier, I resolved its warnings twice, both times using precious materials to repair the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.”

“The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon is a major mechanical treasure. Once it’s repaired, it increases my strength.”

“In other words, I converted precious materials into my own power, so I survived the danger.”

“Now that the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon is fixed, I should look for another way to make a major leap in power. That should solve this crisis.”

Sun Lingtong didn’t trust the mechanism ring but trusted Ning Zhuo absolutely.

“Since you say so, Little Zhuo, what are we waiting for?”

“Let’s go back to Green Forest Immortal City, and buy whatever we can. We’ll convert wealth into strength!”

They acted immediately.

Repaired by generously throwing in resources, the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon could once again cross the void, carrying the pair of Sun and Ning back to Green Forest Immortal City.

Within Green Forest Immortal City was a vast marketplace. It was extremely prosperous, offering a wide variety of magical tools, magic treasures, talismans, pills… everything one could imagine.

Normally, it would never be this large.

It was because Two Pillars of State had set this place up as a rear base, poured in the resources of the entire country, and created a temporary, abnormally thriving grand market.

Ning Zhuo walked through many shops in succession, finally entering a shop specializing in mechanical constructs.

Upon stepping inside, he saw many samples of mechanical creations.

Owing to the impending war in the Thousand Peaks Forest, the shop mostly sold large-scale war machines: ballistae, war chariots, catapults, battering rams, and so on.

Ning Zhuo gave them just a quick glance and showed no interest.

The shopkeeper rushed over and cupped his hands respectfully. “Greetings, Military Advisor Ning.”

Because Ning Zhuo had once returned victorious alongside the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang, many people recognized him.

For shops selling machinery like this, they had long since gathered intelligence on each army and each important figure.

Ning Zhuo’s name was among the top of their list.

His recent marriage to Mu Lan was still confidential for the time being, but his position as Army Advisor and Ceremonial Officer of the Three Generals Camp was already widely known. More importantly, Ning Zhuo was in charge of logistics for that army. All along, it was Ning Zhuo who had been managing the purchase of military supplies.

So when the shopkeeper saw Ning Zhuo, he was overjoyed, anticipating a huge sale.

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. “Your shop is the largest. You should have mechanical puppets, right?”

The shopkeeper was taken aback and looked a little disappointed.

He wasn’t going to sell big war machines but wanted a few mechanical puppets as personal guards? The profit wouldn’t be that high.

Still, thinking of future possibilities, the shopkeeper smiled. “Of course we do! Master Military Advisor, it is our humble honor to have you here. A few mechanical puppets - let’s just treat them as my gift to you, sir.”

Ning Zhuo chuckled and shook his head. “If it were only a few mechanical puppets, I wouldn’t come to your shop. I could just make them myself, couldn’t I.”

The shopkeeper’s eyes lit up, and he hurriedly gestured. “Please, Military Advisor, step inside. My shop definitely has the largest variety of mechanical puppets in the entire city, and we have ample stock.”

As the two moved toward the back, Ning Zhuo caught the sound of a conversation. It sounded familiar, making him pause slightly.

Indeed, in the inner courtyard, he saw Mu Lan.

Mu Lan was there with her female military logistics officer, bargaining with the deputy shopkeeper.

The trouble with the Red Flower Camp had passed, and they had earlier received support from the Three Generals Camp. Plus, they’d gotten their military pay this morning. Thus, Mu Lan had come in person to buy supplies.

When she saw Ning Zhuo, Mu Lan also hesitated briefly.

Ning Zhuo was the first to salute. “Military Advisor Ning Zhuo of the Three Generals Camp greets General Mu Lan.”

Mu Lan immediately realized that Ning Zhuo was putting on a front, unwilling to reveal their marital relationship in public, and her feelings became complicated.

Mu Lan merely gave him a slight nod, as though they were not close. She then turned to the shopkeeper and said, “We were in the middle of negotiations, and you left halfway. So it was to meet a more important client.”

The shopkeeper quickly apologized.

Mu Lan smiled lightly. “Your attitude isn’t bad. In that case, lower the price a bit more.”

She had recently learned the hard way what it meant to have no funds, and so every penny counted.

The shopkeeper could only give in with a wry smile.

He guided Ning Zhuo to one side and showed him a range of mechanical puppets.

Although Mu Lan kept up her price negotiations, part of her mind remained focused on Ning Zhuo.

Hearing that he wanted to make a large-scale purchase of mechanical puppets piqued her curiosity further.

The shopkeeper recommended many mechanical puppets.

Ning Zhuo focused on both the shopkeeper’s introduction and on inspecting the relevant jade slips with his divine sense.

“This model is good,” Ning Zhuo soon said, picking out a certain mechanical puppet.

The shopkeeper saw that the puppet’s price was quite high and smiled happily, praising Ning Zhuo for his discerning eye and then asking how many he wanted.

Ning Zhuo rubbed the mechanism ring on his thumb with the pad of his index finger, as if casually. “How many do you have?”

The shopkeeper gave a number, feeling quite proud of the substantial inventory.

But in the next moment, Ning Zhuo said impassively, “Very well, I’ll take them all.”

The shopkeeper’s eyes went wide.

Ning Zhuo continued, “I also want this model. Give me all of them you have.”

The shopkeeper opened his mouth but couldn’t speak.

Sensing the ring was still contracting, Ning Zhuo purchased a third model of mechanical puppets.

The shopkeeper was so happy that he was nearly tongue-tied. “Sir, we do offer payment plans, rest assured.”

“Prepare everything now. I’ll pay in full right here,” said Ning Zhuo with a decisive gesture.

The shopkeeper responded with three straight “goods” and immediately sent several staff members to fetch the goods. They soon returned with several bulging storage pouches and handed them all to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo likewise paid the full amount.

The mechanism ring finally stopped tightening. He breathed an inaudible sigh of relief.

Mu Lan was there watching the entire transaction with her own eyes. Though her face remained calm, her emotions were a whirlwind.

“I’m leaving now,” Ning Zhuo said as he took his leave.

Passing by Mu Lan, he instructed the shopkeeper, “The Red Flower Camp is a close ally of our Three Generals Camp. Why not show a bit more generosity, hmm?”

The shopkeeper immediately bowed, saying he’d keep that in mind.

Right afterward, he turned to Mu Lan. “General, in light of Lord Ning’s personal request, all the goods you want to purchase today are on the house. We won’t charge you anything.”

At this, Mu Lan finally couldn’t hold it in. Her expression changed markedly.

She managed to respond haltingly, expressing her gratitude to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo didn’t look back. With his back to her, he simply raised a hand in farewell as he walked out of the shop.

“That was just too dashing!” the female logistics officer at Mu Lan’s side exclaimed in wonder.
