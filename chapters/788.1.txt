Hesitation and Dread

Hesitation and Dread. Since 2024 began, there have been constant ups and downs, successes and failures; the bitterness and hardships are difficult to put into words.

I often feel besieged from all sides, as if surrounded by a pack of wolves.

I think back to Tang Sanzang’s journey to the West to retrieve the scriptures—resting in the desolate mountains and wild ridges, the traveler weary and the horse spent.

Having reached this point myself, I too am utterly exhausted, filled with panic and dread. It is truly difficult to discern: is the one I have encountered the Great Sage Equaling Heaven [Sun Wukong], or the Six-Eared Macaque?

I am, after all, but a mere mortal.

I possess only a sincere heart that seeks the Dao.

Is "saving the tree" nothing more than a delusion?
