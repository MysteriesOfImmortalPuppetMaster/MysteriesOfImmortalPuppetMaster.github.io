Chapter 822: Recruitment

"All things under heaven and earth can be cut."

This was the opening sentence of the Great Primordial Form-Cutting Scroll.

The handwriting in the book was lean and thin, the strokes as clean and decisive as a knife’s edge.

Ning Zhuo stared at this line, his mind falling into a slight trance - between the lines, there seemed to be a hidden calmness that looked down upon all living beings, as if the writer could use a ruler as a blade to tailor everything in the world.

Ning Zhuo first skimmed through the text to understand the overall structure of the Great Primordial Form-Cutting Scroll.

The cutting techniques taught in the book were divided into seven categories.

They were: Straight Cut, Curved Cut, Stacked Cut, Internal Cut, Void Cut, Intent Cut, and Fate Cut.

There was no hierarchy among the seven categories, and they were strongly interconnected.

Broad and profound!

"Truly worthy of being written personally by a Void Refinement level mighty figure," Ning Zhuo sighed with emotion.

After studying it for a while, he began to practice.

Ning Zhuo took out a stack of white paper and placed it before him.

"When the heart is upright, the line is straight; when the hand is steady, the cut is even."

Ning Zhuo silently recited the mnemonic. His right hand, holding the ruler, slowly sank down, aligning the ruler's edge with the edge of the paper.

He took a deep breath and gently pushed with his wrist.

The ruler's edge glided across the paper, leaving a shallow mark - but it was crooked and twisting, like the trail of a crawling earthworm.

Ning Zhuo frowned slightly.

He clearly felt his wrist was steady and his line of sight was true, so why was the line he drew so distorted?

"Again."

Another sheet of paper was spread out. Ning Zhuo adjusted his breathing. This time, he deliberately slowed down, pushing the ruler's blade forward almost inch by inch.

The line was still crooked, only slightly better than the first time.

"Again."

The third sheet, the fourth, the fifth...

An incense stick's worth of time later, over twenty sheets of waste paper were scattered around Ning Zhuo. Each one bore crooked lines; some even broke off midway, as if the ruler's blade had suddenly skipped.

Ning Zhuo stopped his movements and stared at the imitation ruler in his hand, falling into deep thought.

"Every time I push the ruler's blade, I can clearly feel the minute unevenness of the paper's surface, the direction of the fiber texture, and even the tiny changes in the stress on the paper. These sensations are so clear that I can almost 'see' every instant of contact between the ruler's blade and the paper."

"But therein lies the problem - I feel too much."

There was no helping it.

Ning Zhuo's current attainment in Artifact Refining was high enough to give him such abundant sensory feedback.

"Or rather, I am too focused on these subtle sensations, and instead, I've lost my grasp of the whole. I shouldn't be drowned out by countless details."

He picked up the imitation ruler again but didn't rush to make the cut. Instead, he closed his eyes and first imagined a straight line - perfectly straight, without any curvature.

Then, he imagined the ruler's blade sliding along this line, from the starting point to the end point, in one smooth motion.

"When the heart is upright, the line is straight."

He understood.

The so-called "heart is upright" did not refer to moral integrity, but rather the mind's focus on the "line" itself, undisturbed by other distracting thoughts. The direction, length, and position of the line - these were what the mind should focus on. As for the texture of the paper, the tactile feedback of the ruler, and the slight tremors of the wrist, those were all trivial details.

Ning Zhuo suddenly saw the light.

He opened his eyes and pushed the ruler continuously.

The ruler's blade glided silently.

A perfectly straight line extended from the head of the paper to the tail, unbiased and centered exactly along the paper's midline.

A smile involuntarily surfaced on Ning Zhuo's lips.

He picked up the paper and examined it against the light. The depth of the mark was uniform, the width consistent, without any trace of trembling or skipping.

"Success."

Straight lines, horizontal lines, vertical lines, diagonal lines... He cut hundreds of sheets of paper, each one as straight as if snapped by a carpenter's ink line. The imitation ruler in his hand became more and more obedient, almost becoming an extension of his arm.

Eventually, he no longer needed to imagine the straight line beforehand; with just a thought, the ruler's blade would automatically trace the line he envisioned.

Ning Zhuo began to attempt the Curved Cut.

Curved lines were much harder than straight ones. A straight line required only one direction, but a curve required constant adjustment of the angle during movement. Moreover, this adjustment had to be continuous and fluid, without the slightest pause or abrupt turn.

The first curve was as crooked as an earthworm broken into several segments.

The second was slightly better, but one could still see the traces of piecing it together.

The third, the fourth, the fifth...

Ning Zhuo's frown deepened. Practicing curved lines was more than ten times harder than straight lines. He seemed to have returned to his initial state - feeling too much and losing his grasp of the whole.

"No."

He stopped and closed his eyes to ponder.

The difference between a curve and a straight line was not just a change in shape.

A straight line is static: start point, direction, end point. Once these three are determined, the line is determined.

But a curve is dynamic: the direction changes every instant. The mind must follow this change at all times, without the slightest lag.

"So, I need to grasp the rhythm within it."

"The force of the initial cut, the timing of the turn, the lingering resonance of the finish. It's like playing the guqin; not plucking individual notes, but letting the fingers flow naturally with the melody."

Having understood this, Ning Zhuo continued his training.

A moment later.

The ruler's blade wandered.

A fluid arc appeared on the paper, completed in one breath from start to finish, without any stiff turns.

Ning Zhuo smiled.

He continued practicing. Arcs, waves, spirals... various curves became increasingly proficient in his hands. Eventually, he could even cut out a simple sketch of a plum blossom on the paper: five petals, round and full, with slender and spirited stamens.

After a full six hours, the waste paper scattered around Ning Zhuo had piled up into a stack amounting to hundreds of sheets.

His mental energy was dim, and his body swayed slightly; he had reached his absolute limit.

Although the time was short, Ning Zhuo's gains were immense. His learning speed was far beyond that of ordinary people!

On one hand, Ning Zhuo had accumulated a foundation in his cultivation realm, so when cultivating the cutting technique, he could infer other things from one instance and get started very easily.

On the other hand, during his study, Ning Zhuo also leeched off the use of the Luo Shu, utilizing the technique of "head from the rafters and piercing his thigh with an awl" to maintain intense focus.

"But going further isn't something that can be broken through in a short time."

Ning Zhuo put away the Great Primordial Form-Cutting Scroll and took out the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.

"I've only just started learning. Although I've successfully mastered the basics, there is still an extremely long distance before I can refine the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale."

Ning Zhuo was not discouraged, nor was he disappointed.

Because this situation was within his estimation.

"I am far from researching the Great Primordial Form-Cutting Scroll thoroughly. Whether cultivating this book will help me refine the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale in the future... I can't see any signs of that yet."

"But even if it doesn't help in the future, just mastering the skill of cutting will be of deep benefit to Artifact Refining, Alchemy, Talisman Making, and Formation Setup!"

While Ning Zhuo was consulting the Great Primordial Form-Cutting Scroll for the first time, over at Myriad Beasts Peak.

-----
On a section of a broken cliff protruding from the mountainside stood a palace hall. It was suspended over empty space on three sides, with only its back against the mountain body.

There were no railings in front of the hall, only a large expanse of natural blue-grey rock. In the cracks of the stone grew nameless dwarf pines, twisted and vigorous, blown by the astral winds so that they leaned forever to one side.

Tuoba Huang sat in the main seat, his figure like a mountain.

"Drinking tea isn't nearly as satisfying as drinking wine!" Tuoba Huang spoke in a gruff voice, lifting his teacup and draining it in one gulp, completely disregarding any notion of savoring the flavor.

Scalding tea dripped down his beard, which resembled a lion's mane, and landed on the animal skin cloak at his chest. He didn't wipe it off, merely smacking his lips.

Sitting in the guest seat, Wang Yu smiled faintly.

The Lord of Danxia Peak was dressed in a cloud-patterned Daoist robe as always, with rosy clouds flowing across the fabric like dawn reflecting on snow. His seated posture was calm and perfectly rounded, forming a sharp contrast with Tuoba Huang's roughness.

"Peak Lord Tuoba is heroic. This Cloud Mist Tip indeed does not suit your taste. Another day, I will have a disciple send over a jar of Fire Thorn Brew. That wine is strong; I imagine it will catch your eye."

Tuoba Huang waved his large hand: "Let's talk business. You came to my door personally today; what is it regarding?"

Wang Yu didn't answer immediately. He unhurriedly poured himself a cup of tea, blew on it gently, and then spoke:

"Has Peak Lord Tuoba heard of that youngster who has been in the limelight within the sect recently?"

"Ning Zhuo?" A sharp light flashed in Tuoba Huang's crimson pupils, followed immediately by a sneer. "His Noble Spirit shot straight into the clouds, and then he publicly returned the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone. Tsk, tsk. Who in the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect doesn't know that big-headed kid now?"

He paused, his curly beard raising slightly, a hint of appreciation leaking into his tone: "That old thing Zhong Dao actually picked up a treasure this time."

Wang Yu's brow twitched slightly: "Peak Lord Tuoba knows something of Ning Zhuo?"

Tuoba Huang shook his head: "I wouldn't say I know him, I've just heard of him a few times. After all, it's the Flying Cloud Assembly; I also want to recruit some talent for my peak."

Wang Yu nodded: "Just a short while ago, Ning Zhuo took first place in the Demon Subjugation Hall's second test. But when it came time to receive the heavy reward for first place, he rejected Zhong Dao's implicit invitation."

"Oh?" Tuoba Huang was surprised. "Tell me in detail."

Wang Yu then recounted the events in detail.

Upon hearing this, Tuoba Huang couldn't help but laugh loudly: "This kid Ning Zhuo has his own ideas. Hahaha, I didn't expect that old fellow Zhong Dao to have a moment where he eats a loss."

Tuoba Huang had been unhappy with Zhong Dao for a long time.

Especially before, during the Eight Peaks Council discussion regarding White Paper Immortal City. The Peak Lords had found a method and wanted Zhong Dao's assistance. In the end, Zhong Dao questioned them sternly, making the Peak Lords lose face, and Tuoba Huang had also been embarrassed.

Wang Yu smiled. After taking a light sip of tea, he expressed that he viewed Ning Zhuo's future extremely highly, even believing that Ning Zhuo might become a second Zhong Dao in the future.

This caused Tuoba Huang to frown, his voice turning gruff: "Although I can't stand Old Man Zhong, he is indeed quite special. His talent is unsurpassed, and he possesses great destiny. A cultivator of his strength only appears once every few centuries, even within the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

"Ning Zhuo can grow to reach Zhong Dao's status?"

Hearing this, a meaningful light flashed in Wang Yu's eyes: "Peak Lord Tuoba, that statement is incorrect."

"Does Peak Lord Tuoba know how Zhong Dao joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect back then?"

Tuoba Huang froze, then fell into deep thought.

Of course he knew.

Like many others, having suffered losses at Zhong Dao's hands, he had collected intelligence on the man multiple times in an attempt to get even.

Recalling it slightly now, he immediately understood some of the implications behind Wang Yu's words.

Wang Yu held up his teacup but didn't drink, simply looking at his own reflection in the tea soup: "Ning Zhuo's current performance is not much different from when Zhong Dao joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Noble Spirit piercing the sun and clouds, and taking first place in the second test. Especially publicly declining Zhong Dao's invitation - this is something even Zhong Dao didn't do back then."

Tuoba Huang remained silent and contemplative.

Wang Yu continued: "When Zhong Dao joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect back then, no one expected him to have today's achievements either. If someone had seen his potential at that time and fully cultivated him..."

He didn't finish the sentence, but the meaning was obvious.

Tuoba Huang stared at Wang Yu, sharp light flickering in his crimson pupils as he chewed over the deep meaning of these words.

After a long while, he said in a muffled voice: "So you came today to remind me to take this kid seriously?"

Wang Yu stood up with a smile, flicking his whisk: "Peak Lord Tuoba is wise, why would you need me to remind you? It was merely a few idle words to go with the tea."

He cupped his hands slightly: "The tea has been finished; Wang takes his leave."

After Wang Yu left, Tuoba Huang sat alone in the hall.

Outside the hall, the astral winds howled, making the dwarf pines rustle. Clouds and mist surged, sometimes submerging the hall, sometimes scattering to reveal the abyss thousands of feet below.

Tuoba Huang remained motionless, silent as a mountain range.

His mind turned over and over, filled with Wang Yu's words.

Tuoba Huang's brow knitted tighter and tighter.

He gradually realized that Wang Yu's visit today was absolutely not as simple as "a few idle words."

The Lord of Danxia Peak had always been deep and calculating; his words and actions always had a purpose. He specifically mentioned Ning Zhuo, specifically compared him to Zhong Dao, and specifically pointed out "fully cultivating" him - this was a reminder.

A reminder that Ning Zhuo could become the second Zhong Dao.

Even if this probability was still small in Tuoba Huang's mind. But what if?

"If Ning Zhuo becomes a second Zhong Dao..."

Tuoba Huang muttered to himself, a trace of apprehension flashing through his crimson eyes.

One Zhong Dao was already headache enough. If another one came along, to what extent would the Demon Subjugation Hall's strength and influence expand?

When the time came, if the situation of the last Eight Peaks Council occurred again, how would his Myriad Beasts Peak have any say?

"No."

Tuoba Huang suddenly slapped the tea table, shattering it instantly. His fierce and mighty aura erupted abruptly. "I can't let this kid join the Demon Subjugation Hall."

His thick, lion-mane-like beard and hair moved without wind, and his body radiated a fiery temper, the air seemingly lingering with a scorching aura.

"Men!"

"What are your orders, Peak Lord?"

"Prepare a heavy gift and send it to Ning Zhuo in public. I want to recruit him with a heavy sum!"

"Remember, you must specifically point out - this gift is merely to show my, Tuoba Huang's, sincerity. Let Ning Zhuo have no worries and accept it directly. I am different from a certain someone; I don't have any requirements in this regard. Hahaha!"

Tuoba Huang's temperament was impatient, causing his subordinates to act with lightning speed.

Soon, gongs and drums reached the sky.

A small team of cultivators, riding several carriages pulled by strange beasts, flew toward the Azure Stone Cave Abode with great fanfare. Along the way, they attracted more and more cultivators to follow and watch.

On the stone platform outside the Azure Stone Cave Abode, the envoys from Myriad Beasts Peak opened the treasure chests one by one, revealing the collections within.

The sunlight shone upon them, refracting dazzling, colorful brilliance that made people dizzy.

"So many top-grade spirit stones?!" Many cultivators squinted, stung by the radiance.

"Is that the egg of a Red Flame Tiger?" The voice of a knowledgeable cultivator changed pitch.

A Golden Core stage cultivator squeezed to the front, staring at a segment of beast bone in one of the chests, his pupils constricting violently: "Did I see that wrong? That looks like the remains of a Soul Formation level demonic beast?!"

"Ning Zhuo is merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator."

"What exactly does Myriad Beasts Peak want to do? Bringing out Soul Formation level resources for a Foundation Establishment cultivator?!"

Many people found it inconceivable.
