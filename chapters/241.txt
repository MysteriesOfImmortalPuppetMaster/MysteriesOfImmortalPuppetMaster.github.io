Chapter 241: Bombarding Fire Persimmon Mountain!

Zhu Xuanji sighed in disappointment, then seemed to recall something and asked, "At that time, where did Daoist Brother Zheng Danlian's battle with that crazed Foundation Establishment cultivator take place?" Regarding this, Zheng Shuangjun remembered clearly and directly provided Zhu Xuanji with the answer.

Zhu Xuanji noted this clue, obtained the mechanical blueprint, and finally turned to leave.

Ning Zhuo wandered for a long time, feasting his eyes.

After leaving the Cloud Market and returning home, he resumed his cultivation.

After performing a session of the fourth layer of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, he sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, the Floating Cloud Cloak enveloping him, eyes tightly shut, shoulders hunched, head loweredâ€”once again, his soul entered the Immortal Palace.

In the first room of the Immortal Palace, there were numerous mechanical puppets.

Some were gathered in groups, others queued, gradually passing through the first door.

"Brother, may I ask, why does your appearance differ from ours?" Ning Zhuo jumped down from a small mountain of mechanical parts, and a passerby inquired.

Ning Zhuo chuckled, "I am Ning Zhuo of the Ning family, have you heard of me?"

"Ah?" The questioning puppet exclaimed, nodding repeatedly, "So it's Young Master Ning Zhuo, I've heard of your fame."

Ning Zhuo pointed to his large head, "This is the manifestation of my innate talent. As for what talent, I don't know either. The main branch of the Ning family has been preparing a test for me, but it's not ready yet."

Ning Zhuo's appearance caused more whispers among the crowd.

As he approached the first portal, the puppets all voluntarily made way.

"Thank you, everyone." Ning Zhuo cupped his hands in gratitude, received spirit stones as a reward, and left the first room.

"This is my first time seeing Ning Zhuo." "The genius youth of the Ning family is surprisingly approachable!"

"Hehe, approachable? You must have a misunderstanding about the master of the black market. These young masters from large cultivation families may smile often, but when they act, it's ruthless." "Seeing him today, the famous Ning Zhuo is nothing special." "The Monkey Head Gang wiped out the Viper Gang overnight, wasn't that Ning Zhuo's doing? And you think he's nothing special?!"

In the second room, many puppets were still attempting to pass the trials.

It's worth mentioning that Ning Zhuo had long ago voluntarily dismantled the mechanical traps he had added, significantly lowering the difficulty of passing the second room and beyond.

This action sparked numerous speculations among the various factions of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

The most mainstream guess was that when Meng Chong and others reached a certain checkpoint, it indicated that the difficulty of previous checkpoints no longer posed a challenge or tempering, so they were voluntarily removed.

Another mainstream speculation was that the three sects' elders were blessing the masses.

While selecting and training elite disciples, they also considered those with insufficient aptitude, allowing them to keep up with the frontrunners, maintaining hope while also applying pressure on the leaders from the followers.

Unbeknownst to them, this was all Ning Zhuo's doing.

He realized that mechanical traps were becoming less effective against large numbers, and maintaining them would consume a significant amount of his time and energy, so he voluntarily removed them.

The further he progressed, the fewer mechanical puppets there were in the rooms.

By the time Ning Zhuo reached the first transfer hall, he was the only one left.

Under the protection of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, he met with Sun Lingtong again.

Given that Ning Zhuo was likely under the surveillance of numerous Golden Core cultivators, this was their only channel of communication.

Sun Lingtong inquired about the Cloud Commerce and Cloud Market, and Ning Zhuo recounted his shopping experience.

"I bought you a Somersault Cloud and brought a Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud for Yang Chanyu." Sun Lingtong was displeased, "Why did you buy her something!"

Ning Zhuo sighed, "During the Golden Core skirmish, she indeed contributed significantly." "Without the false scripture she personally crafted, our plan might have been exposed from the start." "Giving her this auspicious cloud, I think she'll be pleased, and it might prompt her to reduce her fees, which would be beneficial."

Sun Lingtong glanced at Ning Zhuo, immediately realizing that his previous deception, claiming to have paid a hefty sum to invite Yang Chanyu's assistance, had been seen through by Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo intended to use this magical artifact-level Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud to alleviate Sun Lingtong's burden.

"Stop doing these pointless things in the future. Such a waste of money! Can this Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud be returned?" Sun Lingtong asked.

Ning Zhuo's tone turned serious, "Boss, be honest with me, what exactly did you promise to get Yang Chanyu to agree to help?"

"Hahaha. The weather is nice today! The sunshine is great." Sun Lingtong deflected.

Ning Zhuo snorted, dropping the topic.

Even though they were in the Lava Immortal Palace, Sun Lingtong spoke of weather and sunshine, clearly using this absurd response to express his stance.

Ning Zhuo could only compromise, refraining from further inquiry.

"I'll hand over the Somersault Cloud and Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud to you when I next enter the Immortal Palace."

"For now, the Lava Immortal Palace seems to be a relatively safe place. After all, not many possess the mechanical expertise to enter the Immortal Palace," Ning Zhuo said.

Sun Lingtong nodded, "Zhu Xuanji seems to have set his sights on you."

"Such a seasoned divine constable, even without evidence of your crimes, sometimes develops an intuition from years of case-solving." "Little Zhuo, although your plan is risky, you should indeed act soon." "I'll leave the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai to you. I won't get involved; too many people will only complicate things for you."

Ning Zhuo nodded and bid farewell to Sun Lingtong.

His main purpose this time was to clear the path to the Dao Gate!

With the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, he charged forward.

The checkpoints along the way posed no obstacle to him, and for every reward option, Ning Zhuo chose spirit stones.

The leaderboard rewards were also, without exception, spirit stones.

Ning Zhuo maximized his spirit stone reserves!

The third Dao Gate.

He pushed the door open...

Clearing the third checkpoint.

Clearing the second checkpoint.

The final checkpoint!

Ning Zhuo used brute force over finesse, lacking in spell mastery, he wielded spirit stones, extracting vast amounts of spirit power to win by sheer volume!

After spending over half an hour, he finally succeeded, clearing the final checkpoint on his own.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai were left at the penultimate checkpoint.

There was no choice; having an extra helper would exponentially increase the difficulty of the final checkpoint.

This checkpoint tested the trial disciple's own spellcasting abilities.

Ning Zhuo entered the final reward chamber of the Dao Gate.

The moment he stepped through the door, he acquired a Foundation Establishment method centered on the middle dantian.

With this, he had collected all three Foundation Establishment methods, ready for the final fusion and combination to form a complete and comprehensive Three Sects Supreme Foundation Establishment Method!

Using such a Foundation Establishment method, he would truly cultivate all three dantians simultaneously!

Among the many position waist tokens hanging on the wall, Ning Zhuo, after communicating with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, already had a target.

Without hesitation, he took the topmost waist token.

Five Elements Cannon Tower Chief

It was also a position of the second rank.

"Master, Master, you did it! You finally did it!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's excited voice immediately followed.

"I sensed your presence earlier, Master, but seeing you busy with the trials, I dared not disturb you," the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit explained.

Ning Zhuo nodded, "Enough with the idle talk. Execute the plan we agreed upon."

"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, activate the Five Elements Cannon Tower for me!"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit immediately responded, "Little Spirit obeys."

Its authority was insufficient, but once Ning Zhuo became the Cannon Tower Chief and granted authorization, it could fully activate the tower.

The next moment.

In the Lava Immortal Palace, a three-story cannon tower suddenly rose.

With a series of mechanical clicks, the tower creaked and reached a certain limit, fixing itself in place.

After rising, the tower had reached six stories.

"What's happening?" Many cultivators within the Immortal Palace, startled by the commotion, cast spells to gaze afar, witnessing the now taller Five Elements Cannon Tower.

Then, under countless astonished gazes, every window of the six-story tower opened, revealing numerous thick, sturdy cannons.

Most of the cannons were of the magical artifact level, but the main cannon, ten times larger, reached the level of a magical treasure, with one on each floor.

The massive cannon muzzles, dark and imposing, exuded an air of dominance.

"It seems something major is about to happen!" The cultivators observing this scene couldn't help but feel a surge of anticipation.

In the reward chamber.

Ning Zhuo's voice was as firm as iron, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, channel all your magical power, prepare for bombardment."

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's voice also turned steely, "Mana infusion complete, the tower is ready."

Ning Zhuo clenched his fist and decisively ordered, "Fire!"

Boom!!!

The simultaneous firing of the cannons merged into a single roar.

Hundreds of cannonballs formed from five-colored magical power shot in all directions.

They traced arcs through the air, then plunged into the Fire Persimmon Lava.

They burrowed deep into the mountain, recklessly carving out countless tunnels.

Then, amidst numerous demon beast colonies, they exploded with a thunderous roar!

Boom boom boom...

This time, the explosions didn't merge into one but erupted in succession.

The five-colored magical power shockwaves spread fiercely in all directions, obliterating everything in their path!

The ineffective Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were reduced to dust in the explosions.

Fire Persimmon Mountain was shaken to an unprecedented degree!

The ground quaked, the mountain trembled!

Lava surged, shooting skyward, reaching a height of a hundred zhang.

The scorching flames blazed high, forming colossal pillars of fire, engulfing the entire summit of Fire Persimmon Mountain.

This was a hell of flames, carrying unparalleled destructive power, causing the heavens and earth to tremble, threatening to devour all life!

The Daoists who had been meditating were left speechless by this hellish scene.

"What... what's happening?"

"The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit has gone mad!!" "It's completely lost it!!!"

In an instant, Meng Kui recalled the scene from the Sitting Mountain Observation.

He suddenly understood, "That Dragon Turtle pulled out its limbs, disregarding the shattered rock plates, it was determined to plunge into the lava." "It's fighting desperately to break free!"
