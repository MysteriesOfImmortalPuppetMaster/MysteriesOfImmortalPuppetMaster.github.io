Chapter 710: Making Friends and Discussing Foes

Green Stone Grotto Abode.

Ning Zhuo sat in the host's seat, raised his wine cup, and thanked the invited cultivators: "Our victory over Ban Ji this time relied entirely on our unity and concerted efforts. Come, everyone, let's have another drink!"

After returning from Green Bamboo Peak, Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to invite the other eleven who had passed the trial. Some Golden Core cultivators weren't invited, and some, considering the upcoming competition, declined Ning Zhuo's invitation. In the end, five came. Ning Zhuo invited these five to his grotto abode, where Chef Lao prepared a spiritual food feast.

The Spirit Valley wine was mellow, the Golden Line eel fragrant and crispy, the simmered Hundred Treasures Mushrooms were so fresh it felt like your tongue would melt, and there were also chilled Jade Scatter Fruits, which brought a cool, sweet sensation upon eating, with a very unique flavor.

"That Ban Ji, although he comes from the Ban Family, his usual behavior is almost no different from a demonic cultivator. Whenever he sees an excellent mechanical construct, he wants to seize it. I've long been displeased with him."

The speaker was a young male cultivator. His hair was curly and yellowish, with many traces of burns or gunpowder blackening on his face and hands. His nickname was Huo Wa'er, and those closer to him called him A Huo directly. He enjoyed making explosive-type mechanical constructs and had a temperament that hated evil.

Huo Wa'er said, "Hey, I know some rumors. That Ban Ji isn't cultivating the normal Ban Family technique; it's said to be a demonic art!"

Ning Zhuo immediately nodded: "I know about this. It's the 'Greedy Mechanism Demonic Heart Art'. This art claims: Greed for mechanisms breeds heart demons, heart demons born lead to demonic madness."

"Therefore, Ban Ji's demonic thoughts are quite troublesome. I'm sure you all have deep personal experience with that, right?"

Ning Zhuo spotted an opportunity, seized it immediately, and decisively spoke up, sharing some information he had acquired at great cost. His words immediately elicited widespread agreement.

Huo Wa'er cursed: "Dammit, Ban Ji's divine sense isn't easy to deal with!"

Zhang Xiaodan's voice was muffled: "Indeed." He had a sturdy build, broad shoulders and a thick waist, with skin dark and shiny like an iron lump. He gave off a simple, honest, even somewhat dull feeling, speaking with a deep, muffled voice. But his divine sense was quite "hard"; it was the most stubborn and tenacious among the many divine senses that had trapped Ban Ji.

Talking about their common enemy and their shared experience of fighting side-by-side made the banquet atmosphere more lively.

A young female cultivator looked at Ning Zhuo and directly asked how he had come into conflict with Ban Ji.

Ning Zhuo gave her a grateful look, then revealed a bitter smile, sighed, and said, "What if I told you that today's Rising Cloud Minor Trial was the first time I've ever laid eyes on Ban Ji? I wonder if you all would doubt me?"

As he spoke, he took out a letter from his storage belt and passed it around for everyone to see. This letter was naturally the one Ban Ji had sent earlier expressing his desire for a spar. While everyone was looking at it, Ning Zhuo continued, "However, regarding my conflict with Ban Ji, I do have some conjectures and verifications."

"I sent a subordinate to personally deliver my reply to Ban Ji. At that time, he was drinking happily with Pi Fujie…"

"And I just happen to have a conflict with Pi Fujie." Ning Zhuo mentioned that he had invited Shen Huangling, but the Shen Family and the Pi Family of Nine Palaces Immortal City were mortal enemies, so he himself was also hated by Pi Fujie. "In the end, I directly killed a newly recruited demonic subordinate of his"

"Everyone, take a look." Ning Zhuo took out that tiger skin again, specifically pointing out the locations of the Thousand Scale Skin Talisman and the Bloodstained Galloping Talisman.

After this round of explanation, the way everyone looked at Ning Zhuo changed subtly.

"So Ning Zhuo is actually together with Ning Lan, Lin Jinglong, and Situ Xing." They didn't know Ning Zhuo, but they had more or less heard of Ning Lan and the other three. The fact that Ning Zhuo could associate with them elevated their evaluation of Ning Zhuo to the same level as Ning Lan and the others.

"This tiger demon's combat power while alive must have been considerable. It also had two major demonic talismans, yet it was still killed by Ning Zhuo…"

"This big-headed youngster shouldn't be underestimated. Although his divine sense isn't great, his combat power is surely there."

"What exactly is his background? His backing must be quite substantial!"

Old Patchwork Sun looked at Ning Zhuo with concern: "The Pi Family, at the very beginning, were outright demonic cultivators. They only bribed high-ranking officials of the state to switch to the righteous path."

"The Pi Family's foundation is not clean!"

"Young Master Ning, you must be extra cautious in the future."

"Old Patchwork Sun" was naturally his nickname. He was a slightly hunchbacked old man, his face wrinkled like ravines, always wearing a worried, frowning expression. He perpetually wore a faded, coarse short jacket patched with various colored patches, carrying a large wicker box on his back - even bigger than he was and also covered in patches - filled with all kinds of repair tools and materials.

Zhang Xiaodan sighed: "The Ban Family is a famous mechanical arts family in our country. Who would have thought they'd produce someone as heretical and unconventional as Ban Ji in this generation?" His tone held some regret for the Ban Family.

The young female cultivator, Jiang Xiaobian, snorted coldly: "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam is crooked! If the Ban Family's intentions were truly upright, how could they allow Ban Ji to cultivate demonic arts and act so arrogantly and tyrannically?"

Ning Zhuo nodded inwardly, adding to himself: "Exactly, that's right." His purpose for hosting this banquet was more than half achieved.

In Ning Zhuo's view: Ban Ji possessed demonic arts and acted tyrannically, making him the perfect target. Since he was a demonic cultivator, his reputation was inherently bad, making him prone to being ganged up on.

In contrast, Ning Zhuo, although unknown, at least didn't have a completely negative reputation like Ban Ji. Therefore, in Qing Jiuzi's first Rising Cloud Minor Trial, he used this weakness to successfully unite a large group of loose cultivators. 

Ban Ji's own rampant attacking posture also helped Ning Zhuo from another angle. After all, most people knew of Ban Ji and were wary of him. As for whether ganging up on him was unfair? Of course not - why talk about fairness with a demonic cultivator? Just gang up on him! The previous battle had proven this point. They were the righteous path, Ban Ji was a demonic cultivator; they were the good guys, dealing with the bad guy together was perfectly justified!

To this end, Ning Zhuo listed much evidence to convince everyone.

Bai Yaozi Chen Liu turned his gaze to Ning Zhuo: "Young Master Ning, you still need to be more careful. I wonder if any elders from your family are accompanying you?"

"Both Pi Fujie's family and Ban Ji's family are famous far and wide in our country." Chen Liu was lean, with dark skin, sharp eyes that held a bit of shrewdness and wariness. Under the guise of concern, he was actually probing Ning Zhuo's background. When operating in the world, background matters.

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "I won't hide it from you all, this is my first time at the main mountain gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. You could say I'm a newcomer."

"I uphold the idea of being kind to others and never intended to offend anyone." However, when it comes to villains like Pi Fujie and Ban Ji, offending them is just something that happens. "My family elders didn't blame me; they just told me not to be afraid!"

Ning Zhuo didn't give any information, but the others' eyes flickered slightly. Facing the Pi and Ban families, Ning Zhuo's family elders still maintained a tough attitude, which indirectly suggested that Ning Zhuo's background was not small!

Ning Zhuo's tone turned relaxed, not wanting to appear overly aggressive: "Once this Flying Cloud Grand Meeting is over, I should become a disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

"If Ban Ji and Pi Fujie also successfully join, we'll be fellow disciples. Our conflicts can be resolved openly through the Martial Arts Hall."

"If they fail, and I'm a disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, I'll have even less reason to fear them." Ning Zhuo's optimistic attitude and forward-looking perspective immediately resonated with everyone, successfully shifting the topic.

These five cultivators had come to the main mountain gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect at this time, naturally also wanting to join. Based on Ning Zhuo's earlier exchanges with them, he learned that all five ere loose cultivators, each with their own expertise in the mechanical arts.

For example, Old Patchwork Sun was good at repairs, Zhang Xiaodan had skill in artifact refining, specializing in heavy machinery, Huo Wa'er had deep attainments in explosive constructs, Jiang Xiaobian excelled in insect-type constructs and sound control, and Chen Liu was quick-witted, good with information and adaptability.

"Joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect, it's easy to say, but also not easy to say!"

"If I can obtain Qing Jiuzi's inheritance, can I ensure my entry into the Myriad Manifestations Sect?"

"That's absolutely possible. Haven't you heard? Qing Jiuzi's inheritance even includes the Peak Master Token of Green Bamboo Peak."

Everyone shared the same goal, so the conversation was lively. Ning Zhuo listened for a while, occasionally interjecting.

Someone naturally brought up the 'Primordial Sound Reed Book', and the topic shifted to the rewards of this Qing Jiuzi minor trial. All twelve winners, including Ning Zhuo, had received a copy of the 'Primordial Sound Reed Book'.

Zhang Xiaodan expressed his worry: "I'm completely ignorant of musical theory. I'm afraid I'll do poorly in the subsequent minor trials."

Huo Wa'er said: "What's there to fear? At worst, you just lose."

Chen Liu looked at the young female cultivator: "I think Fellow Daoist Jiang has the best hope."

The young female cultivator, Jiang Xiaobian, looked quite young.

She was sallow and thin, with withered, yellowish hair always tied into a thin, small braid at the back of her head. At her waist hung several bamboo tubes, from which the faint chirping of insects could often be heard.

Jiang Xiaobian specialized in using spirit insects as primary materials to create tiny insect-type mechanisms. When facing enemies, she would open the bamboo tubes, pouring out swarms of mechanical insects.

Given the large number of insects, she certainly couldn't control each one individually with spiritual energy threads.

She played an insect flute, using sound to control the various mechanical insects. Qing Jiuzi's mechanical approach also placed great emphasis on music.

The 'Primordial Sound Reed Book' was a text discussing the creation of mechanical components. It detailed twenty types of reeds, each capable of producing primordial sounds with different effects, and conversely, how to use primordial sounds to activate and control mechanisms.

Chen Liu said: "Fellow Daoist Jiang is already skilled in the way of music. This 'Primordial Sound Reed Book' is like adding wings to a tiger for you."

Jiang Xiaobian, however, shook her head: "Not exactly. Qing Jiuzi's sound-based mechanisms are vast and profound, not entirely the same as the insect-controlling music I specialize in.

One could only say there are points of commonality that can be used for reference. But to rely on this to win in the subsequent minor trials requires careful study and comprehension of its essence."

Thus, the conversation focused on this topic again, with everyone expressing their views, creating a lively atmosphere. Ning Zhuo smiled, participating throughout. Although he had a deeper understanding, he chose to hide his ability in this context.

There was no need to show off his excellence. Since Ban Ji was already eliminated, his opponents in the next Qing Jiuzi Rising Cloud minor arena would be the other eleven people. This included the five present. Despite his youth, Ning Zhuo was quite mature, lacking the emotional need to flaunt his intelligence or show off in front of others.

After a while, everyone held their own opinions and began to argue.

Ning Zhuo then said: "Everyone, please listen to me. How about we pause the discussion on the 'Primordial Sound Reed Book' for now? Why don't you each face the upcoming Qing Jiuzi minor trials based on your own understanding?"

"Let's agree beforehand: no matter who among us ultimately obtains the Qing Jiu inheritance, that person has to host a feast!"

"At that time, no one is allowed to welch, agreed?"

As the host who provided the feast and with his unusual status, Ning Zhuo's words were supported as soon as he spoke.

Zhang Xiaodan already foresaw that he wouldn't make it to the end: "Even if I only obtain this text, it's still a significant gain."

Old Patchwork Sun comforted Zhang Xiaodan: "Qing Jiuzi's mechanical art, while unique, isn't considered top-tier."

"True," Chen Liu nodded, "Within our Myriad Manifestations Sect, there's a top-tier mechanical arts family. That's the Meng Family on Shen Suan Peak!"

Ning Zhuo's heart stirred upon hearing this. This wasn't the first time he had heard of it.

Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he had heard about this family from Song Fuli. After arriving at the Myriad Manifestations Sect and purchasing intelligence, he also saw information about the Meng Family. "Although my mother's surname is Meng, it has nothing to do with this Meng Family.

If it did, she would have told me long ago." But this is actually good. "Shen Suan Peak is quite weak. If I were implicated by this connection, I'm afraid I'd be dragged into the deepest and most terrifying internal struggle within the Myriad Manifestations Sect currently."

Chen Liu continued: "If the Meng Family cultivators of Shen Suan Peak were to hold a Rising Cloud minor trial, I'd fight tooth and nail to participate! It's a pity the Meng Family has been lying low these years, with few noticeable movements."

"This Flying Cloud Grand Meeting, I'm afraid they will still maintain a secretive posture."

The banquet ended, both hosts and guests were happy, and they parted reluctantly.

Alone, Ning Zhuo took out the jade slip 'Primordial Sound Reed Book' to study. He thought back to the others' conversations and profiles, silently evaluating:

"Old Patchwork Sun is trapped by the 'vessel' and seeks its 'technique'; Chen Liu is skilled in 'change' but neglects its 'purity'; Huo Wa'er emphasizes 'power' but loses its 'form'; Jiang Xiaobian excels in 'sound' but is confused by its 'principle'; Zhang Xiaodan is fixated on 'heaviness' but forgets its 'ingenuity'."

"As for the poetic metaphors of 'Heavenly Dew', 'Twenty-Four', and 'Ice Crystal Clear', they offer three layers of guidance."

"The first points to the distinction between clarity and turbidity - Heavenly Dew need not be sweet nectar, its value lies in utmost purity; the second points to the rhythm of the cosmos - Twenty-Four is not a fixed number, but corresponds to the cycle of clear sound generation; the third points to the pinnacle of spirituality - Ice Crystal Clear does not describe its appearance, but reflects a soul that is clear and bright."

For Ning Zhuo, this text was simple and easy to understand; after reading it a few times, he had no more doubts. However, for safety's sake, he still used the Comprehension Brush, aided by the Luoshu page, to "look" at it once more. This time, he gained an unexpected new harvest.
