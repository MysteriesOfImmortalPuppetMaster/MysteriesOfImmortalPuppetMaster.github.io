Chapter 569: The Sound of the Void Tide

Organizing an army......

Relying on an existing cultivation nation had saved him a lot of trouble.

Without one, Ning Zhuo would have to start from scratch to organize an army, and the cost would be quite high. He had to solve issues such as military registration, discipline, authority, organization, and morale by himself.

“Even if he painstakingly organized an army, the subsequent maintenance cost would be enormous.”

“That is not an option for me.”

“Therefore, the better choice was to focus on elite mechanisms, such as Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu.”

The heavily-armored Blood Ape - Dasheng had clearly fallen behind.

The main purpose of designing this mechanical war mechanism was actually to help Ning Zhuo cultivate the Demonic Blood Vein Skill. 

The reason its defense was outstanding was that at the time, Ning Zhuo spared no expense, leveraging multiple forces and using a large amount of precious materials to make it.

In terms of design, it could only be considered below average.

In the two national battlefields, the heavily-armored Blood Ape - Dasheng became a meat target, attracting so much fire that almost every time it appeared in battle, it ended up being scrapped, and could be called high-grade cannon fodder.

There was no helping it; in such large-scale battles, even the material of the heavily-armored Blood Ape - Dasheng appeared weak.

As for the Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu, it had repeatedly achieved military merit. After all, its design scheme was far superior to that of the heavily-armored Blood Ape - Dasheng.

Its different positioning made it easier for it to achieve military success.

But its shortcoming was that its materials were not good enough.

“I needed to redesign the mechanical body for Yuan Dasheng; this time, I must ponder it carefully and strive to reach a top-level design.”

“Meng Yehu’s design could be retained. Taking this opportunity of scrapping and overhauling, I could just replace it with better materials for reconstruction.”

Ning Zhuo quickly finalized the plans for Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu.

Although he had preserved many battle merits without redeeming them, he still had a lot of precious materials on hand.

The reason for this was Tian Shuang.

Under the influence of Buddha’s Thoughts, Tian Shuang voluntarily gave almost his entire estate to Ning Zhuo.

This powerful ghost cultivator had long been famous among the nations, and his estate was extremely abundant.

Even though the main materials were related to the Ghost Path and Soul Cultivation, there were still plenty of conventional precious materials, reaching the Nascent Soul level, that could be used for Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu.

However, even after the plan was set, Ning Zhuo first directly repaired the heavily-armored Blood Ape - Dasheng and the Shadow Blade - Yehu according to their original forms.

Relying on the Nascent Soul-level mechanical pedestal, even if these two mechanisms were scrapped, they could still be quickly remolded.

After the Two Note Nation War, Ning Zhuo had changed enormously. Especially in the aspect of being vigilant in times of peace.

He preferred to spend a little more money to quickly repair Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu to ensure his own combat strength.

Who knew whether an accident might occur in the next moment, and whether that accident would be fatal?

After repairing these two war mechanisms, Ning Zhuo again possessed two great Golden Core level battle forces, and he felt much more at ease.

As for those ordinary mechanical mechanisms, Ning Zhuo did not make them.

His military position would soon be abolished, and the formation of a mechanical army would be canceled.

In such a case, if he displayed so many mechanical mechanisms, it would be like a beast-tamer summoning a large number of demon pets.

Ning Zhuo’s military tactic of the Hero's Return would hardly be effective.

Therefore, even if these mechanical mechanisms served as cannon fodder, they turned out to be extremely cost-inefficient.

“When I faced conflicts, it was mainly with individual strong opponents. These mechanical mechanisms were too ordinary; once released, they could easily be pierced by strong opponents, implementing a decapitation tactic against me.”

“In addition to occupying my divine sense in controlling these mechanisms, they had almost no offensive capability.”

Ning Zhuo, pragmatic and flexible, immediately adjusted the general direction of mechanism production, shifting from scale and quantity to producing elite individuals in order to achieve a higher standard in quality.

Ning Zhuo focused his next efforts on the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor.

This treasure-level mechanical war armor had performed astonishingly in the grand battle—Ning Zhuo had repeatedly resisted Xiang Yue with it.

The upper half of the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor was already scarred and cracked, needing delicate repair.

“If I relied solely on my own ability, I could not repair the upper half of the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor. Fortunately, I had the mechanical pedestal.”

Ning Zhuo’s own cultivation was too weak, only at the Foundation Establishment stage, and it was difficult for his meager spiritual power to do much for a Nascent Soul-level treasure.

The mechanical pedestal allowed him to reach realms beyond his own ability.

This was the essence of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation!

By now, the entire cultivation world was thriving, and the exquisite techniques of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation allowed cultivators to transcend cultivation levels and sects, accomplishing things they could not do on their own.

“Repairing the upper half of the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor should pose no problem.”

“But its lower half needed a better restoration!”

The lower half of the current Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor was just a roughly made imitation by Ning Zhuo.

It was also Ning Zhuo’s luck.

During the previous grand battle, this weakness had not been discovered. The vast majority of cultivators were caught up in their own skirmishes, too busy to pay attention.

The timing of Ning Zhuo’s participation in the battlefield was also very good, and he never attracted too much attention.

After he joined forces with Mu Lan and Liu Guan Zhang, for a long time he enjoyed a local advantage.

The mechanical Dragon weaved through the void.

“What was that sound?” Sun Lingtong suddenly had a jolt and quickly contacted Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo, buried in the mechanical pedestal and meticulously repairing the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor, immediately looked up after receiving the transmission.

The attentive big-headed youth listened carefully for a moment, then looked puzzled: “I didn’t hear anything.”

Sun Lingtong exclaimed, “You didn’t hear? Strange! The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon did not detect anything either. But I indeed heard a series of hissing sounds, as if the tide was surging.”

“This sound kept ringing and grew louder. Could you really not hear it?”

Ning Zhuo subconsciously fumbled for the mechanical ring on his finger, but it showed no reaction.

However, Ning Zhuo was not complacent and frowned slightly, “Boss, our understanding of the void was only half-baked. My mechanical ring had only inherited a bit of talent.”

“To be safe, we should return to the mortal realm first.”

“We weren’t in a hurry anyway; there was no need to stubbornly face the risk.”

Sun Lingtong nodded, “You’re right, Little Zhuo, let’s slip out first.”

Thus, the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon departed from the void and returned to the present world.

In the present world, it was morning.

A light snowfall had just stopped not long ago.

The uninhabited mountains were draped in an elegant white veil. In the distance, the mountain peaks were clad in silver, their outlines distinct, as if a beautiful painting had been frozen in time—quiet and profound.

The pine trees stood tall, with icicles hanging from their branches. Sunlight shone through the clouds, casting mottled shadows of the trees.

The surroundings were serene, with occasional bird calls echoing through the vast valleys, like a clear melody, which only accentuated the stillness of winter.

Sun and Ning looked at this beautiful scenery, exchanged glances, and all left the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, stepping out into the open.

Although the interior of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was not cramped, it was ultimately an enclosed space, and staying inside for a long time indeed made people feel stifled.

The two brothers, once outside, simultaneously took a deep breath and felt their hearts refreshed.

“According to our route, this should be the border of the Northern Wind Nation,” said Sun Lingtong.

Ning Zhuo nodded, “It should be.”

The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was produced by the Lava Immortal Palace and had no record of traveling. Although Ning Zhuo had been collecting maps during the period in Two Note Nation, the maps he held often deviated from the actual situation.

The more detailed the map, the higher its value, and the less circulated it was in the market.

Moreover, Two Note Nation and the North Wind Nation were two different cultivation nations. Additionally, since Sun and Ning had been escaping through the void, they had very few references for the present world.

Therefore, they could only roughly estimate their position based on climate and topography.

This awkwardness was mainly because they had only just begun to travel the world. Once they had visited more places and recorded them precisely in the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, they could deduce the locations of many unfamiliar places.

“North Wind Nation……” Sun Lingtong gazed into the distance at the snowy peaks and said, “Little Zhuo, didn’t the Ning family originate from this nation?”

Ning Zhuo nodded, “This was our homeland. Many of the elders in the family often reminisced about their lives in the North Wind Nation.”

“However, for me, having been born on the move and living in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, I could not empathize with their homesickness.”

“Speaking of which, we had already been traveling for several months.”

“But I felt as if we had only left the Fire Persimmon Immortal City yesterday,” Ning Zhuo lamented.

This snowy scene, on the contrary, stirred a bit of his mild nostalgia for Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

They did not stay there long; after two shi, they set off again, boarding the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to vanish into the void.

“There is no sound now.” Sun Lingtong listened carefully and gradually relaxed, “Perhaps it was just my hallucination.”

Ning Zhuo frowned slightly and shook his head, “Boss, don’t forget, you were the one who absorbed the Evil void God Bone Marrow. You might be hearing sounds that I couldn’t, possibly because of that.”

“In any case, we must be cautious.”

Sun Lingtong nodded, “Mm! If any sound appears next, I won’t notify you first; I will immediately control the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to return to the present world.”

“Alright.” Ning Zhuo nodded, and the two reached an agreement.

After this incident, the division of labor between Sun and Ning changed once again.

Previously, they had equally divided their time, one keeping watch while the other cultivated.

Now Sun Lingtong primarily stayed at the dragon head cabin, while Ning Zhuo mainly focused on his cultivation.

Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu’s new bodies were still under consideration, and the upper half of the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor had already been properly repaired.

Previously, in Two Note Nation, he mainly used the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat to increase his body foundation. Now, Ning Zhuo had shifted his focus in cultivation to the three supreme methods.

With the help of the Three Palaces Treasure Merging Talisman, the rate at which precious pills grew in his three dantians was extremely fast.

“At this pace, the stage of precious pill growth would quickly reach its final phase.”

“After that stage, I would enter the mid-Foundation Establishment period.”

Ning Zhuo estimated the progress, his mind as calm as a still lake.

There was no significant qualitative change during the early, middle, and late stages of Foundation Establishment, and Ning Zhuo himself did not have high expectations.

But the theme of cultivation was precisely one of gradual accumulation; without accumulating step by step, how could one eventually form a Golden Core?

Besides focusing on the progress of the three supreme methods, Ning Zhuo had not forgotten the accumulation of his body foundation.

He mainly relied on the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.

After the Two Note offensive battle, Ning Zhuo had deepened his understanding of body cultivation. A strong body foundation was very important; having a relatively high baseline greatly increased one’s chance of survival on the battlefield.

And figures like Lord Long and Xiang Yue, who easily stirred up the battlefield, all possessed extremely strong body foundations.

But for Ning Zhuo, reaching the level of Lord Long and Xiang Yue was extremely, extremely difficult.

It required opportunity, and the use of treasures like the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat. Compared to Lord Long and Xiang Yue, it required even more sacrifice!

This was because Lord Long and Xiang Yue’s cultivation methods focused on cultivating the flesh, mainly emphasizing the lower dantian’s essence sea.

Ning Zhuo’s three supreme methods were cultivated in all three seas, and the Demonic Blood Vein Skill was more about control, so the accumulation and enhancement of his body foundation could not compare to that of Lord Long and Xiang Yue’s methods.

“Although at present, the effect of body cultivation was still considerable, the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat could not continue indefinitely. There would come a day when its cultivation effect would decline, until it diminished to zero.”

Using cultivation methods to train the flesh was, on the one hand, cheaper, and on the other hand, more stable than using precious materials, treasures, and so on.

The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat had greatly helped Ning Zhuo!

In the second grand battle, one of the biggest contributors behind Ning Zhuo’s high combat power was the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.

In addition to advancing his cultivation methods and body cultivation, Ning Zhuo embarked on a third aspect of cultivation, namely the cultivation of his soul.

The battle between the Heavenly and Earthly Twin Ghosts made Ning Zhuo deeply aware that his lack of a solid soul foundation was a major weakness; thus, if he were targeted, his situation would become extremely dangerous.

It was said that Ning Zhuo had experienced a short period in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City where his soul foundation had grown.

He first used the Soul Devouring Technique, and then he himself cultivated a spell called the Ghost Martial Divine Weapon Forging Method. This method could consume soul power, sever parts of the soul, and forge ghostly weapons.

Thus, when Ning Zhuo left the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, his soul foundation was nearly two hundred times that of a normal person, and he had forged a ghost ax about the size of a door panel as his accompanying Soul Martial Weapon.

Such a soul foundation was already remarkable among his peers, or even at the Foundation Establishment stage.

But at the Golden Core level, it was completely insufficient.

When facing the Heavenly and Earthly Twin Ghosts, it was as good as “nothing.”

In Tian Shuang’s storage bag were the main cultivation methods of both him and Di Gui. The two were from the Soul Devouring Sect, one of the holy places for soul and ghost cultivators. Naturally, their methods were excellent.

In his spare time while arduously cultivating, Ning Zhuo browsed and contemplated these methods.

It was impossible for him to cultivate further.

The three supreme methods already covered the three major dantians; cultivating other methods would be tantamount to courting misery, or even self-harm, or suicide.

Understanding the essentials and secrets of soul cultivation would greatly help him in the future when using some treasures or materials for soul cultivation.

“Speaking of which, Black Water Mountain and White Paper City was a city of soul cultivation.”

“When I went there, in addition to obtaining the divination of the Mournful Ghost Lyre, I could also trade some soul cultivation materials or treasures to make up for my soul weakness.” Ning Zhuo planned to himself.

Tian Shuang’s estate was too high-end; Ning Zhuo, currently only at the Foundation Establishment stage, needed a lot of basic soul materials.

One day later.

Sun and Ning voluntarily slipped out of the void, returned to the present world, and after patrolling the nearby area for a while, they successfully found their target.

Frost Howl Valley!

Like the Flame Star Pit, it was also one of the world’s wonders.
