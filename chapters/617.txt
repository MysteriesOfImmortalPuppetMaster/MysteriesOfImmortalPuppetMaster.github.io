Chapter 617: Yang Sanyan, the Arrogant One

The yin wind howled, carrying countless ghostly figures.

A dense miasma of yin energy enveloped the city's defenses, severely disrupting the divine sense of the defending cultivators and restricting their vision to a mere three zhang ahead.

Big-Headed Ghosts, Small-Headed Ghosts, Hanging Ghosts, Soul-Hooking Geckos, and more soared on the wind or scaled the city walls, relentlessly assaulting the ramparts.

"Hold the line! Hold the line!"

"Father!"

"Die, you damn ghosts!"

"Don't push too far forward!"

"Form ranks! Form ranks!"

"Aaaah!"

The cacophony of battle cries, commands, screams, and furious roars wove together into a grim anthem of the Yang Realm's living defending their homeland.

The endless, brutal, and numb Ghost Tide clashed with the courage, valor, and sacrifices of the living - two invisible forces locked in a deadly dance, their fates intertwined.

Tie Guzheng, commander of the City Guard, coordinated the city's defenses. Reports from each sector arrived in succession, his face hardening with each update.

This Ghost Tide rivaled the final stages of past invasions, its scale surpassing all historical records. Had the White Paper City Lord not offered exorbitant bounties to recruit every able-bodied warrior from the surrounding villages and towns, White Paper Immortal City would have already fallen.

"Even so, our casualties are mounting rapidly..."

"Worse still, a highly trained and disciplined army of Yin Soldiers lurks beyond the battlefield, watching with predatory eyes!"

"And what about our forces?"

Even Lian Tiegu and the City Guard couldn't be considered true Cultivation armies.

The only force in the entire city that could barely qualify was the Qing-Jiao Army.

In stark contrast, the defenders' true reliance remained on the White Paper Immortal City itself!

Thud... Thud... Thud...

The earth trembled as a shadow darker than the night, as massive as a small mountain, emerged from the depths of the dense Yin Tide.

It crashed through the curtain-like yin wind, trampling low-level ghost mists that couldn't escape its path, and lumbered toward the city gates with its ponderous, towering frame.

"Dead Bone Giant!" Tie Guzheng leaped to his feet, his entire body tensed.

The alarm bells of the White Paper Immortal City rang out!

Countless black and dark gray bones intertwined and fused together, forming a colossal monstrosity.

Each bone was thick, gnarled, and weathered, eroded by the passage of time and the corrosive influence of yin energy.

With every step, the ground shuddered as if struck by a massive hammer, the thunderous impacts echoing across the battlefield.

Though its gait was slow, its strides were immense. In just a dozen steps, it stood before the city walls.

The towering fortifications barely reached its neck.

The cultivators atop the walls found themselves eye-to-eye with the giant's gaping maw and cavernous nostrils.

Boom!

The Dead Bone Giant raised its palm and slammed it against the city wall.

The once-immovable wall shuddered violently, then crackled like tearing paper. Cracks spiderwebbed across its surface, spreading rapidly.

Boom! Boom!

The giant struck twice more.

The violent tremors rippled through the wall and into the surrounding area, shaking the defending soldiers off their feet.

The ghostly creatures fared even worse. Caught between the Dead Bone Giant's onslaught and the White Paper Immortal City's defenses, nearly all were annihilated.

"We can't let it continue this rampage!"

Determined, Tie Guzheng personally charged forward, wielding an iron fan taller than himself. He lunged at the giant's face, initiating direct combat.

Though only at the Golden Core stage, the Dead Bone Giant displayed Nascent Soul-level combat prowess within the Ghost Tide.

Tie Guzheng, also at the Golden Core stage, possessed comparable strength. As commander of the City Guard, he could channel the White Paper Immortal City's power with every movement, making him a formidable opponent.

The two clashed for nearly ten rounds, neither gaining the upper hand.

"We're here!"

"Charge with me!"

The Qing-Jiao Army arrived, Qing Chi still leading the charge.

The army swept across the wall like a whirlwind, slaughtering ghostly creatures in droves and inflicting heavy casualties.

Once again, Qing Chi became the center of attention, basking in the glory of her performance.

The more she fought, the more invigorated she became. The Military Heart she had cultivated had evolved into a Military Seed, granting her constant awareness of the Qing-Jiao Army's overall condition.

"The Paper Armor Technique and Yin Crossing Technique are truly invaluable."

"Little Ma really knows his stuff. He chose the perfect path for us right away."

"Vigorous Yang Manor is practically defunct now. When will he return to fight alongside me?"

Even amidst the battle, Qing Chi's thoughts raced like lightning as she missed Jiao Ma.

Far away, the Vanguard General of the Underworld Army grew restless.

The dense Yin Tide couldn't block his gaze.

He surveyed the battlefield: Tie Guzheng was holding off the Dead Bone Giant, Qing Chi was clearing the surrounding area, and the White Paper Immortal City was regaining its footing thanks to the combined efforts of the two warriors and their army.

This was the Ghost Tide's strongest point!

From here on, the Ghost Tide's offensive would gradually weaken.

"Flying Spear Ghost General," the Vanguard General suddenly commanded.

A Ghost General immediately stepped forward from the ranks to his left.

"This subordinate awaits your orders!" the Ghost General saluted.

The Vanguard General reached into the pen holder on his desk, selected three Military Tokens, and tossed them to the Flying Spear Ghost General.

"I grant you three units of military power," the Vanguard General commanded. "Spare no effort in your attempt to kill even Tie Guzheng."

"This subordinate obeys."

The Flying Spear Ghost General grasped the three Military Tokens and immediately left the Vanguard General's tent, ascending the high platform in the plaza.

He stood tall, gazing intently for a moment before drawing a Magic Artifact spear. With a flourish, he hurled it into the wind.

Whoosh!

The spear sliced through the raging yin wind with unstoppable force. In the blink of an eye, it hurtled toward Tie Guzheng's head.

Tie Guzheng's eyes widened in fury. With every ounce of strength, he raised his iron fan.

Clang!

Sparks and golden light erupted as the spear struck the fan. The ear-splitting metallic clang made the surrounding cultivators wince.

The spear pierced through the fan's ribs. Tie Guzheng tumbled backward, rolling three times before scrambling to his feet, his face pale with shock. He had narrowly escaped death.

Seeing Tie Guzheng now on guard, the Flying Spear Ghost General sighed inwardly. He retrieved another Magic Artifact spear.

Channeling his Golden Core energy and expending a second Military Token, he unleashed another full-powered throw, amplified by the Military Power Amplification.

This time, the long spear wasn't aimed at Tie Guzheng, but at Qing Chi.

Tie Guzheng sensed grave danger. "Damn it, he thought, this flying spear is both immensely powerful and treacherously elusive. I only detected it when it was right in front of me."

"If there's a second shot, how will the others defend themselves?"

With that thought, Tie Guzheng immediately ordered, "Quick! Get the Qing-Jiao Army off the wall!"

But it was too late.

The second flying spear had already traversed multiple li, hurtling toward the wall to shatter Qing Chi's skull.

Unaware of the danger, Qing Chi was still fiercely engaged in battle!

Just as her life hung by a thread, a gray-white bone staff materialized out of thin air and struck the spear's side.

The spear's trajectory veered wildly off course. By the time it reached the city wall, it had deviated so severely that it pierced the air, soaring over White Paper Immortal City and vanishing into the distant horizon.

The violent collision between the staff and spear erupted with such force that it shattered the surrounding yin energy, creating a tremendous shockwave that drew the attention of many nearby cultivators.

Yet Qing Chi remained oblivious, still engrossed in her fight.

Qing Yan, who had been protecting Qing Chi, nervously glanced around.

The Flying Spear Ghost General's pupils constricted as he immediately used his last Military Token, channeling its power into the third flying spear.

His throwing motion was even faster than before.

This time, his target remained Qing Chi!

However, before the third spear could travel even half a li, it inexplicably vanished mid-air, as if it had never existed at all!

The Flying Spear Ghost General's face twisted in disbelief and shock.

Having failed to kill the enemy with all three spears, he reluctantly braced himself and returned to the main camp to report.

The atmosphere inside the command tent was markedly different from before.

The Vanguard General showed no anger toward the Flying Spear Ghost General, his expression icy. "White Paper Immortal City has received reinforcements. You are pardoned this time."

He dismissed the Ghost General with perfunctory instructions to rejoin his unit, his attention focused entirely on the spot where the third spear had mysteriously disappeared.

The appearance of the bone club was one thing, but what truly concerned the Vanguard General was the reason behind the spear's vanishing act.

The event had unfolded too quickly for him to discern any clues.

The Dead Bone Giant opened its massive maw, unleashing a surging wave of Death Qi.

Tie Guzheng unfurled his iron fan, unleashing a gale of metallic wind.

The two forces collided, weakening the Death Qi wave by eighty percent, yet it still surged over the city wall.

The Death Qi wave struck Tie Guzheng, sending him staggering back dozens of steps until he crashed into the city gate tower.

With no further obstacles, the Dead Bone Giant suddenly lowered its head and charged, slamming its shoulder against the White Paper City Wall.

The wall buckled under the impact, its surface warping like a thick stack of paper twisted violently, bulging inward into the city.

The sight sent shivers down the spines of the witnessing cultivators.

The Dead Bone Giant retreated, preparing for a second assault.

"No!" Sensing imminent danger, the cultivators frantically attacked, but their strikes proved futile, barely scratching the giant's bone-armored hide.

At that critical moment, a scroll materialized mid-air, unfurling above the Dead Bone Giant to reveal a massive character for "Suppress."

The character detached from the scroll and flew directly to the giant's forehead, branding itself deeply into its bone.

The Dead Bone Giant's aura, combat prowess, and speed plummeted, as if a giant now carried a mountain on its shoulders, its threat diminished drastically.

Then, the bone club that had appeared earlier materialized behind the giant.

The bone club suddenly expanded, growing taller than the city wall and thicker than a main pillar in the blink of an eye.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The bone club slammed into the Dead Bone Giant's back, each strike shattering massive chunks of bone. The third blow crushed its spine, causing the giant to fold in half and collapse, paralyzed.

Tie Guzheng and the others watching this scene erupted in cheers, realizing powerful reinforcements had arrived.

In the next moment, the bone club shrank and landed in the hand of a gray-robed cultivator.

He wore a white bone mask, his eye sockets sunken and empty, save for two eerie blue ghost flames. This was Bone Tomb Daoist of the Soul Devouring Sect.

Near the blank scroll, another cultivator materialized.

His face was gaunt, framed by three wisps of a long beard. His eyes crackled with electric intensity, radiating the refined aura of a scholar. It was Zhou Wenyan, the Confucian cultivator from the All-Book Pavilion.

The final figure appeared directly beside Qing Chi.

Dressed in a dark azure Daoist robe, he stood as straight as a pine tree, his hands clasped behind his back, perched proudly atop the city wall.

"Demons and monsters, how dare you invade my Immortal City!"

His jade-like face bore a tightly closed vertical mark between his brows, his eyes blazing with undisguised contempt and fury.

Supreme talent - All Under my Gaze is Emptiness!

In the next instant, the vertical mark on his forehead split open, revealing a third, vertically oriented eye.

His eyes blazed with white light - pure, unyielding, and majestic.

Wherever the white light fell, everything was erased, vanishing without a trace. No ghostly creature could withstand it; the only difference was that those with higher cultivation could resist for a few breaths before disappearing into thin air.

The vertical eye on the forehead of the three-eyed cultivator swept across the section of the White Paper City Wall, and all the ghostly creatures there vanished like smoke.

He turned and swept his gaze across the left flank of the wall. All ghostly creatures and yin winds disappeared from that section as well.

"Yang Sanyan of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Demon Subjugation Hall is here," the young cultivator announced, his voice cold and brimming with arrogance.

All the cultivators on the wall turned to look, their faces filled with surprise, shock, and awe. In an instant, their morale soared!

Qing Chi stared curiously at Yang Sanyan, who stood just a few feet away.

In the distance, the Vanguard General of the Underworld Army pondered for a moment, then sighed and ordered, "Retreat."

These three cultivators possessed astonishing power, each at the Golden Core level. But Yang Sanyan was even more extraordinary, displaying combat prowess that hinted at the Nascent Soul realm!

Yang Sanyan's vertical eye snapped shut. He turned slightly, extended his right hand, and wordlessly reached for Qing Chi.

Qing Chi's hair stood on end, and she instinctively retreated to create distance.

But in the next instant, Yang Sanyan's hand clamped down on her shoulder.

"Ghostman Clan girl, don't go running off!"

Qing Yan paled in terror and immediately dropped to one knee, signaling his allegiance.

Yang Sanyan snorted coldly. "If not for that, you'd already be dead. My brother mentioned you in his letter, along with someone named Jiao Ma."

"He told me he had sworn loyalty to Jiao Ma."

"Now he's dead!"

"How did Jiao Ma protect my brother? You're close to him - go fetch him here. He will answer for my brother's death!"

Qing Chi struggled, but Yang Sanyan swiftly subdued her completely.

Her eyes widened in disbelief. Even with the Military Power Amplification bolstering her strength, she couldn't resist him at all!

Helpless, Qing Yan gritted his teeth. "Please wait here, Lord. I will summon Young Master Jiao Ma immediately."

"Make him come pay his respects to me at once." Yang Sanyan strode away, carrying Qing Chi like a kitten. His towering frame dwarfed her petite form, making her look utterly helpless in his grasp.

Yang Sanyan strode onto the city gate tower, immediately driving away the cultivator stationed there. He planted himself in the main seat with an air of authority, casually tossing Qing Chi at his feet.

He ceased fighting, leaving Zhou Wenyan of the All-Book Pavilion and Bone Tomb Daoist of the Soul Devouring Sect to swiftly eliminate the remaining ghostly creatures.

Seeing the battle resolved, Tie Guzheng thanked Zhou Wenyan and Bone Tomb Daoist before approaching Yang Sanyan to pay his respects.

"Incompetent fool," Yang Sanyan snapped without acknowledging him. "Go oversee the city's defenses and don't bother me."

The only person he wished to see was Jiao Ma.

Soon, led by Qing Yan, Ning Zhuo arrived at the city gate tower.

Qing Yan used his divine sense to urgently warn Jiao Ma, "Remember your manners. Yang Sanyan is from the Myriad Manifestations Sect, with extraordinary power and status. More importantly, Qing Chi is still in his hands."

"Hmph, so you're Jiao Ma? Give me..." Yang Sanyan sneered, but his words were cut short.

Boom!

In the next instant, Ning Zhuo thrust both palms forward, shattering the entire city gate tower.
