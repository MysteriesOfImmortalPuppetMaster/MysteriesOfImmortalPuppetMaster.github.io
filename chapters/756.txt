Chapter 756: Reality and Illusion

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel a surge of delight.

"To actually encounter a Bronze Shield - this is quite fortunate!"

He was well-versed in the intelligence regarding the Rising Cloud Minor Trial within the Profound Armor Cave. He knew that Profound Armament Armor typically manifested as various weapons and armaments, making shields exceedingly rare.

Of course, even rarer than shields were large-scale siege weapons like ballistae and battering rams.

Ning Zhuo continued to survey his surroundings, noticing that the battle environment had also changed.

The previous three battles had taken place in spherical arenas, offering ample space for maneuverability.

Now, however, the Profound Armor Cave's Grand Formation had condensed into a narrow alleyway, drastically restricting movement. The Bronze Shield before him occupied more than half of the passage's width.

"Starting from the fourth battle, each encounter will have a specific environment."

The alleyway was as deep as a throat, its damp brick walls covered in slick moss. The end of the passage vanished into an impenetrable darkness.

The Bronze Shield shifted from stillness to motion.

It launched the first attack, a clumsy charge that swept low across the ground, aiming to strike Ning Zhuo's lower body.

"Such speed!" Ning Zhuo's pupils narrowed slightly.

The Bronze Shield moved so swiftly that it left a bronze afterimage in Ning Zhuo's vision.

Ning Zhuo retreated hastily.

The walls on either side seemed to close in as he backed away, adding to the pressure.

No room to maneuver!

But Ning Zhuo had known from the start that he only needed to buy time and establish his stance.

Left blade, right sword.

Ning Zhuo let out a low growl, and his left blade and right sword struck almost simultaneously. The blade crashed down, striking the shield's surface. The sword, moving with blinding speed, left its own afterimage as it pierced the shield's edge.

The next moment, a deafening clash of metal erupted.

The blade's force momentarily halted the shield's forward momentum, but though the sword's tip pierced the edge, it failed to penetrate further.

A violent recoil surged through Ning Zhuo's right arm. His wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm, and shoulder immediately shifted to absorb and dissipate the shock.

Ning Zhuo continued retreating, his left blade crashing down again while his right sword withdrew, regrouping for another strike.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Each strike sent sparks flying.

Through a series of slashes and thrusts, Ning Zhuo gradually neutralized the Bronze Shield's defenses.

Clang!

The blade and sword clashed violently, finally forcing the Bronze Shield back.

Ning Zhuo leaped back a step, glancing down at his weapons with a grim expression.

The bronze sword was severely worn, its blade riddled with fine cracks. The bronze knife's edge was chipped and curled.

"The bronze sword has seen the most use."

"The bronze knife, used against the shield, was at a disadvantage."

Weapons, due to their different designs and materials, naturally have inherent advantages and disadvantages against each other.

But Ning Zhuo knew the primary cause was wear and tear.

"Regular weapons wear down with frequent use. The Profound Armament Armor is no exception - in fact, it's even more susceptible."

The Profound Armament Armor could transform its shape, its materials inherently unstable. This flexibility also meant its components weren't rigidly fixed, making it less durable.

"In my previous training sessions, I practiced and studied far more than others, using the blade and sword far more extensively."

"The swords can't be used much longer; they need repairs!"

Ning Zhuo tossed the swords behind him, letting them hover in his wake. He stretched out his arms, slightly splaying his fingers.

The bronze gauntlets melted into two streams of molten copper, which poured directly into Ning Zhuo's hands before rapidly solidifying into a pair of bronze gauntlets.

Ning Zhuo swung the gauntlets, launching an aggressive assault against the Bronze Shield.

The shield was heavy and powerful, but Ning Zhuo moved more than twice as agilely as before.

His fists were naturally more nimble and fluid than swords. After all, humans are born with hands and use them most frequently in daily life.

Among the Demonic Cultivator techniques Ning Zhuo had acquired, martial arts involving fists and feet were the most abundant.

Ning Zhuo unleashed a flurry of punches, the bronze gauntlets blurring into motion as they relentlessly attacked the shield. His footwork was agile, allowing him to spring off the walls on either side, flipping and twisting to maintain momentum.

He effortlessly gained the upper hand.

This was different from before!

With his memories reactivated and his close-combat skills advancing by leaps and bounds, the gauntlets - a weapon almost instantly usable - made him like a tiger with wings.

Even though his memories and physical body were mismatched, the gauntlets themselves possessed fundamental martial techniques that constantly calibrated Ning Zhuo's movements.

"In just a couple of hours, my martial arts prowess has at least tripled compared to before the Rising Cloud Minor Trial!" Ning Zhuo thought, his heart soaring with excitement. As the one experiencing this firsthand, he felt the transformation most profoundly.

Previously, his close combat skills had been merely solid, no longer a glaring weakness. But as Ning Zhuo made significant breakthroughs in Five Elements Spells and Mechanism Art, close combat had once again become a weak point - an undeniable truth.

Now, however, his close combat abilities were undergoing a massive leap forward!

Ning Zhuo's double-fisted strike sent the Bronze Shield crashing to the ground.

Using the recoil, the shield floated upward, suddenly tilting skyward with an unnatural agility. It evaded Ning Zhuo's fists and hovered above the narrow alley.

"Not good!" Ning Zhuo looked up and saw the massive shield descending like the foreleg of a colossal beast, poised to crush him.

He immediately retreated, dodging the attack.

The shield shifted its trajectory mid-air, exploiting the alley's confined space to relentlessly corner Ning Zhuo against the wall, leaving him no escape.

Gritting his teeth, Ning Zhuo transformed his fists into palms, bracing himself to withstand the shield's impact.

Clang!

His arms buckled as if supporting a collapsing mountain.

An overwhelming, irresistible force slammed into Ning Zhuo, his knees buckling as he was forced into a half-kneeling position.

The violent impact of his knees against the paving stones shattered the tiles, leaving shallow craters in the ground.

Darkness swam before Ning Zhuo's eyes, and a metallic sweetness rose in his throat.

With a guttural roar, Ning Zhuo channeled every ounce of strength into a counterattack. He sprang from his half-kneeling stance, his body coiling like a spring compressed to its limit before exploding outward.

The Bronze Shield shifted a fraction of an inch under his assault!

Seizing the momentary opening, Ning Zhuo dodged aside and flipped into a counterattack.

But the Bronze Shield moved with newfound agility, clearly having "adapted" to Ning Zhuo's shift from blades to gauntlets and developed countermeasures.

This didn't surprise Ning Zhuo. If the gauntlets possessed such martial mastery, the Bronze Shield - being even more powerful - would naturally possess similar capabilities.

"Compared to the gauntlets, the shield makes even greater use of the environment!"

Ning Zhuo had already keenly observed the shield's superior advantage.

In this narrow alley, the gauntlets' inability to exploit the confined space would have been a disadvantage. But the shield pressed against walls, used its bulk to constrict Ning Zhuo's movements, and even leveraged its edges to ricochet between the walls, once again forcing Ning Zhuo onto the defensive.

Ning Zhuo could only barely parry, sustaining a series of injuries.

His face, however, was flushed with excitement, his heart brimming with joy. "I've got it! I've got it!"

Previously, the pressure hadn't been sufficient. The gauntlets and his Physical Body were compatible, but Ning Zhuo himself was mentally drained, torn between countless choices from his memories.

Now, the Bronze Shield's overwhelming pressure left him no time for hesitation. He had to rely on instinct, acting from the depths of his heart, unconsciously selecting techniques that resonated with his true nature.

Executing these techniques was akin to rigorous practice - grueling, relentless practice that yielded profound benefits.

He felt himself gradually merging with the gauntlets, his movements growing smoother, almost effortless.

This sense of effortless mastery was something he had never experienced with swords or blades. After all, fists and feet were far more primal, closer to instinct than any weapon.

The Bronze Shield suddenly accelerated, tearing through the air as it hurtled toward Ning Zhuo's face.

He dodged the initial strike, then kicked off the wall, spinning back to counterattack.

Channeling spiritual energy into his right arm, his muscles bulged as he swung the gauntlet in a powerful side strike against the shield.

The impact drove the shield into the wall, wedging it tightly between the bricks. In his haste, Ning Zhuo couldn't immediately dislodge it.

"An opening!" Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed with opportunity as he pressed his attack.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

A series of explosive strikes rang out, and the shield's energy rapidly weakened.

Suddenly, one side of the shield melted into molten bronze, easily breaking free from the wall's grip.

The shield whirred into a rapid spin, its body shrinking by a circle. The rim transformed into a dense series of jagged teeth.

As the serrated edge spun wildly, it radiated a chilling light, tearing through the air and slashing viciously toward Ning Zhuo.

This unprecedented transformation caught Ning Zhuo completely off guard, leaving him on the defensive.

The Bronze Shield's counterattack had been perfectly timed, exploiting the vulnerable moment when his old strength had been exhausted and his new strength had yet to surge. It was clear this had been meticulously planned.

The shield crashing into the wall earlier was just a trap!

Ning Zhuo realized in an instant that he had fallen victim to a shield's cunning scheme.

With no time to dodge, he could only raise his hands, using his palms to resist the shield's relentless cutting edge.

A shower of sparks erupted as the ear-splitting screech of metal grinding against metal reverberated through the narrow alley.

Ning Zhuo's bronze gauntlets and the shield were made of the same material, so neither held a clear advantage, allowing him to temporarily block the attack.

But Ning Zhuo's strength couldn't match the shield's sheer mass. His arms were forced apart, exposing his abdomen.

The serrated rim sliced into Ning Zhuo's abdomen, the cold metal sinking deep into his flesh. A wave of agony instantly overwhelmed him, blurring his vision.

If this continued, Ning Zhuo would likely be sliced in half.

Although cultivators from Profound Armor Cave were observing and could intervene to heal him, Ning Zhuo was undoubtedly on the verge of defeat.

One misstep had caused the situation to deteriorate rapidly, leaving him teetering on the precipice of failure.

The young man tried to evade, but the Bronze Shield had deliberately maneuvered him, forcing his back against the wall and trapping his waist against its serrated edge, leaving him no room to escape.

Some of the observing cultivators gasped at the sight.

Just as Ning Zhuo was about to lose, a memory suddenly surfaced with startling clarity in his mind.

A Demonic Cultivator parried an opponent's blade strike with his sword. The sword's spine suddenly "sensed" the downward shift in the enemy's blade force, indicating an impending sweeping motion.

With a subtle twist of his wrist, the Demonic Cultivator tilted his sword, guiding the enemy's sweeping strike half an inch outward. The deflected blade left an opening, which the Demonic Cultivator exploited with a swift counterattack, piercing his opponent's heart with a single thrust!

"Demonic Cultivator, give me back my wife and children's lives!" the enemy roared, his fist driving straight forward.

The Demonic Cultivator met the blow with his palm. The moment they connected, he sensed that the enemy's punch lacked follow-through and his center of gravity was slightly off-balance.

Instantly shifting his stance, the Demonic Cultivator guided the enemy's fist backward like a swimming fish, simultaneously sidestepping to evade the line of force.

The enemy's fist struck empty air, his momentum carrying him forward as his center of gravity was further destabilized. Seizing the opportunity, the Demonic Cultivator lowered his shoulder and delivered a brutal elbow strike, slamming into the vulnerable gap beneath the enemy's ribs.

Thud!

The enemy collapsed, blood gushing from his mouth.

"I treated you like a brother, and this is how you repay me?! In this battle, only one of us will leave alive!"

The Demonic Cultivator's short halberd locked against his opponent's hooked claws, their weapons locked in a stalemate of brute force.

Suddenly, the Demonic Cultivator sensed his opponent preparing to unleash his Force, aiming a knee strike at him.

Seizing the opportunity, the Demonic Cultivator abruptly relaxed his grip and withdrew his strength, simultaneously ducking low and sidestepping.

The enemy's explosive knee strike missed its mark, throwing him off balance. The Demonic Cultivator seized the moment, freeing his halberd with a swift upward sweep that pierced through his opponent's jaw and into his skull.

The memories flooding Ning Zhuo's mind eerily mirrored his current predicament.

Without hesitation, he acted on instinct, gripping the Bronze Shield's upper and lower edges, immediately sensing the shifting forces within it.

"Guide the momentum!"

A sharp glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he twisted his wrist, pressed his body against the wall, and flipped upside down like a windmill. Using the shield's rotational force to propel his own spin, he deflected the shield's trajectory.

The Bronze Shield slammed deep into the wall, freeing Ning Zhuo from his confinement!

Danger averted!

The watching cultivators exhaled in relief. None wanted Ning Zhuo eliminated so early; they eagerly anticipated his clash with Ban Ji.

"Ning Zhuo's injuries are severe - his intestines are exposed!"

"Even though he's free, he's still in grave danger."

Many held their breath for Ning Zhuo.

His face was deathly pale from blood loss. He pressed one hand tightly against the gaping wound in his abdomen, trying to keep the flesh aligned, while raising his other hand to face the Bronze Shield's relentless assault.

Surrounded by peril, Ning Zhuo repeatedly rolled across the ground, retreating step by step, dodging and evading, completely on the defensive.

Yet his resilience shone through. Though the scene was desperate, he refused to fall.

"Hmm?" Gradually, some cultivators began to show surprise, their keen eyes detecting Ning Zhuo's sudden improvement.

"He's breaking through in the heat of battle! He's suddenly grasped the essence of martial arts - the interplay between the real and the illusory!"

"Ning Zhuo can now sense the shifting forces within the Bronze Shield's feints, keenly detecting the subtle changes and predicting its next move!"

"It's as if he had 'foresight' and prepared his defenses in advance. That's why, even with only one hand to defend, he managed to hold out."

"Is this what it means to be a genius?"

The crowd exchanged silent glances. Some had previously dismissed Ning Zhuo's last-minute training as futile, but now they witnessed his astonishing progress and remarkable achievements unfold before their very eyes.

"I only gained enough experience in my sixties to 'sense' the shifts in force and feel truly one with my weapon!"

"And how old is Ning Zhuo?"

"His comprehension is terrifying! Just a while ago, his martial arts skills were still so rudimentary."

Cultivator Hao, drawn by the spectacle, sighed sincerely, "Geniuses defy all conventional logic."

His words struck a chord with the crowd, plunging them into silence.

Bitterness, helplessness, resentment, and even envy... a complex mix of emotions stirred in the cultivators' hearts.

When they considered their own painstaking years of accumulation and then witnessed Ning Zhuo's performance, the comparison was enough to drive anyone mad with frustration.

A moment later,

Clang.

Ning Zhuo slammed his fists down, smashing the Bronze Shield to the ground.

He stomped his foot heavily, pinning the shield in place, and swiftly began refining it.

Panting heavily, his robes stained with blood, Ning Zhuo's eyes shone with exhilaration, his spirit soaring.

"Having access to vast amounts of others' memories has spared me the long, arduous process of accumulation and practice."

"For me, this kind of real combat is the most valuable experience!"
