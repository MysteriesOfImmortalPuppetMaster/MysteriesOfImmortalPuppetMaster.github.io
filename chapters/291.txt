Chapter 291: Wait, the Mechanical Ape in the Trial Room?!

"Isn't it the mechanical ape we encountered in the trial checkpoint?!" "Why is it appearing here?"

"It's being controlled by Sun Lingtong, which means we've been set up by the scoundrels of the Void Sect all along?!" The reformation team members who entered the second round of the palace examination were shocked beyond words.

Some were so enraged that they cursed Sun Lingtong loudly.

Too treacherous!

Too cunning!

Such a despicable villain!!

Who in the reformation team hasn't been tormented by the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng? Even Ning Zhuo, the true master of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, has played along many times.

In short, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng is a sore spot for the reformation team, a shadow, an object of countless gritted teeth.

To deal with the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai, the three reformation teams once joined forces for a major campaign.

It was unsuccessful!

The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng brought too much failure, too much humiliation, too many setbacks.

Previously, everyone thought it was just one of the mechanisms in the trial checkpoints.

This understanding made it easier for everyone to accept psychologically.

After all, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng originated from the three sects' masters, and it was understandable that everyone lost to such a Void Refining powerhouse.

But now, with Sun Lingtong openly using the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, everyone suddenly realized—we weren't defeated by a Void Refining powerhouse, but were tricked by the scoundrels of the Void Sect!

And tricked so many times.

If not for the second round of the palace examination, we would have been kept in the dark forever.

At this moment, this kind of suffocation and resentment couldn't be washed away even with the waters of three rivers!

"Curse you, Sun scoundrel!"

"I curse you Void Sect people, may your sons be born without anuses!!" "Not fit to be human, simply not fit to be human!"

Sun Lingtong became the most glaring presence in the main hall square. Countless pairs of fiery eyes stared at him.

Ineffective curses and insults poured down like a torrential rain.

At first, Sun Lingtong was a bit uncomfortable. Later, he found it quite enjoyable.

"Savor it carefully, it's quite thrilling."

"Hehe!"

"I just love seeing you hate me yet unable to defeat me."

"Ah, yes, it's me defeating you instead."

"Hehe..."

Sun Lingtong was smug, shaking his head, his small face flushed with excitement.

After using the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, he immediately started a terrifying winning streak. Even Zhu Xuanji and others were consecutively defeated by him.

The most frustrated person was none other than Meng Chong.

"Argh! Vile scoundrel, to toy with us to such an extent, I, the great one, will twist your head off and use it as a ball!" "I'm so furious, so furious!!"

Meng Chong roared repeatedly, yet could only watch as his mechanical puppets, without the advantage of numbers, were brutally ravaged by the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

Past memories resurfaced, turning into slaps that struck his face one after another.

Too painful!

This humiliation was truly excessive for a proud son of heaven like him.

Meng Chong was so angry that his face turned red, his hair stood on end, and he rolled up his sleeves, ready to rush to the central area to personally confront the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

In the end, an invisible force firmly blocked him.

Sun Lingtong didn't forget to add insult to injury.

He extended his little finger, picked his ear, and looked at Meng Chong with disdain: "Little weakling, what are you shouting for? Haven't I tormented you enough?" In an instant, the struggling Meng Chong froze.

Then, his eyes filled with blood, and he seemed about to explode, roaring to the sky with a deafening shout.

"I'll defeat you, I'll defeat you!!" Meng Chong was so angry he lost his mind.

No matter how the people from the City Lord's Mansion tried to dissuade him, it was useless.

Zhu Xuanji, the Book Master, and others, however, did not let anger cloud their judgment.

"Rather than saying I lost to Sun Lingtong, it's more accurate to say I lost to this intelligent mechanical ape." "This ape is indeed formidable. With equal cultivation, even I find it hard to resist."

"According to the information from the second round of the palace examination, the mechanical ape was brought out from the trial checkpoint, so it can be used in the palace examination." "By this calculation, the Void Sect should have another mechanical puppet that can control ghosts." At this point in the discussion, even these elites among the Golden Core stage cultivators fell silent.

Sun Lingtong had only revealed one trump card, yet he already had such a huge advantage. He hadn't even used another trump card.

"It can be foreseen that the first place in the second round of the palace examination will again be the Entry Standard!" "Fortunately, the second round of the palace examination only eliminates the last ten, so advancing to the next round isn't difficult."

"The mechanical ape came from the trial checkpoint, why didn't the reformation teams from the four forces find this reward? Is it deeper in the trial checkpoint?" Everyone kept speculating.

No one told them that there was an insider who concealed the paths of the Buddhist Gate and Demonic Gate.

With the help of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, Sun Lingtong made a big splash, immediately stopping the decline and rebounding strongly.

The reason for arranging the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng instead of the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai was mainly considered by Ning Zhuo: the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was already exposed the most, so exposing it a bit more didn't matter.

Although this mechanism was later enhanced with a lot of Foundation Establishment stage materials, it ultimately only had Foundation Establishment stage combat power, unable to stand on the stage against Zhu Xuanji and others.

It could only show off on the platform.

The Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai was different!

Although its material was also limited to the Foundation Establishment stage, it contained the Golden Core of Qi Bai from his lifetime, and if fully utilized, it had Golden Core level combat power!

Of course, if fully utilized, the mechanical body often couldn't withstand it, as it was only made of Foundation Establishment level materials. This was the biggest shortcoming of the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai that had existed for a long time.

In summary, keeping the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai and exposing the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng to secure Sun Lingtong's spot in the next round was a very wise decision.

And Ning Zhuo himself, while everyone was attracted by the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and Sun Lingtong, "stumbled" and "struggled" to "fight hard" and "difficultly" secured victory after victory.

Besides Ning Zhuo and others, the least surprised was Zhu Xuanji.

He had previously discovered the secret—Yuan Dasheng had been refined into the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

He also knew that Yuan Dasheng's corpse had fallen into the hands of the Void Sect.

Thus, the conclusion that the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng belonged to the Void Sect was naturally deduced.

However, Zhu Xuanji did not expect that the Void Sect could actually bring out the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng only had Foundation Establishment level combat power, which did not make Zhu Xuanji take it seriously.

Seeing Sun Lingtong using the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng to dominate, even defeating himself, this result made Zhu Xuanji pay more attention to another matter.

That was the clue about the golden furnace!

Among the five golden furnaces that had already been used to ruins, the first golden furnace didn't need investigation, as Zhu Xuanji already knew the inside story. The fifth golden furnace had just been investigated.

He only had the second, third, and fourth golden furnaces left.

In the dark, a premonition told him that the answers hidden beneath the ruins of these three golden furnaces were extremely important to him.

However, since the last success, the opportunity Zhu Xuanji had been waiting for had never appeared.

Although there were situations where scarlet flame beasts approached, each time they were blasted away by Ning Zhuo's early activation of the Five Elements Tower before they truly reached the Gourd Forest.

This prevented Zhu Xuanji and others from using the scarlet flame beasts to delve into the ruins of the golden furnaces.

The opportunity appeared after the fifth question.

Roar!

Accompanied by an earth-shattering roar, a massive flame lizard emerged from the lava.

Nascent Soul level!

The second Nascent Soul level scarlet flame beast appeared in the beast tide.

Its target was directly the Lava Immortal Palace.

Meng Kui immediately took action, relying on the Immortal City Grand Formation to intercept the Nascent Soul level flame lizard.

The two sides fought for over a dozen rounds, and the fire snake that had previously fled seemed to seize the opportunity and charged over.

For a moment, Meng Kui faced two Nascent Soul level beasts alone!

He wielded four large hands of mana, blocking left and right, clearly at a disadvantage.

Boom!

The flame lizard slammed into the Lava Immortal Palace.

The previously only slightly damaged spherical light shield instantly dimmed.

The flame lizard charged again.

The spherical light shield shattered with a loud crash!

Countless scarlet flame beasts landed from all directions, storming into the Lava Immortal Palace.

The Five Elements Tower fired wildly, shells like torrential rain, pounding the flame lizard's head and neck. The relentless bombardment caused minor injuries, finally forcing it to retreat.

However, before retreating, the flame lizard swung its tail fiercely, directly breaking off a corner of the palace, causing several buildings along with the land to separate from the main body.

Then, this corner of the palace fell into the lava and quickly disappeared completely.

Such a heavy blow caused the dragon turtle fire spirit to let out a miserable cry in the main hall!

Chaos erupted in the Lava Immortal Palace.

This was the first time such a large number of scarlet flame beasts had flooded into the palace.

Although the spherical light shield was soon restored, blocking further beast landings, the scarlet flame beasts that had entered were already a huge threat that needed to be quickly eliminated!

Cultivators fought with all their might, battling everywhere.

During the battle, due to a small accident, someone discovered that the palace's restrictions were also damaged, creating a loophole.

As long as one was a Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment stage cultivator, even without mechanical expertise, they could enter and exit the palace!

This was absolutely impossible before. Mechanical expertise had to meet the standard.

"The opportunity has come!" Zhu Xuanji felt a mix of emotions.

On one hand, the opportunity he had been waiting for finally arrived. On the other hand, with a corner of the Lava Immortal Palace collapsed, the cost of repairing such a significant loss would undoubtedly be enormous!

This forced the dragon turtle fire spirit to contact Ning Zhuo again: "L-little master, bombard the golden furnace area! Let Zhu Xuanji completely give up on this!"
