Chapter 718: Exploring the Labyrinth with Void Spider Silk (Happy National Day!)

As the first to purchase Void Spider Silk, Ning Zhuo surged ahead, leaving the others in his dust.

Initially, the other cultivators continued to use their own methods to compete for the flower buds.

But as time passed, the clearly lagging group, sensing their disadvantage, began scrambling to buy Void Spider Silk.

"Give me a length of Void Spider Silk!"

"I'll take some too!"

"Too expensive! Too expensive! Can't you lower the price?"

Some gritted their teeth, others shouted, and a few even pleaded.

Hidden in the shadows, Che Zhuzi sneered inwardly: Do paupers even deserve to cultivate Mechanism Art?

He refrained from voicing his thoughts aloud. After all, even the poorest cultivators had participated in his Rising Cloud Trial and personally experienced the value of Void Spider Silk.

Even if they couldn't afford it now, they might become buyers in the future.

And even if they remained too poor to purchase it, they could still spread the word about Void Spider Silk.

The price of Void Spider Silk, of course, remained unchanged.

The cultivators who had purchased large quantities of the silk began to close the gap rapidly.

This aggressive surge forced the original leaders to abandon their own methods and reluctantly purchase Void Spider Silk as well.

Most of them used the silk to reestablish their lead.

Of course, a few individuals still managed to maintain their lead using their own methods, which proved to be just as effective as the Void Spider Silk.

These cultivators caught Che Zhuzi's attention. He observed them closely, meticulously noting each one, as they might become his future business rivals.

Che Zhuzi wasn't just using the Rising Cloud Trial to sell Void Spider Silk; he was also seizing the opportunity to scout potential competitors.

After the time it takes to brew a cup of tea, Che Zhuzi saw the situation on the field had become clear. The gap between the leaders and the rest had widened, and there was virtually no further interest in purchasing Void Spider Silk. He decisively announced the end of the round.

Ning Zhuo had undoubtedly secured first place in the second round.

Che Zhuzi was pleased with this outcome.

His impression of Ning Zhuo had improved significantly.

It was Ning Zhuo who had first purchased the Void Spider Silk with unwavering determination and enthusiasm, playing a crucial role in creating market momentum and accelerating the shift in the crowd's mindset during the second round.

"Selling this much spider silk owes a great deal to Ning Zhuo!"

As he pondered this, Che Zhuzi announced, "The next phase is a rest period. When the time is up, we will proceed to the final round."

The first two rounds had been conducted consecutively. The break before the third round undoubtedly allowed many to catch their breath and recover their spiritual energy.

Che Zhuzi activated the Formation, immediately altering the layout of the Formation Space.

A labyrinth rose from the center, its walls spreading rapidly in all directions.

The cultivators retreated, positioning themselves around the maze, their eyes filled with curiosity.

Once the labyrinth stabilized, its outermost layer was sealed off completely, leaving no entrances or exits.

Che Zhuzi then announced the rules: The cultivators must use puppet strings and suspension threads to probe the labyrinth, locate the Mystic Iron Puppets scattered throughout, and control them.

Using these puppets, the cultivators must fight their way to the labyrinth's center. When time runs out, the ten cultivators remaining in the center will be declared the victors!

Each of the ten victors will receive a 20% discount on Void Spider Silk purchases for two consecutive years.

The first-place winner will also be awarded a magic treasure.

Having experienced the second trial, the cultivators exchanged uneasy glances, momentarily speechless.

By the third trial, Che Zhuzi had abandoned all pretense of subtlety in his scheme to sell Void Spider Silk!

Some cultivators were so enraged they considered withdrawing altogether. But glancing at their peers, they quickly dismissed the idea. After all, leaving now would only benefit the others.

Having finally reached the third trial after spending a fortune on Void Spider Silk in the second trial, retreating now would mean throwing away all that money.

Che Zhuzi had thoroughly grasped the cultivators' mindset, refining the rules through countless iterations to precisely exploit their inner calculations.

Several more bundles of Void Spider Silk materialized in mid-air, this time priced at double the cost of the second trial.

A few cultivators gritted their teeth in silent frustration.

These were the rare individuals who had reached this point through their own skill and ingenuity.

But now, even they might have to succumb to the norm.

After all, the outermost layer of the maze was completely sealed off. Clearly, Che Zhuzi was forcing everyone to use Void Spider Silk to traverse the Void, bypass the outer barriers, and delve deeper into the maze.

A sharp glint flashed through Ning Zhuo's eyes as he suddenly declared, "I'll buy two strands of Void Spider Silk first."

Instantly, all eyes turned toward him.

Some glared with fiery intensity, as if to say, You big-headed fool! Even if you're a plant, at least try to act more convincingly!

Hidden in the shadows, Che Zhuzi chuckled softly. "That kid's head is indeed larger than average. His brain must be working overtime."

Ning Zhuo had carefully observed that the Void Spider Silk appearing this time was even more abundant than double the amount from the second trial.

Based on the rules of the previous two trials, it was clear that Che Zhuzi was exceptionally cunning and would never make pointless arrangements.

The sheer quantity of Void Spider Silk strongly suggested that Che Zhuzi was confident he could make the cultivators in the arena "willing" and "eager" to purchase it!

Given this, Ning Zhuo decided to take the initiative and purchase the silk immediately, rather than risk being delayed later.

After Ning Zhuo firmly bought two strands of Void Spider Silk, Che Zhuzi sent him another Jade Slip.

Ning Zhuo channeled his divine sense into the Jade Slip, and his eyes immediately lit up.

Though the content was brief, it was crucial: instructions on how to connect two strands of Void Spider Silk into a longer piece, and how to repair one strand using another.

It seems the maze will demand both long strands of silk and the ability to repair them, Ning Zhuo mused.

Seeing Ning Zhuo holding the Jade Slip, several cultivators immediately approached him with questions.

This was critical information that could help them make more informed decisions.

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly and bowed to the group. "I am Ning Zhuo. It is an honor to compete alongside you all, Fellow Daoists. Here is the Jade Slip; you may take turns reading it."

Che Zhuzi let out another soft "hmm" at the sight.

It was rare to see someone as young as Ning Zhuo possess such magnanimity.

The cultivators who had asked their questions had already mentally prepared themselves for Ning Zhuo's refusal. When he responded so graciously, their impression of him immediately improved.

"Fellow Daoist Ning, your generosity is truly admirable!"

"I, XXX, thank you."

"I am XX. After this Rising Cloud Trial, I would be honored if you would join me for a banquet!"

Ning Zhuo smiled warmly, indicating that he was open to all suggestions, his goodwill radiating.

After examining the Jade Slip, everyone reached the same conclusion as Ning Zhuo and began purchasing Void Spider Silk, each acquiring at least two segments.

Some cultivators, short on funds, could only watch helplessly, some even pacing anxiously in circles.

Others attempted to buy more segments of Void Spider Silk. Firstly, they worried that two segments might not be enough. Secondly, they harbored a darker motive: the available Void Spider Silk seemed to be limited, with no replenishment after sales.

By buying more, they would leave less for others, using their financial advantage to increase their competitiveness.

Ning Zhuo had anticipated this possibility, but he chose not to follow suit.

On one hand, Ning Zhuo felt that two strands of Void Spider Silk were sufficient. On the other hand, he pondered Che Zhuzi's temperament. It was entirely possible that the limited quantity was merely a facade, and that Che Zhuzi would replenish the supply in large quantities once a certain threshold was reached.

Thirdly, he had already expressed goodwill by offering to share the Jade Slip. Purchasing more Void Spider Silk now would contradict his previous diplomatic strategy, leaving others with the impression of hypocrisy and duplicity.

When Che Zhuzi announced the start, the cultivators acted almost simultaneously.

Countless strands of Void Spider Silk shot toward the outer walls of the central maze.

A few strands failed to penetrate the Void, colliding with the walls and collapsing limply, causing the corresponding cultivators to pale.

The vast majority of the Void Spider Silk, however, pierced through the Void, bypassing the outer walls and successfully probing into the maze's interior.

To Che Zhuzi, the maze appeared transparent.

"The outermost three layers contain no Mystic Iron Puppets."

"Beyond these layers, the trial becomes a matter of luck."

"Whoever has the best luck will encounter the Mystic Iron Puppets first, gaining a significant advantage!"

Lady Spiderweb was also watching closely.

Through her connection with Che Zhuzi, Lady Spiderweb could monitor the progress of every puppet thread at a glance.

"Keep dragging it out," she muttered.

"The longer Ning Zhuo delays, the more spiritual energy he'll expend and the worse his condition will become. That will give me the perfect opportunity to strike a decisive blow!"

"Hehehe."

"Enjoy your last moments of freedom, little boy."

"After the third trial, you'll be my dog."

Lady Spiderweb cackled at the thought.

"Uh..." Her smile froze on her face.

She saw Ning Zhuo's puppet thread be the first to encounter a Mystic Iron Puppet.

The thread paused for a split second, then, like a venomous serpent, darted toward the puppet with lightning speed.

It pierced through the puppet's body, reaching its core.

Ning Zhuo took three deep breaths, a fleeting glint of brilliance flashing in his eyes.

He swiftly seized control of the Mystic Iron Puppet.

"Hmm?" Che Zhuzi was once again surprised by this display. Mastering an unfamiliar mechanism so quickly - even though the Mystic Iron Puppet's simple design was due to cost constraints - demonstrated Ning Zhuo's exceptional skill in Mechanism Art.

"At least this kid's fundamentals in Mechanism Art are rock-solid!"

"I'm starting to like him."

"Heh heh."

As a Golden Core cultivator, Che Zhuzi naturally looked down upon Ning Zhuo, a Foundation Establishment cultivator. His reasoning was simple: the more skilled Ning Zhuo became in Mechanism Art, the more he would rely on Void Spider Silk in the future. This meant Ning Zhuo was likely to become a regular customer.

Ning Zhuo controlled the Mystic Iron Puppet, first making it move in place to get a feel for its movements. Once he was comfortable, he began to walk.

Tap, tap, tap, tap...

The Mystic Iron Puppet's pace quickened, eventually turning into a jog, then accelerating into a full run.

As they ventured deeper into the labyrinth, they encountered various obstacles.

Whether it was Poisonous Miasma, flames, or frost, each hazard damaged the ever-lengthening Void Spider Silk.

The Void Spider Silk Ning Zhuo had purchased in advance proved invaluable.

Using the spare silk, he continuously repaired the main control thread, allowing them to press onward.
