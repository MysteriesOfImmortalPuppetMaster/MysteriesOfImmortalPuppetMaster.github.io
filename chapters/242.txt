Chapter 242: Lava Assault on the City

Fire Persimmon Mountain is erupting!

The earth trembles violently, crimson flames soar like pillars to the heavens, and endless magma surges wildly.

The scorching magma draws dazzling arcs of flame in mid-air, resembling golden-red fire dragons soaring into the sky before crashing down with force.

The overwhelming magma cascades downward with a torrential momentum, threatening to incinerate everything in its path!

And Fire Persimmon Immortal City, situated on Fire Persimmon Mountain, bears the brunt of this onslaught.

"We're... doomed!"

"Why, why is Fire Persimmon Mountain erupting so violently?!" "Run, flee quickly!!"

The entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City is plunged into immense panic and chaos.

People scatter like ants, fleeing in all directions without a clear path.

Chi Han and Fei Si appear, hovering high in the sky, personally overseeing the situation and doing their utmost to stabilize the chaos and calm the populace.

The night is relentlessly pushed back by the firelight, and the air is filled with an unprecedentedly pungent sulfuric odor, making it hard to breathe!

Faced with such a natural calamity, even formidable Golden Core cultivators like Chi Han and Fei Si can't help but feel their own frailty and insignificance.

In this situation, mere Golden Core strength is utterly insufficient; trying to turn the tide is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot!

Their only reliance is the Nascent Soul!

On the mountain journey.

Meng Kui's face is illuminated by the bright firelight, and he can no longer sit idly by, his expression grave.

At this critical juncture, as the city lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he must step forward.

"Activate the Fire Persimmon Immortal City Grand Formation!"

With a resolute shout, countless emerald formation patterns immediately appear in the sky, on the city walls, and on the ground.

These formation patterns vary in thickness, crisscrossing each other with grandeur.

This is the Fire Persimmon Immortal City Grand Formation, fully mobilized.

Normally hidden, these formation patterns are only visible to the naked eye at this moment.

The countless formation patterns form walls that block the surging magma flow.

Sizzle...

The rolling magma crashes against the formation walls, halting its momentum and emitting billowing white smoke.

Unable to advance, the magma rapidly accumulates in place, gradually forming a high slope.

Under the intense heat, the emerald formation walls quickly develop cracks.

When countless cracks densely cover the walls, reaching a certain threshold, the formation walls finally reach their limit and shatter with a roar.

However, the formation walls are continuous, one after another.

Even if the foremost walls collapse, those behind them rise to take their place.

Thus, relying on the grand formation, the impact speed of the magma is finally slowed, buying precious time for the citizens within the Immortal City.

"Listen to me, everyone, don't panic!"

"The city lord has taken action; he is a Nascent Soul cultivator, we are surely safe." "No one will be harmed tonight."

Meng Kui's voice echoes throughout the city, his face as stern as iron, his voice cold and resolute, doing his utmost to reassure the populace.

After saying this, he immediately mobilizes the city guard.

The Fire Persimmon Immortal City's city guard is meticulously selected, consisting of numerous Foundation Establishment cultivators, highly skilled in group combat.

The time has come to test Fei Si's abilities!

He must quickly decide how many troops to deploy.

Fei Si thinks rapidly, grits his teeth, and dispatches sixty percent of the city guard, leaving forty percent to defend Fire Persimmon Immortal City and maintain stability within.

Chi Han rushes over, intending to lead the dispatched city guard to the front lines to counter the surging magma.

Fei Si angrily scolds, "Fool, what use is a mere body cultivator like you at the front lines?"

"You must stay and guard Fire Persimmon Immortal City. The situation is chaotic; if the Shadow Demon Cultivators take advantage of the chaos and destabilize us, leading to defeat, that would be the worst outcome."

After a brief explanation, Fei Si directly orders Chi Han to suppress the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

If any suspicious activity arises, he is to act immediately, without hesitation, and eliminate any suspicious individuals on the spot.

Although Chi Han usually clashes with Fei Si, at such a critical moment, he sets aside past grievances and accepts the order solemnly.

Fei Si's brow is furrowed, his heart heavy as if weighed down by a boulder.

Fei Si secretly calculates: with such a terrifying eruption from Fire Persimmon Mountain, even with Meng Kui and the grand formation, they can only barely hold on, resulting in a pyrrhic victory.

Fire Persimmon Immortal City is bound to suffer impact, and by then, much of the Immortal City could be swallowed by magma.

To prevent this, they must fully mobilize the city's manpower to possibly turn the tide.

Fei Si doesn't hesitate, urgently contacting Zhu Xuanji, as well as the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families, the three major cultivation families.

The city lord's mansion has always strived to maintain relations with these families, even if only superficially, investing effort and resources.

Despite recent tensions and deepening conflicts due to the emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace, Zhu Xuanji's presence has further aligned the three families against the Meng family.

But at this moment, the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City is in severe crisis, and the interests of the city and the three major cultivation families are aligned; they need to overcome this challenge together.

Upon hearing Fei Si's plea for assistance, both Zhu Xuanji and the three major cultivation families respond immediately.

Six Golden Core cultivators quickly gather around Fei Si.

Fei Si says, "The situation is urgent, so I won't say much. We need your strength to stop the magma from spreading further." "Take these command tokens; wearing them will exempt you from the suppression of the city's grand formation." With that, Fei Si hands out five command tokens to the Golden Core cultivators of the three families.

Only Zhu Xuanji is excluded, as his royal lineage renders the city's grand formation ineffective against him.

The three families' Golden Core cultivators swiftly fly out of Fire Persimmon Immortal City to the front lines.

With the command tokens, they unleash their spells without suppression, their power surging tenfold compared to the previous internal conflicts.

Ning Jiufan, clad in white robes, waves his hand, causing frost and snow to pour down, covering the magma and rapidly solidifying its surface with excellent results.

The Zheng family's two Golden Core cultivators, Zheng Dan and Zheng Shuang, both employ their signature spells, directly manipulating the magma to flow back and counteract itself.

As a cultivation family specializing in artifact crafting, the Zheng family has deep expertise in controlling flames.

The Zhou family's two Golden Core ancestors, however, don't shine as brightly as the Ning and Zheng families.

Primarily because they excel in formations, but with the city's grand formation already in place, there's no room for them to showcase their strengths.

Even so, the two Golden Core cultivators unleash their full power, and without the formation's suppression, their spells significantly curb the magma's spread.

Following them are large numbers of city guards.

Many city guard leaders receive Fei Si's transmissions, precisely positioning themselves at the formation's nodes.

In these nodes, the leaders' spellcasting abilities are greatly enhanced.

Simultaneously, they command their subordinates with increased efficiency.

Fei Si, commanding with composure, sees the city guards in position and issues unified orders.

The first wave releases the Earth Wall Technique.

The second wave follows with the Rapid Stream Technique.

The third wave employs the Mud and Wood Technique.

The sequence of spells is carefully arranged to complement each other, maximizing the effects of the previous spells.

The spells rain down like a torrential downpour, sizzling as they cover the magma.

Meanwhile, within Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the vast populace is also mobilized.

Many cultivators, to protect their home, voluntarily contribute their efforts.

Fei Si doesn't send them to the front lines but instead opens some nodes of the grand formation, allowing them to cast spells from within.

Once these spells are cast, they are immediately transferred by the grand formation to the front lines.

Fei Si demonstrates exceptional ability, assessing the situation and commanding the entire city.

At this moment, the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City stands united against a common enemy!

Though natural disasters are terrifying, all the city's cultivators believe that human effort can triumph over nature.

With countless cultivators working together, the once terrifyingly surging magma slows down more and more.

People see hope, and morale soars.

Some cultivators, after casting spells continuously, exhaust their magical power and are helped away from the nodes.

The next group is already queued up, ready to take over the vacated positions.

Those who are replaced immediately sit down, consuming pills to restore their magical power as quickly as possible.

This scene, observed by those with keen eyes, inspires admiration.

"Though Fire Persimmon Immortal City is newly built, its citizens are well-trained, possessing basic tactical skills." "Previous city lords, though they didn't repair the grand formation, organized military drills for the citizens every year." "What we see now is the result of those drills."

Such military drill policies are not unique to Fire Persimmon Immortal City but are widespread throughout the cultivation world.

The cultivation world has developed to a point where spirit energy is abundant, and there are countless talented individuals with exceptional spiritual roots.

Cultivation arts flourish like a hundred flowers, and many techniques have matured, reaching the pinnacle of resource utilization.

Countless families, sects, and alliances engage in escalating conflicts, constantly updating and optimizing their methods, ultimately giving rise to numerous cultivation nations of varying sizes.

The arms race between cultivation nations has persisted for nearly a century.

This arms race includes not only the accumulation of cultivation resources and the training of cultivators but also the military training of the broadest base of cultivators.

It can be said that nearly everyone in Fire Persimmon Immortal City is a soldier!

Now, facing an existential crisis, all the city's cultivators mobilize immediately, following the drills, each person actively contributing their part.

Even a swarm of ants, when gathered, can move mountains and overturn seas!
