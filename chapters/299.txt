Chapter 299: Love is Letting Go

The flames raged. The scorching heat distorted the atmosphere and lava boiled along the path. 

Suddenly, a Scarlet Flame Beast the size of a small mountain emerged from within! A Nascent Soul stage Flame Lizard!

It attacked from the south, fiercely slamming into the Lava Immortal Palace.

Meanwhile, from the north, a Nascent Soul level Fire Snake, with its entire body wrapped in blazing flames, opened its mouth to unleash a torrent of fire.

The scorching flames roasted the spherical barrier of the Lava Immortal Palace. 

With barrier already damaged and under the pincer attack of the two Nascent Soul stage beasts, cracks spread across it. 

The situation was extremely dire.

"Vile beasts," Meng Kui uttered coldly.

Technique — Mystery Within Learning!

Four large handprints condensed, two heading south and two north, targeting the Nascent Soul stage beasts.

The Fire Snake hissed while twisting its massive body to evade.

The Flame Lizard, however, neither dodged nor avoided; it endured the slap of the handprints as it continued its relentless assault on the spherical barrier.

The Immortal Palace swayed!

Under the fierce attack of the Flame Lizard, the closest mechanical structures collapsed one after another. 

The ground cracked, and then a corner of the Immortal Palace fully separated from the main body, collapsing into the lava below.

The lava, stirred by the falling corner of the palace, surged out with massive waves, crashing against the broken remnants surrounding the palace.

A large amount of lava spread into the Lava Immortal Palace before the spherical barrier could close, burning more structures and leaving a scene of devastation.

In the depths of the smoke and clouds, Meng Kui's gaze was deep and expressionless.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Suddenly, battles erupted within the inner circle of the Lava Immortal Palace.

The Shadow Demon Cultivator appeared once more, pursuing Yang Chanyu!

The Lava Immortal Palace, already shaken by the impact of the Nascent Soul beasts, had awakened nearly all the cultivators within.

The battle between the Shadow Demon Cultivator and Yang Chanyu immediately drew widespread attention from the cultivators.

A streak of golden light like a long rainbow cut through the sky, swiftly approaching the battlefield of Yang Chanyu and the Shadow Demon Cultivator.

Seeing this familiar light, everyone knew it was undoubtedly Zhu Xuanji!

Scarlet Flame Beasts at the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages once again formed into waves, surging towards the inner circle of the Lava Immortal Palace.

"The opportunity has come," Zhu Xuanji secretly commanded.

Thus, members of the three respecialization teams, holding positions at both the Command Platform and Five Elements Tower, collaborated to execute the order.

Under their influence, only a few mechanical constructs intercepted the beasts to prevent them from approaching the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was anxious and quickly contacted Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's second-grade position still held sway, overriding the commands of all members from the three respecialization teams.

Thus, a large number of mechanical constructs gathered towards the furnace forest while Five Elements Cannonballs rained down like a storm, continuously covering the beast tide.

However, with Ning Zhuo intentionally holding back, some Scarlet Flame Beasts still managed to break into the ruins of the Golden Furnace.

The real Zhu Xuanji suddenly appeared, following the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's exclamation, and entered the ruins of the Golden Furnace!

The previous Zhu Xuanji was not the real one but Zhu Zhen impersonating him.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't constantly monitor Zhu Xuanji as it had to bear the heavy responsibility of defending the Immortal Palace against the endless beast attacks.

Therefore, it hadn't detected the secret exchange between Zhu Zhen and Zhu Xuanji in advance.

"Young Master, Young Master!" 

"Quickly, act fast!"

"We must not let Zhu Xuanji discover any clues!"

At this moment, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit felt as if its heart was in its throat, even though it had no heart.

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, making a firm decision: "Zhu Xuanji, you forced me!"

With the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's cooperation, he fully unleashed the attack power of the Five Elements Tower. 

Five Elements Cannonballs poured down like a torrential rain; it was a terrifying offensive that completely blanketed the ruins of the Golden Furnace.

Amidst the intense bombardment, Zhu Xuanji barely managed to hold on.

He knew that at this moment, he had to race against time. With extremely limited time, he could only choose one to investigate.

The second, third, and fourth Golden Furnaces were all being destroyed along with the highly valuable clues they contained!

Zhu Xuanji hesitated for a moment but ultimately chose the second Golden Furnace.

The reason lay in the riddle poem given by Ning Zhuo.

Zhu Xuanji had only glanced at it and immediately knew the answer was "two."

Zhu Xuanji was convinced that Ning Zhuo was referring to the second Golden Furnace!

He rushed to the ruins of the second Golden Furnace, touching it with his hand, and with great difficulty, used the Origin Tracing Technique.

Under the Heaven-Piercing Eyes, he witnessed the following scene.

The door of the second Golden Furnace was open and the teleportation circle was spitting out materials.

These materials were of excellent quality, with the lowest being at the Golden Core stage and the highest reaching the Nascent Soul stage.

Among them, what caught his eye was the body of a miniature dragon. It was extremely magnificent — its entire body like a crystal sculpture, with red and orange flames shimmering within the crystal, burning silently, revealing an incredible beauty amidst the danger.

Seeing this, Zhu Xuanji's pupils contracted sharply.

Then, he saw these materials all being thrown into the Golden Furnace.

The door of the furnace closed, igniting the flames, and the roar of a flood dragon echoed from within.

The refining process was not long.

Cracks rapidly spread across the surface of the furnace. When the refining was complete and the flames extinguished, it broke apart into a pile of fragments.

From the ruins of the Golden Furnace, a small mechanical construct slowly ascended.

The construct resembled a dragon, its length only as long as an adult's forearm.

The dragon's head was fierce — its horns forked, its whiskers were naturally flowing, and its eyes were like red water, with a hint of gold.

Its entire body was covered in silver-white dragon scales, enveloped in a faint golden glow.

The dragon's claws were sharp, capable of retracting completely into its body through a certain degree of mechanical transformation.

The dragon's tail swayed nimbly, the flowing tail whiskers containing flames, often leaving a trail of fire in mid-air as it swung.

Mechanical Construct — Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon!

Zhu Xuanji quickly recognized it.

This was a very classic mechanical construct.

From the mundane level's One-Centimeter Dormant Earthworm to the Qi Refining stage's Ten-Inch Frightening Snake, Foundation Establishment stage's Hundred-Foot Coiling Python, Golden Core stage's Thousand-Zhang Coiling Flood Dragon, and finally to the Nascent Soul stage's Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.

The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon could be large or small, moved swiftly, and maintained strength, making it an excellent riding mechanical treasure.

The past image abruptly ended.

Zhu Xuanji suddenly realized!

"Ning Zhuo's hint was extremely valuable." 

"I understand now!"

"The problem lies with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!!"

Zhu Xuanji regretfully glanced at the ruins of the third and fourth Golden Furnaces, which had been devastated by the bombardment.

Zhu Xuanji could no longer hold on and had to retreat for now.

"Did he discover anything?" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely anxious.

The bombardment was so dense that it couldn't observe the situation inside.

It knew nothing about Zhu Xuanji's actions within!

The bombardment continued for a while before finally ceasing.

The original ruins of the Golden Furnace had become a deep pit, with debris scattered both inside and outside the pit.

As Zhu Xuanji expected, Zhu Zhen returned empty-handed.

The two conferred privately, with Zhu Xuanji transmitting his findings and his deductions about the palace spirit to Zhu Zhen.

Zhu Zhen was puzzled and directly asked Zhu Xuanji how he deduced this.

Zhu Xuanji sighed: "That's because you don't know the past of the Lava Immortal Palace, nor the situation of the first Golden Furnace." 

He explained to Zhu Zhen, telling him about the royal secrets he had seen in the capital.

A hundred years ago.

Fire Persimmon Mountain had just erupted. Lava covered the land, poisonous smoke shrouded the sky, and living beings were devastated. It was a scene of utter desolation.

A Sage from the Three Sects, clad in a white borrowed robe as pure as snow, his sleeves fluttering gently in the wind, slowly descended from the sky.

His face was as steady as an ancient pine, his brows filled with compassion and sorrow, and his demeanor was transcendent.

Another magnificent golden rainbow light broke through the sky, landing nearby, and transforming into a graceful and elegant woman.

She wore a luxurious golden embroidered phoenix robe, radiant and dazzling, with the edges of her attire adorned with brilliant pearls and jade, exuding a dignified and majestic aura.

The woman's phoenix eyes were filled with anger. Staring intently at the Sage of the Three Sects, her voice tinged with resentment and reproach: "You heartless man, you finally returned! Since you came to my kingdom, why didn't you come to the capital to see me? Do you know how much I've longed for you?"

The Sage of the Three Sects didn't turn his head, only gazing at the scorching land below, his tone extremely calm: "Southern Empress, many years ago, I already told you: our fate is over, it's better to forget each other in the vastness of the world."

The woman, the founding empress of the Southern Bean Kingdom, shouted angrily: "You simply say it's over, and it's over? I don't agree!" 

"Do you know how much I've missed you all these years? I even changed the name of the country to Southern Bean."

"Red beans grow in the southern land and in spring they sprout a few branches. I hope you pick more of them, for this thing is the most reminiscent...."

"My dear, I don't believe you haven't thought of me all these years!"

As she spoke, her voice paused slightly, her eyes reddening.

The Sage of the Three Sects shook his head, sighing deeply, and took out a mechanical model from his bosom.

He gently tossed it. The model flew into the air and rapidly transformed into an enormous Immortal Palace, blocking the sunlight and casting a massive shadow on the ground.

The Immortal Palace, with its red bricks and golden pillars, stood majestically and beautifully, precisely the Lava Immortal Palace!

Seeing this, the Southern Bean Empress immediately showed joy, her voice becoming softer: "My dear, you still remember our past." 

"Back then, you and I were in harmony, spending every day together, building this mechanical palace."

"You laid out the architecture, setting the foundation. And I sculpted the statues, meticulously crafting them."

"We spent such a wonderful time in this palace." 

"We can continue."

"My dear, I've already founded a nation, my wish has been fulfilled. Come back, let's live together, just like before!"

The Sage of the Three Sects always had his back to the Southern Bean Empress, not responding, only using his divine eyes to observe the Fire Persimmon Mountain below.

The Southern Bean Empress slowly floated closer, but was blocked by an invisible wall of qi.

"My dear," the empress called out, her voice filled with genuine affection.

The Sage of the Three Sects remained unmoved. His eyes suddenly fixed and his mind slightly stirred.

Immediately, the Lava Immortal Palace emitted a treasure light, piercing through the mountain and entering the depths of the lava.

The roar of a flood dragon suddenly erupted, and a Nascent Soul stage Fire Flood Dragon, in a fit of rage, charged out of Fire Persimmon Mountain.

Under the compassionate gaze of the Southern Bean Empress, the Fire Flood Dragon courageously rushed towards the Lava Immortal Palace.

It intended to crash into the palace and destroy it!

The Sage of the Three Sects gently spread his hands.

The Fire Flood Dragon, flying through the air, rapidly shrank, and by the time it reached the sage's hands, it had become a small snake, less than three inches long.

The Fire Flood Dragon struggled desperately, but could never escape the sage's hands.

The Lava Immortal Palace slowly descended, like a mountain toppling, pressing the atmosphere, producing a rumbling sound.

The Sage of the Three Sects sat cross-legged in the sky, beginning to overlook the Lava Immortal Palace.

He gently pinched the neck of the Fire Flood Dragon, extracting its soul.

"Go," the Sage of the Three Sects flicked his finger.

The Nascent Soul stage Fire Flood Dragon's soul, like a meteor chasing the moon, directly entered the first Golden Furnace.

Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra!

The fierce flames quickly burned, and after a few breaths, the Golden Furnace collapsed, refining a Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.

The Southern Bean Empress, who had been watching, was slightly stunned upon seeing the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: "It was clearly a flood dragon, why does its spirit resemble a dragon turtle?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit initially didn't understand, but upon realizing, it roared angrily at the Sage of the Three Sects.

The Sage of the Three Sects reached out and captured the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit into his palm.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was compressed to a very small size, looking up at the Sage of the Three Sects, like a mortal ant gazing at a heavenly pillar and Buddha.

The Sage of the Three Sects slowly spoke: "In eight hundred years, a calamity will sweep the world. Blood will flow like rivers, and corpses will lie everywhere." 

"Dragons and snakes will rise, kings will frequently emerge. A sage will descend, purifying the universe."

"You, the Fire Flood Dragon, are formed from the essence of countless souls buried in the volcano, combined with the endless fire poison and geothermal energy of the mountain."

"You are born with a heavy burden of sin."

"If allowed to develop naturally, you will be slain by a new king, your essence becoming material for the king, contributing your entire being to his dominion." 

"Today, I spare you once."

"From now on, you will serve as the palace spirit, controlling the Immortal Palace, and guarding Fire Persimmon Mountain."

"As long as Fire Persimmon Mountain remains peaceful, without causing harm, for seven hundred and twenty years, you will repay your innate sins, shed your turtle shell, and truly possess the spirit of a flood dragon." 

"Look."

The Sage of the Three Sects slightly raised his palm, indicating for the dragon spirit to pay attention to its former snake body.

Although it was a Fire Flood Dragon, it had immortal potential!

When its life reached the Nascent Soul stage, its immortal potential naturally transformed into a divine ability — Spirit Gathering Condensation.

This divine ability could gather spirit energy, continuously compressing it to the extreme, transforming it into solid crystals, known as spirit crystals.

The Fire Snake lineage's body was originally composed of intangible flames, but it was extraordinary from birth, continuously compressing its fire element magical power, gathering and condensing it, transforming into a solid flood dragon body.

The Sage of the Three Sects continued: "Your body is reserved for you, only you can use it."

"When the seven hundred and twenty years are up, you can use the Lava Immortal Palace to create a mechanical body, leave the cage, and roam the world freely."

After speaking, the Sage of the Three Sects gently tossed the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit into the main hall of the Immortal Palace, placing the Fire Flood Dragon body into the palace's treasury.

The Sage of the Three Sects extended his index finger, pointing towards Fire Persimmon Mountain.

The Lava Immortal Palace accelerated its descent.

Seeing the testament of her past love with the sage about to sink into the mountain, suppressing the volcano, the Southern Bean Empress couldn't help but cry out: "My dear, do you really want to do this? How cruel you are!"

"Where is your love?"

"You once said, even if you entered the Buddhist Gate, you still had love!!"

The Sage of the Three Sects clasped his hands together, chanting aloud: "Thus have I heard: the Tathagata's compassion, universally bestowing great love, pervades all realms. Great love is the source of the Buddha's heart, the blessing of all beings... If a Bodhisattva harbors great love, all under heaven are kin. No distinction of status, all beings are equal, caring without self, offering selflessly... Therefore, a Bodhisattva observes the suffering of beings as if it were their own, their heart like an ocean, compassion boundless..."

The Southern Bean Empress, full of anger, interrupted: "My dear, stop reciting!!"

The Sage of the Three Sects sighed: "This is the great love of the Buddhist Gate, not desire."

The Southern Bean Empress was furious: "I don't understand!"

The Sage of the Three Sects paused for a moment: "Love is compassion." 

After a pause, he added: "Love is letting go."

As he spoke, the Lava Immortal Palace had already sunk to the mountain top of Fire Persimmon Mountain.

"My dear!" The Southern Bean Empress gazed sorrowfully at the Sage of the Three Sects, crying out bitterly, "I can't let go!"

The Sage of the Three Sects, however, clasped his hands together, his lowered eyes seemingly penetrating a thousand years.

He softly chanted:

"Golden furnace red fire refines soul spirit, Immortal Palace buries mountain to aid all beings." 

"I urge the Southern Empress to let go of obsession, past love like smoke disperses in the dust." 

"All beings suffer from heavy desires, thinking themselves masters, puppets of their own making." 

"The Buddha's compassion is great love, letting go of heart's obstacles, the path naturally forms."

The Southern Bean Empress felt a chill in her heart, tears of despair falling. But the pride of an empress prevented her from turning away.

She gritted her teeth, unleashing her power, forcibly extracting a treasure from the Immortal Palace.

The treasure fell into her hand, revealing its true form—a mirror.

The entire mirror was surrounded by a lifelike golden phoenix, exquisitely beautiful to the extreme. It was the Golden Phoenix Mirror!

The Sage of the Three Sects was moved, for the first time slightly turning his head to look at the Southern Bean Empress.

The Southern Bean Empress gritted her teeth: "This is mine, I don't want to cooperate with you, to contribute to your compassion."

The Sage of the Three Sects, however, shook his head slightly: "Southern Empress, you were not destined to be a ruler, yet you founded a nation, relying on my Life-Hanging Thread Divine Ability."

"If you leave the Golden Phoenix Mirror, it will repay the karma. This is a good thing for you."

The Southern Bean Empress was slightly stunned, then moved: "Indeed, my dear, you still care about me!"

The Sage of the Three Sects was suddenly touched, his eyes sparkling: "I see, I see."

Saying this, he took out a treasure seal from his bosom.

This treasure seal, resembling both gold and jade, was a fusion of Buddha and demon, with a compassionate Buddha face and a ferocious demon head, extremely peculiar.

Buddha Heart Demon Seal!

The Sage of the Three Sects directly threw the treasure seal into the Immortal Palace.

The Southern Bean Empress was shocked: "My dear, how can you discard such a precious treasure? How will you protect yourself in the future?" 

"I shouldn't have acted on impulse, I'll return the Golden Phoenix Mirror, quickly retrieve the treasure seal."

The Sage of the Three Sects, however, changed his sitting posture, stood up, and before leaving, slightly turned: "The karma is set. Since you took the Golden Phoenix Mirror, in the future, protect the Immortal Palace's legacy for me."

After saying this, he floated away like a feather, his figure seemingly slow but actually swift as lightning, vanishing like a wisp of blue smoke into the nine bends.

The Southern Bean Empress was suppressed by an invisible force, unable to move, only able to watch helplessly as the Sage of the Three Sects' figure disappeared into the horizon.

Her heart was filled with despair, crying out hoarsely: "My dear—!"

Her voice was mournful, like a cuckoo weeping blood, echoing between heaven and earth, breaking hearts and souls.
