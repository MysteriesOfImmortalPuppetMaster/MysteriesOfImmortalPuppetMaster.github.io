Chapter 527: Heavenly Art Forging Sound Score

Thousand Peaks Forest.

At the edge of the battlefield.

In an uninhabited mountain valley, there was a hidden thatched hut.

Lin Bufan was sitting on a low stool made from wooden stakes in the open space before the thatched hut, leisurely sipping tea while gazing at the distant mountains under the clear sky.

A ripple ran through the air, and soon the figure of Zhu Xuanji penetrated the illusory formation and appeared before Lin Bufan.

Lin Bufan was momentarily taken aback, then promptly set his cup down.

Ever since he had been “drafted” by Zhu Xuanji and drawn into his side, the two of them had secretly established multiple camps.

This was just one of them.

Lin Bufan liked the scenery here, so he often resided in this place.

As for Zhu Xuanji, he was like a divine dragon -visible only fleetingly -and rarely lingered in these secret camps.

Lin Bufan knew full well: according to the national conditions of the Twin Rivers Nation, Southern Bean Country was inevitably closely connected with Thousand Peaks Forest. Zhu Xuanji had been dispatched here to maintain close contact with the Southern Bean-aligned forces hidden in Thousand Peaks Forest. Indeed, there were even personnel and forces directly planted by Southern Bean Country within the forest.

The matter of the Twin Rivers Nation newly forming a great army, dispatching Du Tiechuan to campaign against Thousand Peaks Forest, from the very beginning was not an internal matter of the Twin Rivers Nation, but was already entangled with other countries.

When Lin Bufan saw Zhu Xuanji coming to find him, he understood that there was an important matter that required his attention.

Sure enough, Zhu Xuanji tossed a jade slip to him.

Using his divine sense to manipulate objects.

The jade slip floated before Lin Bufan and slowly landed in his outstretched palm.

Lin Bufan swept his divine sense over it, and a strange expression immediately appeared on his face: “I didn’t expect that the first thing I had to do would still be related to that kid Ning Zhuo.”

The latest intelligence in the jade slip recorded that Ning Zhuo was marching with the army to attack the Ten Li Burning Forest.

Zhu Xuanji said, “Ning Zhuo’s safety is linked to the fate of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and therefore the implications are significant -there can be no mistakes.”

“Friend Lin, you might as well go and secretly protect him. The Three Generals’ Camp is not important; you only need to ensure Ning Zhuo’s life and freedom.”

Lin Bufan shook his head with a bitter smile, “That kid still doesn’t know that he has already been targeted by the Old Monster in the Stone and the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth.”

“The Old Monster in the Stone is suspected to be at the Soul Formation level, with extremely deep scheming and utterly mysterious whereabouts.”

“The Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth are powerful figures from the Soul Devouring Sect, renowned far and wide and known among all nations. With Ning Zhuo’s current combat strength -even with the assistance of mechanized troops -he would undoubtedly be doomed against the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth!”

“If I were him, I would definitely hunker down obediently in the frontline camp.”

Having said that, Lin Bufan picked up his cup, took a sip of tea, and sighed, “Alas, this task is not easy to handle.”

Zhu Xuanji laughed, “The Ning family and your Myriad Medicine Sect cooperate very closely, and I’ve also heard that Miss Lin from your sect is very close to Ning Zhuo.”

“Perhaps in the future, you might even become one family.”

Lin Bufan glared, “Don’t go saying things like that!”

“That kid Ning Zhuo is already married -to the heir of a nation’s top general’s mansion. Tsk tsk...”

Lin Bufan looked toward Zhu Xuanji and said with a hint of mockery, “Speaking of which, ever since Ning Zhuo appeared in Green Forest Immortal City, he has repeatedly declared in public that he has a marriage arrangement with your Zhu family. Now that he’s pulled this stunt, does your Zhu family have no response at all?”

“That kid…” Zhu Xuanji shook his head with a wry smile.

Regarding Ning Zhuo spreading such rumors, he did not refute them -not even showing any anger.

It was because in Fire Persimmon Immortal City he had deeply experienced Ning Zhuo’s ability to endure, be cunning, and disguise himself.

Seeing that he could not extract any more intelligence, Lin Bufan drained his tea and stood up, saying, “To speak bluntly, whether it is the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth or the Old Monster in the Stone, I can’t defeat them.”

“If necessary, I will abandon Ning Zhuo to save myself.”

Zhu Xuanji nodded, “Of course.”

“If Ning Zhuo is injured here, it will be his destined doom.”

“You must put your own survival first.”

“As for your current operation, and the future possible rewards, go ask Ning Zhuo for them. That kid can now sponsor the Three Generals’ Camp and the Red Flower Camp -he’s rich enough to have oil flowing.”

Lin Bufan nodded, immediately got up, left this secret camp, and hurried to the Ten Li Burning Forest.

He concealed his presence and flew at a low altitude while pondering every word Zhu Xuanji had just spoken and every change in his expression.

“I previously thought that Ning Zhuo’s marriage alliance with the Zhu family was just his boastful claim. But Zhu Xuanji didn’t deny it just now.”

“Furthermore, although Zhu Xuanji mentioned ‘destined doom,’ it made me feel that he had considerable confidence in Ning Zhuo!”

“Strange.”

“Although Ning Zhuo was highly gifted and full of potential, in such circumstances, why did Zhu Xuanji still have full confidence in him?”

Near the frontline camp of the Twin Rivers Nation.

The Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth lurked in a dark corner, as still as a mountain rock.

One after another, ghostly creatures occasionally returned to their side to give detailed reports.

“Hmm?” Suddenly, the white-clad ghost cultivator Tian Shuang raised his eyebrow slightly and immediately transmitted a mental message with his divine sense to the black-clad ghost cultivator Di Hui, “We have received news from the alliance: the Three Generals’ Camp has suddenly left the main camp and set out to campaign in the Ten Li Burning Forest.”

Di Hui immediately responded, “That kid Ning Zhuo is also among them?”

Tian Shuang said, “The intelligence did not specify that.”

When the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth returned to the frontline battlefield, they had just missed the departure of the Three Generals’ Camp.

After all, they were outsiders; apart from the results they had personally scouted, the intelligence they received was basically second-hand from the alliance. Therefore, there was a delay in timing.

Di Hui thought for a moment and said, “If Ning Zhuo continues to hunker down in the main camp, we will have no way of dealing with him.”

“Now is a good opportunity!”

“Whether he has set out with the army or not, this opportunity is enough for us to move out and investigate further.”

Tian Shuang said, “I think so too.”

“The only concern is, what if Ning Zhuo stays behind in the main camp? After the two of us leave this place, he might go out alone to harvest Ginseng Dragon Wiskers. Wouldn’t that mean we miss an opportunity?”

Di Hui thought for a moment, then shook his head immediately, “Thousand Peaks Forest contains Soul Formation Level combat power; the two of us must not split arbitrarily. Then let’s choose one option: I suggest we leave here and head to the Ten Li Burning Forest.”

“Even if we find nothing, we can still wipe out the Three Generals’ Camp, causing over half of Ning Zhuo’s forces to be depleted.”

But unexpectedly, Tian Shuang shook his head, “Not acceptable.”

“That kid Ning Zhuo is no slouch; he has hooked up with Mu Lan and become husband and wife.”

“If the Three Generals’ Camp is wiped out by us, Ning Zhuo will most likely join the Red Flower Camp. The Red Flower Camp can form battle array formations, which are much harder to deal with than the Three Generals’ Camp.”

Di Hui was stunned for a moment, then realized, “That is true. So what should we do next...?”

Before Di Hui could finish speaking, a flying message was delivered.

The Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth immediately sensed it and quickly accepted the flying message.

“Oh? Someone is interested in the Threefold Treasure we displayed, wanting to join forces to seize the treasure!”

“I did not expect that there would be three Nascent Soul cultivators, one of whom is even the Red Sleeve Immortal.”

They also attached considerable importance to this female cultivator, who possessed the mountain-moving divine ability.

With that, the scales in their hearts immediately tilted heavily in favor of staying in this place.

After all, by staying here, they would have the opportunity to obtain three heavy treasures. Even if the treasures could not be collected, if they were expelled by the main force of the Twin Rivers Nation, they would have a chance to acquire their companions’ souls to create ghosts.

In comparison, Ning Zhuo was merely at the Foundation Establishment stage; even if he possessed Golden Core combat power, or even mastered bizarre methods, in the eyes of the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, he was not worth worrying about.

Their reason for taking on this sect task was simply that they happened to come to Thousand Peaks Forest -a convenient matter.

Ten Li Burning Forest.

The soldiers of the Three Generals’ Camp cheered in unison, their morale surging noticeably.

The swarms of mice and mayflies retreated on their own, allowing their first skirmish to be a victory and further boosting their confidence.

Liu Er, Guan, Zhang, and Ning showed not the slightest trace of smugness.

They knew the intelligence well: the Fire Fur Mice and the Red Refined Mayfly swarms in the Ten Li Burning Forest were specially bred, not for defensive combat, but to assist in artifact forging.

Fire Fur Mice were scavengers with a wide-ranging diet; they could not only ingest shattered tree bark and roots but also devour the remnants left behind by large-scale artifact forging and the like.

After they died, the indigestible residuals in their bodies could be further refined, often yielding valuable materials.

The Red Refined Mayfly swarms, on the other hand, would be attracted in groups whenever a cultivator needed to inscribe array patterns or talismans during artifact forging. By manipulating them with divine sense, the mayflies would land on a magical instrument or artifact, arranging themselves into the shapes of talismans or arrays. By sacrificing the mayflies one by one and stamping imprints, talismans and arrays were quickly formed.

“This is merely the enemy’s probe. All troops, obey orders and continue marching!”

After Liu Er and the others heard a round of cheers from the entire army, he shouted loudly to halt them.

The entire army continued to advance.

After marching another two li, the soldiers had to stop.

The surrounding raging flames suddenly transformed drastically, turning into walls of fire that encircled the entire army.

Subsequently, these fire walls burned higher and higher, connecting sky and earth, forming a heavenly curtain, like a giant crimson bowl inverted and placed over the Three Generals’ Camp.

The soldiers were thrown into panic and commotion for a moment, but when they saw that the three generals-Liu, Guan, and Zhang -remained calm, they quickly recovered.

The Flowing Flame Immortal, who presided over the formation, stood in front of the Vermilion Bird Incense Furnace, exerting herself fully to mobilize the formation’s power.

Immediately, a huge image of a Vermilion Bird appeared on the heavenly curtain.

The ambient air temperature quickly soared.

Waves of flames surged toward the Three Generals’ Camp, the ground became scorching hot, and countless fire sparks emerged.

The sparks quickly grew, turning the area into a sea of flames.

The entire Three Generals’ Camp was immersed in a sea of fire, and the frost-white talismans on their bodies were being rapidly consumed.

Seeing this, Liu Er immediately ordered, “Transform into the Iron Barrel Formation!”

Guan Hong and Zhang Hei immediately cooperated, both executing their military tactics.

Speed was of the essence in warfare!

The soldiers moved with extreme agility, generally remaining calm, and very few made mistakes.

Soon, the Iron Barrel Formation was successfully established.

Once the battle formation was complete, it immediately provided strong protection to the entire army. The soldiers immediately felt that the temperature had dropped significantly, and the rate at which the frost-white talismans were being consumed on their bodies had also decreased considerably.

Their morale stabilized once more.

However, the soldiers could still sense that the surrounding temperature was slowly rising, and their protective frost-white talismans continued to wear down, though at a rate no less than three times slower than before.

Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning immediately realized that if they defended for too long, they would surely lose.

Zhang Hei, impulsive by nature, took the initiative, brandishing the Black Snake Spear once again and executing the tactic of overwhelming the enemy.

Black Water soldiers surged forth again, but before they could charge into the Red Fire Heavenly Curtain, they were burned and melted halfway.

Guan Hong waved the Blood Dragon Blade in his hand, releasing a massive blade aura as he hacked at the heavenly curtain.

The heavenly curtain flickered for a moment, then quickly stabilized.

Liu Er held the Xuanhuang Sword but did not strike.

Each of the three generals had their own focus; Guan Hong’s attacking method was potent yet restrained and very concentrated. In the current situation, it was just right to break through with a pinpoint strike.

By contrast, even if Liu Er struck, he might not achieve such an effective result. Military strength was precious; although it could be quickly restored, its consumption came from the soldiers’ combat power, physical strength, and so on.

Guan Hong continued his assault, hacking three times in succession and carving a huge gap in the heavenly curtain.

Seeing this, Liu Er took advantage of the moment while Guan Hong was catching his breath and added another sword strike.

That strike was just right -it broke through the limit that the heavenly curtain could bear, splitting it apart.

The heavenly curtain immediately dissipated.

The soldiers cheered once again, enabling them to continue their advance.

There was reason behind naming the Ten Li Burning Forest as such; its front-to-back distance was approximately ten li.

However, the Three Generals’ Camp did not need to traverse the full ten li; if they marched five li, they could roughly break through to the central area and see the Fire Crown Divine Cedar.

This divine tree was the king of trees in the Ten Li Burning Forest-a signature giant tree.

The Three Generals’ Camp had already advanced three li, leaving only the final two li.

However, the journey ahead suddenly became significantly more difficult.

Layer upon layer of fire curtains appeared in succession, enveloping the Three Generals’ Camp and making their movement extremely difficult.

Although Guan Hong could hack through the fire curtains, such frequent assaults greatly drained him.

He was at the Golden Core level and was already extremely fatigued, and the rest of the soldiers were even worse.

The closer they got to the center of the Burning Forest, the more vigorous the flames became, and with the rising temperature, the consumption of the Three Generals’ Camp increased rapidly.

Everyone had to replenish their talismans more and more frequently, and the soldiers’ physical energy was largely depleted -even though they consumed some pill-like provisions and military rations along the way, their strength still fell short.

When they were nearly four li in, a loud bell sound suddenly resounded.

The bell sound reverberated, arousing raging flames.

The soldiers’ armor, talismans, and even their weapons began to crack and quickly disintegrated.

In this crisis, Liu Er hurriedly deployed military tactics to fortify their position, buying critical time.

Taking advantage of this, the soldiers quickly replenished their talismans, and Ning Zhuo also cast spells to try to alleviate the predicament.

During the arduous process of resisting the bell sound, Ning Zhuo’s thoughts made a sudden turn -a flash of spiritual light streaked through his divine sea, and he exclaimed in astonishment, “Could it be the Heavenly Art Forging Sound Score?!”

Zhang Hei asked, “What?”

Guan Hong looked equally puzzled.

But Liu Er’s eyes lit up, “That’s right -it must be this method.”

Yan Jin, who specialized in the Heavenly Art Forging Sound Score, was the chief craftsman of the Ten Li Burning Forest. At that moment, he stood in front of a huge bronze bell; each time he swung his fists and palms, he forcefully pounded the bell, eliciting a resounding, mighty sound.

The bell sound could forge iron into steel, turning the entire Three Generals’ Camp into raw ore for forging!

The Three Generals’ Camp was plunged into a predicament, and the three generals -Liu, Guan, and Zhang -were at a loss.

It was all because the bell sound was hard to defend against; no matter what methods they employed, they could not change the passive situation of taking blow after blow.

“They were delaying our advance through layer upon layer of fire curtains, and then using the bell sound forging technique to kill us.”

Ning Zhuo looked around and saw that many soldiers had blood oozing from their mouths and noses.

Their internal organs could not withstand the bell sound -they were already suffering massive internal bleeding.

“The Heavenly Art Forging Sound Score is an artifact forging method that amplifies its power through the great bell. As long as we destroy the great bell, this move can be neutralized.”

“According to the intelligence, the forest chief of the Ten Li Burning Forest is the Nascent Soul cultivator Luo Chen. He has never made an appearance.”

“The Three Generals’ Camp is marching slowly and relies on the Iron Barrel Formation for defense; switching to other formations would be tantamount to suicide. The three generals -Liu, Guan, and Zhang -are only at the Golden Core level; once they leave the Iron Barrel Formation to go destroy the great bell, they would inevitably suffer an attack from Luo Chen.”

“It is time for me to act.”

Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo rotated his mechanical ring.

The ring had no reaction.

He immediately sent his divine sense into his storage belt and took out one mechanized puppet after another.

The mechanized army had appeared!
