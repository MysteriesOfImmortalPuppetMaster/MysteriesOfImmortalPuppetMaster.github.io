Chapter 314: The Five Tails of Great Purity

The sound of the Transmission Bell echoed in Ning Zhuo's mind. The contents of the Foundation Establishment chapter of the Three Sects' Supreme Method were imprinted in his divine sea's upper dantian. However, Ning Zhuo's main focus was not on the Three Sects' Supreme Method. He took a deep breath, savoring the wonders of the Foundation Establishment stage. His divine thought condensed and merged into divine sense, allowing it to leave the body for reconnaissance and control of artifacts. Using divine sense to manipulate mechanical constructs was also one of the mainstream methods of control.

In his qi sea, his magical power had liquefied, no longer the true qi of the Qi Refining Stage. As his cultivation deepened in the future, the magical power accumulated in his qi sea would only increase. For now, having just completed Foundation Establishment, Ning Zhuo's internal magical power accumulation had already surpassed the peak of the Qi Refining Stage! The upper limit of his reserves had increased significantly, and casting spells, which directly consumed liquefied magical power, resulted in a natural surge in spell power.

In his essence sea, his blood energy had expanded considerably and had also liquefied. During Foundation Establishment, the essence sea also undertook the task of cleansing the meridians and refining the marrow, elevating the essence of his physical body. Even without using magical power, he possessed the strength of a thousand pounds, as swift as a galloping horse, surpassing the limits of ordinary mortals.

More crucially, with each breath, Ning Zhuo achieved the same effect as the breathing technique of the Qi Refining Stage. His body had become more attuned to absorbing spiritual qi. This led to a result known asâ€”fasting. After his body's sublimation, Ning Zhuo could sustain himself by absorbing spiritual qi, no longer needing to eat. Consuming ordinary food would accumulate impurities in his body, hindering cultivation, so it was best to consume only spiritual food in the future.

"And then there's longevity." "Successfully establishing a foundation increases a cultivator's lifespan, ranging from two hundred to three hundred years." "I need to calculate exactly how much my lifespan has increased. However, with the Three Sects' Supreme Method, the increase in lifespan is bound to be significant!" Ning Zhuo moved his body. His foundation was so robust that breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage was effortless. Instead of feeling a decline in state due to the breakthrough, he felt a strong sense of comfort, as if every inch of his body had been thoroughly cleansed by spiritual qi.

The significant boost in strength made him feel incredibly vigorous. His five senses had also become sharper, especially his perception of spiritual qi, which was incomparable to the Qi Refining Stage. Ning Zhuo felt eager to test his newfound strength; for the first time, he felt truly powerful!

But soon, he shook his head slightly, reminding himself: this was merely the initial euphoria of advancing to the Foundation Establishment stage, a qualitative change in strength leading to a sense of elation, which was just an illusion. Ning Zhuo recalled the battle prowess of Zhu Xuanji, and the feeling of elation dissipated instantly. He was acutely aware: even though he had advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage, he would still not be a match for Zhu Xuanji.

Zhu Xuanji's display of three divine abilities in the previous battle was simply insurmountable! "Perhaps, the Night Rain Demon Weapon in Zheng Danlian's hand holds some hope." "Or maybe, I can use the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability to try and plant it on Zhu Xuanji, to control him." Ning Zhuo had already mastered the complete divine ability. Previously, during the Qi Refining Stage, he had sensed through the divine ability that once he advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage, he could use the divine ability to influence Golden Core stage beings.

This was not unusual. Divine abilities and innate talents inherently contained the Dao and principles, enabling cultivators to challenge those of higher levels. However, after witnessing Zhu Xuanji's strength, Ning Zhuo began to doubt: could the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability really deal with Zhu Xuanji? Even if successfully planted, to what extent could it influence him?

"To solve Zhu Xuanji alone is too difficult." "Fortunately, to seize the position of the Immortal Palace's master, it's not necessary to eliminate all competitors." "Moreover, I am currently hidden in the shadows and can wait for the right moment, letting Zhu Xuanji and others fiercely compete and exhaust each other." "As long as I am not eliminated, there is still hope. Even if the hope is slim, I will not give up!" Ning Zhuo's gaze was resolute.

In this regard, he was very grateful to Zhu Xuanji. It was the experience at the children's orphanage that solidified Ning Zhuo's fighting spirit. "Rudie Niang, hold on a little longer." After a word of encouragement, he immediately began repairing the Golden Core stage mechanical ape. Besides that, there was also the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai. The interior of the Golden Core stage mechanical ape had suffered devastating damage, though its exterior, despite many fist pits and palm prints, remained relatively intact.

Ning Zhuo took out the mechanical parts he had previously replaced and skillfully installed them. These mechanical parts, obtained from trial checkpoints, were originally part of the Golden Core stage mechanical ape. Once installed, the mechanical ape regained its combat capability. "Regrettably, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng is still in Boss Sun's hands. If I had Yuan Dasheng's spiritual parasitism, it would save me a lot of effort in controlling the mechanical ape." As for the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai, it was severely injured. In the previous battle, it had been directly cleaved in half by Zhu Xuanji's hand.

After inspection, Ning Zhuo immediately decided on an emergency repair plan. He would use suitable materials to fuse its two halves into one. Then, utilizing the Ice Jade Hand, he would employ the Ice Jade Palm technique to perfectly repair the fine details of the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai, both logically and illogically. This greatly conserved Ning Zhuo's energy and time.

Click, click, clack... The sound of mechanisms echoed once more. After the previous major shift, the number of mechanical secret pavilions breached by the cultivators reached thirty-six, triggering another mechanism. This time, it was a minor shift. Originally close cultivators were separated by the minor shift.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had long awaited this moment. As soon as the shift ended, it would immediately send a message to Meng Chong, guiding him to be the first to break through and enter the main hall of the Immortal Palace.

Lava Immortal Palace. Amidst the entanglement of the magical power hand and the three Nascent Soul stage Scarlet Flame Beasts, a five-tailed fire fox suddenly appeared. The fire fox's form was like a small dog, inconspicuous in the blazing sea of fire. It wasn't until it suddenly cast a spell that its Nascent Soul stage's vast aura was revealed!

Its mouth remained tightly shut, with five tails swaying behind it. The tips of the tails resembled brushes, painting mysterious talismanic symbols in mid-air. The symbols dissipated immediately, causing the sea of fire to surge, with tongues of flame intertwining in the air, condensing into massive fireballs as large as hills. The fireballs shot forth with a roar, crashing into the Lava Immortal Palace.

The scorching flames ravaged the Immortal Palace, with explosions causing the palace to tremble violently, incinerating all mechanical constructs in the sea of fire. The flames even spread to the main hall. Amidst the intense burning, countless mechanical blocks soared into the sky. These blocks, each as large as a house, were interconnected by purple-blue currents. The originally normal space was altered by the appearance of these mechanical blocks.

The overwhelming flames were temporarily isolated by the chaotic space created by the mechanical blocks! "Is that the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities?!" The cultivators who witnessed this scene exclaimed in shock. At the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain, amidst the clouds and mist, Meng Hu stood up abruptly. His tiger eyes were fixed on the five-tailed fire fox. The fire fox seemed to sense something, glancing up at the sky with a tense expression.

Its small figure quickly blurred in the sea of fire, diving into the magma and disappearing. Meng Kui snorted coldly, his expression darken. Fire Persimmon Mountain did have fire foxes and similar demon beasts, but their scale was small, with their living space completely occupied by fire fusion demon apes, fire snakes, and stomping flame lizards. With such a small scale of demon beasts, how could a Nascent Soul stage five-tailed fire fox possibly emerge?

Meng Kui calculated with his fingers: "As expected, it's the Great Purity Palace!" He immediately deduced the specific location and signaled Meng Hu to take action. Meng Hu received the order, let out a roar, and shot out of the clouds like a meteor, crashing fiercely into a mountainside a mile away. The small mountain shook violently, dust billowing, nearly breaking in half.

A green light rose, revealing a young cultivator with beast patterns on his face. "Damn Daoist thief, I've been tracking you all along!" Meng Hu shouted. The young cultivator's eye twitched; he was a beast-taming cultivator who had just used his spirit pet, the five-tailed fire fox, to launch a sneak attack on the Lava Immortal Palace. He hadn't had time to relish his success before Meng Hu found his true form.

"I am from the Great Purity..." The young cultivator was about to state his identity when Meng Hu interrupted with a loud shout. Meng Hu charged forward with fierce might. The young cultivator could only retreat continuously, releasing various demon beasts from his beast-taming pouch to fend off the attack.

Lava Immortal Palace. Central Main Hall. The Secret Pavilion of Opportunities was forced out, compelled to resist the burning sea of fire, causing the related restrictions to diminish once more! Inside the pavilion, Zhu Xuanji and others simultaneously regained their Golden Core stage cultivation. Moreover, their divine sense spread, penetrating the pavilion they were in, allowing them to observe the external situation to varying degrees.

Sensitive cultivators quickly used spells to detect that communication between the inside and outside had become smooth. Cultivators at the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages could even enter these pavilions as long as they avoided the purple-blue currents! Zhu Xuanji's divine sense swept across, discovering the specific locations of the Meng family cultivators, Zheng Danlian, and others.

A Golden Core body cultivator pushed forward: "Young Master Meng Chong, according to your grandfather's arrangement, you go first. I'll hold off Zhu Xuanji!" With a solemn expression, he actively moved towards the pavilion where Zhu Xuanji was located. Simultaneously, Zheng Danlian also headed towards Zhu Xuanji.

Meng Chong didn't look back, breaking through a door and, following the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's guidance, headed straight for the correct exit. "Sun Lingtong seems to be hiding, Meng Chong is in trouble." Zhu Xuanji's divine sense penetrated the pavilion, covering a vast area, sensing Meng Chong's movements, and immediately set off to intercept.

Zhu Zhen's voice suddenly came through: "Brother, as per your instructions, I've managed to excavate some bricks and stones from the ruins of the Golden Furnace." "I've already extracted some materials, and I can confirm they originate from the third Golden Furnace!" "Do you need me to send them over?" Zhu Xuanji pondered briefly: "Send them over." In the next moment, both of them cast spells simultaneously.

Official Techniqueâ€” Crossing! The waste material in Zhu Zhen's hand vanished, reappearing in Zhu Xuanji's hand. Holding the waste material, Zhu Xuanji's eyes flashed with golden light, sharp and extraordinary. Innate Talentâ€”Heaven-Piercing Eyes. Spellâ€”Origin Tracing Technique!
