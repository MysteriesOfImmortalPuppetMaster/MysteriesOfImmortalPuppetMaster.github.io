Chapter 792: Ning Zhuo and Gu Qing’s "Tacit Battle"

<i class="letter">To Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo:

<i class="letter">Wishing you spring blessings and summer peace as the seasons turn.

<i class="letter">Ever since Qing first arrived at this precious land, I have heard of your profound attainments in the Path of Mechanisms, particularly your Snow Pivot mechanical puppets, which are truly refreshing and uniquely ingenious. Every time I think of this, I am filled with admiration, only sighing that I have had no chance to seek your guidance in person.

<i class="letter">Today, I take the liberty of writing to express my regards.

<i class="letter">Coincidentally, Qing has achieved some minor results in the Path of Painting and wishes to use the opportunity of the martial arena to compare notes with the mechanical puppets created by your skilled hands. To meet a friend through art would truly be a great joy in my life.

<i class="letter">For this exchange, Qing has three wishes: First, regardless of victory or defeat, we seek only an exchange of Dao and art; second, my avatar shall compete against your puppet, intending to communicate and verify our skills, with harmony being our priority; third, I plan to invite the talents of various sects to observe together, which not only shows transparency and openness but also allows all fellow Daoists to gain something.

<i class="letter">Qing knows well that the Great Dao is boundless; an exchange is not for the sake of rivalry, but to explore profound mysteries together. If you do not find me unworthy, Qing shall prepare light tea and await your favorable reply.

<i class="letter">Respectfully submitted for your kind consideration, awaiting your response.

<i class="letter">Wishing you peace on the Path,

<i class="letter">Gu Qing, respectfully."

Gu Qing’s letter for the challenge was elegantly phrased, with a tactful tone and even a hint of respect.

This was within Ning Zhuo’s expectations, but it also raised the latter's vigilance once again.

"As expected of a genius famous both inside and outside the capital of Huazhang Kingdom," Ning Zhuo praised inwardly.

Gu Qing’s response was precisely designed to solve his current dilemma of rumors.

On one hand, he invited many geniuses of this session of the Myriad Manifestations Sect to compete, using their recognized reputations to verify his own.

On the other hand, by using a painted avatar to fight, regardless of the outcome, he would have an excuse; it wouldn't hurt their relationship or create intense conflict.

Ning Zhuo didn't even need to guess to know that in Gu Qing’s challenge letter to Situ Xing, he would only say he wanted to use a painted avatar to charge through Situ Xing’s sword formation. In the letter to Zhu Fenxiang, he would mention using a painted avatar to face Zhu Fenxiang’s Spirit-Invoking technique.

"Gu Qing has likely already made up his mind; if a battle looks bad, he’ll just quit while he’s ahead and decisively admit defeat. A mix of wins and losses will do."

"Even if he had enough strength to suppress everyone, including me, he wouldn't do so."

As long as there were wins and losses, and it looked authentic enough to the public, the rumor offensive against Gu Qing would crumble.

One could clearly sense Gu Qing’s level just by looking at the phrasing in his letter. He certainly wouldn't do something as foolish as winning everything!

Ning Zhuo held the flying letter, his eyes showing a look of contemplation. He thought of another layer: "Gu Qing sent flying letters to us, and he will surely use the mouths of outsiders to leak this matter."

"The public will inevitably want to see the duels between us. On one hand, it's to watch the excitement; on the other, it's to understand our strength and methods as much as possible, which can effectively help them in the upcoming minor trials."

"Therefore, the public will also facilitate this. If I refuse or even hesitate slightly, public opinion will immediately surge, claiming I am afraid to fight and that my strength is low, inferior to Gu Qing."

In this regard, Gu Qing acted quite "transparently."

He directly said in the letter: "Third, I plan to invite the talents of various sects to observe together, which not only shows transparency and openness but also allows all fellow Daoists to gain something."

See: how much he considers others.

Once the content of the letter was disclosed, it would inevitably improve the public’s impression of him. They would have no idea they were actually being used by Gu Qing.

Even if there were smart people who realized this, for their own benefit, they would still be willing to facilitate it.

A short letter, seemingly simple, actually revealed Gu Qing’s solid and experienced conduct of the Righteous Path.

However... all of this was within Ning Zhuo’s expectations.

He had already collected much intelligence on Gu Qing. When he initially arranged the rumors, he had specifically considered him.

Gu Qing’s fame across Huazhang Kingdom had its drawbacks. At the very least, it was easy to gather a large amount of intelligence about him.

"The opponent has already taken the bait, so let's continue." Ning Zhuo immediately wrote a reply - 

<i class="letter">"Your kind letter has been received, and it felt like a breath of fresh air.

<i class="letter">I am grateful you did not find me unworthy and sent this invitation. Between the ink and brush, you have shown great magnanimity and elegance; between the lines, the style of a gentleman overflows.

<i class="letter">Zhuo has read your letter, and it was like listening to pure music.

<i class="letter">Your three wishes for the exchange are gems of wisdom that resonate deeply with me. The phrase 'regardless of victory or defeat, we seek only an exchange of Dao and art' especially shows Brother Gu’s broad-mindedness and lofty aspirations, which have left me deeply impressed.

<i class="letter">My Path of Mechanisms is but a minor skill; how could I dare claim the reputation of being 'refreshing and uniquely ingenious'? However, your Dao of Painting avatars are marvelously profound, naturally gifted with divine charm, making one yearn for them.

<i class="letter">Zhuo has heard that in the Huazhang Kingdom, the style of a gentleman is celebrated and the literary lineage is long. Although I have long lived in a small country, every time I read the classic texts of sages, my heart is moved and my thoughts bridge a thousand years. To be able to discuss the Dao and practice martial arts with you today is truly a rare destiny in my life.

<i class="letter">To be honest, Zhuo has always held admiration for the Confucian school of heart studies.

<i class="letter">I especially subscribe to the tenet of 'Unity of Knowledge and Action,' which shares a similar interest with my Path of Mechanisms’ wonder of 'Principle and Action Shining Together.' This exchange is just like meeting friends through martial arts and connecting hearts through art - would that not be delightful!

<i class="letter">Since you have shown such kind intent, how could I not obey?

<i class="letter">I am willing to use the Snow Pivot mechanical puppet to meet your masterful brush.

<i class="letter">I am deeply grateful for your consideration.

<i class="letter">..."

Ning Zhuo’s reply soon reached Gu Qing’s hands.

"Teacher, the first one to reply is Ning Zhuo." Gu Qing handed the letter to Zhao Hansheng to read.

Zhao Hansheng scanned it with his divine sense and nodded slightly: "This lad is also extraordinary. It's just that his background is unclear. There hasn't been a breakthrough in the internal intelligence of the Myriad Manifestations Sect; they only recorded his various deeds since arriving at the sect's main mountain."

The teacher and student were from Huazhang Kingdom, and for intelligence gathering, they mostly relied on the procurement of the Trading Hall.

Gu Qing smiled: "Ning Zhuo was originally obscure and he intentionally hid his identity. It's not surprising that the Myriad Manifestations Sect is slow to investigate enough intelligence, as it requires crossing several countries."

"He is now a first-rate genius, and all parties are increasing their investigation into his intelligence. I expect there will be significant intelligence gains before long."

Zhao Hansheng returned the letter to Gu Qing: "What do you think?"

Gu Qing stared at the letter in his hand and smiled composedly: "I can understand."

"Ning Zhuo’s situation is actually similar to mine."

"Although he has gained the reputation of a first-rate genius since coming to the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he has never proven himself in the martial arena before the public."

"If he doesn't prove he can fight, that he can reach the Golden Core-level combat strength, the public will always have doubts about his strength."

"His name as a genius will also remain superficial and not solid."

After a pause, Gu Qing continued: "Ning Zhuo’s two first-place finishes were both obtained from Confucian trials. It's very normal for him to have a good impression of Confucianism."

"And from his performance in the Profound Armor Grotto, this person is most likely from a Righteous Path family. He has quite an understanding of human hearts and can repel enemies with words. Though not a Confucian cultivator, he has quite the style of one."

"He wants to befriend me, so I will satisfy him."

"In this encounter, I will carefully control my strength and fight him to a 'draw.' According to my estimation, as long as I win him over slightly, this person will become one of my supporters."

Zhao Hansheng nodded: "In that case, go ahead."

-----

The Martial Arts Hall.

Many cultivators gathered here, discussing the upcoming battle.

"This time Gu Qing is using a painted avatar, and Ning Zhuo is using his mechanical puppet. I wonder who will win?"

"Gu Qing can use painted avatars to socialize everywhere and convince many cultivators; that is his Confucian attainment. As for actual combat, it remains to be verified."

"Similarly, it's rumored that Ning Zhuo has a Golden Core-level mechanical puppet, but as for its specific capabilities, there isn't much reliable intelligence."

"Look, Gu Qing is here!"

Countless gazes immediately shifted over.

Gu Qing, in a moon-white Confucian robe, gracefully stepped onto the stage.

The crowd below was silent for a few breaths before a wave of low-voiced praise erupted.

"As expected of a talent from Huazhang Kingdom; this demeanor is truly extraordinary."

"I heard his painted avatars are exquisite beyond compare; I wonder how they compare to his true self?"

Gu Qing smiled, cupping his hands in greeting to everyone, appearing quite friendly.

Internally, however, he was thinking: "Is Ning Zhuo... not here yet?"

Just as he thought this, a cultivator wearing a hood and robe to conceal himself emerged from the crowd and stepped into the formation space.

"So Ning Zhuo was already here?" Gu Qing’s heart stirred. He immediately cupped his hands and spoke loudly, "Qing has just arrived. It is truly a joy to have the chance to exchange notes with Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo today."

However, the "visitor" actively pulled back the hood, causing a low cry of surprise from the entire audience.

It turned out this was not a living person, but a mechanical puppet.

She had a body made of Profound Ice, standing six and a half feet tall. She wore a Snow Pivot Guard helmet, with lines as sharp as if carved by a knife or axe. Beneath it, her eyes were two slowly rotating deep blue vortices, bottomless.

Hexagonal Profound Ice armor fit perfectly, with azure spiritual light flowing and circulating like blood at the armor's seams.

On the shoulder plates, a pair of Ice Dragon heads appeared fierce and dangerous.

Six cold steel mechanical spheres flew out silently, circling her body and emitting a slight chill.

"What a fine ice-attribute mechanical battle puppet! Just by its appearance, one can tell it's extraordinary!"

"It indeed has a Golden Core aura."

"But... why didn't Ning Zhuo come?"

"Did he only send his mechanical puppet?"

"Or is he hidden among us?"

"There's no need for that. He's part of the first wave of geniuses; what would be the point of hiding among us? It’s not transparent at all."

"Look closely, the hanging threads maintaining this mechanical puppet are cast into the void; they should be Void Spider Silks!"

Vital points of Snow Pivot Guard Xie were maintained by Void Spider Silks, vanishing into the void.

Gu Qing’s true body had already seen this detail, and he couldn't help but squint his eyes.

He felt quite displeased.

He thought Ning Zhuo would show up in person; he didn't expect only a mechanical battle puppet to come. This made Gu Qing, whose true body was present, feel somewhat awkward.

Even so, Gu Qing’s smile never faded; instead, it became richer and more cordial.

He cupped his hands and continued: "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo’s mechanical puppet is certainly no small matter. To be able to witness its power today, Gu is indeed fortunate."

The voice of Snow Pivot Guard Xie came: "Fellow Daoist Gu, I am truly sorry. I am currently in seclusion and have urgent matters at hand that I temporarily cannot leave."

"After this battle, I will surely visit in person to apologize."

"Please do not take offense, do not take offense."

Hearing Ning Zhuo say this, Gu Qing’s displeasure and slight suspicion mostly dissipated.

Gu Qing extended his palm: "My true body is here, while you have not arrived. I am taking advantage of you. For the upcoming battle, I promise I will only use a painted avatar to ensure fairness and meet as friends through martial arts. Please command your mechanism to strike first."

He believed in Ning Zhuo’s Righteous Path attainment; they had already reached a plan before this battle - to perform a public "tacit battle."

Snow Pivot Guard Xie was slightly stunned, then cupped her hands: "Brother Gu Qing has extraordinary magnanimity; I shall show my meager skills first."

Gu Qing nodded slightly. In his view, Ning Zhuo’s straightforward agreement was also a signal - I understand your meaning; you want a tacit battle, and so do I!

The Void Spider Silks moved frequently, and Snow Pivot Guard Xie charged at Gu Qing.

Gu Qing’s true body retreated a few steps, each step spanning several yards, quickly backing to the edge of the battlefield.

Remaining in place was one of his painted avatars.

Bang bang bang...

Snow Pivot Guard Xie and the painted avatar clashed, using only physical parts for simple martial combat.

Ning Zhuo was indeed in the Blue Stone Grotto. Watching the battle from a distance and controlling through Void Spider Silks was all real.

He also wanted to use this battle to train his ability to control mechanisms from afar and gain relevant experience.

His experience in the Profound Armor Cave had greatly improved his martial arts.

After several rounds of close combat, they were evenly matched with the painted avatar.

The observing crowd, however, was highly dissatisfied and began to clamor.

"Start fighting for real!"

"Use the real stuff!"

"We didn't come here to watch a play. If this continues, this duel is meaningless."

Gu Qing’s true body smiled: "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, you’ve heard everyone’s voice, haven't you? I know you don't want to strike first and take advantage of me. But in this friendly exchange, someone has to make the first move, right?"

Seeing Ning Zhuo clash this way, he was even more certain it was a tacit battle.

Ning Zhuo controlled Snow Pivot Guard Xie to retreat a few steps, and his voice came through: "Sigh, Fellow Daoist Gu Qing, then I shall be rude."

Gu Qing’s true body extended his palm, appearing poised: "Please."

Ning Zhuo gave a low shout, truly mobilizing Snow Pivot Guard Xie to cast ice-attribute spells.

In an instant, cold air gushed out, exceptionally piercing.

Almost instantly, the entire floor of the martial arts arena was covered by a layer of deep blue Profound Ice.

Ning Zhuo shouted again.

The temperature plummeted further, and ice crystal dust condensed in the air, shimmering everywhere.

Ning Zhuo shouted once more.

On the ice-sealed floor tiles, sharp ice spikes grew frantically, forming a grim battlefield of ice spikes.

The smile on Gu Qing’s face froze for a moment.

He was shocked by Ning Zhuo’s large-scale move, but soon realized: "Ning Zhuo wants a grand gesture to create a massive spectacle and cover up the truth of the tacit battle."

"Good."

"I will temporarily endure and defend, let him take some of the spotlight first."

"Then I’ll strike to change the battlefield's situation, showing I am not weaker than him."

"Finally, I’ll find a suitable time to stop together with Ning Zhuo, creating the result of a draw."

Gu Qing believed Ning Zhuo was thinking the same thing.

Because there was a "tacit understanding" between them!

"Benevolent Heart Body Protection, Grace Moistening the Four Directions!" Gu Qing’s painted avatar flicked his sleeve, literary qi overflowing as he chanted in a clear voice.

A pale golden light expanded from within him, warm and mellow, turning into a semi-transparent shield.

The Profound Ice spikes grew frantically, continuously shooting out, but were all blocked by the shield.

Bang bang bang...

The splashing ice fragments and the golden light dissipating from the shield's surface formed a glow like fireflies, which was quite beautiful.

The ice spikes were continuous, and Gu Qing’s painted avatar grit his teeth slightly, feeling the pressure grow.

At the same time, the hidden cold air transmitted from the ground, penetrating into the shield, eroding the painted avatar and trying to freeze his literary qi.

The painted avatar could have attacked to defend, but under the true body’s instruction, he decided to continue defending, allowing Ning Zhuo more spotlight.

Snow Pivot Guard Xie’s attacks were like an endless tide.

The cold wave did not stop; the roaring Ice Dragon heads on her shoulder armor suddenly shot out azure beams of light.

Boom!

The painted avatar’s shield suffered a heavy blow and, caught off guard, collapsed directly.

The avatar retreated frantically, narrowly dodging the sweep of the blue light. In the blink of an eye, he brandished his brush and wrote two large characters - Ice Break!

The characters flew out, reflecting the ice-blue profound light to neutralize the attack.

The mechanical eyes of the roaring Ice Dragon heads burst with even greater light, suppressing the "Ice Break" characters.

Gu Qing’s true body was somewhat dissatisfied: "Ning Zhuo still wants to show off?"

Just now, when his painted avatar dodged, he almost rolled on the ground like a lazy donkey, losing all poise and causing Gu Qing to lose face.

Now Ning Zhuo wouldn't let up and still wanted to perform; he was naturally unhappy.

But at this moment, the pressure of the ice-blue profound light suddenly relaxed, though from the outside, it seemed to have strengthened once again.

Gu Qing’s heart stirred: "Oh, so Ning Zhuo has this plan. It seems he realized his mistake in making my avatar lose face just now. Next, it’s my turn to reclaim the situation."

Gu Qing’s painted avatar spoke: "Haoran..."

Boom!

Before he could finish, Snow Pivot Guard Xie charged straight over, runes lighting up across her body as six cold steel mechanical spheres struck out simultaneously.

A terrifying cold wave formed instantly, pressing down overwhelmingly!

The painted avatar wanted to reclaim the field and was casting a powerful Confucian technique, but it required time to form the verbal seal.

As a result, Snow Pivot Guard Xie did not follow the rules, had no tacit understanding, and struck ruthlessly, even secretly activating the trump card - Snow Soul Ice Spirit!

Crackle crackle...

The painted avatar was frozen in a block of ice the height of a man, instantly losing combat effectiveness.

The cultivators on the field were stunned.

Gu Qing’s true body was also dazed, disbelieving in his heart. He stared at Snow Pivot Guard Xie, seemingly screaming and accusing silently: "The tacit understanding! Where is our tacit understanding?!"

Snow Pivot Guard Xie then transmitted Ning Zhuo’s voice: "Hmm?"

"Fellow Daoist Gu Qing, why is... why is your painted avatar so fragile?"

Gu Qing: ?!!

Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, what is wrong with you?!

Do you know what you are saying?!

Next, he heard Ning Zhuo give a cold snort: "Perhaps Gu Qing’s painted avatar has methods he hasn't used yet."

Deliberately making excuses for Gu Qing made it seem even more like an insult.

"Sigh," Ning Zhuo sighed again, "To be honest, I’m a bit disappointed, Fellow Daoist Gu Qing."

Gu Qing’s pupils shrank, leaking strands of cold light. He finally reacted and truly understood that Ning Zhuo bore malice. The previous letter and combat performance were all fake - a scheme! A scam! A sneak attack! He had no literary virtue; he was no gentleman!

This little brat!

The corners of Gu Qing’s mouth twitched: "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo..."

In the next moment, Ning Zhuo interrupted: "Fellow Daoist Gu Qing, there’s no need to exchange notes further."

"I am a bit busy."

"Aren't you going to fight the others?"

"I'll just happen to watch the performances of Situ Xing, Zhu Fenxiang, Pi Fujie, and the others."

Then, Snow Pivot Guard Xie looked around at the crowd and announced loudly: "You all, bring word to Pi Fujie and the others as well."

"I," Snow Pivot Guard Xie pointed to herself, then pointed to the painted avatar frozen in the ice block, "defeated him in only twenty-six breaths of time."

Gu Qing’s brows arched high, veins bulging on his forehead. Strands of blood, like cracks in glass, appeared in the whites of his eyes.

"Ning Zhuo, you brat!!!" He was almost livid with rage, but in the end, he could only howl in his heart.
