Chapter 767: Natural Martial Dao

Ao Pan was slightly stunned, feeling quite surprised in his heart.

He thought for a moment, reasoning that he would still be fellow disciples with Tie Zheng in the future, so he laughed and said, "What are you saying? Fellow Daoist Tie Zheng, you and I are both here to participate in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial; we are inherently competitors."

"Isn't making alliances and maneuvering against one another exactly what should happen here?"

"If you want to blame anyone, you can only blame your own strength for being too great, forcing me to ally with the weak to resist the strong."

Veins bulged on Tie Zheng's forehead: "I won't listen to your explanations, you despicable villain!"

Ao Pan: "..."

Lu Zeng interjected, "Aiya, you are an outsider, you don't know his past. Why bicker about this right now? Let's join hands and beat him!"

Although Tie Zheng was a lone cultivator, he came from a large clan and had a very high starting point.

It was just that later, he unfortunately encountered betrayals from many people. This included his parents, wife, sworn brothers, and so on.

As a result, disheartened and cold inside, he broke away from his clan, voluntarily becoming a lone cultivator to roam for a long time and cultivate alone in the wilderness.

Because of this, his temperament became withdrawn and eccentric, often immersed in past traumas. He would have a stress reaction to any betrayal, no matter how small.

Ao Pan took a deep breath, and the long whip in his hand sliced through the air, emitting a piercing shriek as it struck directly at Tie Zheng.

Tie Zheng raised the Weapon in his hand to block the front.

Ao Pan's arm and wrist shook continuously; the long whip in his hand acted like a living creature, changing its trajectory to coil around the handle of the blade in Tie Zheng's hand.

At the same time, Ao Pan threw out another Profound Weapon Armor with his other hand.

Bronze radiance exploded outward. In the next moment, a massive Siege Battering Ram appeared in mid-air, pressing down toward Ao Pan with crushing momentum.

Boom!

Tie Zheng dodged, and the Siege Battering Ram smashed into the ground, shaking the entire rock cavern violently!

But simultaneously, he could not attend to the bronze blade in his hand, which was coiled up by Ao Pan's long whip.

"Let go!" Ao Pan shouted coldly, pulling with sudden force.

Tie Zheng gripped it with all his might, but his strength could not compare to Ao Pan's. Helpless, it slipped from his hand; the web of his thumb was torn open, dripping with fresh blood.

Ao Pan was a Golden Core body cultivator, while Tie Zheng was a martial cultivator.

There was a difference between the two.

In terms of Physical Body quality, Ao Pan was stronger than Tie Zheng.

"Well done!" Lu Zeng was overjoyed.

Ao Pan coiled up Tie Zheng's weapon, grabbing it with one hand to fully suppress it. At the same time, his divine sense moved to retract the Siege Battering Ram.

This weapon was too huge and heavy; while suitable for a battlefield, it had little room to be effective in this kind of one-on-one combat.

Basically, Ao Pan did not pin his hopes on it causing damage.

Therefore, when Ao Pan used it, he merely treated it as a cover to force the enemy to defend; the real offensive was to be launched separately.

"I seized one of Tie Zheng's bronze artifacts, but now he will be on guard. It will be very difficult for the Siege Battering Ram to achieve this result again!" Ao Pan's eyes flickered with cold light.

Ao Pan immediately glanced at Lu Zeng, hesitated for a moment, and then handed the bronze blade he had just seized over to him.

"You have too few Weapons; you refine this one!"

"I'll block him first."

Lu Zeng was stunned, feeling quite surprised.

Ao Pan's decision was extremely wise. In the previous two-against-one fight, many of the bronze artifacts in Lu Zeng's hands had been damaged. He had almost no handy weapons left, and his combat power was severely weakened.

He was not a martial cultivator, nor a body cultivator, but a Mechanism Cultivator. The more bronze artifacts he controlled, the more he could exert his combat power.

The sincerity for cooperation that Ao Pan displayed made Lu Zeng look at him in a new light for a moment.

One had to know that Ao Pan could have absolutely kept it for himself to add another piece of Profound Weapon Armor. This kind of bronze artifact was not durable and could easily be damaged in intense clashes.

But he did not do so; instead, he voluntarily gave the benefit to Lu Zeng.

This action immediately patched up the rift caused by his earlier attack on Lu Zeng. In this instant, it made his temporary battle alliance with Lu Zeng several times more resilient.

Tie Zheng was furious!

"Good! Good! Very good!" His eyes were crimson red as the pain and wretchedness engraved at the bottom of his life in days past surfaced once again.

His arms abruptly spread open to both sides of his body. His left hand grasped a bronze sword, sword light extending and retracting; his right hand held a twelve-foot bronze long spear. A bronze sickle with a ferocious design hovered at his left waist. A bronze long staff, perfectly round throughout, hovered at his right waist.

Martial Art  -  Metal and Iron Clash!

In an instant, sword light was like snow, spear shadows were like a forest, the sickle carved fatal arcs, and the long staff swept across like a beast swinging its tail!

A storm of metal and iron rose up around Tie Zheng.

Ao Pan and Lu Zeng were forced to retreat steadily.

The bronze blade in Lu Zeng's hand was struggling violently. While forcefully refining it, he shouted, "Can you hold on?"

Ao Pan gritted his teeth and stood in front of Lu Zeng.

He sacrificed the Siege Battering Ram once again, smashing it toward Tie Zheng.

Clang clang clang...

A series of explosions rang out. The Siege Battering Ram crashed into the metal and iron storm surrounding Tie Zheng, kicking up countless sparks that were dazzlingly bright for a moment.

The power of the metal and iron storm plummeted, while the Siege Battering Ram was chopped beyond recognition. After holding on for a few breaths, it was teleported away by the Grand Formation of the Profound Armor Cave.

But it successfully bought critical time for Ao Pan and Lu Zeng.

Lu Zeng retreated rapidly while forcefully refining the bronze blade, pulling distance from Tie Zheng.

Ao Pan cautiously maintained his distance from Tie Zheng, holding his most handy bronze long whip and waving it constantly.

The long whip cracked loudly, whip shadows dancing like dragons and pythons, striking the area around Tie Zheng to forcibly check the metal and iron storm.

Under his faceguard, Tie Zheng's gaze was icy cold. His left shoulder shook slightly, releasing his sixth Profound Weapon Armor - a bronze bow.

The bronze bow hovered above his head, drawing its string on its own. With two whoosh sounds, it shot out a fire arrow and an ice arrow.

The two arrows traced two arcs in mid-air, bypassing Ao Pan to shoot directly at Lu Zeng.

Peng peng.

The powers of ice and fire exploded in succession. The resulting shockwave mixed with countless ice fragments and flames.

Lu Zeng flew backward out of the airwave, half-kneeling on the ground as he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.

But the bronze blade in his hand was no longer struggling; it had been successfully refined by him.

Lu Zeng stood up abruptly and launched a counterattack.

Ao Pan's long whip followed like a shadow.

The metal and iron storm rose up around Tie Zheng again, surging straight up.

The three Golden Core Cultivators fought into a chaotic mass. Although their strength was suppressed by the Grand Formation, they were still the top combat power in the arena.

Tie Zheng fought one against two and was suppressed into a disadvantage.

"Opportunity!" Lu Zeng threw out the bronze blade in his hand, forcing Tie Zheng to dodge.

He abruptly grabbed a bronze hammer beside him and smashed it out with force. Whoosh! The wind from the hammer was so oppressive it almost suffocated people.

Tie Zheng's divine sense moved, and the bronze long staff and bronze long spear shot out together.

The long staff carried the muffled sound of wind and thunder, sweeping upward from below toward the hammer handle with a precise angle. The long spear was like a poison dragon leaving its cave, condensing a point of cold light to stab directly at the center of the giant hammer's face, breaking the surface with a point.

Two explosions erupted almost simultaneously.

The heavy hammerhead grazed Tie Zheng's shoulder and finally landed on the ground, instantly smashing out a deep pit.

The long staff and long spear were knocked back a section, leaving Tie Zheng wide open.

Ao Pan's attack followed immediately, looking as if it was about to pierce Tie Zheng's chest...

"Sweeping Light!" Tie Zheng shouted in a low voice.

Of the twelve beast-head bronze bell balls hanging at his waist, one suddenly vibrated, flew into mid-air, and transformed into a blade light attacking Ao Pan.

Ao Pan was knocked flying back by a massive force. Looking closely, he saw a leopard-shaped Blade Beast biting onto his bronze sword.

Ao Pan's bronze sword was his seventh weapon and the most powerful one.

He decisively let go, using divine sense to control it, intending to let the bronze sword fight on its own.

This choice became the most critical mistake!

The Blade Beast was composed of countless blades. Some blades were heavy, the width of an adult's palm, while others were as thin as cicada wings, extremely sharp. Suddenly, it rotated frantically and vibrated at high speed. The blades rubbed against each other, forming a bronze sphere that "swallowed" the bronze sword into its body.

Subsequently, a series of metal grinding sounds rang out, extremely piercing and setting one's teeth on edge.

In just two breaths, the Blade Beast transformed back into a leopard shape and pounced at Ao Pan again. That bronze sword was already incredibly tattered and was teleported off the field by the Grand Formation.

"This is a Blade Beast?!" Ao Pan's pupils constricted violently, sensing a fatal crisis.

He frantically waved the long whip in his hand, laying down layers of defensive whip shadows in front of him!

The Blade Beast, Sweeping Light, was wondrously fast, like a bolt of lightning, shooting directly into the whip shadows.

The next moment, the whip shadows dispersed!

The bronze whip Ao Pan relied on was cut into countless segments.

Ao Pan was dumbstruck, revealing a look of panic.

The Blade Beast, Sweeping Light, carried its remaining momentum and pounced on him, transforming into a sphere of blades once more.

Ao Pan was hit; he erupted in desperation, slashing ruthlessly with the only bronze artifact remaining in his hand.

With a loud clang, Ao Pan barely managed to slash the Blade Beast back.

He retreated several large steps in succession. His tough body was already covered in blade wounds; in some places, the flesh was sliced into mince, while other wounds were deep enough to see bone.

Heavy injury!

The terrifying injuries caused the Cultivators witnessing this scene to all constrict their pupils.

The Blade Beast, Sweeping Light, flipped backward. When it landed on the ground, it transformed into a leopard shape again.

The Blade Beast pounced at Ao Pan once more.

Lu Zeng felt things were bad and hurriedly blocked its path. As a result, the Blade Beast, Sweeping Light, was extremely agile. Like a bolt of lightning, it made a turn in mid-air, easily avoiding Lu Zeng and killing its way toward Ao Pan.

Ao Pan's heart went cold, and he could only shout, "I concede!"

The Blade Beast smashed into his body, but was blocked by the power of the Grand Formation, preventing Ao Pan from sustaining further injuries.

Ao Pan gasped for breath, looking at Tie Zheng with lingering fear. The next moment, he was teleported off the field.

As soon as Ao Pan was eliminated, Lu Zeng's expression changed drastically, and he couldn't help but panic.

The Blade Beast pounced toward him.

Clang clang clang clang...

Lu Zeng fully mobilized his Profound Weapon Armor, retreating steadily under the Blade Beast's wild attacks.

When the Blade Beast assumed its leopard form, it possessed immense strength and agile movements. Before it even became the blade sphere, it released a terrifying crushing and cutting power, easily crippling Lu Zeng's Profound Weapon Armor.

Lu Zeng was soon unarmed and bathed in blood; he decisively spoke up to concede.

Lu Zeng was teleported off the field, and the radiance slowly dissipated from Tie Zheng's eyes.

The Blade Beast, Sweeping Light, returned to his side. The leopard-shaped outline composed of countless vibrating blades rose and fell slightly, as if panting. Steam lingered around its body, like the sweat evaporating from a flesh-and-blood body after intense activity. But in fact, this was metal dust created by the rapid cutting and friction of countless blades.

The Cultivators who saw this scene all stared wide-eyed. Whether it was the Cultivators hosting the Rising Cloud Minor Trial inside the Profound Armor Cave or the competitors participating in it, all were shocked by the Blade Beast's combat power.

Someone exclaimed in admiration, "This Blade Beast's combat power is simply too strong!"

Someone was puzzled, "The refining method for Blade Beasts isn't rare. Why is Tie Zheng's performance so astonishing?"

Cultivator Hao muttered in a low voice, "Natural Martial Dao..."

Although Tie Zheng's life experience was tragic, fortune and misfortune were intertwined. He cultivated alone in the wilderness, his mind harmonizing with the Martial Dao, realizing the wild nature within nature. He did not possess the craftsmanship of an Artifact Refiner, but relying on the special properties of Azure Flow Copper and the Profound Weapon Armor, he managed to refine this formidable Blade Beast, Sweeping Light.

A cultivator beside him judged, "With such a Blade Beast by his side, the winner of this Rising Cloud Minor Trial should be him. The only uncertainty remaining is whether he can capture the top rank."

The top rank of the Profound Armor Cave's Rising Cloud Minor Trial required the Cultivator to be first place and to hold at least nine pieces of Profound Weapon Armor. Neither of these two conditions could be missing.

The struggle between the three Golden Core cultivators had ended, but the battle between the Foundation Establishment Cultivators was still raging.

The might of the Blade Beast, Sweeping Light, left Tie Zheng unchallenged. The latter began to calmly pick up Profound Weapon Armors and refine them.

Lu Zeng and Ao Pan were eliminated one after another, leaving behind several Profound Weapon Armors. Combined with what Tie Zheng held, he already had more than nine. His advantage was huge, practically locking in the top rank.

Cultivator Hao looked toward Ning Zhuo, Ban Ji, and the others.

"The Foundation Establishment Cultivators are still infighting. If they can join forces, there is still a chance."

"Is there a possibility for Ban Ji and Ning Zhuo to join forces?"

The observing Cultivators all understood that for the Foundation Establishment Cultivators to join forces, the most critical factor was the attitude of these two people, Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji.

Ban Ji shouted loudly, "Ning Zhuo, stop quickly! Now is not the time for us to fight!"

"If we keep fighting, the top rank will fall to someone else."

Ning Zhuo snorted coldly, "The top rank has little meaning to me! I came here this time specifically to intercept you. Ban Ji, right now is the consequence and retribution for you plotting against me."

Ban Ji was furious, "You idiot!"

His eyes were filled with blood streaks, and his heart was incomparably anxious.

The Rising Cloud Minor Trial of the Profound Weapon Armor meant a great deal to him. According to the results of his divination, his goal for this trip was the top rank.

Ning Zhuo could not care, but Ban Ji did not have that luxury!

However, Ban Ji was now trapped in a siege; two fists were no match for four hands.

"Damn it! Damn Ning Zhuo, damn Human Tribulation!!" Just as Ban Ji was at his wit's end, with anger and hatred interwoven, several Cultivators suddenly changed their targets and launched a sneak attack on Ning Zhuo simultaneously.

"What?!" Ning Zhuo turned pale with fright. Caught off guard, his back was stabbed, and fresh blood spurted out.

He hurriedly turned around, pulling back his shield. As a result, he was kicked hard by an attacking Cultivator, and his entire body flew backward; the shield immediately flew from his hand.

The coordination between the sneaking Cultivators was seamless; one of them immediately acted, grabbing the shield firmly and suppressing it with full force.

Ning Zhuo flew down like a sack, crashing into the cave wall, and hurriedly rolled away.

The next moment, several bronze weapons slashed onto the cave wall, missing Ning Zhuo by a hair's breadth.

In the blink of an eye, the struggle among the Foundation Establishment group underwent another drastic change.

Ban Ji: ?!

The several Cultivators who acted against Ning Zhuo looked at Ban Ji and bowed in salute one after another.

"Young Master Ban, do not be suspicious. The Ban Family walks the Righteous Path and does good deeds. In early years, you showed kindness to the few of us; today, we shall repay it here."
