Chapter 693: A Young Man's Wealth: A Few Too Many Magic Treasures

The solid ice imprisoning Yuan Dasheng originated from a technique wielded by one of the Forbidden Army Commanders of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

This ice wasn't merely of the Water Element; it also embodied the principles of Profound Yin.

Ning Zhuo could penetrate the ice using his Water Element mastery, but his understanding of Profound Yin remained limited. Consequently, he couldn't devise a spell to counter the ice based solely on the Five Elements.

Meanwhile, the Yellow Dust enveloping Meng Yehu's entire body, though of the Earth Element, stemmed from a Divided Spirit of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

This meant it was no longer pure Earth Element, but retained the divine power of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Divided Spirit.

The Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan couldn't shake this divine power.

After all, it was merely a Magic Artifact, not a Magic Treasure.

Ning Zhuo possessed the materials to craft a Magic Treasure, but his natal magical technique hadn't yet matured. Even with a Magic Treasure-grade vessel, it couldn't unleash the full power of a Magic Treasure.

In fact, the inherent potency of a Magic Treasure might interfere with and erode the talismanic imprints of his natal magical technique.

Only when Ning Zhuo's Three Dantian all reached the Golden Core-level could he possess a Lifebound Treasure, rather than his current Lifebound Artifact.

With the Five Elements approach proving ineffective, Ning Zhuo examined his possessions, searching for a breakthrough.

The Buddha Heart Demon Seal had always resided within Ning Zhuo's divine sea, bringing him unexpected joy during the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts Battle and the Lord of the Forgetful River Battle.

However, its rank was too high and its nature too mysterious for Ning Zhuo to truly control it yet.

"But as my cultivation level rises, the power of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal's passive counterattacks has also increased significantly. After all, it relies on my strength to function."

Magic Artifacts, Magic Treasures, Spirit Treasures, Dao Treasures.

"Based on its current performance, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal clearly lacks sufficient spiritual energy to qualify as a Spirit Treasure. It likely belongs to the highest tier of Magic Treasures."

There were vast differences even among Magic Treasures.

Generally, Golden Core and Nascent Soul-level cultivators used Magic Treasures.

The disparities between Magic Treasures mirrored the gulf between Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivatorsâ€”sometimes as vast as heaven and earth.

In terms of quality, the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat possessed greater spiritual energy and could be considered a quasi-Spirit Treasure.

Ning Zhuo primarily used it to cultivate his Physical Body. This was largely thanks to the unorthodox methods developed by Sun Lingtong, which made the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat's body refinement techniques exceptionally efficient.

"I need to find an opportunity to repair the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat first."

The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat remained damaged, its surface riddled with cracks.

In the past, Ning Zhuo lacked both the ability to repair the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat and the inclination, thinking, "I'll burn it eventually anyway, so as long as it works, there's no point in fixing it."

But now, Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin had explicitly instructed him in the Jade Slip message to preserve the Spirit Boat and not destroy it.

This completely altered Ning Zhuo's plans for the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.

Over the past few months, Ning Zhuo had used the Spirit Boat more than any other magic treasure.

He had no choice; his physical body needed to be strengthened to withstand the immense pressure of the Million-Man Soul.

If left unchecked, this pressure would continuously damage his body due to the strain on his soul.

Besides the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, he also used several other magic treasures for cultivation, including the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor, the Evil Ghost Reversal Cauldron, and the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle.

Strictly speaking, the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor was a Military Treasure. Whenever Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong used it, they paired it with the High Victory Legacy, achieving remarkable results.

However, this cultivation method had a drawback: each stage of comprehension had to be fully mastered before progressing to the next. Otherwise, even if they gained some understanding, it would differ little from their previous insights.

"Old Sun can move on to the next stage now," Ning Zhuo thought. "He's already fully grasped the Light Body Swift Wind Formation. But I'm still a ways behind."

Ning Zhuo had previously comprehended the Hero's Return Technique.

This military strategy was exceptionally effective, far surpassing the Light Body Swift Wind Formation. Fully mastering it would still take some time.

"While this strategy is powerful, it has its limitations. For instance, during the battle in the Forgetful River Prefecture, the Qing-Jiao Army suffered minimal losses, leaving me with no opportunity to gain any enhancements."

"What I truly need is a Mechanical Army!"

Securing this would be no easy task.

Ning Zhuo had successfully established an army once before, but the Qing-Jiao Army's creation had been a result of perfect timing, with the heavens and earth aligning and multiple forces lending their support.

He had already emptied his coffers for that endeavor.

Now, simply being the Qing-Jiao Army's deputy commander wouldn't allow him to integrate a Mechanical Army into its ranks. The army's established Military Seed already precluded such a possibility.

Unless Ning Zhuo joined an army whose Military Seed recognized mechanical constructs, or, like in the Two Note Kingdom, directly enlisted in the national army, achieving his goal in one step.

The Hungry Ghost Reversal Cauldron was a soul-path magical treasure that could consume ghosts to produce Soul Essence in bulk. When combined with the other three treasures, it could significantly enhance one's Soul foundation.

In White Paper Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had used these treasures to elevate his Soul cultivation to the Million-Man Soul realm.

Currently, however, he couldn't use them. Ning Zhuo had temporarily halted his Soul cultivation to focus on strengthening his Physical Body foundation.

As for the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle, it was a Demon Treasure.

Only cultivators with demonic blood could truly unleash its power, making it incompatible with Ning Zhuo.

During a gamble of fate, Liu Er had been forced to gift this treasure to Ning Zhuo. Originally, Ning Zhuo had intended to explore the kettle's mysteries and devise a method for self-Dual Cultivation.

However, upon arriving at White Paper Immortal City, he discovered that the current White Paper City Lord coveted this Demon Treasure far more than he did!

In the future, Ning Zhuo planned to use this treasure to convert the White Paper City Lord's Yin Qi into Yang Qi. With this Yang Qi as leverage, the City Lord would have no choice but to comply with his demands, ensuring his inevitable success!

This would serve as Ning Zhuo's ultimate trump card to control the White Paper City Lord, exert continuous influence over her, and even dominate the Ghostly Black Marshlands!

The remaining magic treasures included the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, the Golden Light Collar, the Azure-White Jade Ring, and others.

The Great Primordial Dispersal Scale was a Legacy Treasure of the Profound Primordial Scholar.

It had first been seized by Luo Si, who then gifted it to Ning Zhuo. During the Black Cloud Battlefield, Ning Zhuo had comprehended the arrangements of Fate and used the scale to shatter the Yellow Dust Barrier.

The Great Primordial Dispersal Scale had played a crucial role in his success.

After the great battle in the Underworld Prefecture, Ning Zhuo attempted to refine the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, but was disappointed to find he had made absolutely no progress.

"I still haven't found the key," he mused.

"The Profound Primordial Scholar was a Void Refinement-level powerhouse. His construction of the White Paper Immortal City, the legacy treasures he left behind, and his secret deployment of the Paper Person army must all serve a purpose."

Ning Zhuo felt that unless he could decipher this purpose, he would never find the key to refining the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.

For now, however, his status as Vice City Lord of the White Paper Immortal City allowed him to freely wield the treasure.

Therefore, whether he could refine it or not was of little immediate consequence.

As for the Golden Light Collar and Azure-White Jade Ring, both were defensive magic treasures Ning Zhuo had acquired on the battlefield of the Two Note Kingdom, expending his accumulated war merits to obtain them.

He hadn't needed them during the subsequent Lord of the Forgetful River Battle.

The reason was simple: even activating both treasures simultaneously wouldn't provide enough additional defense to withstand a single strike from his enemies.

During that great battle, Ning Zhuo had relied primarily on the Azure Iron Han Armor - Golden Swallow, leaping and dodging along the razor's edge between life and death.

It was only during his battle with Lin Jinglong that Ning Zhuo finally deployed the Azure-White Jade Ring.

And it proved quite useful.

Lin Jinglong no longer used his magic treasures. Relying on the Azure-White Jade Ring, Ning Zhuo had become virtually invincible. No matter how Spring Thunder bombarded him, his body remained unshaken.

In addition to these defenses, he also possessed the Bone-Piercing Crocodile's stomach pouch.

Qing Yan had gifted Ning Zhuo the stomach pouch aboard the ship. Since it was made from Golden Core-level materials, the pouch itself qualified as a magic treasure.

The stomach pouch was designed to enhance the foundation of one's soul.

By projecting one's soul into the pouch, enduring its corrosive effects, and then recovering, one could greatly strengthen the soul's resilience.

However, the pouch had a limited number of uses, making this Golden Core-level magic treasure among the lowest tier.

Ning Zhuo had accepted it but never found time to use it. By the time he had the opportunity, he had already acquired Old Chef's Dark Cuisine and, shortly after, the Four Treasures of Soul Cultivation from the White Paper City Lord.

Compared to these, the stomach pouch's cultivation benefits paled in comparison. Ning Zhuo had never used it once, relegating it to the bottom of his storage chest.

Other unused items included the Dragon Qi Jade Pendant and the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal.

Ning Zhuo retrieved the Dragon Qi Jade Pendant, examined it briefly, and then put it away.

"This was a gift from Li Xiangshang. It cracked when I ascended the Sacrificial Altar to seize the Innate Talent."

"It must have played a crucial role, providing me with immense assistance."

"It's a pity that by the time I led the Qing-Jiao Army back to the Yang World, Li Xiangshang had already left White Paper Immortal City."

"However, he's cultivating along the Cang River, serving under the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign. If the opportunity arises, I'll seek him out for a discussion. Perhaps I can uncover the true purpose of the jade pendant."

As for the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal, it was utterly useless to Ning Zhuo.

"Perhaps I could use it to trade with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord in the future?"

"I'll wait and see."

"Unless the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord weakens to a critical point, I won't use this seal to bargain with him."

The Forgetful River Prefecture was currently under a full-scale assault from the Ghostfire Prefecture.

Ning Zhuo chose to observe the situation quietly.

"I can't allow the Ghostfire Prefecture to completely conquer the Forgetful River Prefecture. If they annex such a vast territory, their power will expand exponentially."

"The Ghostly Black Marshlands would then face not the relatively familiar Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, but the far more formidable Ghostfire Prefecture."

This was not what Ning Zhuo wanted.

What he needed was for the Forgetful River Prefecture and the Ghostfire Prefecture to remain locked in a protracted war, these two colossal powers locked in a stalemate, bleeding resources and unable to spare attention for other matters.

"Therefore, the opportunity to trade for the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal will only arise when the Forgetful River Prefecture is on the verge of collapse!"

After a thorough inventory, Ning Zhuo discovered he possessed over ten magic treasures.

This count included National Artifacts, Military Treasures, and similar items.

In any case, the sheer number of magic treasures at this level far exceeded what a Foundation Establishment cultivator should possess.

Let alone Foundation Establishment cultivators, even the vast majority of Golden Core cultivators would pale in comparison.

Considering their quality, treasures like the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle, and the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal would make even Nascent Soul cultivators green with envy, jealousy, and resentment.

When calculating these assets, Ning Zhuo deliberately excluded mechanical constructs, or the total would have been even higher.

Qi Bai alone carried four magic treasure-level mechanical components within his body.

Among mechanical constructs, Ning Zhuo used the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon most frequently.

The Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon had proven invaluable, especially during the Two Note Kingdom war, where it played a pivotal role.

The Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon possessed numerous empty compartments, offering immense potential for upgrades. Had it fallen into ordinary hands, they would likely have poured their efforts into its continuous improvement, working day and night to enhance its capabilities.

However, when the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon came into Ning Zhuo's possession, he only hastily upgraded it once while at the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, specifically for the Spirit Hidden Willow. After transplanting the willow, he merely maintained the vessel with minor repairs, neglecting further enhancements.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Ning were too preoccupied with their travels to spare the time or inclination for such endeavors.

Now, however, as they prepared to relocate the contents of the Jade Cleansing Pavilion's Immortal Abode, the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon was undergoing its second round of upgrades.

The Golden Core-level Mechanical Puppets included:

Buddha Physician Meng Yaoyin Heavy-Armored Blood Ape Dasheng Shadow Blade Night Tiger Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor * Azure Iron Han Armor - Golden Swallow

Among these, Buddha Physician Meng Yaoyin wielded Strange Path techniques, granting her combat prowess rivaling that of a Nascent Soul cultivator.

In addition to these, there were:

Netherworld Envoy - Qi Bai Milk Butterfly Lady Mechanism Ring Floating Ice White Jade Hand * Weather Orb - Ice Crystal Snow

Beyond these, there were mass-produced, mature mechanisms such as:

Blazing Monkeys Firewalking Snakes Thunder Silence Birds Golden Swallow Tridents

Next came various mechanical components, such as the Up-and-Down Ruyi Cord, the Topknot-Fishing Death Whip, the Riveted Rapid-Fire Crossbow, the Hanging Ring, and the Half-Dead, Half-Alive Pearl.

Many of the medicinal pills had been consumed by Ning Zhuo during his travels. The most valuable remaining item was the Nine Springs Tranquil Incense, one of the Four Treasures of Soul Cultivation from White Paper Immortal City.

Spirit Food couldn't be stored for long, so there was a large quantity of Ice Jade Wine and a small amount of Bitter Cold True Water. The most valuable item was the Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine, another of the Four Treasures of Soul Cultivation.

There were numerous talismans. The Three Palaces Interlocking Treasure Talisman had once been invaluable to Ning Zhuo, but it was no longer needed. The Slick and Smooth Talisman and the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman even contained traces of spiritual energy! The Directional Void Escape Talisman and the Substitute Talisman provided Ning Zhuo with greater margin for error.

"But during the Lord of the Wangchuan Battle, none of these talismans could be used."

"In truly high-level combat, these talismans are simply too low-grade."

Only a few materials remained. Ning Zhuo had invested all the Heavenly Ghost's wealth into building the Qing-Jiao Army.

There were several Western Pure Lands, over a hundred Ghost Path Golden Cores, and a large pile of materials salvaged from disassembled magic treasures and Magic Artifacts.

Supreme Goodness Like Water and Fire Within Wood had already been used up.

The Spirit Stone shortage was severe!

The most valuable item was the Stone Monster's corpse, but Ning Zhuo couldn't afford to use it. He might need it later to impersonate the Old Stone Monster in the Thousand Peaks Forest.

Among the materials, Ning Zhuo spotted thirteen stalks of Ghost Shadow Bamboo. He had originally planned to study Meng Yehu's design plans and keep the bamboo for future use.

Now that Meng Yehu had fully adopted Golden Core-level materials, these Foundation Establishment-level Ghost Shadow Bamboo stalks were no longer useful.

Ning Zhuo had also gradually collected a small pile of books, including the Ice Sculpture Secret Manual, Collection of Serpentine Springing Array Formations, Yin Bone Manual, Netherworld Heart Sutra, Detailed Explanation of Soul Guiding Techniques, Minor Blood Demon Dissection Technique, Dead Moon's Offering Song, Great Celestial Burial Canon, the Jiao Family Jade Slip, the Myriad Manifestations Sutra (Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment chapters), the Chef Elder's Legacy, and more.
