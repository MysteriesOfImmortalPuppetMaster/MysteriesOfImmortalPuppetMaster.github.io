Chapter 234: Accepting the Examination

Ning Zhuo's Residence.

Zhu Xuanji and Ning Zhuo stood facing each other.

Ning Zhuo's breathing was steady, but his heart was tight.

He thought to himself, "This moment has finally arrived."

Ever since Zhu Xuanji appeared and entered Fire Persimmon Immortal City...

Ever since Ning Zhuo came into contact with the Three Sect Superior Techniques and decided to cultivate these three techniques...

Ning Zhuo had already anticipated this moment.

No, to be precise, the anticipation started even earlier, more than a decade ago, when Ning Zhuo had already foreseen this day.

He had long expected that his cultivation would be examined.

He had also prepared for this early on.

However, when the moment of the test truly arrived, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel his heart race.

If it were any other Golden Core Stage cultivator, it would be fine, but facing Zhu Xuanji, who possessed the Golden Eyes talent, Ning Zhuo had no experience and couldn't grasp the details.

As a Qi Refining Stage cultivator, Ning Zhuo had to conceal his true cultivation from a Golden Core Stage cultivator, which was extremely difficult.

The accelerated heartbeat of Ning Zhuo was immediately noticed by Zhu Xuanji.

He said softly, "Your heart is beating a bit fast. Why, are you feeling nervous?"

Ning Zhuo grinned, "Of course, Lord Zhu. Is this Demonic Blood Vein Technique really compatible with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique? Is the rumored Three Sect Superior Techniques true?" Ning Zhuo's face was full of anticipation for the Three Sect Superior Techniques.

Concerning his path of cultivation and the Three Sect Superior Techniques, it was natural for his heart to beat a little faster.

Zhu Xuanji chuckled, "Since you asked, I'll tell you some good news. From what we have seen so far, the Demonic Dao Scripture we obtained is indeed compatible with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique."

"Although this Demonic Dao Scripture only goes up to the fifth level of the Qi Refining Stage, from these contents, it is already evident that it has some connection with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique." Then, Zhu Xuanji changed the topic, "The Three Sect Superior Techniques cultivate the upper, middle, and lower dantian respectively. Once you can use these three techniques to establish your foundation, your future will undoubtedly be bright. In this world, techniques that can establish a foundation using three dantians are extremely rare!"

"So this time, I will not only check your Qi Sea but also your Essence Sea. I will also examine your Divine Sea. How about that?"

Could Ning Zhuo refuse?

He immediately showed a look of joy and eagerly said, "Lord Zhu, that would be wonderful! Please, go ahead and examine me thoroughly."

As Ning Zhuo spoke, he secretly activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and the Hidden Cloud Bud under his tongue.

These two treasures were the key to resisting the examination!

Zhu Xuanji emitted a trace of blood energy, which penetrated Ning Zhuo's body, delving deep into his Essence Sea lower dantian.

Apart from the magical artifact, only blood energy could enter and exit the lower dantian Essence Sea.

Zhu Xuanji's blood energy carried his divine sense, circling above Ning Zhuo's Essence Sea, taking in its entirety.

The Hidden Cloud Bud played its role, firmly covering the true appearance of the Essence Sea, showing Zhu Xuanji only the scene that Ning Zhuo had deliberately arranged.

Ning Zhuo had been training this for over a decade.

He was already so familiar with it that it had become as instinctive as breathing.

Zhu Xuanji's exploration of the Essence Sea revealed that it was similar to that of ordinary cultivators, albeit with a slightly deeper foundation.

After all, Ning Zhuo had been consuming a lot of spiritual food recently.

Zhu Xuanji retracted his blood energy and then infused his magical power into Ning Zhuo's body.

Similarly, his magical power also carried his divine sense.

Zhu Xuanji's magical power entered Ning Zhuo's middle dantian Qi Sea, where he saw five-colored clouds surging, sensing that Ning Zhuo's cultivation had reached the fourth level, already at the peak of the fourth level.

"It seems that the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique is indeed very suitable for you."

Zhu Xuanji praised lightly and withdrew his magical power.

Finally, he directly released his divine sense to probe Ning Zhuo's upper dantian Divine Sea.

The Divine Sea was Ning Zhuo's most fortified area.

Not only was there the Hidden Cloud Bud to cover the true scene, but the Buddha Heart Demon Seal was also there to suppress and deceive.

As expected, Zhu Xuanji's sweep revealed an empty Divine Sea, but its capacity was large.

This made Zhu Xuanji think of Ning Zhuo's talent.

To this day, Ning Zhuo's talent had not been tested by the Ning family.

But from Ning Zhuo's Divine Sea, some clues could be seen.

Zhu Xuanji withdrew his divine sense.

The golden glimmers in his eyes also dissipated.

"I have good news for you. Very good!"

"All three of your dantians are suitable for cultivating the Three Sect Superior Techniques."

"You have talent, and the talent lies in your Divine Sea. From this point of view, the path of divine cultivation is most suitable for you. Just like the Void Sect's core technique—Void Technique, which specializes in the Divine Sea and also cultivates the Essence Sea."

"Do you know about the Void Sect?"

"Perhaps... you are more familiar with Sun Lingtong."

Ning Zhuo replied, "Of course, I know Sun Lingtong. He was the controller of the last round of the black market."

"As for my talent, I have considered it too."

"But I think the Three Sect Superior Techniques suit me better. Now that I have obtained the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique and the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, maybe in the future, I can also get the Divine Sea cultivation technique for the upper dantian."

Zhu Xuanji nodded, "Indeed."

He looked seriously at Ning Zhuo, "But I must remind you, don't be too complacent. Although we have obtained the Demonic Dao Scripture, your situation is still somewhat dangerous."

Ning Zhuo showed a puzzled expression, "Lord Zhu, what do you mean?"

"The reason I am in danger is that many people previously thought the Demonic Dao Scripture was in my hands. Now that the Demonic Dao Scripture has emerged and was taken by the ancestor of the Zheng family, many people saw this."

The battle among the Golden Core cultivators had attracted much attention.

In the Immortal City, the scale of cultivators was large, and they had mastered many techniques, making it easy to observe the battlefield from afar.

Zhu Xuanji sighed.

"On the surface, it seems so."

"But to be honest with you, I feel that things are not that simple."

Ning Zhuo immediately cupped his fists and bowed deeply, "Please, Lord Zhu, enlighten me."

Zhu Xuanji sighed again, "Ning Zhuo, you have seen puppet shows, right? Now I feel like there is a hidden hand behind the scenes."

"The recent Golden Core battle was like a puppet show, with all the participating Golden Core cultivators acting like puppets, completely unaware."

"The stage just now might have been deliberately set up by the hidden hand."

Ning Zhuo was stunned, "Lord Zhu, are you referring to the City Lord's Mansion?"

"Indeed, during the recent battle, only Chi Han from the City Lord's Mansion took action, while Fei Si did not. And the City Lord himself remained an observer. If he had taken action, he could have suppressed the entire scene."

Zhu Xuanji shook his head and sighed, "It's difficult to make him take action. You may not understand his style. To make him personally intervene, the situation must be extremely urgent."

"Perhaps it is the City Lord's Mansion?"

Ning Zhuo said, "As for investigating the case, Lord Zhu, I don't understand much. But I believe that you will definitely succeed!"

Zhu Xuanji's expression changed slightly, and he smiled, "You seem to have a lot of confidence in me."

Ning Zhuo chuckled, "Of course, because you are the divine constable, you are Zhu Xuanji, who investigates and ensures the safety of the people. You are the most righteous person I have ever seen. The righteous path will surely prevail."

Zhu Xuanji was slightly taken aback, seriously examining the young man in front of him.

Ning Zhuo's eyes were clear, and he spoke sincerely, revealing his firm belief in the righteous path at that moment.

Seeing such a Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji seemed to see his younger self.

Like Ning Zhuo, he was also full of firm belief in the righteous path.

Zhu Xuanji laughed again, "You little rascal, was framing Yuan Dasheng also part of your righteous path?"

Ning Zhuo spread his hands, "The Monkey Head Gang was originally a gang of black market origins. Besides, what does it matter if I get rid of a monkey?"

"And as for the black market, this is what I think."

"If I control the black market, I can make it more orderly, maintain stability, and reduce bloodshed. At the same time, I can make my clan live better."

"Then why shouldn't I do it?"

"I feel that the three major families all want to meddle in the black market, but they care too much about their reputation."

"I also care about my reputation, but I can't help it, I need to eat."

"I have to fill my stomach first before I can practice my righteous path and help my clan."

Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly and patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder, "At least you are pragmatic."

With that, Zhu Xuanji took his leave.

Ning Zhuo escorted him to the courtyard gate, watching until Zhu Xuanji disappeared from sight.

Ning Zhuo turned back into the courtyard, his eyebrows gradually rising, and his face showing more and more joy.

After returning to his room and closing the door, he couldn't help but clench his fists and raise his arms in excitement.

From this action, it was clear—he was very happy.

After all, he had not only obtained the Demonic Blood Vein Technique but also received Zhu Xuanji's recognition of his talent.

He was also told that cultivating the Three Sect Superior Techniques simultaneously was completely feasible.

With a face full of excitement, Ning Zhuo entered the underground chamber to begin his cultivation.

However, whether studying the mechanical constructs' texts or sitting in meditation, he was somewhat distracted.

From time to time, he would pause and grin foolishly.

These small actions revealed his youthful nature.

Occasionally, he would furrow his brows, showing some doubt, as if recalling the last conversation with Zhu Xuanji.

But then he would shake his head, as if saying, "Why think about this? If the sky falls, there are taller people to hold it up!"

He even murmured to himself, "Isn't there still Lord Zhu Xuanji?"
