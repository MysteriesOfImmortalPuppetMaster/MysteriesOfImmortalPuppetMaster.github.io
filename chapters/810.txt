Chapter 810: Dao-Bearing Jade Page (Part 1)

The Five Elements are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth; the Five Viscera are the Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, and Kidney. The Five Elements belong to the Five Viscera, each performing its own function, generating and overcoming one another in an endless cycle...

This was the content of the Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art. It could be said to gather the essence of heaven and earth, harmonizing the wonders of the Five Elements, possessing profound Dao and principles.

After the Five Elements God Lord imparted it to Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo found he could not cultivate it.

The big-headed youth had already cultivated the Three Sects' Supreme Methods, and all three dantians were occupied. He could only modify the Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art, turning it into a spell.

This spell consisted of five chapters, corresponding respectively to the five elements of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. To cultivate it successfully, one had to consume the True Essence of the Five Elements, starting with materials at least ten thousand years old.

From another perspective, this was essentially taking the principles of ten-thousand-year-grade Five Elements True Essence and amplifying them upon one's own Five Viscera.

The cost was exorbitant, but the effects were superb. During his time in the Two Note Kingdom, Ning Zhuo relied on three of these elements to repeatedly deliver stunning performances on the battlefield.

Now, at the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he still relied on this to perfectly control the three-colored flames right from his first attempt.

Once he utilized the Spirit Gods within his Five Viscera Temple, he could control Five Elements spells to the peak of perfection. Therefore, even Five Elements spells he was trying for the first time could be cast decently, saving him a massive amount of effort in practicing spells.

With such flames, Ning Zhuo successfully passed the second chapter.

Zhao Hansheng read the third chapter aloud: "Its warp and weft correspond to the celestial measures above. The Weaving Girl pauses her shuttle, borrowing the ingenuity of the Heavenly Granddaughter; Lu Ban severs his hand, imitating the loom of creation. Weaving clouds and rosy mists as the weft, stitching stars and the Dipper as the warp. When first formed, it resembles the hidden River Map; upon second glance, it looks like the floating Luo Scroll..."

The gathered cultivators: "??"

Ning Zhuo listened carefully, his brows furrowed tight. He initially judged that this step of papermaking involved at least three fields: astrology, mathematical calculation, and weaving techniques.

"'Its warp and weft correspond to the celestial measures above' - this is explaining the correspondence between astrology and weaving."

"'Luo Scroll' does not refer to the Dao Artifact Luo Shu, but should refer to mathematical deduction."

"No wonder there is a mechanical loom on the stall."

Ning Zhuo cast his gaze toward the stall in front of him. As they reached the third chapter, new precious materials and tools were transported over.

The main frame of the loom was made of metal with a dark silver luster, inlaid with twenty-eight gemstones arranged according to the constellations. The shuttle was even more exquisite, transparent throughout, with seven-colored flowing light swirling inside.

A knowledgeable cultivator recognized it: "This is a loom made of Star Meteoric Iron. Is that Rainbow Light True Essence sealed inside the shuttle?"

Ning Zhuo ran his hand over the loom, probing it with his divine sense, and quickly understood it thoroughly. He was a mechanism cultivator after all; this was exactly his area of expertise.

More cultivators cast their divine sense toward Gu Qing.

Gu Qing began.

He drew out fine threads from the Literary Light Pulp. After the tempering of the second chapter, these threads were as tough as silk, yet lighter and softer.

The threads were arranged on the loom: eighty-one vertical warp threads and eighty-one horizontal weft threads.

Gu Qing's weaving speed slowed down noticeably. He knew very well that this step was critical. The quantity of fine threads was limited; if he made too many mistakes, he would have to start refining from scratch.

Slow work yields fine detail.

Gu Qing's every stitch was incredibly precise. Accompanying this, with every intersection he wove, the runes he softly chanted would fall upon it, and the corresponding gemstone on the loom would shimmer slightly.

Gradually, a faint Nine Palaces pattern emerged on the woven paper base.

"Is this the Nine Palaces Numerology? That is the most obscure and difficult of all formations." Many cultivators watching this scene felt despair.

Gu Qing was weaving a formation into the paper base, and Ning Zhuo was studying it as well.

After mastering the loom, Ning Zhuo frowned; he had encountered trouble. "My Literary Light Pulp was not as excellent as Gu Qing's from the start. Even after the tempering in the second chapter, it is only the size of a fist."

According to Ning Zhuo's understanding of the third chapter, he discovered that the number of complete threads he could draw from his base material was likely only around one hundred.

But the third chapter required eighty-one.

"The room for error left for me is very small."

"It's my first attempt at papermaking, yet I can only afford to make mistakes twenty-odd times."

"Weaving techniques..."

This was one of the hundred arts of cultivation, but Ning Zhuo was not skilled in it.

"However..."

Ning Zhuo dug through his memories and quickly discovered that among the demonic cultivators he had absorbed earlier, some had dabbled in this path.

He reviewed it briefly before beginning to operate the mechanical loom.

At the same time, he transmitted a thought via divine sense, contacting Sun Lingtong through Life Hanging by a Thread: "Boss, help me!"

"Coming!" Sun Lingtong had long been prepared. He immediately activated his Spirit Eyes, rubbed off the buffing effect of the Luo Shu, and passed it to Ning Zhuo through the Life Hanging by a Thread.

With the aid of the Luo Shu, the mechanical loom, and the demonic cultivator's memories, Ning Zhuo's weaving speed was even slower than Gu Qing's.

Vertical is the warp, horizontal is the weft; the warp is Heaven, the weft is Earth; only when Heaven and Earth interweave is a world formed.

What was important was not the tangible threads, but the intangible principles described in the form of a formation.

Weaving was listed as one of the hundred arts of cultivation not because it simply wove structures, but because it wove principles and materials together into a unified whole.

A deeper level of weaving involved the deeper restructuring and arrangement of one's own internal self.

This was not something Ning Zhuo could touch upon at present.

Every cultivation art was broad and profound, filled, expanded, improved, and accumulated by countless predecessors and sages.

Fortunately, the weaving technique involved in this papermaking process did not require such profound depth.

Three distinct time periods (six hours) later, Ning Zhuo wiped the sweat from his forehead, looked at the finished product before him, and exhaled a breath of turbid air.

By the end of this chapter, fewer than nine hundred people remained in the venue.

Zhao Hansheng chanted: "As for the Golden Crow dropping a feather, melting into flowing cinnabar; the Jade Rabbit leaves behind essence, condensing into flying white. Where Lord Han loosened his clothes in a grand manner, his spirit swallowed the Cloud Dream; when Mi Dian's sleeves were dripping wet, his spirit captured Emei. A single point of consonance penetrates the white soul, three parts of bright moon enter the ice silk..."

The cultivators: ???

The difficulty of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page papermaking method skyrocketed again. It was almost entirely composed of literary imagery, raising the threshold for comprehension once more!

Many cultivators stared at Gu Qing, sizing him up, wanting to imitate him.

But this time, Gu Qing realized his situation. He gave a faint smile, stood with his hands clasped, and remained motionless.

The cultivators' expressions changed slightly, and they secretly became anxious.

Some of them had indeed made it this far by fishing in troubled waters and copying Gu Qing. But Gu Qing suddenly stopping caused them to lose their direction.

Not to mention anything else, just eliminating the interference from the various materials and finding the correct ones was not something they could accomplish.

Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought: "'Golden Crow dropping a feather' refers to the morning glow; 'Jade Rabbit leaves behind essence' should be the moonlight. 'Lord Han loosened his clothes' describes a mental state, or perhaps divine sense? 'Mi Dian's sleeves' must refer to the splash-ink technique in calligraphy..."

Ning Zhuo deliberated thoroughly three times. Once he finished considering, he selected the new materials that had appeared on the stall.

He took out two jade bottles: one bottle was scorching hot, sealing a wisp of purple-red light inside; the other was icy cold, containing a mass of silver-white mist.

Then he took out two small boxes. Upon opening them, one contained black ashes, and the other contained pale gold powder.

Gu Qing cast his divine sense toward Ning Zhuo, observing quietly. Seeing this scene, his heart stirred: "He chose correctly."

"Worthy of being my great enemy."

"The difficulty here is too low for him; it's impossible to stop him."

More and more cultivators began to pay attention to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo began to mix the colors.

He first mixed the four materials, adding Literary Heart Spring Water. The resulting color was not fixed; it shifted between purple-red, silver-white, and pale gold, as if it were alive.

Ning Zhuo picked up the brush.

There were multiple brushes provided on the stall. The one Ning Zhuo selected had a shaft of hundred-year purple bamboo and bristles capable of mixing white horse tail with black sable hair.

He soaked the brush in the mixed color and held it suspended over the paper base.

Ning Zhuo's gaze was heavy and concentrated. He took a deep breath before starting.

Right from the start, his movements were bold and sweeping, as if he weren't dyeing paper, but wildly wielding the fine brush in his hand.

Waving the brush, the force penetrated the back of the paper!

Half an incense stick of time later.

On the paper base, the greenish-gray background tumbled like a sea of clouds, golden nodes twinkled like stars, and a silver wash flowed like moonlight.

It was exactly "Spirit swallowing the Cloud Dream, Spirit capturing Emei"!

Seeing this, Zhao Hansheng lowered his eyelids slightly.

Ning Zhuo passed this chapter as well.

Seeing Ning Zhuo refine a finished product, many cultivators hesitated whether to imitate him. Some took action, while others continued to watch Gu Qing.

Gu Qing waited for a while longer before beginning his crafting.

His steps and movements were very similar to Ning Zhuo's, but his efficiency was extremely high, and his brushwork was far more skilled than Ning Zhuo's.

He was a Confucian cultivator; he was simply too adept at using a brush.

Precisely because of this, he knew it would take him little time, so he had nothing to fear and waited until the last moment to start.

In the end, Gu Qing's paper base had magnificent colors and a majestic artistic conception, its quality higher than Ning Zhuo's.

Many cultivators sighed and groaned. They saw the correct direction clearly, but there was too little time left for them. Many were eliminated because they ran out of time. Some were nervous and made mistakes in their haste, getting eliminated early.

After being eliminated, these cultivators looked at Gu Qing with hatred.

Those who remained, however, looked expectantly at Ning Zhuo, their eyes containing gratitude.

With a small trick, Gu Qing caused half of the participants to be eliminated in this chapter. Only a little over four hundred people remained in the field.

The Fifth Chapter:

"Viewing the sinking jade of the Miluo, the Chu songs still remain; gazing at the falling tears of Mount Xian, the Yang Tablet is still warm. Gather the solitary indignation of Qu Yuan chanting by the marsh, capture the heroic talent of Jia Yi's strategies in Luoyang. Draw further upon the beauty of the crimson flowers of Ye Water, steal the brilliance of the purple clouds of Mount Zhong..."

One had to throw the paper base into a cauldron, consume Literary Qi, and refine a Literary Soul.

Nearly two hundred people were eliminated.

The Sixth Chapter:

"Of old, Confucius heard the Shao music and forgot the taste of meat for three months; Zhuangzi dreamed of a butterfly, forever losing his track in ancient times. Take the mirror of the square inch of the Spirit Platform, capture the shadows of the myriad phenomena of the great universe. Cause the qi of the Kun Peng's ocean journey to dissolve into the tip of a hair; let the icy demeanor of the Gu She mountain hide within the warp and weft..."

This chapter required using the magic artifact "Spirit Communication Mirror" to perform "Shadow Capture and Image Transfer," capturing a total of thirty-six types of imagery, corresponding to the number of Heavenly Tiangang stars.

Then, pressing the mirror onto the paper base, one had to operate the transfer method described in the chapter. The images in the mirror had to be transferred one by one into the depths of the paper base.

This step required extremely high control of divine sense and consumed the cultivator's mental energy the most.

The thirty-six transfers had to be done in one go; they could not be interrupted midway.

After completing this step, Gu Qing's face was as pale as paper, his body tottering. Conversely, Ning Zhuo remained calm.

The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual was exactly what he excelled at, but Ning Zhuo's flaw was that his divine sense wasn't strong or deep enough. After understanding this chapter, he decisively took pills to temporarily boost the strength and depth of his divine sense, thus passing this chapter smoothly.

At this point, fewer than a hundred cultivators remained in the field.

The Seventh Chapter:

"The Records of the Artificers states: Heaven has its times, Earth has its qi. Therefore, gather the morning glow in spring, collect the noon sleet in summer, pluck the evening mist in autumn, and accept the night dew in winter. Once the essence of the four seasons is prepared, erect the armillary sphere to measure the stars, and set up the gnomon to correct the shadow. Let the Xuanji rotate without being fitted, let the Jade Heng circulate before it is touched..."

Ning Zhuo's heart shook slightly; he realized this step was actually to imprint space-time into the paper base.

Gu Qing immediately took action, carefully selecting the essence qi of the four seasons from over a hundred jade bottles.

They were: Beginning of Spring Green Dragon, Spring Equinox Yin-Yang, Beginning of Summer Vermilion Bird, Summer Solstice Sun Essence, Beginning of Autumn White Tiger, Autumn Equinox Moon Essence, Beginning of Winter Black Tortoise, and Winter Solstice Starlight.

Using a mechanical Armillary Sphere and a Gui Biao, he placed the paper base inside the Armillary Sphere and began refining.

He opened the jade bottles in order. Every time one opened, a stream of essence qi surged out, guided by the Armillary Sphere to shine upon the paper base at a specific angle.

The Armillary Sphere rotated slowly, allowing the paper base to receive the illumination of the seasonal essences from different angles...

More than four hours later, Gu Qing harvested the finished product.

Near perfect!

He was far ahead once again.

Ning Zhuo barely finished in the final quarter of an hour.

At this moment, gazing at the paper base, he felt as if he were looking up at the cosmic firmament, sensing a vastness and profundity he had never felt before.

After this chapter passed, only thirty-odd people remained.

Gu Qing's eyes flickered slightly, a feeling of disappointment surfacing from the bottom of his heart.

He had just seen the possibility of Ning Zhuo being eliminated, but in the end, Ning Zhuo held on.

The Eighth Chapter:

"The Book of Changes says: Like sounds respond to each other, like qi seeks like. Thus, though Bo Ya smashed his qin, the sound did not vanish from the human world; when Xiang Xiu heard the flute, it was truly the passing of the torch. Draw the tears of weeping bamboo as glue, gather the stone of the bird carrying wood as the medium. Make severed gold connectable, make the separated able to unite..."

The expressions of the thirty-odd people who had persevered changed one after another. Many furrowed their brows, revealing anxiety and unease.

These people possessed real skills; listening and comprehending as they went, they heard that they needed to refine the precious material "Kindred Spirit Glue." This material was quite critical, but the refining process was complicated, requiring over eighty types of materials like Kun Fish Swim Bladder Glue, Weeping Bamboo Morning Dew, Flying Bird Stone, and so on.

Most critically, it required the method of Sound Refining, necessitating either a Qin or a Xiao flute, with using both simultaneously being even better.

"Fortunately, I previously obtained the inheritance [Empty Valley Note Joint Green Machine Tube], which allowed me to master sound techniques."

"But there is still a sticking point I can't figure out!"

At this point, the Confucian classics involved became increasingly obscure and difficult, and there were things even Ning Zhuo couldn't quite grasp.

Confucian Technique - Head Suspended from a Beam!

Confucian Technique - Thigh Pricking Awl!

Ning Zhuo's hair was suspended in the air by an invisible force, and with a wooden cone in hand, 'pu-chi' 'pu-chi', he stabbed the inner flesh of his thigh until it was a bloody mess.

Layers of memory became vivid, his thoughts became more penetrating, and as he pondered, he broke through layer after layer of obstacles, advancing by leaps and bounds!

Gu Qing's breath was slightly ragged. Physical and mental exhaustion was accumulating, clearly affecting his state.

He had never had such a papermaking experience.

"I have successfully created the Dao-Bearing Jade Page many times before, but I have never felt it to be this difficult."

"The pressure is too great!"

He subconsciously scanned the cultivators present with his divine sense, pausing especially on Ning Zhuo.

In the previous four rounds, Ning Zhuo had brought him immense pressure, embarrassing him several times. Gu Qing's reputation had plummeted accordingly, and he had been forced to the edge of a cliff.

He had to prove himself in this round and restore his prestige!
