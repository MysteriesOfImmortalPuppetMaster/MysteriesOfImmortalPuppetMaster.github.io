Chapter 229: The Third Layer of Rumors

Ning Zhuo left the martial arts arena and returned to his residence.

From his appearance, it was clear that his previous tension had vanished, replaced by a confident stride, head held high, and a vigorous spirit, with no trace of the previous oppression.

He returned to his underground training room, took out the mechanical classics, and quickly became engrossed in them, focusing intently.

He went to his workbench, picked up the scattered mechanical parts from the ground, and began disassembling and replacing them, continuing his research on mechanical constructs.

He worked until lunchtime.

Pushing the door open, he went to the dining hall and ate several bowls of rice.

These dishes were quite luxurious, all being spirit food! Despite Ning Zhuo's current cultivation at the ninth layer peak, he still consumed a large amount of spirit food daily as a disguise.

After a hearty meal, Ning Zhuo returned to the underground training chamber.

This time, he activated the Floating Cloud Cloak, enveloping himself in layers of floating clouds, pretending to cultivate the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.

The Cloud Concealment Bud under his tongue, infused with Ning Zhuo's magical power, helped him disguise himself.

In the perception of Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan, Ning Zhuo appeared to be cultivating the fourth layer of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.

After finishing his meditation, Ning Zhuo rested briefly, then closed his eyes within the floating clouds and directly entered the Immortal Palace with his soul.

"You're here!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been silently observing Ning Zhuo.

Seeing Ning Zhuo enter the Immortal Palace again, it silently cheered for him.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit never imagined that one day it would secretly support Ning Zhuo, wishing he could pass the Dao Gate path in one go.

"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit?" Ning Zhuo called out tentatively.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shrank back, hearing him but not wanting to respond.

It tried to avoid communicating with Ning Zhuo as much as possible.

Reflecting on their last conversation, it felt it had said too much, really too much!

Having learned from his previous failure in exploring the Dao Gate path, Ning Zhuo chose spirit stones as rewards from the start this time.

He had already claimed the rewards from the leaderboard once, and the next claim was four days away.

But relying solely on the spirit stones from passing the stages, he had accumulated quite a number.

When Ning Zhuo reached the final stage of the Dao Gate path again, his spirit power reserves were at least thirty percent higher than before.

Yet, he failed once more. "My spell proficiency still needs improvement... but this requires extensive practice and can't be rushed. If I have more spirit stones, I can still use the method of passing the stages by quantity!"

Ning Zhuo discovered the method to pass the stages.

Either refine spell techniques or summarize experiences, with a comprehensive and detailed strategy, calculating every step meticulously to accumulate a quantitative advantage.

While Ning Zhuo was breaking through the stages, Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan kept a close watch on him.

"This Floating Cloud Cloak is somewhat troublesome," Ning Jiufan remarked.

Most of his detection spells couldn't perfectly bypass the Floating Cloud Cloak, always causing significant consumption of the floating clouds. "This should be an inheritance from Ning Zhuo's mother. The techniques from the Flying Cloud Kingdom indeed differ greatly from those of our Southern Bean Kingdom."

The layers of floating clouds enveloping Ning Zhuo made Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan less inclined to observe him closely.

Zhu Xuanji continued, "It seems Ning Zhuo has completely calmed down. His temperament has undergone a transformation, which is very good. He has withstood this test, proving to be a good seedling for cultivation. Brother Ning, I must congratulate you."

Ning Jiufan smiled slightly, genuinely pleased.

He had witnessed Ning Zhuo's performance over the past couple of days.

The latter had indeed made significant progress in temperament.

Coupled with Ning Zhuo's innate talent, he was destined to become a pillar of the Ning family!

"Who's there?" Suddenly, Zhu Xuanji shouted.

His eyes shone brightly, emitting golden light.

In an instant, his gaze was so sharp that Ning Jiufan had to avert his eyes to avoid direct contact.

Zhu Xuanji disappeared instantly, leaving only a faint golden shadow in Ning Jiufan's vision.

Boom! The next moment, Ning Jiufan heard a violent explosion.

He quickly turned his head and saw Zhu Xuanji fiercely clashing with a mysterious strong enemy.

Ning Jiufan hurriedly intervened, rushing over.

Zhu Xuanji waved his hand, and a golden light wall appeared out of thin air, enveloping Ning Zhuo, giving an impression of being impregnable.

The mysterious enemy, wrapped in green spell light, was rapidly retreating. "Where do you think you're going!" Zhu Xuanji pursued relentlessly.

The green spell light was shattered by him, revealing the enemy's appearance.

She had a graceful figure and a face like a peach blossom.

"Void Sect, Yang Chanyu!" Instantly, the identity of the mysterious enemy flashed in Ning Jiufan's mind.

Yang Chanyu, while retreating rapidly, smiled.

Her eyes emitted green light, staring intently at Ning Zhuo, who was still in the Immortal Palace.

Clearly, this was a detection spell.

The green light retracted, and Yang Chanyu smiled lightly, "I see." After saying this, she turned, her speed increasing, leaving only a pink afterimage as she disappeared into the shadows of the street. "I'll chase! You stay here," Zhu Xuanji said, then hurriedly pursued.

Ning Jiufan concealed himself, coming directly to Ning Zhuo's side.

He pushed his magical power to the limit but restrained his aura, not leaking a trace, standing ready.

Hearing the commotion, the Foundation Establishment guards also rushed over.

They were astonished by the golden light wall's presence, unaware of Ning Jiufan's invisible presence nearby.

Zhu Xuanji and Yang Chanyu continued their chase and battle, causing explosions and the collapse of buildings, echoing like thunder throughout the night, alarming the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Ning Zhuo's soul was still in the Lava Immortal Palace, his body surrounded by the golden light wall.

Outside the light wall, Foundation Establishment guards stood in heavy defense, tightly protecting him.

After the disturbance, the floating clouds returned to their place, shielding Ning Zhuo securely.

However, the previous display showed that such defense was extremely fragile against a Golden Core Stage opponent, almost like a decoration.

In a certain restaurant, the continuous explosions drew the attention of the diners, who got up and went to the windows to watch the commotion.

Taking this opportunity, Sun Lingtong, disguised as a middle-aged man, flashed and disappeared under the table.

The secret monitors only had their view blocked for a moment, and when they looked again, the target had completely vanished.

"Where is he?" Feeling something was wrong, the monitors immediately ran to the scene, looking around Sun Lingtong's previous dining table, searching anxiously. "Find him quickly! He can't be far. He must be nearby!"

"Who is so inconsiderate?" "Using detection spells on me!" The pursuers looked grim, some directly activating detection spells, scanning all the diners on the floor.

Some diners immediately turned hostile.

Such detection spells were quite strong and were a severe offense to those being scanned.

But the next moment, the spellcasters released their auras, each showing a fierce expression.

There were six of them, each with Foundation Establishment cultivation! Their combined auras immediately suppressed the entire scene.

The diners who had wanted to retaliate turned pale, sweating profusely, and dared not speak.

This display made them realize they had offended ruthless individuals, likely from a force they couldn't provoke.

The pursuers searched frantically, quickly expanding their search to the entire restaurant, but they still couldn't find Sun Lingtong.

They hurriedly left the restaurant, spreading out around it.

Along the way, Sun Lingtong, disguised as an old man, brushed past the pursuers.

The pursuers didn't pay attention, directly knocking Sun Lingtong to the ground, rushing forward without stopping.

Sun Lingtong immediately made groaning sounds, perfectly portraying a helpless old man knocked down by careless passersby, unable to get up.

Sun Lingtong, from the Void Sect, was adept at disguising himself as various characters! The subsequent pursuers only glanced at him before stepping over him.

Each pursuer held a magical artifact, continuously infusing it with magical power, causing the artifacts to emit strong fluctuations, searching the surroundings.

Sun Lingtong was within the search range, even at the center, but he remained motionless.

As a disciple of the Void Sect, he had the confidence to resist most detection artifacts! However, a shadow loomed in his eyes.

After spreading the second layer of rumors, Sun Lingtong found that a large number of people were searching everywhere, trying to find the source of the rumors.

Sun Lingtong's detection revealed that these investigators mainly came from the four major forces of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

But it didn't stop there.

For instance, the Great Purity Palace also sent disciples to participate in the investigation. "The next moment is crucial," Sun Lingtong thought.

Now, all the major forces in the city were taking action, frantically searching for the mastermind behind the rumors.

This made spreading rumors increasingly difficult, reducing his operational space by a hundredfold! If Sun Lingtong continued, the risk would increase tenfold.

But he still held the third wave of rumors.

At this moment, Sun Lingtong, disguised as an old man, lay helplessly on the street.

He looked up at the sky, recalling his conspiracy with Ning Zhuo in the Lava Immortal Palace.

Ning Zhuo had solemnly told him, "Brother Sun, according to my plan, the third wave of rumors is the most crucial."
