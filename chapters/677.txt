Chapter 677: A Visit

Myriad Manifestations Sect, Main Mountain Gate.

A training hall within the Martial Hall.

Liu Fu stood before his opponent, his face dark and stormy, and transmitted a message with his divine sense: "Chen Er, why are you doing this? What did Ning Zhuo offer you to make you risk offending Lord Yu Heye and stubbornly accept my challenge?"

Ning Zhuo had hired a group of cultivators to rent cave mansions on a massive scale, forcing Liu Fu to confess his crimes to Yu Heye.

Yu Heye ordered his subordinates to harass the cultivators renting the cave mansions.

As this was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Main Mountain Gate, internal disputes between cultivators were typically resolved through the Martial Hall.

The Internal Affairs Hall primarily handled major conflicts among the sect's members.

For less serious disputes, the sect encouraged its disciples to settle matters privately through martial sparring.

This system perfectly suited the Myriad Manifestations Sect's circumstances.

The sect had an overwhelming number of members, and the resulting friction led to countless conflicts. Adopting the conventional management methods of a super-sect would require a massive workforce dedicated solely to resolving disputes.

Such human-driven governance would inevitably breed corruption and even lead to wrongful convictions.

After all, the Myriad Manifestations Sect wasn't a cultivation nation. In such nations, officials could investigate and judge cases, relying on divine insight and official authority to cast spells, often uncovering the truth.

During the lead-up to the Flying Cloud Assembly, cultivators from all directions flooded the Main Mountain Gate, swelling the population even further.

Vast numbers of non-sect cultivators would temporarily reside here, inevitably leading to a surge in disputes and conflicts.

The Myriad Manifestations Sect largely ignored these matters, leaving them to be resolved privately.

This approach served two purposes: it minimized administrative costs and fostered a survival-of-the-fittest atmosphere within the sect. As a result, those who rose to prominence within the sect typically possessed formidable combat prowess.

With both high combat power and a large population, irreconcilable internal conflicts were inevitable. These factors made it impossible for the Myriad Manifestations Sect to confine itself to its established boundaries.

To prevent internal strife from escalating, the sect's leaders naturally shifted internal conflicts outward.

This strategy allowed them to secure more territory, providing room for internal maneuvering among their members.

Over time, the Myriad Manifestations Sect's influence expanded relentlessly. Those who temporarily lost out in internal competition often established outposts beyond the sect's borders, hoping to turn the tide. This led to the sect's tentacles stretching further and further, extending its reach across the land.

So, when Yu Heye discovered that someone had interfered with the mountain peak he had chosen, he naturally opted for a martial challenge to resolve the issue.

Most of the cultivators Ning Zhuo had gathered chose to avoid conflict, unwilling to risk their lives for the ten mid-grade Spirit Stones. They voluntarily withdrew their cave mansion leases.

However, a stubborn few accepted the challenge.

"Chen Er," standing before Liu Fu, was one of them.

Liu Fu had already learned that Ning Zhuo's rallying cry for these low-level cultivators was the promise of ten mid-grade Spirit Stones. Was Chen Er really willing to risk his life for such a paltry sum?

Fatalities during martial challenges were not uncommon.

What Liu Fu didn't know was that "Chen Er" was merely a temporary alias. His true identity was the Old Chef who served Ning Zhuo.

The Old Chef remained silent, merely beckoning Liu Fu with a crooked finger.

Liu Fu flew into a rage. "Obstinate fool!"

With a wave of his hand, he unleashed ten talismans. The talismans ignited in mid-air, transforming into a barrage of water arrows that surged toward the Old Chef.

The Old Chef's mind stirred, and he summoned a "shield" to block the attack.

Simultaneously, he stamped his foot against the ground, activating a movement technique that propelled him forward with astonishing speed.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The shield proved remarkably agile, moving at his will to encircle the Old Chef and intercept every threatening water arrow.

Old Chef reached into his robe and scattered a handful of glutinous rice into the air.

The rice grains swelled mid-air, transforming into massive, pale-yellow worms that swarmed toward Liu Fu.

Liu Fu's heart leaped. "A Gu Cultivator?"

He drew his signature Magic Artifact - a sword case he had acquired from the market.

Channeling spiritual energy, he opened the case, unleashing a barrage of faint golden sword qi.

The razor-sharp sword qi pierced through the worms, their momentum carrying them back around for a second strike. After repeated strikes, a colossal worm finally succumbed.

Old Chef smiled inwardly.

A mistake. Liu Fu's decision to use sword qi against the giant worms was a grave error.

Old Chef had intended the worms merely as a distraction. By expending vast amounts of spiritual energy to conjure sword qi and focus solely on killing the worms, Liu Fu had surrendered the initiative in this battle.

Had the sword qi been directed at Old Chef, he would have been forced to defend with all his might, resulting in a stalemate.

But now, with no external pressure, Old Chef could effortlessly turn his attention to Liu Fu.

He produced a gourd and sprayed out a torrent of golden oil droplets.

The hundreds of thousands of droplets formed a torrential downpour, engulfing Liu Fu.

Having lost the advantage, Liu Fu could only activate a talisman, conjuring a Golden Bell Light Shield around himself for temporary protection.

The Golden Bell Light Shield proved remarkably sturdy. Oil droplets crashed against it, shattering into fragments, and scattered remnants splashed in all directions. For a moment, the attack seemed impenetrable.

"This is a Talisman Treasure," Shen Xi observed from the sidelines.

A mere martial arts demonstration would never have captured his attention. But this involved Ning Zhuo, and by extension, his own influence within the alliance, piquing his interest.

"What do you think, cousin?" Shen Xi asked, seizing the opportunity to test Su Lingkou's insight.

Su Lingkou replied without hesitation, "Liu Fu is no fighter. He made two critical errors: first, he surrendered the initiative, and second, while appearing steadfast, he turned himself into a sitting duck."

"Especially that first mistake!" Su Lingkou shook her head, her face contorted with disdain. "Liu Fu actually used sword qi against those worms? Utterly foolish!"

Shen Xi smiled faintly. "I can understand his reasoning. Gu Cultivators' methods are notoriously bizarre and unpredictable. Liu Fu likely chose to eliminate the worms first as a precaution."

"But his judgment failed him. Chen Er isn't a Gu Cultivator; he must have some culinary skills."

The observer sees clearest.

Shen Xi noticed the subtle details, recognizing that what the Old Chef was scattering wasn't Gu insects, but glutinous rice.

"Liu Fu is about to lose," Su Lingkou observed. "This Chen Er must be Ning Zhuo's countermeasure."

"He's hidden his true experts here. Yu Heye's subordinates won't take this defeat lying down. In the end, Yu Heye himself might even step in."

"Mm," Shen Xi nodded.

Concentrating on the battle, he pointed at Old Chef. "Cousin, I need to investigate him."

Shen Xi needed to determine whether Old Chef was a high-priced mercenary hired by Ning Zhuo or a subordinate Ning Zhuo had brought with him. The distinction was crucial.

As soon as he spoke, Old Chef unleashed a decisive strike, severely injuring Liu Fu.

Despite his victory, Old Chef remained in the Martial Hall. The second and third matches were still to come.

Due to the concentrated challenge format, the Martial Hall had scheduled all the matches between Ning Zhuo and Yu Heye's subordinates together.

The second match pitted a tall, muscular man against a short, agile one.

The tall man roared, his arms bulging with muscles like gnarled tree roots, and slammed his fists into the ground.

An earth serpent erupted from the earth, lunging toward the shorter man.

The short man chuckled, his movements lightning-fast. He leaped onto the serpent's back and charged straight at his towering opponent.

The tall man snorted coldly and unleashed over a dozen talismans, which ignited instantly.

The talismans transformed into a barrage of stone spikes that shot toward the short man. The short man's speed surged, leaving afterimages in his wake as he charged headfirst into the storm of stone spikes.

Weaving through the relentless barrage, he dodged every attack with uncanny agility, closing the distance to the tall man.

The tall man, skilled in ranged spellcasting, quickly faltered under the short man's close-quarters assault with a dagger.

Sensing the dire situation, the tall man had no choice but to concede defeat.

Third match, fourth match, fifth match...

Yu Heye's side lost every single one!

This lopsided outcome left Su Lingkou utterly astonished.

Shen Xi's eyes gleamed with sharp interest. "Where did Ning Zhuo find these skilled fighters? Cousin, investigate these people thoroughly and uncover their identities."

Realizing he had underestimated Ning Zhuo's capabilities, he thought to himself, "I need to reassess my approach to this man."

As evening approached...

"They were all defeated?" In the cultivation chamber, Yu Heye jerked his head up, his eyes widening as he stared at Liu Fu.

Liu Fu's face was deathly pale as he stammered out the details.

Finally, he handed Yu Heye another invitation card.

The card was still from Ning Zhuo!

Yu Heye frowned deeply, staring at the invitation.

After a moment of silence, his brow relaxed, and a faint smile appeared on his face. "A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator," he chuckled.

His impression of Ning Zhuo had begun to shift slightly.

Though still just a minor cultivator in the Foundation Establishment Stage, Ning Zhuo seemed to command a force that warranted greater consideration.

Of course, not too much consideration.

Yu Heye knew very well that the cultivators who had attached themselves to him were far from exceptional in strength.

He cultivated the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art, and his physical condition deteriorated daily. Yet he still had to risk breaking through to the Nascent Soul Stage.

Any true elite from the Foundation Establishment Stage seeking a powerful patron would never choose him.

A flame erupted from his palm, incinerating the invitation card.

Yu Heye flicked his hand and turned to Liu Fu. "The enemy came prepared, catching you off guard. Your defeat was understandable."

Instead of reprimanding them, he offered Liu Fu and the others a way to save face.

"In that case, let's pull some strings."

"Ning Zhuo's plan to gather Loose Cultivators on a large scale and establish them here hinges on one crucial element: the Cultivator within the Internal Affairs Hall who is assisting him."

"Whether through warnings, threats, or bribery, neutralizing this key figure could effectively silence Ning Zhuo."

Yu Heye began to strategize.

Having long anticipated Ning Zhuo's methods, he immediately recognized this critical vulnerability. Disrupting it would severely hinder Ning Zhuo's operations.

But the next moment, Liu Fu offered a wry smile. "My lord, we've just identified the Internal Affairs Hall Cultivator collaborating with Ning Zhuo."

"His surname is Cao, and his name is Cao Gui."

Yu Heye's brow furrowed instantly. "The Cao?"

Liu Fu was a veteran under his command; otherwise, Yu Heye wouldn't have entrusted him with the task of expelling the Cultivators.

Liu Fu nodded.

Yu Heye's frown deepened. "It seems our opponent came prepared."

Years ago, Yu Heye had offended a prominent figure from the main peak - a member of the Cao Family. To resolve the matter, he had nearly exhausted his entire fortune.

Though the Cao Family hadn't directly retaliated, they had effectively blocked his path to becoming a Golden Core True Disciple. How could they possibly allow an enemy to become a True Inheritor of the sect?

Ning Zhuo had gathered intelligence in advance; his money wasn't wasted.

Since this approach failed, Yu Heye devised another plan. "It's strange that these people are working for Ning Zhuo. Investigate our opponents and try to bribe them."

With the Cao Family's involvement, Yu Heye dared not make any major moves. He preferred to spend money to avoid trouble.

Liu Fu nodded and left to carry out the order.

Half a day later, Su Lingkou reported to Shen Xi with disappointment.

Shen Xi raised an eyebrow. "You mean you couldn't find any information about them at all?"

Su Lingkou nodded. "Yes, it's as if they appeared out of thin air."

A grave expression settled on Shen Xi's face.

Bringing outsiders to the Myriad Manifestations Sect was not uncommon. But since these weren't Loose Cultivators, it meant Ning Zhuo had the backing of a powerful force.

In Shen Xi's mind, Ning Zhuo immediately became shrouded in mystery.

Liu Fu delivered a similar report to Yu Heye.

After dismissing Liu Fu, Yu Heye fell into deep thought.

This development wasn't a flaw in his plan.

Like Shen Xi, Yu Heye once again raised his assessment of Ning Zhuo.

"Why is this person going to such lengths to make things difficult for me? Just because I expelled him and made him lose face?" Yu Heye wondered, puzzled.

To dispel his doubts, Yu Heye simply needed to confront Ning Zhuo face-to-face.

But...

He had burned all the invitation cards!

Just as Yu Heye began to regret his rashness, his gaze suddenly froze. Beside his hand lay an invitation card, placed there silently.

What?!

Yu Heye's shock was profound.

He had no idea when the card had been placed there.

If the sender could deliver an invitation card undetected, couldn't they also approach him unnoticed and casually take his life?

"Ning Zhuo, which faction is backing you?!"

Yu Heye unfolded the invitation card and quickly scanned its contents.

The message was simple: Ning Zhuo requested an audience with Yu Heye to discuss the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art.

Yu Heye scoffed in amusement. "A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator dares to discuss Dao with a late-stage Golden Core True Disciple like me?"

He was displeased. This attitude of equal exchange irked Yu Heye.

Yet this time, he refrained from tearing up the invitation card.

After careful consideration, he summoned Liu Fu again. "Arrange for Ning Zhuo to be hosted tomorrow. Prepare fine wine and delicacies."

Liu Fu bowed. "As you command."

The next day, Ning Zhuo arrived at Solid Rock Cave Mansion precisely on time, as promised.

His impeccable manners and respectful address, referring to Yu Heye as "Senior," significantly eased the latter's mood.

After the customary pleasantries, Ning Zhuo stated plainly that he had originally intended to take the ten Spirit Stones and choose a more convenient cave mansion elsewhere. However, Shen Xi had sought him out with urgent matters.

He briefly explained the situation.

"I see," Yu Heye said, stroking his beard with an impassive expression.

"Therefore, Senior Yu, please rest assured," Ning Zhuo continued. "Though I've leveraged the Cao Family's influence, this matter isn't about them using me to trouble you."

Words are often best understood in reverse.

In other words, if Ning Zhuo truly wanted to confront Yu Heye, he could have exploited this power far more deeply.

Yu Heye gave Ning Zhuo a long, penetrating look. "What do you intend to do?"

Ning Zhuo deftly changed the subject. "This junior has recently been studying the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art and has encountered some perplexing questions. I would be honored to seek your guidance, Senior Yu."

Yu Heye snorted coldly, impatient with Ning Zhuo's evasiveness. Yet he still stroked his beard and raised his chin slightly. "Speak your mind."
