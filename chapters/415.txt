Chapter 415: Countless Treasures

The reason Sun Lingtong confirmed that the opponent was dead was that he used his celestial spirit eye to check.

Of course, he also knew that he was only a Foundation Establishment cultivator; the gap in cultivation level compared to a Soul Formation expert was like heaven and earth.

But he still had the means of the Ten Thousand Li Dragon for reconnaissance.

This mechanism was at the Nascent Soul level, and investigating a Soul Formation being was far outside the gras of of Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong stared at the stone sphere in front of him, feeling puzzled: "A Soul Formation existence has already perished."

He then thought of the group of black-robed cultivators he had been following and quickly reconstructed the basic outline of the truth in his mind.

"It seems these people are actually here to pay their respects, wanting to meet or awaken this Soul Formation existence."

"This existence clearly is not a proper cultivator, which is why the group outside would set up a formation, essentially sacrificing their own."

"They never expected that the Soul Formation existence had already passed away.

Although cultivators are powerful, there were many instances of them passing away.

For example, low-level cultivators immersed in cultivation forget to eat, leading to starvation. This kind of situation used to happen frequently in ancient times, which is why the Fasting Pill was developed.

Or similar to Ning Zhuo previously, who delved too deeply into the Dao laws, expended too much mental power, and ended up burning out their brain, becoming senile at best, or outright dying on the spot at worst.

Many higher-level cultivators, having hit a bottleneck in their cultivation, exhausted all other means to no effect, could only enter a secluded state. A secluded state, as the name implies, means not stopping until the goal is reached. It’s either a breakthrough in cultivation or death! This usually occurs when a cultivator's lifespan is nearing its end.

"Could it be that this Soul Formation existence was also nearing the end of its lifespan?"

Sun Lingtong guessed in his heart.

His heartbeat quickened, and he murmured: "Exciting, this is really too exciting."

Outside the cave, only four black-robed cultivators remained, communicating with their divine senses.

After arguing for a moment, one of them stepped forward.

He took out a crimson token from his bosom and infused it with magical power.

Then, he took out a piece of talisman paper and wrote on it, crafting a flying message.

At the end of the message, he raised the token and shot out a symbol to mark the message, indicating his identity.

The cultivator, risking his life, sent the flying talisman into the abyss.

After completing this step, he directly knelt on the ground with his forehead pressed against it, performing a grand act of worship.

Meanwhile, the other three black-robed cultivators also did the same, extremely tense.

The flying message soared quickly, reached the bottom of the cave, and then hovered around the sphere, flying in circles.

Sun Lingtong took a light breath and immediately activated the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, swallowing the flying message directly.

The black-robed cultivator maintaining the flying message felt a huge shock in his heart; he sensed he had lost contact with the message. He could feel the message had not been destroyed, but had simply vanished.

This was even more chilling than if the message had been destroyed—it felt like a stone tossed into an abyss, with no echo returning from the bottom of the cave for a long time.

Sun Lingtong began to feel anxious.

"This group of black-robed cultivators is willing to sacrifice themselves just to see the Soul Formation existence here.

"They are clearly driven by some powerful force behind them!"

"This flying message could mean someone will enter personally next time.

"My time is limited; I need to quickly find the Soul Formation's legacy."

However, Sun Lingtong, navigating the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, circled the cave bottom several times but found nothing.

The cave bottom was utterly empty. There wasn't even a shadow of treasure; just stones, everywhere stones!

The mechanical dragon continued to observe the outside of the cave.

The four black-robed cultivators had gathered at the cave entrance, wanting to step inside but were extremely tense and hesitating.

Sun Lingtong sighed.

He didn't want to kill these people. Not to mention that the four of them were all Foundation Establishment cultivators—there were many of them, and their methods were unclear.

They undoubtedly had a significant figure behind them. Killing them would attract the attention of that big figure!

Those who could take the initiative to visit a Soul Formation existence would at least have to be at the Nascent Soul level in terms of cultivation.

"I just arrived at Thousand Peaks Forest with Ning Zhuo and already attracted a Nascent Soul level, even Soul Formation cultivator. This really isn't suitable!"

If Sun Lingtong had found the remains of the Soul Formation, that would be one thing.

The key was that he hadn’t found anything.

Not only did he fail to gain any benefits, but he also offended a significant figure for no reason, which was highly irrational.

"Ah, oh." Sun Lingtong scratched his head, feeling particularly unwilling.

It was clearly a tremendous opportunity, but it seemed like he was going to return empty-handed.

"A little risk shouldn’t hurt." Sun Lingtong thought it over and, with a resolve, controlled the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, gradually approaching the only giant stone sphere at the bottom of the cave.

On the surface, the stone sphere looked very ordinary. But under the reconnaissance of the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, Sun Lingtong could sense it contained many Dao Marks.

The Ten Thousand Li Dragon opened its mouth and shot out a magical tool.

It was released by Sun Lingtong.

The magical tool struck the stone sphere, immediately cracking it with large fissures.

"What?!" The stone surface’s defense was weaker than Sun Lingtong had imagined.

In the next moment, the stone skin fell away, revealing dazzling treasure light inside, shining outward.

Sun Lingtong couldn't help but open his mouth wide.

Even while being within the mechanical dragon, his face was illuminated, and so was his entire body by the brilliant light.

"I'm rich, I'm rich!"

Sun Lingtong couldn’t help but cheer in his heart.

From that small cracked area, he saw a piece of Arcane Yellow Mother Stone, a handful of Earth Spirit Soil, a piece of Celestial Meteorite, and a piece of Purple Crystal Obsidian!

The Arcane Yellow Mother Stone, with its deep earth patterns, emanated a heavy earthy energy. It was a fragment of the roots of the earth, possessing strong defensive abilities and highly stable properties.

The Earth Spirit Soil contains the essence of the earth veins, which can only be found deep underground or at junctions of earth veins. It is excellent planting soil. The growth speed and medicinal effect of the planted spirit herbs will greatly increase.

The Celestial Meteorite and Purple Crystal Obsidian were also exceptionally precious, not to mention.

"These four materials are all at the Nascent Soul level!"

Sun Lingtong was so excited he nearly drooled.

He quickly released more magical tools and began to dig.

One by one, the treasures were excavated and absorbed into the body of the Ten Thousand Li Dragon.

Iridescent Miraculous Jade, Blood-Scorching Demonic Stone, Luminous Stone Essence, Gloomy Black Soil...

These treasures had two common points. The first was that they were all related to the earth element, being either stones, jades, or soil. The second was that their grades were all very high, all at the Nascent Soul level!

"This transformation cultivator might specialize in the earth element and is likely an earth elemental being."

"The outer layer of the stone sphere is filled with Nascent Soul level materials, and digging into the inner layer should yield Soul Formation materials, right?"

Sun Lingtong licked his lips and continued digging.

This feeling was truly wonderful for him.

Of course, he didn’t lose focus, always paying attention to the group of black-robed cultivators outside the cave.

The heavy treasure was right in front of him, and if this group barged in now, they couldn’t blame Sun Lingtong for taking drastic actions!

However, contrary to Sun Lingtong's expectations, the four black-robed cultivators ultimately did not step inside; after hesitating and struggling, they bowed and turned to leave.

When digging, Sun Lingtong naturally used his methods to obscure sound and light so that they were unaware of the actual situation at the cave bottom.

Sun Lingtong dug away the outer layer of the stone sphere and obtained a large number of treasures, simply skyrocketing to wealth overnight!

But when he continued to dig deeper, he encountered enormous obstacles.

No matter what means he used, it was difficult to shift the now shrunken stone sphere.

Moreover, the stone sphere trembled slightly and began to absorb a large amount of earth element spirit energy. This spirit energy adhered to its surface, continuously condensing and forming new stone skin.

The stone skin rapidly covered the treasure light and quickly thickened at an observable rate.

Sun Lingtong's eyes shone brightly: "Could it be that these stone skins will gradually transform into Nascent Soul level materials?!"

He immediately set to work, digging again.

The newly formed stone skin was very fragile; after being scraped off, it was just ordinary stone, making Sun Lingtong extremely disappointed.

"It seems the transformation of stone into various treasures requires a long time; it can't be achieved overnight."

Sun Lingtong reached the inner layer but could still find nothing.

"Hehe."

"I'll call Ning Zhuo out and let him think of a way."

"His big head is always useful!"

"I’m very curious, no matter how hard this stone sphere is, can it compare to the Great Serpent Scythe?"

Just as this thought crossed his mind, the mechanical dragon suddenly erupted with an ear-piercing alarm.

Sun Lingtong’s expression changed dramatically; he quickly raised his hand and saw that his hands were covered in a layer of lime, gradually turning to stone!

"What, what’s going on?!"

Sun Lingtong quickly mobilized his magical power, infusing it into his hands to resist the petrification.

Although the petrification speed was significantly alleviated, it remained tenacious, continually eroding.

Sun Lingtong hastily took out pills to swallow, trying various spells, but with little effect.

"Is this a massive trap?!"
