Chapter 834: Obtaining the Book

This was the strategy Sun and Ning had devised!

It didn't matter if they couldn't out-calculate it; they would simply interfere with the water formation, ensuring that whatever calculations it produced couldn't be implemented in time.

Sun Lingtong watched with a surging heart, his face full of excitement. He wanted to cheer for Ning Zhuo, but fearing he might distract him, he could only applaud silently in his heart.

The core of the Luo Shu Water Formation was a single page from the Dao Artifact, the Luo Shu. It was indeed incredibly powerful. However, the duo of Sun and Ning had their advantages.

One of their advantages was that they had secretly taken control of the Shuyu Studio. borrowing the power of this cave abode's formation, Sun and Ning could use superior force to suppress their target!

In contrast, while the core of the Luo Shu Water Formation was incomparably strong, the foundation constructing the water formation was merely composed of damaged treasures.

The foundation of the water formation was very thin!

Sun and Ning fully utilized their advantage, pressuring the entire water formation.

The rotation speed of the water vortex slowed down, and the formation patterns became increasingly chaotic.

No matter how the Luo Shu page adapted, its overall strength simply couldn't compare to the opposition; it was being put in an overly difficult position.

A tiny crack suddenly appeared on the surface of the water vortex!

This was an energy fault caused by the stagnation of the formation's operation reaching a critical stage.

Now!

Essence light shot from Ning Zhuo's eyes as he thrust out both hands, his ten fingers fluttering like dancing butterflies.

Streaks of spiritual energy shot from his fingertips, rapidly carving formation patterns onto the surface of the water vortex.

A Formation within a Formation!

Sun Lingtong’s eyes widened as he held his breath and focused. He knew this move by Ning Zhuo was crucial. If he could successfully build the formation, then even if they failed this time, it wouldn't cause too much of a commotion.

Ning Zhuo fully displayed his Master-level formation attainment!

Various formation-laying techniques emerged one after another, revealing the gains Ning Zhuo had made from sweeping through the formation trials earlier.

Soon, fine beads of sweat seeped from the big-headed youth's forehead, but his fingers remained as steady as a rock.

One breath, ten breaths, twenty-seven breaths.

When the final formation pattern landed.

Buzz...

The water vortex trembled violently, and then, slowly ceased its rotation.

The Luo Shu page continued its frantic calculations, but its results could no longer be transmitted to the original formation - because the formation had been "taken over" by Ning Zhuo's new formation.

And the function of this new formation was to be useless!

It could be said that the Luo Shu page had been sidelined and isolated.

A flash of joy crossed Sun Lingtong's face, but soon, his expression turned solemn.

Because the new formation began to change!

Formation patterns twisted, formation lines reorganized, and formation eyes shifted - everything happened in an instant. The speed was even faster than the water vortex before.

Sun Lingtong couldn't help but be startled internally: "So, the calculation ability of the Luo Shu page had never been fully unleashed until now."

From the moment Sun and Ning infiltrated the Shuyu Studio, Sun Lingtong had been studying the Luo Shu page and the surrounding water formation. It was only now, when they made their move, that they truly forced out the upper limit of the Luo Shu page's capabilities.

The new formation changed faster and faster.

Ning Zhuo's expression was grave.

The Luo Shu page was the source of mathematical principles. Ning Zhuo's formation-within-a-formation was inside the water formation, so it would inevitably be understood, penetrated, and eroded.

Even though this was formed from Ning Zhuo's own spiritual energy, it wouldn't last long.

The new formation trembled violently, its patterns twisting madly.

The Luo Shu page was attacking with full force, wanting to take over the new formation as quickly as possible. At the same time, the external water formation was exerting pressure inward.

"In the end, it has no intellect, only instinct. Luo Shu page, come into my hand!" Ning Zhuo shouted in his heart.

He activated the Formation-Gap Traversing Shuttle, first following the cracks in the water formation to charge through the formation-within-a-formation, rushing straight towards the Luo Shu page.

The page trembled slightly, its form suddenly becoming ethereal and blurry before splitting into ten copies.

Nine fake, one real!

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath. Thoughts rose and fell in his mind, his thinking speed pushed to the extreme by intense mental consumption.

He used the formation-breaking treasures in his hands one after another, throwing them into the water formation.

Seven of the page's phantoms were dispersed in succession, but at the final moment, three remained.

The formation-breaking treasures in Ning Zhuo's hands were exhausted. In the time it would take to retrieve them, the page could completely regroup and recreate ten illusions.

At this moment, Sun Lingtong's heart inevitably hung high in his throat!

He knew that if they failed this time, they would have to find another way to plot for the Luo Shu page. Because the series of changes this time would become data for the Luo Shu's calculations.

Therefore, the difficulty of breaking the water formation and seizing the Luo Shu would increase with each attempt.

"Which of the three is real?"

In this instant, Ning Zhuo's gaze was electric. He knew his predicament - he had to choose one immediately. If he chose the real body, he would succeed. If he chose wrong, he would fall short at the last step.

He didn't have any more time, not even a little bit, to think. Fortunately, at the critical moment, his Master-level attainment triggered his spirituality once again, and a wave of intuition welled up from the bottom of his heart.

But this intuition was quite faint, because while breaking the formation, Ning Zhuo had been constantly bathed in the Luo Shu's Dao Rhyme.

Although the intuition arose, there were other sensations, chaotic and confusing, like looking at flowers through a fog.

Crucially, the experience Ning Zhuo gained from sweeping the formation trials played its part, allowing him to grasp that intuitive sense with incomparable precision.

"Alright, it's you!" Ning Zhuo struck decisively.

Spiritual energy surged out, transforming into a hand possessing all Five Elements spiritual energy. It forcefully charged into the water formation, broke through the formation-within-a-formation, and grabbed directly toward the deepest part of the water vortex.

The hand of Five Elements spiritual energy grabbed the page on the left.

The Luo Shu struggled, its essence manifesting; it was indeed the true body!

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, mobilizing his divine sense to retract the Five Elements palm.

The Luo Shu page struggled instinctively, actually using Dao Rhyme to erode the Five Elements spiritual energy palm.

The surface of the latter immediately began to deform slightly, but then quickly calmed down - Ning Zhuo's attainment in the Five Elements was even deeper than his formation attainment. The Luo Shu tried to influence and penetrate it with its Dao Rhyme, but Ning Zhuo immediately adjusted it gently, forcing it back to its original form!

The moment the Luo Shu page was extracted, the new formation was free from infringement and instantly stabilized, falling completely under Ning Zhuo's control.

In contrast, the swirling water formation began to tremble violently. Because the original formation had lost its core, the most central foundation of this formation was gone, and a rapid collapse began.

But this situation had been anticipated by Sun and Ning.

Ning Zhuo immediately tossed the Luo Shu page to Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong had long been waiting in battle readiness. He activated a prepared theft technique to directly suppress the Luo Shu page.

Ning Zhuo went all out, pouring his spiritual energy and divine sense into the new formation as if they cost nothing.

The new formation operated at high speed, emitting waves of light halos. The halos spread out, covering the swirling water formation wave after wave.

In this moment, the new formation replaced the Luo Shu page, becoming the core of the swirling water formation!

The collapse of the water formation continued, but under the guidance of the new formation, it was no longer violent and ferocious, but greatly delayed.

Eventually, the swirling water formation was consumed to nothingness amidst continuous attrition, without triggering any explosion.

The new formation was also tattered and broken.

Ning Zhuo was so tired his whole body trembled slightly, and his vision went black. His spiritual energy was almost completely depleted, and his divine sense had hit rock bottom; he needed rest urgently.

Sun Lingtong grabbed the Luo Shu page and jumped to Ning Zhuo's side, supporting the big-headed youth: "Little Zhuo, you did it, we succeeded!"

His face was pale, his body soaked in sweat, and his fingers trembled slightly. This wasn't his first time breaking a formation, but the Luo Shu page had brought him immense pressure, possessing an overwhelming advantage in calculation.

The difficulty of Ning Zhuo breaking this formation far exceeded all the Rising Cloud Minor Trials he had encountered before, and the consumption was enormous.

"Fortunately, although it was difficult, everything went smoothly!" Ning Zhuo smiled, looking at the Luo Shu page with a lingering gaze.

This was his mother's relic.

With this, he could finally be considered to have inherited all the items Meng Yaoyin had left in the Myriad Manifestations Sect cave abode.

"Mother, I have finally completed one of the things you entrusted to me."

"Although I haven't determined the entry point for joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect yet, everything is looking up."

"When will you wake up?"

Following Meng Yaoyin's instructions, Ning Zhuo had been waiting for unusual movement from the Great Serpent Scythe.

Having achieved great success in breaking the formation and retrieving the book, Ning Zhuo took the Luo Shu page back to the Blue Stone Cave Abode first.

The Luo Shu page was merely suppressed; Ning Zhuo still needed to refine it before he could use it.

Sun Lingtong remained in the Shuyu Cave to tidy up the Divination Room, doing the preliminary preparation. He would wait for Ning Zhuo to free up his hands before repairing the formation in the Divination Room.

Ultimately, Sun and Ning would try their best to eliminate traces of their infiltration before leaving the Shuyu Studio. They would wait until Ning Zhuo's identity was exposed to reclaim the Shuyu Studio through the formal channels of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

While Sun and Ning split up to act, the Ban family was also making moves.

-----

Ban Clan Territory, Ancestral Hall Secret Chamber.

In the center of the secret chamber, a bronze mechanism standing three zhang tall stood silently - it was the Ban family's clan-guarding treasure, the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain.

Several Supreme Elders sat around the mechanism.

"Let's begin," one of them said in a deep voice.

Immediately, the present Supreme Elders acted simultaneously, their spiritual energy surging and pouring continuously into the mechanism.

Buzz - 

The bronze mechanism shook violently, and countless components began to rotate slowly. Sliders moved up and down, chains pulled left and right, and wheels spun back and forth. Clicking sounds were as dense as rain, as if the entire mechanism was waking from a deep sleep.

In the secret chamber, an invisible pressure permeated the air.

One breath.

Ten breaths.

Forty breaths...

The rotation of the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain became faster and more violent. Sliders almost derailed, chains were pulled taut, and wheels emitted ear-piercing friction sounds. The entire mechanism was trembling, as if bearing some immense pressure.

A Supreme Elder was moved: "Ning Zhuo's Qi luck is even more tyrannical than before."

Only after fifty breaths did light and shadow emerge, gradually solidifying to depict the scene of Ning Zhuo's Qi luck.

Several Supreme Elders hurriedly focused their gaze to watch.

They saw an arm symbolizing Ning Zhuo's Qi luck, existing between emptiness and reality, grasping a small nebula.

The nebula was about the size of a human head, deep blue throughout, with countless starlights flickering inside. Every star was breathing, every ray of light was beating, as if it were a miniature starry sky.

The nebula struggled violently, wanting to break free from the arm's grasp. But those five fingers were clamped down like iron pincers; no matter how the nebula struggled, it couldn't escape in the slightest.

Expressions of astonishment appeared on the faces of the Supreme Elders.

The last time they observed his luck, the Qi luck arm was only grabbing Ice Attribute Cold Qi. Now, it was grasping a nebula.

"What is going on?"

"What major event is Ning Zhuo up to now?"

"For this nebula to show such signs of Qi luck, it must be something extraordinary! Has Ning Zhuo obtained some major opportunity?"

The faces of the Supreme Elders were all very grim.

Ban Ji was the hope of their entire clan, bearing the Royal Mandate. And Ning Zhuo was Ban Ji's Human Tribulation!

With Ning Zhuo obtaining a major opportunity now, there would inevitably be a major improvement. Ban Ji, however, was still using the Golden Core to cleanse his physical body. With such a trend, even if Ban Ji came out of seclusion, he likely wouldn't gain any advantage.

"Look closely, there are new changes within Ning Zhuo's Qi luck palm as well," a Supreme Elder spoke up to remind them.

Everyone hurriedly looked closer.

They immediately discovered that on Ning Zhuo's Qi luck palm, there were many palm lines. These lines were dense, layered, and tightly arranged, containing great profundity, looking like... formation patterns.

The group fell silent for a few breaths before someone realized: "This should correspond to Ning Zhuo's ability in the Dao of Formations."

"Recently, Ning Zhuo successively rejected Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang, throwing himself wholeheartedly into formation trials, sweeping through nearly ten related Rising Clouds Small Trials in one go."

"According to the latest intelligence, his outstanding performance has already attracted the attention of Wenren Yan, a high-level figure of Heavy Formation Peak. Ning Zhuo personally hosted a banquet inviting Wenren Yan and Shen Xi."

"Ning Zhuo hides quite deeply. Only now has he revealed this skill."

None of the Supreme Elders had expected that Ning Zhuo's formation-laying ability was a newly added strength. Such a massive leap in ability was something they had only heard of but never seen with their own eyes in their entire lives.

They simply assumed Ning Zhuo had been holding back all along and only recently used his full strength. For such a posture to be revealed in the vision of Qi luck was entirely normal.

The expressions of the Supreme Elders became even uglier.

Naturally, they made associations: Besides the Dao of Formations, did Ning Zhuo have other hidden strengths?

"Impossible!"

"How old is he? One look tells you he's a vigorous young junior."

"How much time does a person like that have? Besides cultivating his technique, he practices mechanic arts. And he has such attainment in formations!"

"He is also proficient in various righteous path methods. Since coming to the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he has flourished..."

"He cannot possibly have other hidden strengths."

"Perhaps, the Dao of Formations is his main cultivation, and mechanic arts are just a cover."

The Supreme Elders voiced their opinions one after another.

They continued to observe.

Above the Qi luck arm, plain white paper formed a thin book. Countless pitch-black ink droplets spilled from the book, pouring down like a sudden rainstorm onto the Qi luck arm.

Sizzle, sizzle.

Tiny lowercase characters, formed of ink, emerged on the surface of the arm. These characters were extremely fine and dense, covering the entire arm.

The ink characters gathered, forming articles one after another.

Once the articles were complete, they lifted on their own. The "skin" of the Qi luck arm curled and changed along with them, turning into flipping pages.

The outermost pages peeled away from the arm like fallen leaves.

With each page that peeled off, a wisp of Qi luck was taken away.

The expressions of the Ban family Supreme Elders softened considerably.

"The entanglement between Zhao Hansheng, Gu Qing, and Ning Zhuo actually hasn't been resolved yet!"

"This is a good thing. Looking at the current state, the threat that master and disciple pose to Ning Zhuo is even greater and deeper."

"But clearly, Ning Zhuo hasn't had any dealings with that master and disciple recently."

The group discussed it but remained puzzled.
