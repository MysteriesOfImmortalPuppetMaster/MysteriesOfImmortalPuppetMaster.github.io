Chapter 655: A Guest Star Should Shine North of the Literary Pivot

The Black Iron Han Armor was disintegrating.

Countless wounds, torn and widened by the violent friction with the air, peeled away in strips and chunks, accompanied by the sickening sound of twisting metal.

Myriad tiny space fragments struck the Mechanical Battle Armor like hail, leaving densely packed craters and scratches, their clanging sounds hiding a fatal menace.

When larger space fragments struck or grazed Ning Zhuo, his body jolted violently, his internal organs feeling like they were being shredded. Fresh blood flowed continuously from the corners of his mouth and the cracks in his damaged armor, staining Qing Chi's robes crimson.

This was only because his internal organs had been enhanced by the Spirit God Art, granting them extraordinary resilience. Otherwise, the extreme velocity and abrupt maneuvers would have caused massive internal bleeding long ago.

The space storm, like a primordial beast with its maw agape, pursued Ning Zhuo relentlessly. With power sufficient to pulverize mountains and warp steel, it greedily devoured every remaining fragment of space.

Only when it reached the limit of the Earth Lung Turbid Qi did it abruptly halt.

The Path of Returning to Silence had completely vanished.

The space storm began to devour itself. In the span of a few breaths, it smoothed out all the turbulence, transforming into a profound, deathly still void.

The void was then eroded, flooded, and ultimately overwhelmed by a massive influx of Earth Lung Turbid Qi.

This transformed the area into a formidable Earth Qi barrier. However, this time, Ning Zhuo had no second candle body to create a second Path of Returning to Silence.

In fact, after constructing the first channel, the Light Goose of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale had dimly faded away, reverting to its original form as a ruler.

Ning Zhuo didn't know the White Paper City Lord's spell and couldn't summon the Light Goose on his own. Even using this precious treasure was strenuous for him. After all, it was a magic treasure-grade artifact, but his spiritual energy quality was only at the Foundation Establishment level.

Ning Zhuo landed, holding Qing Chi.

The Black Iron Han Armor emitted a piercing wail. Its backplate shattered and peeled off in large chunks, the destructive force rapidly spreading across the entire suit.

This brand-new Mechanical Battle Armor had been rendered completely useless after barely any use!

This vividly demonstrated the heart-pounding intensity of the life-or-death rescue mission.

Even now, Ning Zhuo could still clearly feel the bone-chilling, soul-freezing turbulence of the void's chaotic currents!

His heart pounded wildly, his face etched with grave concern.

Throughout this final battle, he had been completely on the defensive, teetering on the brink of defeat.

What made this possible was a choice made by the True Form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. The Nether Dragon Silhouette aimed precisely at the Path of Returning to Silence, striking with unparalleled sharpness and accuracy, achieving a nearly fatal blow against Ning Zhuo and Luo Si's forces!

Ning Zhuo's expression grew grave. Clutching Qing Chi in his arms, he turned to gaze at the Turbid Qi Barrier, as formidable as a mountain wall. He gritted his teeth.

The situation was dire. He and the Qing-Jiao Army were on one side, Luo Si on the other. The Turbid Qi Barrier severed the connection for Military Might Amplification. Without this support, how long could Luo Si's side hold out?

I shouldn't have hesitated earlier. It was a pointless delay, Ning Zhuo lamented inwardly. I wonder if my telepathic message to Luo Si during this perilous escape actually reached him on the other side?

He needed Luo Si to continue holding out, to buy time. Time was crucial! He desperately needed time.

"Lord Qingyan!!!" A wave of anguished cries erupted from the Qing-Jiao Army.

"Qing Chi!!!" A Ghostmen cultivator flew urgently toward Ning Zhuo.

Meanwhile, Jiao Ma's biological father soared above the Ceremonial Barracks, bellowing orders in a desperate attempt to calm the agitated troops.

Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes, immediately realizing that the Qing-Jiao Army was also on the verge of collapse!

Even newly formed, this army provided crucial military power amplification. Without this boost, Ning Zhuo, relying solely on his own strength, would have been unfit to participate in this decisive battle.

He had to stabilize the Qing-Jiao Army!

The Qing-Jiao Army was divided into two main parts. The Jiao Clan faction was very stable. However, the Ghost Clan Qing Family faction, with Qing Yan dead and Qing Chi unconscious, left these cultivators leaderless and panicked, their morale plummeting to rock bottom, teetering on the brink of collapse.

Divine Technique: Life Hanging by a Thread!

At this critical moment, Ning Zhuo directly implanted the Divine Technique into Qing Chi, who was cradled in his arms.

He swiftly cast spells, alternating between diagnostic and healing techniques on Qing Chi's body.

"Qing Chi, wake up! Wake up quickly!"

Qing Chi was a Ghostman. Thanks to the selfless rescue by Ning Zhuo, Luo Si, and Qing Yan, her injuries weren't severe and healed rapidly.

With the aid of the Divine Technique, her eyes fluttered open.

After a brief moment of confusion, her eyes reddened and filled with tears.

Ning Zhuo abruptly set her upright on the ground, gripping her shoulders firmly. "Qing Chi, this is no time to grieve. Do you want revenge?!"

His urgent question left Qing Chi speechless.

Ning Zhuo shouted, "Your father is dead, and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is the mastermind behind it. He's your father's killer! Do you want revenge?!"

The grief on Qing Chi's face was swiftly replaced by fury and hatred. Blue flames seemed to ignite deep within her eyes as she ground her teeth and replied, "Yes! I must have my revenge!"

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and looked her straight in the eyes. "Now, the opportunity for vengeance is right before us."

"You need to steady yourself and continue leading the Qing-Jiao Army in their encampment. I need your help—your military might."

"The more military might, the better!"

"Can you do this, Qingqing?"

"Only by working together can we disrupt the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme, restore peace to White Paper Immortal City, ensure your father's sacrifice wasn't in vain, and avenge all the innocent lives sacrificed in blood rituals!"

Qing Chi took a deep breath and nodded fiercely. "Little Ma, I'll follow your lead! Let's take revenge together!"

As she spoke, hot tears streamed down her cheeks.

Ning Zhuo licked his dry lips, finding it difficult to meet Qing Chi's clear, passionate gaze.

He turned his gaze to the sky and said, "I've cast a spell on you that will allow you to receive my divine sense transmissions in a timely manner, and even receive my spell enhancements."

This was a protective layer for his Divine Art, Life Hanging by a Thread.

"Trust me!"

"We haven't lost yet."

"Next, as long as I find the weakness in this Formation, I can once again influence the battle situation and reinforce Luo Si!"

Forgetful River Immortal City

City Lord's Mansion

"Heh, I'm back in." Zeng Jide, leading Sun Lingtong, transformed into a pool of Black Shadow and flowed like water through the cracks, slipping back into the City Lord's Mansion.

Earlier, he had almost abandoned his attempt to infiltrate the mansion.

But at the last moment, Sun Lingtong's heartfelt words struck him, jolting him awake. Something had always felt strange—why had he obtained the River of Oblivion Vortex Eye so easily?

Clearly, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had deliberately set this trap, specifically arranging it for Zeng Jide to steal!

"The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord possesses the Heavenly Gift of Drowning in No Return, allowing him to draw others' cultivation memories from the Wangchuan River."

"As a result, even though he's a Ghost Cultivator, he's proficient in Confucian cultivation and especially skilled in Formations. The latter is evident from his grand scheme."

"Despite his profound mastery of formations, he didn't bother to set up any defenses around the River of Oblivion Vortex Eye."

"This setup is clearly designed to invite theft, as if to dismiss me with a mere token."

"Then, fearing my continued thefts and the potential for greater consequences, he launched a Golden Token backed by national power, forcing me into a humiliating retreat."

"Excellent... excellent..." Zeng Jide gritted his teeth inwardly.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's dismissive approach, akin to a beggar's alms, deeply offended the pride of this great thief.

Especially since Zeng Jide was accompanied by a junior fellow sect member—a young man whom Zeng Jide highly valued and greatly admired, seeing great potential in him.

When this junior grew up and looked back on this day, he would undoubtedly laugh: "So the senior sect member, Zeng Jide, was just this easily dismissed by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord?"

Where would Zeng Jide's dignity lie then?

Revenge. He must take brutal revenge!

So, Zeng Jide turned back with Sun Lingtong and returned to the City Lord's Mansion.

"I'll teach the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord a lesson he'll never forget!"

This time, Zeng Jide led Ning Zhuo straight to the heart of the City Lord's Mansion.

Zeng Jide still harbored no intention of helping the Painted Skin Rakshasa. His sole purpose remained to teach the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord a lesson, not to incur his wrath.

"Hmm? The defenses here are deceptive—loose on the surface but tightly guarded within. A grand Formation has been erected, yet it clashes with the surrounding defensive layout. How peculiar."

Zeng Jide quickly sensed something amiss and was drawn to the area.

The old man and the youth pierced through the Formation Space and arrived at its core, where they discovered a massive stone.

The boulder was over thirty meters thick and nearly thirty meters long, resembling the fossilized spine of some ancient creature. Its surface was encrusted with layers of mud, lava, plant roots, and twisted, spiral-shaped cavities. Deeply embedded in the earth, it was drawing in Earth Lung Qi on a terrifying scale.

"What is this?" Sun Lingtong asked Zeng Jide through their linked divine sense.

"This appears to be an Earth-Attribute Treasure, using the Formation to disperse its power outward," Zeng Jide replied. "Strange! Such a grand setup must serve a significant purpose."

In that moment, inspiration struck Sun Lingtong, and he nearly clapped his hands in excitement. "Perfect! Senior, since the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord has been bullying us, let's steal this treasure and give him a profound lesson!"

Zeng Jide hesitated. "Won't this... offend the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord?"

In the short time available, he couldn't identify the origin of the Formation surrounding the giant stone.

Black Cloud Space.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

After a series of explosions, Ning Zhuo, clad in his third set of Black Iron Han Armor, squeezed into a pitch-black Formation Space.

Absolute silence and suffocating darkness enveloped him.

Sharp pains from various parts of his body and bone-deep exhaustion reminded Ning Zhuo of his harrowing escape.

There was no time for proper treatment.

He had to push through his injuries, racing against the clock!

Suppressing panic and despair deep within his heart, Ning Zhuo forced himself to calm down and lock in.

Ghost Tide surges, White Paper imperiled;

A Lone Goose carries a candle to pierce the Heavenly Veil.

A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot;

When myriad lamps illuminate, the calamity will crumble on its own.

"I managed to blast my way into the Formation Space. Now, I must follow the guidance of 'A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot' to reach the critical point and carry out the sabotage!"

This was the method he had conceived on the Altar Battlefield to break the deadlock.

Cornered by the situation, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to take this desperate measure.

His divine sense struggled to spread through the thick darkness.

Dense black clouds everywhere severely hindered the effectiveness of his divine sense.

He immediately unleashed countless Mechanical Mirrors.

His divine sense reflected between the mirrors, rapidly expanding his detection range.

But there were still only black clouds—rolling masses of darkness.

"It's time to use it."

Ning Zhuo retrieved a small, white, semi-transparent storage pouch. Inside, a swirling mass of Literary Qi emitted a radiant snow-white light that shone through the pouch and illuminated the surroundings.

The Literary Light Reflecting Snow Pouch!

A gift from Wen Ruanyu, the pouch contained a vast reserve of his Literary Qi.

"Literary talents respect and compete with each other... their Literary Qi naturally attracts each other..." Ning Zhuo murmured inwardly as he carefully activated the pouch.

The snow-white light suddenly intensified, initially forming a spherical orb that pierced the darkness and enveloped Ning Zhuo.

Then, as if drawn by some invisible force, the pouch itself began to distort slightly. The spherical light transformed into a sharply pointed cone, its tip stretching out in a specific direction.

Ning Zhuo hesitated no longer and immediately accelerated in the direction indicated by the Literary Light Reflecting Snow Pouch.

As he approached his destination, the snow-like light on the pouch became increasingly concentrated and bright, drawing him like a magnet. Simultaneously, the conical mass of light lost its sharpness, its tip blunting until it transformed into an oval shape.

When Ning Zhuo finally arrived, the oval mass had nearly reverted to a perfect sphere, its radiance steady and pure.

He surveyed the area with his divine sense, but detected nothing unusual.

"The flow of energy here is remarkably smooth. There must be a node—a point where the Grand Formation's meridians converge and pass through. Yet it's been cleverly concealed, with not a trace of leakage. If not for the guidance of Literary Qi, it would be completely undetectable!"

He cast a series of detection spells. After a moment, his spirits lifted.

"This is definitely a critical hub!"

"But I can't be certain it's my true target..."

Ning Zhuo fell into hesitation once more.

Formations must not be tampered with recklessly. Without pinpointing the exact target, a single misstep could set off a chain reaction, potentially altering all other hubs beyond recognition.

After a few moments of thought, Ning Zhuo decided to mark this location and then search the surrounding area.

Altar Battlefield

Pfft!

Luo Si flew backward like a burst sack, spewing blood as he went.

Severely injured!

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God pursued relentlessly, punching straight toward him. At the last moment, Luo Si narrowly dodged.

The god then drew upon Earth Lung Turbid Qi, creating a suffocating cover. Luo Si produced a talisman, gaining astonishing speed as he evaded again.

Without Military Power Amplification and having lost one of his two major magic treasures—destroyed by an explosion, while the other was trapped within the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's body, being firmly absorbed by it—his doom approached.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord remained hidden within a tributary, refraining from further action as he focused on eroding the Ice Coffin to retrieve the Nether Dragon Scissors.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God laughed heartily. "Luo Si, you traitor! What madness has possessed you to defect to the White Paper Immortal City?"

"Look at your state now! The 'young master' you pledged yourself to has already abandoned you, fleeing with his beloved!"

"You actually aligned yourself with such a worthless fool?"

"How could you be so thoroughly deceived by the Ash Bone Elder?!"

Luo Si remained silent, desperately fleeing under the relentless onslaught of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God lost all patience, snarling as he struck. "You die first! The Ash Bone Elder will follow!"

Turbid qi shackled Luo Si, leaving him helpless as the fatal fist closed in on his skull.

Pfft!

At the brink of death, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God suddenly deflated. The punch veered off course, striking Luo Si's shoulder instead.

Though gravely injured, Luo Si clung to life.

Enraged, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God swung again.

Pfft!

The god deflated again, its divine form shrinking like a punctured balloon.

What's happening?!

Forgetful River Prefecture Lord?!
