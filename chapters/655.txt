Chapter 655: A Guest Star Should Shine North of the Literary Pivot

The Azure Iron Han Armor was disintegrating.

Countless wounds, torn and widened by the violent friction with the air, peeled away in strips and chunks, accompanied by the agonizing sound of twisting metal.

Myriad tiny space fragments pelted the Mechanical Battle Armor like hail, leaving densely packed craters and scratches. The clanging sounds concealed a deadly menace.

When larger space fragments struck or grazed Ning Zhuo, violent tremors shook his body, making his internal organs feel as if they were being crushed. Fresh blood continuously flowed from the corners of his mouth and the cracks in his damaged armor, staining Qing Chi's robes crimson.

This was only because his internal organs had been enhanced by the Spirit God Art, granting them extraordinary resilience. Otherwise, the extreme acceleration, turns, and impacts would have caused massive internal bleeding.

The Spatial Storm, like a primordial beast with its maw agape, pursued Ning Zhuo relentlessly. With a force capable of pulverizing mountains and twisting steel, it greedily devoured every remaining fragment of space.

Only when they reached the limit of the Earth Lung Turbid Qi did the storm abruptly halt.

The Path of Returning to Silence had completely vanished.

The Spatial Storm began devouring itself. In mere breaths, it smoothed out all the turbulence, transforming into a profound, deathly still void.

Then, the void was eroded, flooded, and ultimately overwhelmed by a massive influx of Earth Lung Turbid Qi.

This place transformed once more into a formidable Earth Qi barrier, but this time, Ning Zhuo had no second candle body to create a second Path of Returning to Silence.

In fact, after constructing the first channel, the Light Goose of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale had dimly faded away, reverting to its original form as a ruler.

Ning Zhuo didn't know the White Paper City Lord's spell and couldn't summon the Light Goose on his own.

Even using this precious treasure was strenuous for him. After all, it was a magic treasure-grade artifact, while his own spiritual energy quality was only at the Foundation Establishment level.

Ning Zhuo landed, cradling Qing Chi in his arms.

The Azure Iron Han Armor emitted a piercing wail, then its backplate shattered and peeled off in large chunks. The disintegration rapidly spread across the entire suit.

This brand-new Mechanical Battle Armor had been rendered utterly useless after barely any use!

This vividly demonstrated how perilous and heart-pounding that life-or-death rescue mission had been.

Even now, Ning Zhuo could still clearly feel the bone-chilling, soul-freezing turbulence of the void!

His heart pounded wildly, his face etched with grave concern.

Throughout this final battle, he had been completely on the defensive, teetering on the brink of defeat.

This critical moment was the result of a choice made by the True Form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. The Nether Dragon Silhouette, aimed at the Path of Returning to Silence, struck with unparalleled precision and lethality, achieving a nearly fatal blow against Ning Zhuo and Luo Si's forces!

Ning Zhuo's expression turned grave. Holding Qing Chi, he turned to gaze at the Turbid Qi Barrier, as formidable as a mountain wall. He clenched his teeth.

The situation was dire. Ning Zhuo and the Qing-Jiao Army were on one side, Luo Si on the other. The Turbid Qi Barrier severed the connection for Military Might Amplification. Without this support, how long could Luo Si's forces hold out?

"I shouldn't have hesitated earlier," Ning Zhuo lamented inwardly. "And it was utterly pointless. I wonder if my telepathic message to Luo Si during this perilous escape actually reached him."

He needed Luo Si to hold out and buy time. Time was crucial - he desperately needed time.

"Lord Qingyan!!!" A chorus of anguished cries erupted from the Qing-Jiao Army.

"Qing Chi!!!" A Ghostmen cultivator rushed toward Ning Zhuo in desperation.

Jiao Ma's biological father soared above the Ceremonial Barracks, bellowing orders to quell the army's panic.

Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes, immediately realizing the Qing-Jiao Army was on the verge of collapse.

Even newly formed, this army provided a crucial boost to military power. Without this enhancement, Ning Zhuo, relying solely on his own strength, would have been utterly unqualified to participate in this decisive battle.

He had to stabilize the Qing-Jiao Army!

The Qing-Jiao Army was divided into two main factions. The Jiao Clan faction was remarkably stable. However, the Ghost Clan Qing Family faction, now leaderless after Qing Yan's death and Qing Chi's unconscious state, was in utter disarray. The cultivators were panicked and demoralized, their morale plummeting to rock bottom, teetering on the brink of collapse.

Divine Technique: Life Hanging by a Thread!

At this critical moment, Ning Zhuo directly implanted the Divine Technique into Qing Chi, who lay in his arms.

He swiftly cast spells, alternating between diagnostic and healing techniques on Qing Chi's body.

"Qing Chi, wake up! Wake up quickly!"

Qing Chi, a member of the Ghostmen, had been rescued at the cost of Ning Zhuo, Luo Si, and Qing Yan's lives. Miraculously, her injuries weren't severe and healed rapidly.

With the Divine Technique's assistance, her eyes fluttered open.

After a brief moment of bewilderment, her eyes reddened and filled with tears.

Ning Zhuo abruptly set her upright, steadying her shoulders. "Qing Chi, this is no time for sorrow. Do you want revenge?!"

His urgent question left Qing Chi speechless.

Ning Zhuo shouted, "Your father is dead, and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is the mastermind behind it. He's your father's killer! Do you want revenge?!"

The grief on Qing Chi's face was swiftly replaced by fury and hatred. Blue flames seemed to ignite deep within her eyes as she ground her teeth and replied, "Yes! I must have revenge!"

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and looked her straight in the eyes. "Now, the opportunity for vengeance is right before us."

"You need to steady yourself and continue commanding the Qing-Jiao Army. I need your help - your military might. The more military power we have, the better! Can you do this, Qingqing?"

"Only by working together can we disrupt the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme and restore peace to White Paper Immortal City. We can ensure your father's sacrifice wasn't in vain and avenge all the innocent lives sacrificed in blood rituals!"

Qing Chi took a deep breath and nodded fiercely. "Little Ma, I'll follow your lead! Let's take revenge together!"

As she spoke, hot tears streamed down her cheeks.

Ning Zhuo licked his dry lips, finding it difficult to meet the clear, passionate gaze of Qing Chi.

He turned his gaze to the sky and said, "I've cast a spell on you that will allow you to receive my divine sense transmissions in a timely manner, and even receive my spell enhancements."

He was laying a protective layer over his Divine Art, Life Hanging by a Thread.

"Trust me!"

"We haven't lost yet."

"Next, as long as I can find the flaw in this Formation, I can once again influence the battle situation and reinforce Luo Si!"

Forgetful River Immortal City

City Lord's Mansion

"Heh, I'm back in," Zeng Jide said, leading Sun Lingtong. They transformed into a pool of Black Shadow, flowing like water through the cracks, and slipped into the City Lord's Mansion once more.

Earlier, he had almost abandoned his attempt to infiltrate the mansion.

But at the last moment, Sun Lingtong's heartfelt words struck him, jolting him awake. Something had always felt off - why had he obtained the River of Oblivion Vortex Eye so easily?

Clearly, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had deliberately set this trap, specifically arranging it for Zeng Jide to steal!

"The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord possesses the Heavenly Gift of Drowning in No Return, allowing him to draw others' cultivation memories from the Wangchuan River."

"Thus, even as a Ghost Cultivator, he excelled in Confucian cultivation and formations. The latter two points were evident from his grand scheme."

"Despite his profound mastery of formations, he didn't bother to set up any defenses around the River of Oblivion Vortex Eye."

"This setup was clearly designed to invite theft, hoping to get rid of me with a simple gesture."

"Then, fearing I might continue stealing and cause further damage, he launched a Golden Token backed by national power, forcing me into a humiliating retreat."

"Excellent... simply excellent..."

Zeng Jide gritted his teeth inwardly.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's dismissive approach, akin to tossing a beggar a coin, deeply offended the pride of this great thief.

Especially since Zeng Jide was accompanied by a junior fellow sect member - a young disciple he highly valued and greatly admired for his promising future.

When this junior grew older and looked back on this day, he would undoubtedly laugh: "So, Senior Zeng Jide was just this easily dismissed by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord?"

Where would Zeng Jide's dignity lie then?

Revenge. He must take brutal revenge!

So, Zeng Jide turned back with Sun Lingtong and returned to the City Lord's Mansion.

"I'll teach the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord a lesson he'll never forget!"

This time, Zeng Jide led Ning Zhuo straight to the heart of the City Lord's Mansion.

Zeng Jide still harbored no intention of helping the Painted Skin Rakshasa. His sole purpose remained to teach the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord a lesson, not to incur his wrath.

"Hmm? The defenses here are deceptive - loose on the outside, but tightly guarded within. A grand Formation has been erected, yet it clashes with the surrounding defenses. How peculiar."

Zeng Jide quickly sensed something amiss and was drawn to the anomaly.

The old man and the youth pierced through the Formation Space and arrived at its core, where they discovered a massive stone.

The stone was over thirty meters thick and nearly thirty meters long, resembling the fossilized spine of some ancient creature. Its surface was encrusted with layers of mud, lava, plant roots, and twisted, spiral-shaped holes. Deeply embedded in the earth, it was drawing in Earth Lung Qi on a terrifying scale.

"What is this?" Sun Lingtong asked Zeng Jide through their linked divine senses.

"This must be an Earth-Attribute Treasure, using the Formation to disperse its power outward," Zeng Jide replied. "Strange! Such a grand setup implies a significant purpose."

In that moment, Sun Lingtong had a sudden realization, nearly clapping in excitement. "This is perfect! Senior, since the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord has been bullying us, let's steal this treasure and give him a profound lesson!"

Zeng Jide hesitated. "Won't this... offend the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord?"

In the short time available, he couldn't identify the origin of the Formation surrounding the giant stone.

-----------------
Black Cloud Space.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

After a series of explosions, Ning Zhuo, clad in his third set of Azure Iron Han Armor, squeezed into a Formation Space as dark as ink.

Absolute silence and suffocating darkness enveloped him.

Sharp pains from various parts of his body and bone-deep exhaustion reminded Ning Zhuo of his harrowing escape.

There was no time to treat his wounds properly.

He had to push through, fighting every second!

Suppressing panic and despair deep within his heart, Ning Zhuo forced himself to calm down and focus.

Ghost Tide surges, White Paper imperiled; Lone Goose carries candle to pierce the Heavenly Veil. A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot; when myriad lamps illuminate, the calamity will crumble on its own.

I narrowly escaped by blowing through the barrier. Now, I must follow the guidance of "A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot" to reach the critical point and sabotage the Formation!

This was the method he had conceived on the Altar Battlefield to break the deadlock.

Cornered by the situation, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to take this desperate measure.

His divine sense struggled to spread through the thick, viscous darkness.

Dense black clouds pervaded the space, severely hindering the effectiveness of his divine sense.

He immediately deployed countless Mechanical Mirrors.

His divine sense refracted between the mirrors, rapidly expanding his detection range.

But all he saw were the swirling black clouds.

"It's time to use it."

Ning Zhuo retrieved a small, white, semi-transparent storage pouch. Inside, a swirling mass of Literary Qi emitted a radiant snow-white glow that illuminated the pouch's exterior.

The Literary Light Reflecting Snow Pouch!

A gift from Wen Ruanyu, the pouch contained a vast reservoir of his Literary Qi.

"Literary talents respect and compete with each other... their Literary Qi naturally attracts each other..." Ning Zhuo murmured inwardly as he carefully activated the pouch.

The snow-white glow intensified, initially forming a spherical orb that pierced the darkness and enveloped Ning Zhuo.

Then, as if drawn by some invisible force, the pouch itself began to distort slightly. The spherical glow transformed into a sharply pointed cone, its tip stretching in a specific direction.

Ning Zhuo hesitated no longer and immediately accelerated in the direction indicated by the Literary Light Reflecting Snow Pouch.

As he approached his goal, the snow-like light on the pouch grew increasingly concentrated and bright, as if drawn by a magnet. At the same time, the conical mass of light, which had been sharply pointed, gradually flattened into an oval shape.

When Ning Zhuo finally arrived, the oval mass had nearly reverted to a perfect sphere, its radiance stable and pure.

Ning Zhuo scanned his surroundings with his divine sense, but detected nothing unusual.

"The flow of energy here is remarkably smooth. There must be a node - a point where the Grand Formation's meridians converge and pass through, yet it's been cleverly concealed, with not a trace of leakage. If not for the guidance of the Literary Qi, it would be completely undetectable!"

He cast a series of detection spells. After a moment, his spirits lifted.

"This is definitely a crucial hub!"

"But I can't be certain it's my true target..."

Ning Zhuo fell into hesitation once more.

Formations cannot be tampered with recklessly. Without pinpointing the exact target, even a slight adjustment could set off a chain reaction, potentially altering the entire Formation Space beyond recognition.

After a few moments of thought, Ning Zhuo decided to mark this location and then search the surrounding area.

Altar Battlefield

Pfft!

Luo Si flew backward like a burst sack, spewing blood along his path.

Severely injured!

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God relentlessly pursued him, punching with deadly intent. Luo Si narrowly avoided the fatal blow.

The Turbid Filth God then harnessed Earth Lung Turbid Qi, creating a suffocating cover. Luo Si produced a talisman, gaining astonishing speed to evade again.

Without Military Power Amplification and having lost one of his two major magic treasures to destruction, while the other was trapped within the Turbid Filth God's grasp, Luo Si was running out of options.

His demise was imminent.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord remained hidden within a tributary, refraining from further action, focusing all his energy on weakening the Ice Coffin to retrieve the Nether Dragon Scissors.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God roared with laughter. "Luo Si, you traitor! What madness possesses you to defect to the White Paper Immortal City?"

"Look at your sorry state! The 'Young Master' you pledged yourself to has already abandoned you, fleeing with his true love!"

"You actually threw your lot in with such a worthless fool?"

"How could you be so thoroughly deceived by the Ash Bone Elder?!"

Luo Si remained silent, desperately fleeing under the relentless onslaught of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, losing all patience, snarled and struck. "You die first! The Ash Bone Elder will follow!"

Turbid qi restrained Luo Si, leaving him helpless as the fatal fist closed in to shatter his skull.

Pfft!

At the critical moment, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God suddenly deflated. The punch, affected by the loss of power, veered off course and struck Luo Si's shoulder instead.

Luo Si suffered further injury, but at least he retained his life.

Enraged, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God swung another punch.

Pfft!

He deflated again, his divine body shrinking rapidly like a punctured balloon.

What's happening?!

Forgetful River Prefecture Lord?!
