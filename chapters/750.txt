Chapter 750: The Big-Headed Youth's Righteous Path Demeanor

"I..." Under normal circumstances, Ban Ji would have already unleashed a torrent of curses. He was known for his short temper and had no pretense of Righteous Path decorum.

But just as the curses were about to erupt, he suddenly remembered where he was.

This wasn't the Ban Clan's territory; it was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, with countless eyes watching.

Forcing the curses back down, he glared at Ning Zhuo with eyes burning like fire.

This little brat actually treats me like a Demonic Cultivator! This Righteous Path facade is utterly detestable!

No, wait. Even though I'm a Demonic Cultivator, I'm also of the Ban Clan. I'm righteous! I'm righteous!

Realizing his mistake, Ban Ji immediately retorted, accusing Ning Zhuo of slander.

To his surprise, Ning Zhuo tilted his large head, looked down his nose at Ban Ji, and said with disdain, "Ban Ji, your reputation precedes you. Now it seems you're all talk and no action - a hypocritical coward, nothing more."

With that, he flicked his sleeve and strode away.

"You..." Ban Ji seethed with rage, his fists clenching instinctively.

In the past, Ban Ji would have annihilated any cultivator who dared to provoke him, either through his own martial prowess or by summoning the Ban Clan's forces to overwhelm the offender.

But now, he couldn't.

Ban Ji's eyes burned crimson as he glared at Ning Zhuo's retreating back, his fists clenched so tightly he longed to punch through the man's heart.

This is infuriating!

Ban Ji had never been so publicly humiliated, so thoroughly slapped in the face.

And he couldn't even refute it.

Because he had done exactly what Ning Zhuo accused him of. Even his recent denial sounded weak and unconvincing.

I want to kill him with a single punch!

I want to stomp on his head and scream, "So what if I did it?! What are you going to do about it?!"

A violent impulse surged through Ban Ji, his Demonic Art activating instinctively, causing malevolent Qi to erupt from his body.

But he couldn't act on it.

Doing so would be a blatant violation of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's rules. Even the entire Ban Clan couldn't protect him from the consequences.

I don't care about myself! But how will my parents face the clan?

This is unbearable! Utterly unbearable!

For a moment, Ban Ji was so enraged he wanted to roar at the heavens.

This is truly unbearable.

If only I didn't have a family, the thought flashed through his divine sea with unprecedented intensity.

The Demonic Path emphasized indulging one's desires and emotions, urging practitioners to fully express their feelings. To hell with heaven and earth - I am the greatest! My personal emotions are paramount; the world revolves around me.

Only by adhering to this principle could Demonic Cultivators smoothly cultivate their Demonic Arts.

This fundamental tenet naturally clashed with rules and regulations, making it difficult for Demonic Cultivators to integrate into tightly knit organizations.

However, Demonic Cultivators were also skilled at manipulating the emotions of others.

Now, Ning Zhuo had ruthlessly stirred up Ban Ji's intense anger and hatred.

Ban Ji clenched his teeth so hard they ground together with a grating sound.

I've made my decision!

I will crush you to ashes.

I will trample you underfoot and wash away this humiliation.

Just you wait. You'll pay for this.

Why hasn't the Rising Cloud Minor Trial started yet?!

Ban Ji's entire body radiated murderous intent.

Many onlookers' eyes gleamed with excitement.

They had witnessed a juicy drama and a lively spectacle.

Some nodded inwardly, thinking, "Ning Zhuo truly lives up to his reputation as a rising star of the Righteous Path. His unwavering righteousness under the Three Trials of the Heart is evident in his actions today."

Others frowned in confusion, wondering, "How could the prestigious Ban Clan tolerate someone like Ban Ji? His Demonic Art is remarkably powerful."

Still others shook their heads secretly, concluding, "With just a few verbal exchanges, Ban Ji was provoked to the brink of losing control. The clear disparity between their capabilities is now undeniable."

Everyone yearned to roam freely, believing themselves to be the greatest under heaven, yet none wished for others to become such domineering Demonic Cultivators.

Thus, the crowd naturally leaned toward Ning Zhuo.

In this initial verbal clash, Ning Zhuo had already gained the upper hand, using Ban Ji as a foil to highlight his own virtues and win over a portion of the crowd.

Having sized up Ban Ji upon their first meeting, Ning Zhuo deliberately provoked him before withdrawing. After surveying the crowd, he approached Lu Zeng, bowing respectfully.

"May I inquire if you are Senior Lu Zeng?" Ning Zhuo asked with a composed smile and impeccable courtesy.

Ning Zhuo naturally paid even closer attention to Mechanism Cultivators, and Lu Zeng was among the individuals he had gathered intelligence on.

Lu Zeng wore indigo robes, his waist encircled by numerous tool pouches. A bronze compass-ruler hung from his chest, while a wooden mechanism box was strapped to his back.

Ning Zhuo knew that Lu Zeng's primary cultivation method was the Connected Thread Coupling Art, and his Lifebound Treasure was a mechanical construct called the Thousand-Mechanism Lotus.

Lu Zeng faced Ning Zhuo with genuine warmth, his broad smile radiating sincerity as he waved his hands repeatedly. "Please, please, you flatter me. Let's treat each other as equals."

Though Ning Zhuo's cultivation was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, Lu Zeng would never underestimate him.

Ning Zhuo had distinguished himself as a prodigy in the very first wave of trials, his future prospects at least Golden Core-level. He had already earned the favor of the Confucian cultivator community and the Demon Subjugation Hall, and his public confrontation with Ban Ji and the Ban Clan demonstrated his formidable confidence.

Even a blind man could see the boundless potential of such a figure. Lu Zeng, being far from blind, naturally treated him as an equal.

After a brief exchange, Lu Zeng proactively gifted Ning Zhuo a Jade Token, explaining that it would grant him discounts on future transactions.

Lu Zeng already operated several shops. If he successfully joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he anticipated establishing a branch within the sect's main mountain gate, selling a wide array of mechanism attachments.

He specialized in crafting these attachments, and the brilliance of the Connected Thread Coupling Art was fully realized in them. Simply affixing one to a mechanical construct would cause fine threads to materialize, tightly binding the two together.

Through mass sales of these attachments, Lu Zeng amassed cultivation resources, fueling his own cultivation progress.

After presenting the jade pendant to Ning Zhuo, Lu Zeng proactively sent another pendant flying toward Ban Ji, right before Ning Zhuo's eyes.

"You two are both dragons and phoenixes among men, true geniuses of Mechanism cultivation. If we can establish future business dealings, the more the merrier!"

A sharp glint flashed in both Ning Zhuo's and Ban Ji's eyes.

With this gesture, Lu Zeng publicly declared his neutrality: I'm a businessman. I'll befriend both of you and offend neither!

This aligned with his humble origins as an outer sect handyman and matched the personality traits described in intelligence reports about him.

After exchanging a few more words with Lu Zeng, Ning Zhuo excused himself.

He then approached Tie Zheng, the Golden Core cultivator, who stood nearby.

Tie Zheng stood eight feet tall, his face hidden behind a bronze beast mask. Clad in martial artist attire, his exposed elbows and knees were replaced with polished steel bone spheres.

He carried a massive broadsword with a qilin-beast head hilt on his back, a heavy iron chain coiled around his waist. Twelve bronze bells, each shaped like a beast's head, hung from the chain.

Ning Zhuo attempted to strike up a conversation, but Tie Zheng responded coldly. After a few terse exchanges, Ning Zhuo withdrew.

He knew Tie Zheng's background and wasn't bothered by the man's aloof demeanor.

Tie Zheng had been born into a prominent clan, but repeated betrayals by his parents, wife, and sworn brothers had filled him with contempt and loathing for humanity. He abandoned his family to become a solitary cultivator, spending his days training alone in the wilderness.

He trusted his sword more than anyone else.

Through a stroke of fortune in the wilderness, he had gained the ability to cultivate sword beasts. To date, he had raised twelve such creatures, each crafted from Golden Core-level blades, making them Golden Core-level beasts themselves.

This gave him a combat prowess far exceeding the norm, making him a renowned Golden Core-level rogue cultivator in the Flying Cloud Kingdom.

Ning Zhuo then approached Ao Pan and offered a respectful bow. "Junior Ning Zhuo greets Senior. I am unaware of your esteemed name and humbly beg your forgiveness."

Ning Zhuo recognized the first two Golden Core cultivators present, but Ao Pan was unfamiliar to him.

Having thoroughly studied the intelligence reports at his disposal, Ning Zhuo was certain that Ao Pan's name was nowhere to be found.

This could only mean that Ao Pan had recently arrived at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate.

Ao Pan stood seven feet tall, his hunched posture resembling that of an old ape. Three claw marks scarred his left cheek, and his eyes were mismatched in size. His right eye was smaller and cloudy like stone, while his left eye was slightly larger, with a vertical pupil and a golden iris.

"No need to apologize for your ignorance. I'm from the Subduing Waves Kingdom and only arrived yesterday."

"Ning Zhuo, I know of you. Like you, I'm an outsider here."

Among the three Golden Core cultivators, Ao Pan showed the warmest attitude toward Ning Zhuo.

"Subduing Waves Kingdom?" Ning Zhuo's interest was piqued. He seized the opportunity to steer the conversation, exchanging a few words with Ao Pan.

Having read extensively, Ning Zhuo possessed a solid grasp of general knowledge and was familiar with some of the customs and traditions of the Subduing Waves Kingdom.

Ao Pan, in turn, spoke of matters he knew well, immediately feeling a sense of kinship. He wanted to continue chatting with Ning Zhuo, but Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in apology and took his leave.

"Though he's a body cultivator, he's quite shrewd. I tried probing him subtly by bringing up the Subduing Waves Kingdom, but he deftly evaded every attempt, offering only vague responses."

After a brief exchange, Ning Zhuo had already grasped Ao Pan's temperament.

In comparison, Tie Zheng seemed far more reliable.

Ning Zhuo decisively withdrew from the conversation.

Ao Pan watched the retreating figure of the large-headed youth, his mismatched eyes narrowing slightly. "This kid's even more slippery than I am. He passed the Three Trials of the Heart with righteous fervor, but he's no simpleton. He possesses remarkable social finesse."

"He drew me into talking about the Subduing Waves Kingdom, extracting all sorts of information about me, while I still don't even know where he's from!"

Before the Rising Cloud Minor Trial began, Ning Zhuo continued to cultivate connections with the surrounding cultivators.

His gaze soon settled on Zhang Wangxing.

The man radiated an unmistakable aura of peak Foundation Establishment.

Zhang Wangxing was powerfully built, yet he wore an even larger, coarse gray robe. A massive hood concealed his face, further obscured by a spell-conjured shadow that shrouded his features.

Though it was broad daylight outside Profound Armor Cave, Ning Zhuo could only make out the lower edge of the shadow beneath the hood, tracing the curve of Zhang Wangxing's jawline. Even this line occasionally flickered with subtle tremors.

"Fellow Daoist, might you be Zhang Wangxing?" Ning Zhuo called out proactively.

Zhang Wangxing nodded slightly, his voice hoarse. "Indeed, it is I, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo."

Ning Zhuo knew his reputation. Though only at the Foundation Establishment stage, Zhang Wangxing possessed Golden Core-level combat prowess. He cultivated the Flesh Transformation Sutra, a technique that perfectly complemented his low-grade Innate Talent. Despite his polite demeanor, he was a rogue cultivator who took on any job for a high price, using the earnings to fund his cultivation.

Zhang Wangxing transmitted a message with his divine sense: "If you plan to deal with Ban Ji in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, I can assist you. Given your noble lineage, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, I trust you won't be stingy."

Ning Zhuo didn't refuse, replying with his divine sense: "We'll see. The situation remains unclear, but I'll contact you if needed, Fellow Daoist Zhang."

Zhang Wangxing chuckled softly. "Be careful, Fellow Daoist. To be frank, if Ban Ji were to hire me, I'd accept."

His tone carried an implicit threat, a clear attempt to raise his price.

This put Ning Zhuo in a delicate position. Realizing he couldn't linger, he promptly excused himself and departed.

"I made a grand entrance, secured a stone token in the first wave, defied the Ban Clan, provoked Ban Ji, and earned the equal treatment of Golden Core cultivators."

"Yet here I am, at a disadvantage before a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator. How ironic."

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel a sense of irony.

After leaving Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo traveled the world, witnessing its majestic mountains and rivers and encountering people of all kinds. Now, gathered beneath the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Flying Cloud Assembly, with cultivators from every corner of the land, his horizons expanded further, and his heart stirred with frequent inspiration.

"Young Master Ning Zhuo!" A Mechanism Cultivator approached Ning Zhuo and bowed in greeting.

This cultivator, also at the Foundation Establishment stage, was stout and muscular, with dark, gleaming skin like a hunk of iron. He carried a square iron shield on his back and moved with deliberate slowness.

Ning Zhuo smiled warmly upon seeing him and called out his name: "Zhang Dadan."

This was an old acquaintance.

Zhang Dadan had participated in Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Minor Trial, and Ning Zhuo had even hosted a banquet for him afterward. Besides Zhang Dadan, the other attendees had included Patchwork Sun, Chen San, Jiang Xiaobian, and Huo Wa'er.

Ning Zhuo still remembered them vividly.

Ning Zhuo clapped Zhang Dadan on the shoulder. "What about the others?"

He learned that Patchwork Sun had originally planned to come with Zhang Dadan but was delayed by another Rising Cloud Minor Trial. Fortunately, the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's Rising Cloud Minor Trial had multiple rounds, similar to the Demon Subjugation Hall, so he hadn't missed his chance entirely.

Chen San had already pledged allegiance to Ning Zhuo and was currently carrying out his missions.

Jiang Xiaobian and Huo Wa'er, however, had no interest in the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor. It didn't align with their cultivation paths.

For them, with so many Rising Cloud Minor Trials available, there were bound to be ones more suited to their interests.

After exchanging a few words with Zhang Dadan, Ning Zhuo was approached by other cultivators eager to strike up a conversation.

Ban Ji had previously maintained a cold and aloof demeanor, as if warning strangers to keep their distance. As a Demonic Cultivator with a notorious reputation (greatly amplified by Ning Zhuo's rumors), even those who wished to curry favor hesitated, weighing the risks.

Ning Zhuo, however, was different.

His mere presence had provoked Ban Ji into a frenzy, allowing Ning Zhuo to seize the upper hand and display his dominance. Increasingly, cultivators became convinced that the power behind Ning Zhuo was no less formidable than that of the Ban Clan. Otherwise, how could they explain his unwavering confidence and overwhelming presence?

Moreover, Ning Zhuo actively engaged in conversation, treating even someone like Zhang Dadan with warmth and friendliness, which stirred the hearts of the observing cultivators.

As a result, Ning Zhuo didn't need to seek out others; many cultivators actively approached him.

He responded to each one with consistent kindness and sincerity.

This scene starkly contrasted with Ban Ji's isolation. Standing alone by the cliff wall, he looked utterly neglected.

Ban Ji watched Ning Zhuo, now surrounded by a crowd, his eyes twitching uncontrollably.

Damn it!

This familiar scenario was repeating itself.

This is bad.

If this continues, will Ning Zhuo rally another group of fools to gang up on me again?

He's a real headache!

A true nuisance!

Ning Zhuo had only been present for a short time, yet after just a few rounds of socializing, Ban Ji already felt the pressure mounting once more.
