Chapter 811: Dao-Bearing Jade Page

"Therefore, this time, I must win!"

It was precisely with this pressure that Gu Qing exhausted his mental efforts and went all out.

Up to this point, he had not let down his own hard work. The quality of his semi-finished product was excellent, ranking at the top of the venue, making him the most promising candidate for victory.

The Understanding Tone Glue was successfully refined.

Gu Qing used a specially made Phoenix feather brush to evenly apply the glue onto the paper base.

Every stroke was maintained at a uniform speed and steadiness, while simultaneously mobilizing the god phantom within the Upper Dantian in his Divine Sea.

The Confucius God!

Confucian cultivators read familiarly and delved deeply into the classics. When their mastery of certain classics reached a specific level, quantitative change would trigger a qualitative change, forming the phantom of a Confucian deity within their own Literary Palace.

At this critical moment, Gu Qing invoked the power of the Confucius God, transmitting it into the paper base, once again pushing the paper-making process successfully to the next step.

Time was up.

Ning Zhuo looked at the paper base in his hands, feeling a wave of lingering fear.

"That was close!"

"I almost failed halfway through and fell short of success!"

"Fortunately, I have the blessings of the Three Confucian Gods on me. At the critical moment, their divine power was triggered, allowing me to turn danger into safety."

Zhao Hansheng's gaze was sharp, staring at Ning Zhuo for several moments.

"My perception shouldn't be wrong."

"Just now, this junior nearly failed, yet the divine power of Confucian deities surged from his body."

"He came prepared..."

Zhao Hansheng sighed deeply in his heart.

Ning Zhuo's performance had repeatedly exceeded his expectations. Zhao Hansheng originally thought Ning Zhuo would fall by the wayside, but unexpectedly, despite stumbling along the way, he had actually made it to the end.

The entire paper-making method consisted of nine chapters. Ning Zhuo had passed the eighth chapter, which meant he had already learned the entire method.

Zhao Hansheng could not publicly renege on his promise. Fortunately, Gu Qing's performance had been excellent from start to finish, bringing him much comfort.

Having such a student made his sacrifice as a teacher worthwhile.

At this moment, only eleven people remained in the arena!

The Ninth Chapter!

"The Book of Rites says: The great jade is not polished; the supreme text has no pattern. Observe the skilled butcher dissecting the ox, meeting it with his spirit rather than viewing it with his eyes; realize Wheelwright Bian hewing the wheel, grasping it in his heart and responding with his hand. Thus, hang it before the bright mirror of the Spirit Platform, and place it beneath the wondrous Bodhi Tree. Wait for the East Sea to turn into mulberry fields three times, and for the peaches on the West Mountain to ripen several times..."

Gu Qing took a deep breath.

This was the final step.

He dared not be careless, nor did he dare to deliberately stall for time. He went straight ahead and took three precious materials: Apricot Altar Sacred Soil, Bright Mirror Stand Tile, and Bodhi Tree Leaf.

He began to set up a formation, using these three precious materials as the suppression objects in the formation eyes.

The formation wasn't rare; it was the most common Three Talents Formation.

After successfully laying down the formation, he placed the paper base into the formation core.

Array Refining!

The brilliance of the formation constantly rippled, and the paper base began to transform. The patterns on its surface gradually simplified, the colors gradually faded, and its aura gradually became restrained.

The formation continued to operate.

One hour, two hours...

Gu Qing was determined to take first place, so he adopted the most time-consuming and strenuous method, which was also the safest.

Using this method, the spiritual paper he refined would also reach the highest quality.

Ning Zhuo, however, was still analyzing the method.

"The great jade is not polished... because it is born of Heaven and Earth, formed naturally."

"The supreme text has no pattern... because true articles reside in the human heart, not on paper."

"The skilled butcher dissecting the ox, meeting it with his spirit rather than viewing it with his eyes... because he understands the essence of the ox and is not confused by appearances."

"Wheelwright Bian hewing the wheel, grasping it in his heart and responding with his hand... because the skill has integrated into his life and become instinct."

Confucian Technique - Head Hanging from the Rafters!

The roots of his hair, tied by a hemp rope, brought a continuous pulling sensation to Ning Zhuo.

Confucian Technique - Awl Piercing Thigh!

Sharp, direct pain constantly stimulated Ning Zhuo, making the youth's mind like a taut bowstring. Sharp thoughts rose and fell, emerging one after another.

His divine thoughts were running dry; he couldn't hold on much longer...

Ning Zhuo felt dizzy and his vision blurred.

At the critical moment, he decisively took out a strand of Literary Wind from his Storage Belt to empower himself.

The Literary Wind was consumed, producing wisps of Literary Qi that nourished the Upper Dantian Divine Sea.

"So, 'Returning to Truth' isn't about removing anything, but recognizing something."

"Recognizing that paper is inherently paper, recognizing that I am inherently human, recognizing that the Dao inherently exists."

Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes.

He had fully comprehended this final ninth chapter.

But time was running out!

"Gu Qing used the Three Talents Formation. This is indeed the steadiest method; if I were him, I would choose it too."

"But for the current me... there isn't enough time."

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, racking his brains and exhausting his thoughts, finally coming up with a method.

"Sigh, in such a situation, I can only take a risk and gamble."

"Whether it succeeds or not is out of my control."

Ning Zhuo held the paper base in his hands and spat out a mouthful of vital essence blood, while simultaneously calling upon the names of the gods in his heart.

Divine Summoning Art!

It was the Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art!

The divine power of the Confucius God surged out from Ning Zhuo's body, converging in mid-air to form a phantom of the Confucius God.

He looked at Ning Zhuo's paper base and gently blew a breath of air onto it.

That breath merged into the paper, and the paper suddenly "came alive" - not turning into a living creature, but gaining a sense of "life."

The Confucius God's divine power dissipated completely.

The divine power of the Mencius God was also triggered, all of it leaving the body to condense into a phantom of the Mencius God.

The Mencius God stepped forward, virtually pressing the two classics, Mencius and the Book of Rites, onto the paper base.

Impartiality, uprightness, integrity.

The feeling the paper base gave off changed again. It seemed it was no longer a passive carrier waiting for anyone to write on it, but an "existence" with a stance, principles, and strength of character.

The Mencius God phantom dissipated, and the Zisi God phantom appeared in the air!

In the next moment, the paper base became moist, becoming firm yet yielding, adaptable to circumstances, and harmoniously moderate!

The Zisi God phantom scattered, and the paper base completed its final transformation!

When Ning Zhuo gazed at it, it was as if he saw the vast sky, the heavy earth, and the warm human heart.

Heaven, Earth, Man.

Return to Truth!

Dao-Bearing Jade Page, complete!

At this moment, Ning Zhuo made it. Through divine refining at the final juncture, he overtook Gu Qing, who had been leading the entire time, and became the first in the arena to refine the Dao-Bearing Jade Page.

"What? Ning Zhuo can actually mobilize the three Great Confucian Gods!" Gu Qing was shaken to his core.

Ning Zhuo felt like he was in a dream as he looked at the spiritual paper before him. "I actually succeeded!?"

He had to admit, there was an element of gambling involved.

He didn't have time to use the Three Talents Formation for refining; he could only go through divine refining.

Borrowing the power of the gods to achieve his own goal.

But Ning Zhuo's relationship with the three Confucian Gods was quite ordinary, so he had absolutely no assurance. It was purely a desperate attempt, treating a dead horse as if it were alive. Since it was the only way, he might as well try.

The result of the attempt - hey, it succeeded!

"The Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art is indeed formidable, truly profound and mysterious." Ning Zhuo realized the value of the Zhu family's technique deeply at this moment, and subconsciously glanced toward Zhu Fenxiang.

Zhu Fenxiang had also fought her way to the end.

At this moment, she stared blankly at Ning Zhuo, her mouth slightly open, her pupils filled with shock and suspicion.

"With a relationship like that between Ning Zhuo and the three Confucian Gods, he actually succeeded on the first try?!"

"That is too ridiculous!"

Zhu Fenxiang had just been trying as well, but the three Confucian Gods had shown no reaction whatsoever.

"Ning Zhuo must be using my Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art. But he only has the first layer; I have mastered the entire text."

"I didn't get a response from a single god, yet Ning Zhuo successfully mobilized three gods in a row? what kind of luck is this?!"

The grand formation slowly came to a halt. Gu Qing's paper boat had shed all its flashiness, becoming simple and elegant, like an unpolished piece of jade.

Gu Qing opened the formation and was in the process of taking out the paper base to complete the final step.

But at this moment, he saw that Ning Zhuo had succeeded in making the paper first. His heart couldn't help but skip a beat!

Ning Zhuo overtaking him caused a slight tremor in his hand movements.

His condition was very poor; he was extremely exhausted. Although his physical and soul foundation were robust, by now, he had been squeezed to the limit.

The key was that his heartstrings had been tight the whole time; he sought only a beautiful victory to prove himself.

But now, Ning Zhuo had surpassed him!

Gu Qing panicked.

His movement deformed, immediately affecting the retrieval of the paper.

The paper instantly shattered, the surface covered in cracks!

Gu Qing: ??!!

For a moment, he stared with eyes wide open, his eyeballs covered in crimson blood vessels.

"Hm?!" Zhao Hansheng was also stunned. He never expected that at the very last moment, his beloved disciple would fall short of success!

"Qing'er has never been this exhausted making paper before. He wanted a grand victory too much to maintain his own reputation!"

"Sigh, others entered the battle with light packs, but he has long carried a heavy burden in his heart."

"But the key is... luck."

If Gu Qing had been disturbed a bit earlier, while still in the process of the Three Talents Formation refining, it wouldn't have mattered much even if his movements were deformed.

It just had to be during the extraction of the paper from the formation - a critical node where the paper needed to be well protected as it adapted from the inside out.

It was an error at this exact point that caused the paper's quality to plummet!

"This... I..." Gu Qing looked at the cracked paper in his hands, his face ashen. His lips moved, but for a moment, his eyes were filled with despair.

It took a full dozen breaths before he reacted. With a numb expression and stiff movements, he completed the final step.

Dao-Bearing Jade Page, complete!

"Qing'er has lost." Zhao Hansheng's eyes flickered slightly. As early as when Gu Qing failed to retrieve the paper, he had already foreseen this result.

He had intervened in the third small trial for Confucian cultivators, not hesitating to bring out one of his prized possessions, the Dao-Bearing Jade Page Paper-Making Method, wanting to build a stage for his beloved disciple to shine.

He didn't expect it to fail.

"Ning Zhuo... this junior indeed possesses extraordinary innate talent and uncommon foundation."

"He will be a good rival for Qing'er."

"Failure is also a good thing for Qing'er." Zhao Hansheng's eyes reflected Gu Qing's despondent look; he had already accepted the facts before him.

He was a Great Scholar whose name was known throughout the kingdom; he had sufficient magnanimity. Such victory or defeat was trivial in his heart.

His divine sense covered the entire venue, taking in the status of the other cultivators.

Of the eleven who persisted to the end, more than half had failed midway.

Probably only five would succeed in making the paper in the end.

Among these five were Ning Zhuo and Gu Qing.

However, Zhao Hansheng was not paying attention to these five at the moment. Instead, his gaze fell intentionally or unintentionally on another person.

This cultivator had the appearance of an old man, with a Golden Core Great aura. He was radiant like cut jade, his cheekbones slightly raised like hidden peaks concealing mountains, and three strands of long beard the color of autumn frost hung down to his chest. His ten finger joints were distinct like bamboo nodes, and the pads of his fingers bore whorls that shimmered slightly.

"This person gave up voluntarily midway."

"Otherwise, with his finished product, even if Qing'er hadn't made a mistake, it would have been hard to distinguish the winner."

"This person has been concealing his strength; his methods are quite brilliant."

Previously, Zhao Hansheng hadn't noticed, but by the ninth chapter, the number of people was so few that this old cultivator stood out.

Zhao Hansheng sighed in his heart: "Myriad Manifestations Sect is worthy of being the number one sect in the Flying Cloud Kingdom. Even looking across various cultivation nations, such a super sect is extremely rare."

"Every Flying Cloud Assembly can attract countless talents to join this sect."

"Gathering such momentum, it is simply like the sea accepting a hundred rivers - majestic and vast!"

Three hours passed in a flash.

Several cultivators shook their heads repeatedly; they had fallen at the last step and failed. Zhu Fenxiang was one of them.

She had doubts in her heart, as well as grievances: "Clearly I had more divine power of the Confucian Gods on me, so why didn't my prayer succeed?"

"My failure... is actually normal. After all, the Divine Summoning Art is like that, and my relationship with the three Confucian Gods is quite ordinary."

"But why?"

"Why did Ning Zhuo of all people succeed?!"

Why him?

It was like this with the True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard before, and it was the same with the three Confucian Gods now. They all looked at Ning Zhuo with special regard.

Why?

In what way am I inferior to Ning Zhuo?

Is my head not as big as his?

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Zhao Hansheng examined the final five finished products.

Although the five sheets of spiritual paper were successfully refined, their quality was quite ordinary, some even terrible to behold.

But neither the cultivators present nor the onlookers underestimated these five people. Because they had also witnessed, or even personally participated in, the difficulty involved.

As the chief official, Zhao Hansheng evaluated cautiously.

After a long time.

He announced: "The winner of this time - Ning Zhuo."

In terms of quality, everyone's spiritual paper did not exceed a certain level, and Ning Zhuo was the earliest to finish. It was reasonable and fair for the victory to belong to him.

Under the public gaze, it was impossible for Zhao Hansheng to practice favoritism.

"Ning Zhuo!" Gu Qing's body swayed violently, his vision going black, nearly fainting on the spot.

He barely managed to support himself, trying hard to stand straight.

Congratulations from behind and cheers from the entire venue had already erupted.

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, it really is you. Congratulations, congratulations."

"Three wins out of five rounds, you are the top name of the three Confucian tests!"

"Amazing, truly amazing. Worthy of being the genius cultivator of this session. clearly not a Confucian cultivator, yet able to defeat the orthodox practitioners and win the championship this time!"

The cultivators who had persisted to the end gathered around Ning Zhuo, offering their congratulations one after another.

Zhu Fenxiang was among them, a smile on her face, though her mood was complicated.

Ning Zhuo's face was pale; having fought to this point, he had also reached his own limit.

He barely managed to respond to everyone, while feelings of joy constantly welled up in his heart.

The difficulty of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page Paper-Making Method had exceeded his expectations. Stumbling along the way, with luck and external force, obtaining such a result also exceeded his expectations.

This was an unexpected victory.

With this, the three Confucian cultivation tests concluded.

The final winner surprised countless people, and the entire Confucian cultivator community discussed the result animatedly.

"This time, it wasn't a layout we intentionally planned."

"This junior that Lord Wen Ruanyu has his eye on will definitely have extraordinary achievements in the future."

"That Noble Spirit... I will never forget it in my life. Once he joins the Myriad Manifestations Sect and grows a little, he will surely become an influential figure!"

"Hehehe, don't forget his other identity. He already has influence superior to others right now."

"Ah, right, right, he is also Meng Yaoyin's son!"

"Speaking of which, he is far more excellent than Meng Yaoyin was back then. It's truly good; the student surpasses the master."

The Xingyun Minor Test ended, but the crowd lingered, unwilling to disperse. The atmosphere around Ning Zhuo grew increasingly enthusiastic.

The elderly cultivator looked back once, smiled faintly, and quietly left.

"Fellow Daoist, please stay." Zhao Hansheng sent a voice transmission from afar, wanting to invite the elderly cultivator for a private gathering. "Does Fellow Daoist perhaps have a history with Ning Zhuo? Is that why you voluntarily ceded the top spot?"

The elderly cultivator paused slightly and responded with his divine sense: "I am Zhen Juxia. Lord Zhao has eyes like torches; since you have seen through it, I dare not put you off with false words."

"It's just that this matter... cannot be fully described by the word 'ceding'."

"My Lord's intentions were painstaking, paving the way for your student Gu Qing, not hesitating to use a heavy treasure as a stepping stone. Such a teacher's heart... Zhen is deeply moved and wishes to emulate it."

"Zhen has no connection with Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, only having heard of his reputation as a genius before. In this small trial, I witnessed the scene of his Noble Spirit piercing through the clouds."

"Zhen has drifted all his life, traversing the nine provinces, and seen no fewer than a hundred sects. Yet only the atmosphere of the Myriad Manifestations Sect suits my heart best."

"Therefore, although I have no old friendship with Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, we will be fellow disciples in the future, and there will be new camaraderie."

Hearing this explanation, Zhao Hansheng nodded slightly and sighed with emotion: "So that is how it is."

"Neither of you has truly joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect yet, but you already have such feelings of fellowship. It is no wonder the Myriad Manifestations Sect is the number one sect in the Flying Cloud Kingdom."

"With people's hearts aligning like this... the Myriad Manifestations Sect is destined to flourish."
