Chapter 294: Kidnapping

Other factions targeting and creating trouble for Ning Zhuo was something Ning Xiaoren was quite pleased to see. However, with the assassins having dragged him personally into the fray, he felt utterly terrible!

Being implicated by enemies and being thrown into life-and-death predicaments were situations that Ning Xiaoren never wanted to experience.

He forced himself to calm down: "First, I need to deal with the Gu insect inside me!" 

Yet, as soon as he had this thought, the Gu insect suddenly triggered. Ning Xiaoren once again writhed on the ground in pain, howling in agony.

"If I openly seek help, I might just die from the pain!" 

He finally understood that the masked assassin had let him regain his freedom because he had extreme confidence in the Gu insect and had already considered Ning Xiaoren's attempts to seek help.

"I need to find my father and have him help me. Others likely don't have a means to remove the Gu and won't genuinely help me." 

However, the Ning Family Clan Leader was not in the Immortal Palace; he was still in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, overseeing the family's affairs. Ning Xiaoren couldn't contact him and didn't dare to leave the palace rashly.

With no other choice, Ning Xiaoren had to follow the assassin's wishes for now in an attempt to buy time. 

After resting for a moment, he left his room and headed towards Ning Zhuo's current residence. 

After some reconnaissance, Ning Xiaoren fell into despair once more. Ning Zhuo and Ning Jiufan's residence was heavily guarded, surrounded by layers of Ning family cultivators, making it nearly impossible to approach the center. 

Even meeting Ning Zhuo was extremely difficult. How could he cause trouble for him?

Ning Xiaoren shrank back into a dark corner, feeling increasingly hopeless. 

At this moment, a young cultivator walked out with a swagger, surrounded by several cultivators who flattered and praised him. It was none other than Ning Ji. 

The crowd around him continued to flatter and fawn over him. Ning Ji, pleased with the attention, casually handed out pills or spirit stones as rewards, which only intensified the flattery around him.

Ning Xiaoren's eyes turned red with envy: "Isn't this brat Ning Zhuo's cousin? After Ning Zhuo rose to prominence, he promptly resigned from his duties at the Talisman Hall to cling to Ning Zhuo." 

"Such extravagance! Hmph, just a petty person who has gained favor!" 

Ning Xiaoren felt both resentment and bitterness. Once upon a time, he was the one surrounded by people. 

Times had changed, and a once insignificant Qi Refining cultivator from a branch family was now being exalted, while Ning Xiaoren could only hide in the shadows.

The heavens are unjust! 

Ning Xiaoren glared at Ning Ji, wishing he could break the arrogant youth's bones. 

"Wait!" 

"I can't get close to Ning Zhuo, but I can target this little brat Ning Ji." 

"The assassin only wants me to cause trouble for Ning Zhuo. If I kidnap Ning Ji and send a ransom note, isn't that causing trouble?" 

Ning Xiaoren suddenly had a flash of inspiration, thinking of a way to deal with the masked assassin.

He squinted his eyes, a glint of sinister light flashing in his gaze. He began to tail Ning Ji. 

After following for a while, Ning Xiaoren found an opportunity. He was about to make a move but then hesitated. 

"I shouldn't act personally. It's too risky!" 

"I need to find someone else to do it for me." But who could he find?

Ning Xiaoren was no longer the Deputy Clan Leader of the Ning family. He had been expelled from the family and was now a lone wolf. 

Ning Xiaoren, being cunning, quickly thought of someone - Ning Xiaohui's grandmother! Ning Xiaohui's grandmother had become increasingly senile, with her rationality growing more and more scarce. 

Ning Xiaoren had retreated to recuperate while Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, severely injured, also had to step back from the front lines for treatment.

Ning Xiaoren found her lying on a sickbed in the medical station at the rear. 

"Granny, I know where Ning Xiaohui is." Ning Xiaoren's first words made Ning Xiaohui's grandmother cry out. 

"Quiet, quiet!" Ning Xiaoren quickly cautioned, "If you're too loud, the enemy will know and take Xiaohui away." 

"No, my Xiaohui!" Ning Xiaohui's grandmother looked terrified and immediately lowered her voice.

Under her questioning, Ning Xiaoren told her: Ning Xiaohui was secretly imprisoned by Ning Zhuo, and only a few people knew this secret. 

If you want to rescue your granddaughter, you must use the same method against Ning Zhuo by kidnapping his relatives and negotiating for a hostage exchange!

Ning Xiaohui's grandmother's eyes widened: "That's a good plan!" 

A scheme targeting Ning Zhuo was taking shape. 

The two conspirators were unaware that this situation had already been discovered by the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit. 

Initially, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit hesitated, not wanting to contact Ning Zhuo. From a subjective emotional standpoint, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit wanted to see Ning Zhuo suffer misfortune. However, with Zhu Xuanji's threat looming, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had to rely on Ning Zhuo's strength to hope to eliminate all traces.

Ning Zhuo had previously explicitly requested it to scout for him and inform him of anything unfavorable. If this plot were to unfold without Ning Zhuo receiving a warning from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, he might not cooperate with it as he had before. With this in mind, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit coughed a few times, and, though reluctant, it ultimately contacted Ning Zhuo again. 

In a weak voice, it informed Ning Zhuo of Ning Xiaoren and Ning Xiaohui's grandmother's plan to kidnap Ning Ji.

Ning Zhuo's heart stirred slightly: "Is that all?" 

Since childhood, his relationship with Ning Ji had never been good. Allowing Ning Ji to cling to him and additionally indulging him was more about maintaining Ning Zhuo's own righteous reputation and image. If the enemy truly wanted to use Ning Ji to threaten Ning Zhuo, it would be a laughable mistake.

"What is Ning Xiaoren thinking? He's the mastermind, and he knows full well that my relationship with Uncle's family isn't close. Why come up with such a foolish idea?" 

Ning Zhuo found it strange and asked the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit. The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, however, was unaware of Ning Ji's previous encounters. It was only drawn to the word "Ning Zhuo" from Ning Xiaoren's mouth, which led it to discover their conspiracy. Therefore, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was unaware of Ning Xiaoren being afflicted by the masked assassin's Gu.

The full context wouldn't be known unless one consulted the records in the Historical Records Pavilion. Unfortunately, the Historical Records Pavilion was no more! This was a result primarily driven by the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit. 

"Young Master, I've made a contribution this time. You just need to restrain Ning Ji or strengthen his protection," the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit didn't forget to take credit.

"No, no, no." Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed with brilliance. He sensed an extremely important opportunity within this plot against him. 

"Let them act without any hindrance. Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, you must closely monitor these two's movements. Report to me at least once a day," Ning Zhuo instructed. 

He decided to turn the tables!

Ning Xiaohui's grandmother acted swiftly. Taking advantage of Ning Ji being alone, she easily succeeded. 

Ning Ji was merely a small Qi Refining stage cultivator while Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was an experienced Foundation Establishment stage cultivator. Capturing a small Ning Ji was as easy as pie.

"I know you're Ning Zhuo's cousin. Write a letter to your dear cousin. Also, write a plea for help to your parents!" Ning Xiaoren had disguised his appearance and deliberately altered his voice. 

Ning Ji, terrified, turned pale: "Good sirs, please don't kill me. I'll do whatever you ask, just don't kill me!" 

"Boo hoo hoo..."

"My cousin is Ning Zhuo, the master of the black market, and he's talented. If you spare me, he'll pay you a handsome ransom!" 

Ning Xiaoren's actions had already alerted the masked group. They hadn't expected to achieve anything significant, but it seemed they had stumbled upon something noteworthy. 

They had already investigated Ning Zhuo's situation and knew that Ning Zhuo's relationship with Uncle Ning Ze's family wasn't close. Even so, Ning Zhuo still had taken good care of Ning Ze's family after his rise. 

After Ning Ji left the Ning family's Talisman Hall, he thrived in the black market. Relying on his relationship with Ning Zhuo, he acted arrogantly, embezzling and breaking the law without consequence, becoming increasingly brazen.

There were those who reported him, but Ning Zhuo never responded. 

The masked group analyzed: whether Ning Zhuo was nostalgic or concerned about his righteous reputation, Ning Ze's family was indeed Ning Zhuo's weak spot. With no progress in other areas, this small weakness became the only breakthrough point.

Immediately, the masked group reappeared and assisted Ning Xiaoren in sending out the ransom note while reassuring him. 

Ning Xiaoren was secretly shocked. With layers of demon beasts surrounding them, contacting the outside world was extremely difficult. This faction had significant power, but he didn't know which faction they belonged to. 

Regardless of faction, it didn't matter. Ning Xiaoren was a complete nobody, unable to resist, and to survive, he could only go with the flow.

[...]

"My son has been kidnapped!" Ning Ze's face changed dramatically upon receiving the letter. 

"Oh my - my child, you can't have anything happen to you. Without you, how can I live?" Wang Lan cried out in panic. 

"Quiet! Do you want the whole clan to know?" Ning Ze scolded. 

This time, Wang Lan, in her panic, retorted against Ning Ze: "It's your fault, isn't it? You sent Ji'er to such a dangerous place like the Lava Immortal Palace. Now he's been kidnapped!" 

Ning Ze snorted coldly: "Do you think the black market is safe? Ning Zhuo participated in the second stage of the palace examination, and all the cultivators in the examination were targeted. Do you think Ji'er wouldn't be kidnapped if he had stayed in the black market? At least at the Lava Immortal Palace he had a better chance of achieving merit."

"This ungrateful brat. He's become increasingly unruly after relying on his relationship with Ning Zhuo. With no achievements, he was bound to get into trouble sooner or later!" 

Wang Lan was momentarily stunned and realized: "So, our Ji'er was implicated by that brat Ning Zhuo?!" 

"I knew it, he's a troublemaker. I've seen it since he was young." 

"Oh, without Ji'er, how can I live! I don't want to live anymore!"

Ning Ze slammed the table, standing up in anger: "Ji'er isn't dead yet and you're already mourning him?!" 

"The only plan now is to find Ning Zhuo. Pack up, we'll take the next shift to the Lava Immortal Palace to find Ning Zhuo." 

"Hmph!" 

"We're Ning Zhuo's closest relatives in this world. He can't possibly ignore this."

Every so often, Fire Persimmon Immortal City would organize a group of personnel with the cooperation of Meng Kui, Zhu Xuanji, and other cultivators, using a temporarily constructed short-distance teleportation array to rotate personnel. 

On one hand, it replenished manpower at the Lava Immortal Palace's frontline, and on the other, it replaced those that were severely injured or those who had to leave the palace.

Ning Ze and Wang Lan took advantage of this channel to smoothly enter the Lava Immortal Palace. Relying on their status, they secured a meeting with Ning Zhuo. 

"What? My cousin was captured? How come I didn't know?!" Ning Zhuo feigned shock. 

Wang Lan wept: "Little Zhuo, Ji'er grew up with you. You can't ignore him! If you don't help him, he'll lose his life!" 

Ning Zhuo immediately assured them: "Uncle, Aunt, please don't worry." 

"I see this letter as the kidnappers wanting a ransom."

"For the sake of my cousin's safety, we might as well pay the ransom first. No amount of money matters; my cousin's life is the most important!" 

Ning Ze and Wang Lan's expressions eased slightly. Regardless, Ning Zhuo's response was correct and reassuring. 

Gaining the approval of his uncle and aunt, Ning Zhuo immediately summoned Ning Xiangguo and instructed him to take the ransom and retrieve the hostage from the kidnappers.

The masked group couldn't care less about the ransom. Seeing Ning Xiangguo, they were quite excited. 

"That brat Ning Zhuo took the bait!" 

"Keep stringing him along and occupying his attention. This will also satisfy our superiors." 

The masked group immediately raised the ransom, sending Ning Xiangguo back empty-handed. 

Ning Ze and Wang Lan's hopes were dashed, prompting them to seek out Ning Zhuo once more.
