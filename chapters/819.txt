Chapter 819: Ning Zhuo Breaks the Deadlock

Inside the dilapidated temple, Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an’s gazes shifted between the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator, the children, the villagers, and the heretical cultivator informant. Their brows were tightly locked.

Ning Zhuo took this scene in, already sensing that things were not good.

He knew a great deal of intelligence regarding these two before him: "Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an’s benevolence and kindness were interfering with their ability to make the correct decision."

"But clearly, the erosion of the blood mist will gradually deepen as time passes."

"Any hesitation, perhaps just wasting a few breaths of time, could ultimately lead to failure!"

Yun Niaoniao looked grave. "Talismans can only protect oneself, resisting the external blood mist erosion. Only medicinal pills and spiritual liquid can save the victims. Adding these three things together, it’s simply not enough to save everyone."

Lu Xu’an sighed heavily. "We cannot fail to capture the Demon Seed host. If that scourge escapes, more living beings will inevitably suffer."

He looked toward the heretical cultivator.

From this perspective, the Golden Light Talisman should be given to the heretical cultivator in exchange for the key clue.

But there was a worry.

That is - after satisfying the heretical cultivator’s demands, would he truly reveal the truth?

Before Ning Zhuo and the other two entered the dilapidated temple, among everyone inside, only the female cultivator and the heretical cultivator had not suffered from the blood mist’s encroachment. However, the blood mist outside the temple was heavy; relying solely on the personal strength of these two cultivators, it would be difficult to break through the blockade.

In other words, the Golden Light Talisman was almost the only method of escape.

If the heretical cultivator merely wanted to survive and pretended to know the Demon Seed host’s location, saying so deliberately, what then?

Lu Xu’an glanced at the heretical cultivator, then turned to look at the female cultivator.

What he was thinking was: To verify the truth or falsehood of the heretical cultivator's words, we have to rely on the female cultivator.

But in the next moment, Lu Xu’an frowned again, recalling the female cultivator’s background. She had only joined halfway through - more accurately, she was a passing cultivator who got swept up in this and knew very little about the heretical cultivator’s situation.

"Therefore, this cultivator from the Demon Subjugation Hall is the key!" Lu Xu’an fixed his gaze on the unconscious male cultivator.

"But to treat him, spiritual liquid certainly won't suffice; a complete medicinal pill must be used."

"And if this medicinal pill is used, the remaining few people sharing three small cups of spiritual liquid won't be enough to save their lives."

"Could it be... we really have to abandon some of them?"

"This indeed is not a real scenario, just a trial," Yun Niaoniao suddenly murmured softly on the side.

Both she and Lu Xu’an knew this was fake.

Yet, they remained hesitant.

On one hand, acting from their true hearts, they wanted to do their utmost to save everyone, even in a fake scenario. On the other hand, they worried about the trial itself. What if there was a more 'correct' solution, and the Demon Subjugation Hall specifically wanted to test their decisiveness and wisdom when knowing they were in a simulated predicament?

Just as their thoughts were becoming cluttered and chaotic, Ning Zhuo suddenly spoke, "You two, I have thought of the correct solution."

Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an’s eyes immediately lit up.

The former urged, "Fellow Daoist Ning, please speak quickly."

Ning Zhuo showed a hint of hesitation. "My method, however, requires you two to actively sacrifice yourselves for there to be a possibility of saving everyone present."

Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an were both stunned, then overjoyed.

Lu Xu’an said, "Since there is such a good prescription, what harm is there in us sacrificing a little?"

Yun Niaoniao did not hesitate at all. "I knew Fellow Daoist Ning would have a method. What should we do?"

"Our spiritual energy has been sealed, making us no different from mortals." Ning Zhuo pointed to the female cultivator who was still struggling to maintain a calming spell. "But her spiritual energy remains. I will ask her to cast a spell to temporarily transfer the pressure of the blood mist erosion onto you two."

Lu Xu’an was startled. "Transfer?"

"Precisely," Ning Zhuo explained. "The three children are about to lose their minds because the blood mist is eroding their divine souls; the two villagers are about to undergo demonization because the blood mist has invaded their heart meridians. If we can draw out part of the blood mist from their bodies and have you two fellow Daoists share the burden, we can buy time."

Yun Niaoniao suddenly understood. "This method is feasible!"

She and Lu Xu’an had also passed the first two levels.

The harm of the blood mist had degrees of severity. In the first level, the Blood Village, some villagers could be saved precisely because the degree of encroachment was not deep.

And the second level, the Demon Seed, made Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an realize: even a Demon Seed can be extracted.

It was just that the three of them were strictly forbidden from using spiritual energy, spells, etc., reduced to "mortals." Among those present, the heretical cultivator was unreliable and untrustworthy, and was also sealed. Only the female cultivator could act.

Lu Xu’an and Yun Niaoniao agreed without objection.

Seeing the three come to an agreement, the female cultivator showed astonishment in her eyes. "This method is feasible, but extremely dangerous. Are you two really willing to risk your bodies? You must know there is only this much antidote. You two sharing the blood mist will indeed prolong things for a while, but the blood mist will self-propagate within your bodies. If too much time passes, you two will perish along with these people!"

Lu Xu’an and Yun Niaoniao looked at each other and both said it was fine.

However, Lu Xu’an looked at Ning Zhuo, his gaze flickering slightly.

Ning Zhuo did not dodge but looked straight at Lu Xu’an. "You two bear a portion of the pressure first. I have other matters to perfect, and I will join in shortly."

Lu Xu’an nodded.

Yun Niaoniao chuckled lightly. "Then Niaoniao will witness with her own eyes how Fellow Daoist Ning brings back the dead and ingeniously solves this difficult problem."

Everyone knew that Ning Zhuo could emit a Noble Spirit that pierced through the clouds. Lu Xu’an hesitated because he worried Ning Zhuo might use them to seize first place. Yun Niaoniao, however, didn't believe for a second that Ning Zhuo would do such a thing.

If Ning Zhuo did that just for a trial, for victory in a fake level, what would become of his reputation?

Moreover, in the Demon Subjugation Hall’s trials, the assessment standard was never superficial success or failure.

The female cultivator formed hand seals, chanting incantations.

Pale green light flowed from her fingertips, turning into two ribbons of light connecting to Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an’s chests respectively. Then, five thin threads branched out, connecting to the three children and the two villagers.

The blood mist began to flow.

Yun Niaoniao let out a muffled groan, feeling a sticky, fierce, and violent thought surge into her body along the light ribbon, giving her an intense urge to destroy.

She gritted her teeth and persisted, her body trembling slightly beneath her plain white dress.

Veins popped out on Lu Xu’an’s forehead, yet he didn't make a sound, also struggling to resist the blood mist’s encroachment.

In contrast, the three children’s frenzy rapidly weakened. Their scratching at their skin stopped, and they curled up one after another, falling into a deep sleep.

The bulging blood vessels on the chests of the two villagers also smoothed out significantly, and their breathing was no longer so rapid.

The heretical cultivator widened his eyes, seemingly in disbelief. "There are actually such fools in this world? And two appeared at once?!"

"Humph, this is the Righteous Path," Ning Zhuo sneered and began to act.

He took the emerald green medicinal pill and walked toward the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator.

The pill emitted a faint, soft green light, and an aura of vitality permeated the air, making even the surrounding air somewhat fresher.

Ning Zhuo placed the pill into the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator's mouth.

The medicinal effect was excellent.

Moments later, the bleeding from the wound on the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator's chest stopped, and much color returned to his pale face.

His eyelashes trembled, and he slowly opened his eyes.

"I..." His voice was hoarse. "I'm still alive?"

"Fellow Daoist, do not move around." Ning Zhuo helped him sit half-upright. "The situation right now is this..."

After listening to Ning Zhuo’s brief explanation, the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator’s gaze immediately fell upon the heretical cultivator informant, anger flashing in his eyes. "You greedy coward!"

The heretical cultivator sneered but did not reply.

Seeing the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator’s strange attitude, Lu Xu’an and Yun Niaoniao felt their hearts stir, and the former asked a question.

The Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator then informed everyone: This heretical cultivator informant was someone he had developed. There had been an operation previously where the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator had almost succeeded, being only a hair's breadth away from sealing the Demon Seed.

But at the critical moment, this heretical cultivator informant was greedy for life and afraid of death. He did not complete the promised cooperation, causing the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator’s efforts to fall short of success.

Now, although the Demon Seed still had the residual power of the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator's seal, it had vanished without a trace. if they delayed any longer, the seal on the Demon Seed would completely fade, its demonic power would recover, and it would inevitably flee far away. The Demon Subjugation Hall’s years of effort would come to naught!

Ning Zhuo asked the crucial question: Did the heretical cultivator informant before them really know the Demon Seed's location?

The Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator nodded. "He does!"

He then explained further.

It turned out that the heretical cultivator informant and the original owner of the Demon Seed host shared a blood relationship. To some extent, he was the most suitable heir for the blood mist Demon Seed host. A subtle resonance existed between the two.

Yun Niaoniao revealed a look of shock. "So, if we give the Golden Light Talisman to this heretic, it is very likely he will actively find the Demon Seed and inherit it?!"

The Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator shook his head. "That won't happen."

Yun Niaoniao wondered, "Why is that?"

The heretical informant sneered. "You outsiders understand nothing! Do you think having a resonance between me and the Demon Seed host is a good thing?"

"Of course not!"

"I don't want to become the Demon Seed's host!"

"That would cause me to gradually lose my sanity and eventually become nutrients for the Demon Seed! I want to live."

"Otherwise, would I have become an informant for your Demon Subjugation Hall?"

"Ridiculous!"

"I came to you to deal with the Demon Seed so I could survive. But for you to seal the Demon Seed, you needed me to take risks and fight to the death. If I wanted to risk my life, what would I need you for?!"

Yun Niaoniao showed evident disgust.

Lu Xu’an said with disdain, "You are a cultivator, yet you have no sense of responsibility and are so greedy for life and afraid of death! Heaven granted you the aptitude for cultivation expecting a response from you."

"As a result, because of a thought of stealing your life, you allowed the Demon Seed to escape and continue harming the common people. When you look back on this in the future, will you not be too ashamed to sleep?"

The heretical cultivator shook his head with a cold smile. "I can't be bothered to argue with fools like you."

He looked at Ning Zhuo. "Hey, since you know the situation now, why haven't you returned the talisman to me?"

"That was my thing to begin with. Give it back, let me go, and I'll tell you the approximate direction of the Demon Seed - that is my bottom line."

Ning Zhuo, however, smiled and shook his head. "I strongly agree with what Fellow Daoist Lu Xu’an said. You have the body of a cultivator; you should be sharing the blood mist even more so."

After speaking, he signaled the female cultivator to act.

The female cultivator hesitated and looked at the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator. The latter hated the heretical cultivator to the bone and nodded decisively.

The female cultivator immediately formed seals and cast the spell. A green light hit the heretical cultivator, linking him to the rest of the group.

"No-!" the heretical cultivator screamed.

The blood mist instantly surged into his body. He trembled violently, blood vessels bulging and pulsing under his skin, his eyes rapidly filling with blood.

"Stop! Stop it quickly!" he roared hoarsely. "You can't do this! I am an important informant!"

Ning Zhuo remained expressionless. "You are greedy for life and afraid of death, you broke faith and abandoned righteousness, causing my fellow Daoist from the Demon Subjugation Hall to be heavily injured and letting the Demon Seed escape. Now you still want to negotiate terms?"

He signaled the female cultivator: Increase the amount of blood mist.

"Ahhh-!" A massive amount of blood mist poured into his body, causing the heretical cultivator to not only scream miserably but also twist and struggle physically. However, restricted by the seal, he couldn't break free at all.

He could only utter curses.

Ning Zhuo’s face was like iron, unmoved.

The blood mist inside the heretical cultivator grew thicker and thicker, causing his screams to gradually turn into beast-like roars. His eyes turned completely blood-red, his sanity on the brink of collapse.

Yun Niaoniao looked unbearable and turned her head away.

Lu Xu’an pursed his lips tightly but did not speak up to stop it.

Only then did Ning Zhuo raise his hand. "Stop."

He took the pot of spiritual liquid, poured out a small cup, and walked up to the heretical cultivator.

The heretical cultivator’s consciousness was already blurry, his mouth emitting meaningless rasping sounds.

Ning Zhuo poured the spiritual liquid into his mouth.

As the clear liquid entered his throat, his whole body shook slightly. The blood color in his eyes receded a bit, restoring a shred of clarity. He gasped for large breaths of air, his body soaked in cold sweat, looking at Ning Zhuo with eyes full of terror.

"Now," Ning Zhuo said indifferently, "are you willing to speak?"

The heretical cultivator’s lips trembled. "You... you lunatic..."

But immediately, he reacted and let out a hideous laugh. "You can't scare me! Didn't you let me drink the spiritual liquid in the end? You want to know the Demon Seed's location? Hahaha!"

"Fine!"

"I want you to kneel down and beg me!!"

Such an arrogant attitude was met with Ning Zhuo’s sincere smile.

Ning Zhuo turned to the female cultivator. "Do it again."

The heretical cultivator: Urgh... Ahhh... Roar!

Moments later, Ning Zhuo used the second cup of spiritual liquid to pull the heretical cultivator back from the edge of complete madness.

The heretical cultivator trembled all over. "Don't, don't do this to me. I'll talk, I'll talk, okay?!"

He panted heavily. "The Demon Seed... I can sense it. The Demon Seed host is in an ancient tomb three miles to the east; it's hiding right there."

Yun Niaoniao’s eyes lit up. "Really?"

Lu Xu’an, however, quietly frowned. Because this response still couldn't prove whether the heretical cultivator was telling the truth.

Ning Zhuo stared at the heretical cultivator for a moment, then suddenly said, "Continue."

"What?!" The heretical cultivator was horrified. "I already told you! You still want to-"

Green light rose again, and the blood mist surged.

The heretical cultivator: Urgh... Ahhh... Roar!

This time, the degree of the heretical cultivator’s struggle clearly weakened significantly. In the end, he went limp on the ground, only his chest heaving weakly, the light in his eyes almost completely scattered.

Ning Zhuo poured out the third small cup of spiritual liquid and woke him up.

Ning Zhuo looked at him with a smile. "You know, you have already used our very last cup of spiritual liquid. If I go out this time and don't find the Demon Seed, what end do you think you will meet?"

The heretical cultivator’s pupils contracted abruptly. He trembled all over, his last shred of luck completely dissipating.

He dared not gamble!

He could only speak. "It... It's five miles to the west, there is a mountain spring. The Demon Seed host is hiding at the bottom of that mountain spring!"

After saying this, he collapsed from exhaustion and closed his eyes directly.
