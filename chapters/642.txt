Chapter 642: Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation

Ning Zhuo, propelled by Yuan Dasheng's force, successfully escaped the spot.

However, the Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng was pierced by icy threads and instantly frozen into a massive ice block.

Yuan Dasheng, who had previously served as a protective shield, lost his combat capability in an instant.

Ning Zhuo didn't even dare to retrieve him.

The ice block radiated a chilling frost that could freeze all life in its vicinity.

The opponent was overwhelmingly powerful, their combat prowess placing them among the top-tier Nascent Soul cultivators.

This inevitably reminded Ning Zhuo of the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts from the Soul Devouring Sect.

"The Two Note Kingdom's campaign against the Thousand Peaks Forest was merely the New Army's punitive expedition against a small, isolated region."

"But the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long plan would undoubtedly keep the most elite of elites by his side."

"If this enemy were unleashed in the Living Realm, they would undoubtedly be on par with the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts - famous throughout the nations. Perhaps even stronger than them!"

Of course, Ning Zhuo couldn't definitively judge who was stronger.

After all, his victory over the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts had been due to a fortunate coincidence. While he had repelled them, the achievement was greatly exaggerated.

Ning Zhuo acutely felt the vast disparity in combat power between himself and his opponent.

Yet his resolve remained unshaken, unwavering even in the slightest!

"Mother would never harm me."

"The Ash Bone Elder's divination techniques, combined with the Profound Primordial Scholar's strategies, are my hidden advantages."

"Most importantly, I am the savior, blessed by the Living Realm's Heavenly Mandate!"

"The enemy may appear formidable, but they must have weaknesses."

"If they were truly so powerful, why didn't they intercept the Qing-Jiao Army when it first took flight? Why let us calmly set up our formations?"

"Though we're engaged, only one Nascent Soul cultivator has actually fought. The other remains an observer - this is deeply suspicious!"

"They must have hidden secrets and fatal flaws, carefully concealed."

"I must find them - and I will!"

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth and fought fiercely, unaware that Immortal Hanyan was also deep in thought.

"This youth is truly exceptional!"

"It's been ages since I've seen such a remarkable young man."

This was a remarkably high praise. As a senior official of the Forgetful River Prefecture, Immortal Hanyan judged Ning Zhuo from the perspective of an entire nation.

Immortal Hanyan murmured to himself, "Qing-Jiao Army..."

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had just relayed the latest intelligence to his subordinates.

They didn't need to know about the Living Realm's battlefield or the White Paper Immortal City. But now that the Qing-Jiao Army had inexplicably attacked, understanding the situation was crucial.

Immortal Hanyan hovered in mid-air, surveying the battlefield with his gaze primarily fixed on Ning Zhuo.

"It seems this man is the calamity sent by the Heavenly Mandate of the Mortal Realm to trouble our Lord."

"He's only at the Foundation Establishment stage, yet he wields such profound spellcasting! How humiliating for countless thousand-year-old ghosts!"

"All three of his dantians radiate formidable qi. He must be cultivating an extraordinary art to have reached this level."

"What truly concerns me is his physical body and soul - both far surpass the standards of the Foundation Establishment stage."

"No ordinary cultivation art can achieve such balance. This means he's discovered another method, expending vast resources to amass such formidable power."

"To achieve this, he must either have profound connections or extraordinary fortune!"

"And to think such a youthful aura belongs to someone not even twenty years old - it's almost unimaginable."

Immortal Hanyan concluded that if Ning Zhuo continued on this path, he would inevitably become a dragon among men, a rising star, a pillar of strength, a regional authority, and ultimately a great master of cultivation.

"A figure like this, blessed by the land's spiritual essence, must be the Child of Destiny of the Living Realm."

"What a pity, to be pitted against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's national Qi Luck."

"To prevent future trouble, I'll kill you first!"

The more outstanding Ning Zhuo became, the more Immortal Hanyan feared him. He resolved to strike first and eliminate Ning Zhuo permanently.

But just as he was about to strike, the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts suddenly sent a telepathic message: "Hold off on the attack!"

Immortal Hanyan was astonished. He had already recognized Ning Zhuo's exceptional talent and potential, and his comrades must have seen it too. He couldn't understand why the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts would stop him.

Through divine sense, the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts explained briefly: "I've already reported the details to the Lord. The order to refrain from killing the Qing-Jiao Army comes directly from him. And the Lord has instructed me to keep this confidential; I can't reveal more. My apologies."

Immortal Hanyan grew even more puzzled and immediately sent a divine sense message to the Core of the Altar deep in the rear. As expected, he received a response from the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form slumbered within a tributary of the Forgetful River. His divided consciousness was simultaneously testing various methods to counter the Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle while overseeing the overall operation.

Immortal Hanyan naturally obeyed the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's command. The Lord has ordered me to hold back and capture the youth alive, he thought. From another perspective, this too is the result of the youth's Qi Luck.

Immortal Hanyan eased his assault, focusing on wearing down Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan while waiting for an opportunity to capture them alive.

Noticing the weakening of Hanyan's attacks, Qing Yan grew excited and shouted, "Hold on! Stay strong! He's showing signs of fatigue - clearly his injuries are hampering him. He can't sustain this for long!"

"Endure! The turning point may come at any moment!"

Ning Zhuo nodded, gradually regaining his composure.

Meanwhile, Luo Si looked up at the roiling black clouds overhead, crimson lightning crackling within them. Leveraging his commander's skill, he led his troops in an orderly retreat. Before leaving, he even managed to seize the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale from the City Lord of White Paper Immortal City.

Now, bearing the command to join forces with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord for mutual defense, he had rushed here with all speed.

After sending the message, he swiftly received a response from the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts.

The Mother of a Hundred Ghosts had long since received orders from the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God to cooperate with Luo Si's army and implement new strategic deployments.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, having exhausted his trump cards for this century-long scheme, was stretched thin in terms of manpower. Luo Si's arrival with reinforcements was truly a lifeline.

This army, having participated in the Battle of White Paper Immortal City, had incurred the wrath of the Living Realm's Heaven. Yet in the Underworld Heavens, they were regarded as heroes and treated with favor.

With the loss of two national treasures - the Nether Dragon Scissors and the Lord of Forgetful Seal - the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord desperately needed this Qi Luck to protect himself.

A massive black cloud descended from the heavens, transforming into a colossal staircase that reached the ground.

"Advance!" Luo Si commanded, waving his banner as he led his troops upward through the cloud.

The thick wall of the black cloud parted automatically, forming a vast passageway that allowed Luo Si's army to advance unimpeded to the battlefield within the cloud.

The arrival of the enemy army sent the Qing-Jiao Army into panic, their morale plummeting.

Qing Chi shouted frantically, trying to steady her troops. But she was too young; perhaps her father could have calmed them, but her panicked words only exposed her immaturity at this critical moment, further eroding morale.

The Qing-Jiao Army now faced the Forgetful River Forbidden Army in front and Luo Si's Army behind. Trapped in a pincer attack, their situation became extremely precarious.

Both the Forgetful River Forbidden Army and Luo Si's Army were massive forces. The Qing-Jiao Army, barely numbering a thousand at full strength, was clearly outmatched.

Humans are the most spiritual of all living beings, often possessing the greatest intelligence.

The intelligent ones excel at assessing situations and adapting to circumstances.

The Qing-Jiao Army was, after all, a newly formed cultivation army. With morale already fragile, where would they find the will to fight?

The Military Seed flickered within Qing Chi's dantian, warning her that the impending collapse of the Qing-Jiao Army threatened its very existence.

Cold sweat dripped from Qing Chi's forehead as she realized she had to make a decision.

"I must stabilize the Qing-Jiao Army!"

"Deploying Military Might and leveraging the Military System can maintain stability, but how much Military Might should I allocate?"

She glanced anxiously toward the main battlefield.

Her lover and her father were both locked in desperate struggles.

Whether it was Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo) or Qing Yan, both were constantly draining Military Might to enhance themselves. Otherwise, they couldn't hope to withstand Immortal Hanyan.

How much Military Might could she divert to stabilize the Qing-Jiao Army without compromising their efforts?

This was the question Qing Chi had to face head-on.

Military Might was finite. If she allocated too much, Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan would lack the resources they needed, risking defeat or even death.

That moment would haunt Qing Chi for a lifetime.

If too little military might was mobilized, the stabilization efforts would fail, requiring another attempt and ultimately consuming more resources in the long run.

If Qing Chi had more experience, it might have been manageable. The real problem was that she had only recently taken up her post.

Yet she knew she had to act.

"If we delay any longer, the Qing-Jiao Army will completely fall apart and be unable to contribute even a shred of military might. That would be true desperation!"

Qing Chi took a deep breath, her eyes gleaming with the resolve to give it her all, and boldly mobilized what little military might remained.

She channeled her strength into the Military Seed.

The three Military Systems she had developed shone brilliantly:

Military System 1: Orders Must Be Obeyed.

Military System 2: A Ten-Year Reserve for a One-Year Army.

Military System 3: Fathers and Sons Fight Together.

[ Orders Must Be Obeyed ] took effect first, restoring order throughout the army.

[ Fathers and Sons Fight Together ] reminded the soldiers of their familial bonds, making them realize that those beside them were blood relatives, greatly increasing their desire to protect each other.

"We'll die together!" Many gritted their teeth, their determination burning with the desperation of a cornered army.

It worked!

Qing Chi's eyes lit up, her spirit soaring, and she nearly leaped up in celebration.

Her daring move had achieved the desired result.

The Qing-Jiao Army had stabilized, its morale beginning to rebound sharply from its lowest point. With the soldiers' resolve restored and their spirits rising, the army's overall combat power returned to its previous levels, even exceeding them slightly.

"Qing Chi, well done!" Ning Zhuo sent his encouragement through his divine sense.

Qing Yan also praised her, "Truly worthy of being my good daughter!"

Previously, their military power had been stretched thin, but now they were once again abundant.

Ning Zhuo frowned slightly, thinking to himself, "Am I mistaken? We were at our weakest just now, yet our opponent didn't press their advantage. It's as if they were holding back."

Immortal Hanyan was indeed holding back.

His orders were to capture the enemy alive whenever possible. Therefore, he remained patient.

Not only were these capture orders personally issued by the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, but Luo Si's army had also arrived.

Although Luo Si's troops were far inferior to the Imperial Guard in discipline and training, their role was to fill the ranks of the Formation deep within the black clouds, allowing it to unleash its full power.

This is enough!

Even if the Qing-Jiao Army has stabilized for now, what difference does it make? Whether it's the Imperial Guard or the Returning Army, either force could crush this tiny New Army.

The enemy's covert sabotage has allowed Qing Chi's reckless gamble to succeed. But if Immortal Hanyan had truly unleashed his full power, Qing Chi's lack of experience and her reckless expenditure of military might would have caused the precarious battle situation, which Qing Yan and Ning Zhuo have been desperately holding together, to collapse completely. It would have cost them their lives!

The commander's banner fluttered in the wind.

Luo Si stood in his war chariot, observing both the Qing-Jiao Army and the battle between Immortal Hanyan, Qing Yan, and Ning Zhuo.

A subordinate asked, "Sir, what should we do next?"

Another officer laughed heartily. "I thought this army had gotten lost, but they actually managed to fight their way here! Hahaha! They're all just walking to their deaths - victories waiting to be claimed!"

More officers stepped forward, volunteering to engage.

Luo Si snorted coldly. "Silence."

His face stern, he rebuked them, "Remember our position. This is not our domain. We follow the Imperial Guard's orders. We're here to assist, not act independently."

Suddenly, Luo Si's expression shifted. "The Mother of a Hundred Ghosts has sent a message: we're to strike first."

"No indiscriminate killing. Capture the enemy army alive."

"All troops, heed my command! Form battle formations and await my orders!"

Luo Si issued the orders, waved his command flag, and the war drums thundered. Under the direction of numerous officers, the army swiftly formed into battle formations.

The military might began to mobilize, its power amplified through a clever deployment.

Military Strategy: Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation!

A tremor ran through Luo Si's entire army as strands of Qi were drawn from each soldier. They converged above the formation like countless fireflies gathering in the sky.

The swirling Qi solidified into thousands of fish scales, which merged and rapidly spun, forming a vortex of military might dozens of feet in diameter.

Immortal Hanyan watched in astonishment, but Luo Si immediately communicated through divine sense: this tactic would strike a devastating blow to the Qing-Jiao Army's morale!

"Very well," Immortal Hanyan replied, returning his attention to Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan.

Capturing the enemy alive was far more challenging than simply killing them.

The Fish Scale Vortex continued to expand, its swirling vortex visibly growing larger with each passing moment.

The vortex quickly expanded to a diameter of thirty meters!

Hundreds of millions of fish-scale-like layers, shimmering with an eerie blue translucency, overlapped in dense layers.

As the Military Might continued to accumulate, the Qing-Jiao Army grew increasingly restless.

Anyone could sense the overwhelming power of this military strategy. Even more terrifying was its ability to continue accumulating strength; the longer it persisted, the more devastating it would become.

"We must destroy it!"

"If we let it accumulate unchecked, we'll be torn limb from limb when it erupts."

The Qing-Jiao Army was not lacking in discerning minds.

Cold sweat once again dripped from Qing Chi's forehead.

Though she was heaven's favored daughter, blessed with exceptional cultivation talent, she found herself unable to shine as brightly in this battle as she had before.

The enemy's strength was simply too overwhelming!

Ning Zhuo urgently transmitted his will through his divine sense: "Qing Chi, lead your troops to charge the enemy behind us! This battle demands self-sacrifice - press forward without hesitation!"

Had anyone else been in her position, they might have asked, "What about the Imperial Guard in front?"

But Qing Chi was not like that. She issued a resolute order and led her army to slaughter their way toward Luo Si's forces.

The Mother of a Hundred Ghosts' gaze sharpened as she transmitted her will to Luo Si: "Need assistance?"

Luo Si shook his head. "This apparent buildup of momentum is merely a feint, a false move to lure the enemy into attacking, making it easier for me to capture them alive."

The Mother of a Hundred Ghosts, aware of Luo Si's tactical prowess, set her worries aside.

Qing Chi led the charge, followed by the Qing-Jiao Army, each soldier driven by a will to die. They surged forward as a single, relentless force, crashing into Luo Si's forces.

Unfazed, Luo Si focused his will.

The Fish Scale Vortex burst forth like a dam collapsing, unleashing a torrential flood.

Wherever it touched, light was devoured, space warped, and reality itself seemed to collapse.

This terrifying force pierced through space, striking the Imperial Guard in an instant.

Where the interwoven scales of the vortex struck, the soldiers' armor crumpled like paper. Their physical bodies disintegrated in the torrent, while their souls were shredded into countless fragments by the swirling scales, vanishing into nothingness.

Both sides stood stunned, speechless.
