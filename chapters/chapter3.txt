Chapter 323: Ning Zhuo's Mother's Legacy

As Ning Zhuo grew older, he and Sun Lingtong stirred up trouble in the black market.

In a narrow alley, several lurking cultivators fell one after another. Hearing the commotion, Ning Zhuo turned abruptly, startled at the sight of these fallen cultivators. If they had managed to ambush him, his fate could have been dire.

But then, he exclaimed in surprise and joy, "Mother! Why are you here? I haven't seen you in so long!"

Buddha Healer Meng Yaoyin smiled softly. "I've been watching what you've been up to lately. Not bad at all."

Seeing Ning Zhuo approach, Meng Yaoyin sighed, "You've grown so tall. It feels like only yesterday that little Zhuo needed lullabies to fall asleep."

"Come with me."

Ning Zhuo followed Meng Yaoyin underground, entering a secret underground base.

"This is one of many secret bases I built," she said. "This one is labeled as the Ding Base."

"I've left a few things here. Now that I see you're ready, you deserve them. Not too grand as to overwhelm you, nor too little to be like a child flaunting gold in the market."

Ning Zhuo received the Cloud-Hidden Bud.

He also received the Lava Immortal Palace Essentials and a mechanical scythe.

Meng Yaoyin cautioned him, "The Cloud-Hidden Bud is a rare flower embodying the principles of the Cloud Dao, which can help you conceal many secrets."

"The Lava Immortal Palace Essentials is something I compiled, summarizing my experiences and guesses about the Immortal Palace and the Three Sect Masters."

"This mechanical scythe, however, demands your utmost attention. It is a Night Rain Devil Weapon, incredibly sharp and vicious. The more cultivators it devours, the stronger it becomes. I paid a great price to tame it, which is why it is loyal to me. Even so, I still had to frequently reforge it to cleanse its accumulated malevolence. Otherwise, it could turn against its wielder."

"Before I died, I sealed it heavily."

"But this is just a temporary solution. The longer you delay, the greater the chance it will break the seal. When that happens, its bloodlust will grow uncontrollably, like a ravenous beast. Everyone around you will be in danger."

"You have the aura I left for you, so it won’t target you immediately."

"If you face an enemy you cannot defeat, unseal it and let it fight for you. Then, find an opportunity to seal it again."

"Do not use it too many times. The more enemies it devours, the harder it becomes to control."

"Its greatest weakness lies in its serpentine form—specifically at its seven-inch mark. This is where its malevolence hides. If you remove this part, its bloodlust will significantly weaken."

"However, I have already tamed this bloodlust."

"If, in the future, it devours too many cultivators and its bloodlust surges, just remove the seven-inch component to weaken it."

"All Night Rain Devil Weapons develop bloodlust. You should periodically reinstall the seven-inch piece, allowing the old and new bloodlust to clash and exhaust each other. This is one way to control it. You must keep the original malevolence, which I have tamed. Since you're my flesh and blood, it will be more inclined to you."

"Remember, reforging, sealing, and using the malevolence against itself—these are the three main methods to control this scythe. The details are all recorded in the Lava Immortal Palace Essentials."

Ning Zhuo nodded, vowing to remember her instructions, then asked, "Mother, I want to share our secrets, including this one, with Boss Sun. Do you think that’s okay?"

Meng Yaoyin smiled, gently stroking his hair. "Yes."

"I asked you to keep it secret before because I was worried that a stranger might betray you. But over the years, I’ve watched Sun Lingtong’s actions carefully."

"I have to say, little Zhuo, you've been quite fortunate."

"He's someone you can trust with your life."

"Of course, this is only for now. People can change. You must always stay vigilant."

"But as for the Lava Immortal Palace Essentials, don't show it to him just yet. It's important to keep some cards close to your chest. If he remains loyal, you can show him later when the time is right."

Ning Zhuo shook his head firmly, his gaze resolute. "I trust Boss Sun!"

Meng Yaoyin was momentarily stunned but then smiled softly. "You've grown up, little Zhuo. You have your own ideas now. I'm glad. Do as you see fit."

Ning Zhuo, elated by his mother’s support, looked up at her with determined eyes. "Mother, wait for me! I will find a way to heal you. I'll bring you back from the Lava Immortal Palace!"

Meng Yaoyin's heart trembled. She knew that Ning Zhuo was sharp and had likely guessed the true purpose behind her bequeathing him her legacy.

Considering her ever-lengthening periods of memory loss, with only a week or two of clarity each year, the parting between mother and son was imminent.

She bent down and embraced Ning Zhuo.

This time, Ning Zhuo did not cry. He just held his mother tightly.

Later, Ning Zhuo, with Sun Lingtong’s help, "discovered" the underground base, obtaining the Cloud-Hidden Bud, Night Rain Devil Weapon, the Lava Immortal Palace Essentials, and other cultivation resources.

Sun Lingtong sighed, "Your mother truly had your best interests at heart. She deliberately set this inheritance for you, rather than handing it over while she was still alive. On the one hand, she was worried that someone might find out and harm you to steal it. On the other hand, she feared you might grow complacent and waste your potential, living in comfort on the merits of your elders."

"You’ve done a great job finding this place through your own abilities, which is exactly what your mother wanted to see."

Ning Zhuo smiled, "I wouldn’t have found the clues without your teachings in thievery. Thank you, Boss!"

Sun Lingtong proudly puffed out his chest, laughing, "Of course!"

However, he quickly became serious. "The Cloud-Hidden Bud is a powerful artifact. According to the jade slip, it can resist various investigative techniques like those tracing back to their source."

"Little Zhuo, this is a supreme defensive treasure. Use it wisely."

"You’ll likely face many investigations in the future when you try to claim the Lava Immortal Palace. I always wanted you to join the Wukong Sect because they have secret arts to resist such scrutiny. But their rules require you to be a disciple to learn them."

"This Cloud-Hidden Bud fills a huge gap in your defenses."

"But I won’t read the Lava Immortal Palace Essentials."

"And from now on, don’t let me know about anything else your mother left for you."

Puzzled, Ning Zhuo asked, "Huh? Why?"

"Idiot," Sun Lingtong replied, "I told you before about the Root Tracing Technique, right? The Divine Constables of the Southern Bean Kingdom use it. If we each keep our secrets, even if one of us gets caught in the future, it won’t affect the other."

Sun Lingtong, having been arrested several times for theft, was well-versed in these matters.

"If we get caught and they extract our memories, they won’t be able to catch everyone. But if we don’t keep secrets, they’ll drag all of us down. If one of us stays safe, there’s hope for rescue."

Ning Zhuo suddenly understood, "No wonder you always told me to keep secrets when I was younger."

"Of course! I’m your boss after all," Sun Lingtong said with a grin.

Ning Zhuo continued studying the Lava Immortal Palace Essentials.

The jade slip described how Meng Yaoyin infiltrated the palace, tested its boundaries, and found loopholes, eventually obtaining the title of Maintenance Chief, allowing her to sit on the throne and wield some of the palace lord’s authority.

The manual explicitly mentioned, "There is a palace spirit within the Lava Immortal Palace, though it has never been seen."

Meng Yaoyin speculated that the palace spirit was likely extremely weak, in a long state of slumber, which explained why the palace had been gradually declining in functionality.

"What? Mother has a Golden Core cultivation?" Ning Zhuo was shocked but quickly understood.

"Of course, with the Cloud-Hidden Bud, hiding her cultivation would be easy."

His mind wandered further. Why had his mother hidden her identity, and how did she meet his father? Could his father also be a Golden Core cultivator?

No, that seemed unlikely.

Though Ning Zhuo had never met his father, he had gathered a lot from his mother and clan members.

He knew his father, Ning Zhong, was a man loyal to his family, proud of his heritage, and straightforward. It was unlikely he had hidden his cultivation like Meng Yaoyin.

The Lava Immortal Palace Essentials also described many mechanisms within the palace, like the Five Element Turrets, General’s Platform, and Medical Hall.

"My mother’s position came from one of these."

"In the future, I should follow in her footsteps, accumulate merit, and trade it for a position."

"These positions have hierarchical control. Perhaps I should also build alliances and gather power to occupy a mechanism building, monopolizing related positions?"

Ning Zhuo continued reading.

"The Zheng family? Hmph!"

"The two Golden Core elders of the Zheng family have given my mother trouble multiple times."

"Though they didn’t directly cause her injuries, they’ve fought her and hindered her recovery several times."

"When the opportunity arises, I will repay them!"

Ning Zhuo didn’t forget the important part—how to control the mechanical scythe.

From the Lava Immortal Palace Essentials, he learned that the scythe’s true name was Serpent Scythe.

He carefully studied the three methods to control it.

The first was sealing, but that required Golden Core cultivation.

The second was reforging, which was even more difficult, requiring a high-quality furnace.

The third was removing and reinstalling the seven-inch component to balance the old and new malevolence within it.

Ning Zhuo, at only eight years old, watched as the scythe devoured the corpses of cultivators. Sun Lingtong marveled, "It’s quite handy for cleaning up the battlefield."

"Over the past two years, it has helped us eliminate many strong foes. You really plan to 'give' it to the Zheng family?"

Ning Zhuo nodded. "Its bloodlust has grown too fierce."

"My mother’s seals are nearly exhausted. We’re not Golden Core cultivators, so we can’t reseal it."

"Reforging it requires a furnace we don’t have. Only the Zheng family has one."

"The malevolence has been purged so many times that the original one is no longer as strong. If we keep purging it, the new malevolence will completely kill off the original, and we’ll lose control of the scythe."

"I’ll find a chance to hand it over to the Zheng family, along with the mechanism diagrams. Given the personalities of their two Golden Core elders, they won’t be able to resist the temptation of reforging it."

"Meanwhile, we’ll continue stockpiling Night Breeze Soft Iron in the black market."

"In the future, when the Zheng family reforges it, they’ll surely use the best materials—Night Breeze Soft Iron."

"At that point, I’ll embed the original malevolence into the iron, betting that the Zheng family won’t notice it!"

Sun Lingtong’s eyes gleamed with excitement. "Brilliant! The Night Rain Empire’s methods are so different from modern cultivation techniques. The chance of the Zheng family discovering the original malevolence is slim."

"I’ll personally deliver the Serpent Scythe to the Lava Immortal Palace."

"We can’t hand it directly to the Zheng family elders. We need a middleman. Hehehe!"
