Chapter 428: Ning Zhuo gains Wisdom

"Life Hanging by a Thread!" Zhu Xuangji's heart tightened.

If Ning Zhuo had mastered this kind of divine power, he would certainly not spare him.

However, in the next moment, Shen Lingshu's tone shifted: "But the situation where Ning Jufan's fortune is high could also be due to his own reasons."

"When a person's fortune plummets to the bottom, after enduring this low period, it will inevitably rise." "A strong external force will also make Ning Jufan's fortune surge and climb steadily."

"In terms of fortune, there is a saying of 'extreme misfortune turning into good fortune.'"

Shen Lingshu continued: "There is another reason, which is external assistance."

"For example, our treatment of Ning Jufan in Jade Steel Mountain has influenced the current town chief of Jade Steel Mountain, making his attitude towards Ning Jufan, and even the Ning family, more enthusiastic."

"We also added a layer of official magic to his official seal, allowing him to use the power of the state to assist in his cultivation."

"There is an even more important factor, which is Elder Ape."

Since Ning Jufan was rescued, Zhu Xuangji had taken the initiative to teach Ning Jufan the methods of demonic cultivation.

Ning Jufan immediately passed this knowledge on to Elder Ape and has been assisting her in cultivation diligently over the past few days.

Elder Ape was originally a demonic beast, and because she belonged to the ape family, her intelligence surpasses that of most demonic beasts but was still weaker than that of humans. She could still be controlled by emotions and instincts.

The Meng family hired assassins to set traps, preparing methods to target this weakness of demonic beasts.

But as long as Elder Ape started cultivating and transitioning from a demonic beast to a demonic cultivator, her intelligence would sprout and continue to rise, at least reaching the level of an ordinary person.

In this way, the methods targeting demonic beasts would no longer be effective, which greatly enhanced Ning Jufan's strength, and even the strength of the entire Ning family.

From this perspective, it is reasonable for Ning Jufan's fortune to be strong. Zhu Xuangji was a bit confused: "So, doesn't this mean that it still cannot be proven that Ning Zhuo has mastered the Life Hanging by a Thread divine power?"

Shen Lingshu nodded: "Do you think divination is so easy to determine results? The more special the target with strong fortune, and the more significant the events related to oneself, the harder it is to predict accurately. Sometimes, the results of the divination might even lead you to take wrong actions, resulting in more unfavorable consequences."

"This is the backlash of divination."

"Moreover, what we want to divine is Ning Zhuo's background, but the real target is not in front of us. We can only approach it indirectly, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty."

Zhu Xuangji was speechless.

He looked at the Mysterious Mechanism Qi Pouch in Shen Lingshu's hand and asked, "When will the fortune in here be returned to Ning Jufan?"

"The time limit is approaching. Ning Jufan is about to leave for Fire Persimmon Immortal City to participate in the contest for the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence."

"Under these circumstances, it is better to let him give his all."

Ning Jufan was very crucial.

Even more crucial than Elder Ape!

Without Elder Ape, the Southern Bean Kingdom still had other methods to support his combat power. Of course, this came at a cost. The Ning family would have to pay for it via contract.

The Ning family was like a nail, driven into Fire Persimmon Immortal City, helping the royal family resist Meng Chong and prevent the Meng family from annexing this city in the shortest ammount of time.

A city often involved enormous profits. Fire Persimmon Immortal City, with its Fire Persimmon Mountain, generated continuous benefits.

According to its potential, it could become the strongest refining treasure city in the entire Southern Bean Kingdom.

However, at present, it had not been further developed.

This city was in the midst of intense competition between the Zhu family and the Meng family.

The Zhou family and the Ning family had already become the tentacles of the royal Zhu family. The Zhou family was a local family and had shown weakness in the previous Lava Immortal Palace contest.

Therefore, the Zhu family valued the Ning family more.

In Zhu Xuangji's view, Ning Jufan himself had considerable combat power, especially since Ning Zhuo left a deep impression on him.

With just Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment periods, he dared to plot for the Lava Immortal Palace, planning for his mother for more than ten years, enduring and scheming, and finally standing up fearlessly at the critical moment. This kind of loyalty and courage showed the family spirit of the Ning clan!

Zhu Xuangji's impression was also the impression of the Zhu family.

The Southern Bean Royal Family generally believed that the Ning family had a strong backbone and was the best choice to resist and counter the Meng family's encroachment on Fire Persimmon Immortal City!

"Is the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence really something that appeared on its own? Could it be a secret plot by Meng Chong?"

"Even if it was a coincidence for him, he would surely set up a plan to compete against Ning Jufan."

"Ning Zhuo is out and his cultivation is weak. He can only be said to have a promising future. Ning Jufan, with his Golden Core, is the key figure at present."

Zhu Xuangji explained the importance of Ning Jufan to Shen Lingshu.

Shen Lingshu nodded: "Rest assured, Xuangji."

"How could I not know the value of Ning Jufan."

"But his fortune, I will still keep in my hands for now and not release it."

"On one hand, I can further calculate his fortune and whether Ning Zhuo has mastered the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability. On the other hand, this is actually a strategy against Meng Chong."

"Meng Chong is also skilled in divination and will surely divine Ning Jufan before the battle."

"If Meng Chong divines Ning Jufan's fortune, he will surely underestimate him."

"At the critical moment, I will suddenly release the fortune, and with the help of my magic, Ning Jufan's fortune will surge more than tenfold!"

"At that time, it will surely catch Meng Chong off guard."

Zhu Xuangji, upon hearing this plan, immediately understood that Shen Lingshu had already planned ahead and felt relieved.


------------------------------------------
Two Note Country, Celestial City of Green Forest.

The blazing flames gradually extinguished.

Jin Li looked exhausted.

He sat cross-legged in front of the refining furnace for several days. During this time, he did not sleep, occasionally making hand gestures and casting spells, his mind focused.

Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and Zhang Zhongyi stood behind Jin Li.

Jin Li shouted, "Open!"

Hiss——!

The furnace door slowly opened, and a large amount of hot air suddenly gushed out, turning into steam and filling the entire room.

Jin Li raised his little finger, lightly waved, and a gust of wind appeared out of nowhere, sweeping away all the steam.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong could already sense the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.

In the next moment, the miniature mechanical dragon was slowly pulled out by an invisible force.

Ning Zhuo could see with his naked eye that the Dragon was even more dilapidated than before.

Sun Lingtong activated his talent, and his eyes glowed with spiritual light, carefully observing.

Before entering the refining furnace, the mechanical dragon already had been damaged by thirty percent and had not been repaired. Now, the damage had increased to at least fifty percent!

Especially the rear half of the mechanical dragon's body, which was covered in cracks, and some dragon scales had disappeared, revealing the outer shell.

But since they needed to rush and remove the Blood Trace Shadow Technique, paying this price was also their choice.

Sun Lingtong took the dragon with both hands, looked at it for a moment, and then nodded slowly at Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo then took out the treasures and handed them to Jin Li.

These treasures, of course, came from the Stone Monster and were of Nascent Soul level.

Jin Li smiled satisfactorily and nodded at Ning Zhuo, "Little friend Ning Zhuo, your mechanical dragon needs repairs, and I can also help."

Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly and explained that his funds were tight, and dealing with the Blood Trace Shadow Technique already violated his family's trade mission.

He said that in the future, when he had more funds, he would come back to Jin Li for help.

Jin Li tossed the treasures in his hand, "Little friend Ning Zhuo, don't be restrained. You can repair the Mechanical Dragon now. You just need to sign a contract with me, and in the future, you can pay me a little more for these treasures."

Ning Zhuo laughed it off and evaded the topic.

The treasures taken from the Stone Monster were of too high quality, and Jin Li was very eager for them.

After dealing with Ning Zhuo a few times, Jin Li had a good impression of him. After this cooperation, he trusted Ning Zhuo more and could make advance payments to a certain extent, allowing Ning Zhuo to borrow.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong discussed and finally politely declined this tempting offer.

After solving the tracking technique, Sun and Ning did not return to the Three Generals Camp but sent a flying letter and left the immortal city, entering the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.

Ning Zhuo went to the dynamic furnace compartment, poured out a large number of spirit stones, and fed them to the smelting furnace in the mechanical dragon.

"This time, it's really a risky move," Ning Zhuo sighed.

The fire essence storage was depleted, and the mechanical dragon could not return to the Thousand Peaks Forest.

Ning Zhuo could only use all his spirit stones for this adventurous journey. But this was only enough to barely buy a one-way ticket, so...

He also embezzled public funds.

He managed the accounts of the Three Generals Camp and took a batch of spirit stones from it, mixing them with his own and sending them all into the smelting furnace.

Sun Lingtong licked his lips and smiled, "This is exciting!"

Ning Zhuo sighed again.

He was under tremendous financial pressure.

Just looking at the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, which was fifty percent damaged, it was clear that it could not be repaired. He was really in a difficult situation.

On the surface, he seemed prosperous, and everyone thought he was a young master from a wealthy family with astonishing wealth, casually taking out Nascent Soul level treasures.

But in reality, these treasures all had problems and had not yet reached the point of exploding.

Ning Zhuo's foundation had always been weak.

The branch family behind him was established by him and had just started, needing a lot of support. It was difficult for them to provide much assistance to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's strategy to deal with the Six Caves Sect and retrieve the mechanical carriage and other items was to join the Two Note Country's side and use their strength.

He was on the right path and had achieved many results.

For example, he cured Sun Lingtong and removed the Blood Trace Shadow Technique. He achieved these with the help of Zhang Zhongyi and Jin Li. If Ning Zhuo had to do it alone, he would not have been able to achieve such results.

But at this stage, he had reached his limit.

Most of the Stone Monster's treasures had been consumed, and spirit stones were severely lacking. He could barely support himself, but in the future, he might need to support the Three Generals Camp!

The Three Generals Camp needed to be maintained so that Ning Zhuo could find opportunities and seize the mechanical carriage on the front line.

Liu, Guan, and Zhang, the three generals, were currently worth investing in and maintaining.

Ning Zhuo knew that Liu Er also had high expectations for his investment!

But Ning Zhuo was almost out of money.

Without money, he would find it difficult to participate in this venture with a high status. Leaving the Three Generals Camp, even if he joined the Red Flower Camp, according to Mu Lan's strict military rules, he would not be able to become a military advisor.

Status was very important, affecting the distribution of spoils and the extent to which he could borrow strength. This, in turn, affected whether he could achieve his goal of retrieving the mechanical carriage.

In a sense, Ning Zhuo was in a desperate situation.

The Stone Monster had become his last hope.

"This time, I must succeed!" Ning Zhuo encouraged himself. He returned to the dragon's head compartment with Sun Lingtong and officially started the spatial teleportation.

The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon quickly disappeared from its original position.

In the darkness, countless silver lights drew straight lines, quickly passing by the mechanical dragon's body.

Cracks slowly spread across the dragon's body. From time to time, pieces of the outer shell broke off and fell into the darkness, disappearing in the void.

The void itself was very dangerous for physical objects.

Even Nascent Soul cultivators found it difficult to traverse the void with their physical bodies.

Nascent Soul level bodies also found it difficult to resist the erosion and wear of the void.

Only the Nascent Soul itself could barely manage.

The true value of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was revealed again!

The darkness dispersed, the view suddenly brightened, and the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon arrived directly at the bottom of the cave, in front of the stone ball.

The mechanical dragon's map was not precise, but any place it had traveled to had a record and the most accurate markers.

With markers, it could teleport through the void and reach the destination directly.

"I'm back, haha, Sun Lingtong is back!" Sun Lingtong stood with his hands on his hips, his expression excited and arrogant.

Ning Zhuo's eyes were also burning with excitement.

He had mastered the method to treat Dao injuries and had succeeded once, so he was no longer afraid of the "trap" here.

Before coming, he had asked Zhang Zhongyi to prepare some herbs.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong applied the herbs all over their bodies, turning into two black, herb-covered figures.

Through the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon's detection, there were no other living beings in the cave besides Sun and Ning.

The two flew out of the mechanical dragon, each carrying a mirror, and fiercely mined the stone ball at the bottom of the cave.

During the time they were away, the stone ball had "grown" back to its original state. The stone skin was still very fragile and was easily broken and destroyed, with large pieces falling off, revealing the inner layer again.

Treasures gleamed!

Various treasures piled together, dazzling Sun and Ning, making their hearts race.

With so many treasures, they would suddenly become rich, escape poverty, have plenty of funds, and have a bright future!

The stone ball trembled slightly, like a naked body, beginning to absorb the surrounding earth-element spirit energy.

The spirit energy attached to its surface, constantly solidifying, turning into new stone skin, wrapping around the inner stone ball.

Sun and Ning would not let this happen. They immediately swung their pickaxes and shoveled away the stone skin.

But when they hit the inner layer of the stone ball, whether it was a pickaxe or a magical tool, even Sun Lingtong's knife technique, they could not shake the inner stone ball at all.

Let alone knocking off these treasures.

Sun Lingtong was still excited.

They had come prepared this time.

"Little Zhuo, it's your turn now," Sun Lingtong stepped back slightly.

Ning Zhuo nodded and smiled, "Boss, just watch."

He took out the staff heads.

Ning Zhuo surrounded these staff heads and began to draw symbols and design formations.

Sun Lingtong assisted, preventing the earth-element spirit energy from forming new stone skin and covering Ning Zhuo's formation.

After a while, Ning Zhuo completed his task.

After checking for errors, he stretched out both arms, spread his ten fingers, and released the Life Hanging by a Thread technique from his fingertips.

The Life Hanging by a Thread technique connected to the most crucial ten staff heads. As Ning Zhuo slowly infused his magical power, the staff heads activated one by one, serving as the eyes and hearts of the formation, and then activated the surrounding symbols, fully utilizing the entire formation.

The formation emitted the light of the five elements.

Thanks to Ning Zhuo's understanding of the five elements, he was able to design such a formation in a short time.

Of course, the magical power cultivated by the Five Elements Qi Technique was also very suitable.

Last time, through Zhang Zhongyi's silver needles, he felt the principle of petrification, which was also a very important experience, giving Ning Zhuo great inspiration.

The reason why the stone ball was difficult to mine was that the divine power Stone Forging Earth Treasure was continuously being released.

Ning Zhuo closed his eyes tightly, fully feeling the principles within the inner layer of the stone ball.

Divine Power — Stone Forging Earth Treasure!

Ning Zhuo felt deeply and continuously gained insights.

Even though it was a divine power, he had no understanding barriers.

He had no choice.

His profound understanding of the earth element made him have no barriers to understanding the divine power.

He knew the principles, and divine powers and spells were applications of principles, a certain exquisite combination of magical power and principles.

"I've learned it, I've learned it!"

The joy of learning made the corners of Ning Zhuo's mouth curl up.

In his mind, the embryonic form of the Stone Forging Earth Treasure divine power had already formed and was rapidly growing!
