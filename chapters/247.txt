Chapter 247: The Infamous Thieves!

"How about it? My infiltration plan isn't bad, right?" Sun Lingtong transmitted his voice to Fairy Chanyu.

Fairy Chanyu chuckled, "I overestimated the inspection skills of these cloud merchants. I didn't expect them to check so carelessly." Since Sun Lingtong intended to steal, he naturally discussed it with Ning Zhuo beforehand.

The two conspired and devised a method to sneak in using the mechanical explosive monkeys.

The mechanical explosive monkeys inherently had storage formations, but they could only store items, not living beings.

Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu modified one of the monkeys, improving its formation so they could temporarily hide inside.

On the surface of the formation, Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu also collaborated to disguise it appropriately.

Thus, Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu quietly reached the interior of the Spirit Beast Cloud Whale through the mechanical explosive monkeys.

At this moment, both concealed their forms.

Only when they moved did they cause slight air fluctuations.

"Where's the door here?" Fairy Chanyu looked around, marveling at the vastness of the warehouse while feeling puzzled.

Sun Lingtong knew more than her, "Follow me! People from the Flying Cloud Kingdom usually set up control formations on the right side of the entrance." Sun Lingtong led Fairy Chanyu to the key position where the cloud merchant cultivators had just operated.

Sun Lingtong infused his magical power into his hand, stroking the cloud-like wall.

After a while, his expression changed, showing joy, "It's here." He continued to infuse magical power into the cloud wall, and immediately, yellow formation patterns appeared.

However, lacking an identity token, the yellow light only appeared briefly before disappearing completely.

That was enough!

Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu were excited because they had found the key to breaking through.

"Isn't it simple to forge an identity token? Watch me!" Fairy Chanyu volunteered, and after some tinkering, she created a fake token.

She inserted the fake token into the groove, and the yellow formation patterns reappeared.

The previous scene repeated.

The doors of the compartments on the shelves dissipated like clouds, revealing the mechanical explosive monkeys stored in each compartment.

Sun Lingtong casually collected some.

His storage bracelet, though only at the artifact level, had excellent storage capabilities.

The reason for stealing the monkeys was to prevent exposing their plan.

After all, he intended to take many things next.

If the cloud merchants discovered that only the monkeys were untouched, they would inevitably suspect Ning Zhuo.

After collecting the Fire Monkeys, the yellow formation patterns on the wall converged in two places, each forming the shape of a door.

A large portal and a small door.

Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu communicated through voice transmission.

They both chose the small door.

Clearly, the large door led to the main passage, where there would be more cloud merchants and more defensive measures.

The fake identity token couldn't directly open the small door.

Fairy Chanyu and Sun Lingtong stood before the small door, pondering.

Fairy Chanyu showed some difficulty.

The formation style of the Cloud Kingdom was unfamiliar and uncomfortable for her.

After ten breaths, Fairy Chanyu only understood a little.

This was too slow!

Such efficiency was unacceptable.

Just as she grew anxious, Sun Lingtong suddenly said, "I understand."

He then took out various small artifacts for theft from his storage bag and began working on the door.

His skillful techniques and comprehensive tools dazzled Fairy Chanyu, a Golden Core true disciple of the Void Sect.

In just five or six breaths, Sun Lingtong quickly stepped back and put away all his tools.

In front of him, the small door dissipated like a cloud, revealing an opening.

"You're quite capable." Fairy Chanyu looked at Sun Lingtong with newfound respect.

Sun Lingtong chuckled without explanation.

Unlike Fairy Chanyu, he was very familiar with the formation concepts and styles of the Flying Cloud Kingdom.

This was because, in his early years, Ning Zhuo shared with him the mechanical tomes left by his mother.

Mechanical tomes were a miscellaneous study, encompassing various cultivation arts beyond just mechanics.

Therefore, conversely, mechanical tomes covered a wide range of cultivation arts.

Sun Lingtong had studied the mechanical tomes left by Ning Zhuo's mother thoroughly.

This led to his broad understanding of the cultivation arts of the Flying Cloud Kingdom.

He was well-versed in the various formation techniques and styles of the Flying Cloud Kingdom.

"Alright, let's hurry. The longer we delay, the more likely we are to be discovered." Sun Lingtong quickly checked to ensure there were no traps behind the door, then swiftly moved forward.

"Wait for me, be careful of the guards." Fairy Chanyu hurriedly followed.

The two arrived at another warehouse.

This warehouse was as spacious as the one they had just been in.

Following the previous steps, Fairy Chanyu once again crafted a fake identity token.

They placed the token in the formation groove.

Through the formation, they made the cabinet doors on the shelves dissipate, revealing the materials hidden in the compartments.

Each compartment contained a cloud of mist, within which an orchid was faintly visible.

Fairy Chanyu frowned slightly, "This is..."

She searched her memory.

She vaguely felt familiar with this peculiar flower, having seen it in sect records before.

Sun Lingtong blurted out, "This is Mist Embroidery Orchid."

"This orchid only grows in dense mist environments, and its flowers are the same color as what you see, all white." "Therefore, it's easily overlooked by herb gatherers."

"This orchid is often used to make disguise talismans or pills for concealing aura." Fairy Chanyu nodded immediately, "Yes, that's it."

She looked at him with newfound respect, praising, "I didn't expect you to be so knowledgeable." Sun Lingtong waved his hand, chuckling, and continued forward.

Along the way, they collected many Mist Embroidery Orchids.

Even if they couldn't use them themselves, they could sell them.

As a specialty of the Flying Cloud Kingdom, they would sell well in the Southern Bean Kingdom.

They opened the small door and entered another warehouse, still a spacious one.

This time, when they opened the cabinet doors, they found dormant beetles in the compartments.

These beetles were all asleep, some as small as millstones, others as large as carriages.

Their shells were extremely hard, with faint electric sparks flickering on the surface.

"These are Heavy Thunder Beetles." Fairy Chanyu immediately recognized them.

"They are a specialty of the Thunder Kingdom."

"These beetles are very heavy and move very slowly."

"Their shells are extremely hard and can be used to make many thunder-type artifacts, especially defensive ones." The Thunder Kingdom was located between the Southern Bean Kingdom and the Flying Cloud Kingdom.

The cloud merchants likely did business there, acquiring many local specialties.

The two collected many Thunder Beetles and continued forward.

This time, the warehouse they entered through the small door was nearly half the size of the previous ones.

They activated the formation, revealing the shelves, and opened the cabinet doors of each compartment.

These compartments were very small, containing only a narrow-necked long bottle, filled with dew.

Fairy Chanyu took a long bottle, poured out some dew, examined it, and smiled.

She recognized the raw material of the dew.

She looked at Sun Lingtong, "Do you recognize it?" Sun Lingtong waved his hand, "Isn't it Heavenly Dew?"

"Alright, we have limited time, let's not engage in unnecessary conversation."

Heavenly Dew was no longer a specialty of any one country or region; it was widely found in the heavens.

Heavenly Dew condensed between the clouds at dawn, crystal clear, and existed for a short time.

It was either blown away by the wind or evaporated by the sunlight.

Cultivators who wanted to collect this Heavenly Dew had to prepare in advance, setting up in the high skies to collect it before it dissipated.

For ordinary cultivators, collecting Heavenly Dew was quite difficult because the clouds where it condensed were often high up.

However, for the cloud merchants of the Flying Cloud Kingdom, it was easy.

Their spirit beasts flew high in the sky, making collecting Heavenly Dew a routine morning activity.

Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu collected some Heavenly Dew and continued forward.

This time, when they opened the small door, a mechanical puppet appeared before them.

Fairy Chanyu was about to act, but Sun Lingtong stopped her, "Wait!"

The mechanical puppet showed no signs of aggression.

After stopping Fairy Chanyu, Sun Lingtong carefully observed the puppet.

The puppet also observed them, chuckling softly, "Who are you two? Thieves?"

Fairy Chanyu was taken aback, and killing intent quickly spread.

Sun Lingtong was also surprised, but he had encountered talking mechanical puppets before.

Yuan Dasheng beside Ning Zhuo was one such.

Sun Lingtong's eyes darted, and he said to the puppet, "Of course, we're not thieves! We're on the same side. Look, our token is still on the wall." Sun Lingtong gestured with his thumb, indicating the fake identity token in the groove on the wall.

Before the mechanical puppet could examine it closely, Sun Lingtong quickly changed the subject, "Can you let us through? We need to check the goods. It's our job to inspect the quality and see if there's any damage."

"We were assigned by Lord Song Fuli as inspectors."

"By the way, what's your name? What level is your intelligence? Can you do math? What's eight times eight?"

The mechanical puppet, with wide eyes, looked at the two, scanning them from head to toe, and in a soft voice said, "My name is Rudie Niang. Since I can talk to you, I've naturally reached the Wisdom Spirit Stage. Eight times eight, hmm... equals sixty-six?"
