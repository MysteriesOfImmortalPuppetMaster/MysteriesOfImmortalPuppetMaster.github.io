Chapter 711: The Benefits of Obscurity

"There must be more to the Primordial Resonance Reed Book than what's written here."

"This book describes twenty vowel reeds, but these are just the basics. There should also be auxiliary reeds."

"The number of auxiliary reeds likely exceeds twenty."

"Perhaps the next time I pass Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Minor Trial, I'll receive a Consonant Reed Book?"

Ning Zhuo speculated inwardly.

The Primordial Resonance Reed Book in his hands was written by Qing Huangzi himself, thus imbued with the author's intent.

Intent is information that cannot be expressed through words or sentences.

Yet, through the Intent Comprehension Brush, Ning Zhuo could perceive it.

As the author, Qing Huangzi had only recorded a fraction of his complete legacy. Clearly, the Primordial Resonance Reed Book represented the most fundamental of foundations.

He hadn't explicitly written about the subsequent stages, but Ning Zhuo could glimpse the later content through the intent embedded within the text.

"The Luo Shu Page, as a Dao Artifact, has also been immensely helpful."

"Under its influence, I've been able to stay on the right path, correctly interpreting this intent."

The results of this experiment felt like a window had been opened for Ning Zhuo.

A glint flashed in his eyes as he quickly realized, "If I want to uncover the fundamental cultivation technique of a Great Power cultivator, could I also study their other authentic works, decipher their intent, and thereby glean the secrets of their cultivation art?"

Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment, then shook his head slightly. "This won't be easy."

"At the very least, these authentic works must be related to the fundamental cultivation technique. Otherwise, the intent left by the Great Power cultivator when writing would pertain to other matters."

"Wait a minute..."

"Many cultivators observe battlefields, studying the sword marks and lightning traces left by clashes between Great Powers, often gaining insights."

"Isn't this the same principle as using the Intent Comprehension Brush?"

Realizing this, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but exclaim sincerely, "There are truly endless avenues to learning!"

"Knowledge knows no bounds!"

Ning Zhuo placed the Intent Comprehension Brush back into its box to continue nurturing it.

The recent tracing had dimmed the brush's luster once more. Using it again now might damage its core.

"Alas, I'm not a Confucian cultivator, lacking a Literary Heart and Literary Qi. This means I can't use the Intent Comprehension Brush for long periods at a time."

"If only I had multiple Intent Comprehension Brushes to rotate between them."

Before beginning his daily cultivation routine, Ning Zhuo summoned Gongsun Yan and handed him a list of materials, instructing him to go out and purchase them.

Although Qing Huangzi hadn't explicitly stated it, now that Ning Zhuo possessed the Primordial Resonance Reed Book, he naturally needed to refine more of its mechanical components.

Bang!

Ban Ji swung his arm, unleashing a surge of spiritual energy that shattered the last flowerpot in his cave dwelling.

The cave was already in ruins, the result of Ban Ji's unrestrained use of spiritual energy to vent his rage.

"Ning Zhuo, I'll kill you! I'll kill you!" Ban Ji snarled through gritted teeth.

He had prepared for Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Minor Trial for a long time, only to be eliminated in the first round!

Without a doubt, it was all Ning Zhuo's fault!

"But it's also my own fault!"

"I was too careless! My overwhelming advantage in the divine sense clash made me complacent! If I had noticed earlier that Ning Zhuo was colluding with others and taken precautions, I would still have had a chance!"

Slap! Slap!

Ban Ji slapped himself twice, his cheeks quickly swelling and reddening. His eyes were bloodshot, his hair disheveled, and his expression twisted with fury, radiating an aura of madness.

Only one! The pain in his swollen cheeks was nothing compared to the agony in his heart.

Qing Huangzi had deliberately spread word of the competition to attract more cultivators, hoping to filter out the most outstanding successor. Ban Ji had been preparing for this moment since he first heard the rumors.

He had prepared extensively.

"I've even deduced and summarized the reed structures for all Forty-Eight Tones!"

"The winners of this round received the Primordial Resonance Reed Book, which only contains twenty types of reeds. There must be further volumes!"

"If I can just pass the first round and maintain my eligibility, I'll have an overwhelming advantage in the subsequent trials!"

But it was all for naught. Ban Ji was eliminated in the very first round.

For him, the psychological blow was devastating.

This failure only intensified his sense of humiliation.

"Aaaah!"

"It's all your fault, Ning Zhuo! You deserve to die!"

"I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Human Tribulation? I'll crush you directly!"

Ban Ji roared, and suddenly the jade pendant hanging around his neck emitted a surge of green light.

The light flowed like water, rapidly coursing through Ban Ji's entire body before converging in his divine sea, jolting him awake.

The fury on Ban Ji's face vanished, replaced by a look of terror.

"That was close! I almost succumbed to demonic possession!"

This was a hallmark of Demonic Arts - extreme, rapid cultivation, and inherent instability.

Ban Ji's Demonic Art, the Greedy Opportunity Demonic Heart Art, focused on cultivating the Upper Dantian's divine sea. This made him prone to emotional outbursts and prone to extreme thinking.

Ban Ji gasped for breath, his forehead slick with fine beads of sweat.

Looking disheveled, he wiped the sweat from his brow and instinctively clutched the jade pendant around his neck.

This magic treasure, a legacy of the Ban Clan, was one of their foundational assets. It had repeatedly saved Ban Ji from the brink of demonic possession.

Gradually calming down, Ban Ji paced within his cave dwelling, pondering how to deal with Ning Zhuo.

"This is my Human Tribulation... but I can't directly eliminate Ning Zhuo."

Ban Ji had previously sent Ning Zhuo a challenge letter, which Ning Zhuo politely declined.

Ban Ji intended to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect. While the sect had few formal rules, any violation could easily lead to severe consequences.

One such rule explicitly stated that conflicts between individuals like Ban Ji and Ning Zhuo must be resolved through the Martial Performance Hall.

If Ban Ji were to attack Ning Zhuo directly and be exposed, the Myriad Manifestations Sect would inevitably punish him severely, potentially even making him a cautionary example.

"No one has resorted to such methods in over a century of Flying Cloud Assemblies."

"Even if I provoke Ning Zhuo relentlessly, he'll likely refuse to enter the Martial Performance Hall with me!"

Ban Ji had already observed Ning Zhuo.

Through the naturally emanating spiritual energy, he discerned that Ning Zhuo was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment Stage, while Ban Ji himself had reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

"Although Ning Zhuo possesses a Golden Core-level mechanical puppet, his control over it is lacking."

"My control skills far surpass his, and my divine sense is leagues ahead!"

"His Golden Core-level mechanical puppet is likely just a safeguard provided by his family."

"But the Golden Core-level mechanical construct in my hands is my true combat power - the result of years of painstaking effort, step-by-step refinement, and relentless improvement!"

"And I have more than just one!"

Ban Ji's face flashed with pride.

"My strength far exceeds Ning Zhuo's, but that brat will never face me head-on."

"He's using the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Sect Rules to harass me and sabotage my plans. Yet I can't directly retaliate. Disgusting! Utterly disgusting!"

"That hypocritical little scoundrel!"

Ban Ji's fury burned unabated. As he thought of this, the image of the big-headed youth smiling faintly at him surfaced in his mind.

Ban Ji's eyes narrowed, his hatred so intense he wished he could tear Ning Zhuo's mouth apart.

"I can't rely on Qing Huangzi anymore."

"But I still have other options!"

"I can't afford to fail again."

"I was truly careless this time, prematurely revealing information and allowing Ning Zhuo to interfere in Qing Huangzi's Minor Trial."

Ban Ji resolved to keep his movements strictly secret from now on.

"I must prevent Ning Zhuo from harassing me again!"

"My cultivation of Demonic Arts goes against the natural order. Ning Zhuo is my Human Tribulation, so whenever I'm near him, my Qi Luck will inevitably be lower, making me prone to misfortune."

"I can't afford to fail in the upcoming Rising Cloud Minor Trials."

"These trials aren't just tests; they're also crucial networking opportunities. When I join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, these connections will allow me to quickly establish myself and advance smoothly."

The Rising Cloud Minor Trials and the Flying Cloud Assembly hold immense significance for cultivators, shaping their future prospects.

After pacing thoughtfully for a while, Ban Ji sent out four Flying Messages in quick succession.

"First, I'll give Ning Zhuo something to keep him busy."

"Once I've passed these Rising Cloud Minor Trials, I'll turn my attention back to him and settle the score properly!"

Moments later, in his newly cleaned and repaired cave abode, Ban Ji welcomed four Demonic Cultivators.

There was the Rust Disaster Artisan, the Mad Monk, Lady Coiled Silk, and finally, the Miasma Mother.

Ban Ji cut straight to the point: "I've hired you all at great expense to deal with a single target."

"This man is called Ning Zhuo. He ruined a crucial opportunity for me, and I harbor a deep-seated hatred for him!"

"Do everything you can to harass him and distract him. If you succeed, I'll reward you handsomely!"

With that, Ban Ji handed over four copied Jade Slips to the Demonic Cultivators. "These contain Ning Zhuo's information."

The four cultivators immediately probed the Jade Slips with their divine sense, rapidly scanning the contents.

Mist Mother Liu Qingyan frowned slightly. "This information is... sparse."

Ban Ji replied, "I purchased the highest-level intelligence from the Trading Hall. Ning Zhuo... he's likely not from this country."

Lady Coiled Silk chuckled playfully. "Though the information is limited, the fact that he associates with Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong suggests he's no ordinary cultivator."

She cast a sultry glance at Ban Ji. "Young Master Ban, it's rare to see you harbor such animosity toward a peer. What exactly did he do to you?"

Ban Ji snorted coldly, forcing the words through clenched teeth: "If we weren't within the Myriad Manifestations Sect - if we were outside - I would have crushed him into dust long ago."

The Rust Disaster Artisan's voice was hoarse as he pressed Ban Ji for the truth. "The intelligence didn't say how you were defeated. If you want us to deal with him, you need to tell us more. What's with all the secrecy?"

"If you waste our time, I'll start to suspect that Ning Zhuo is just a smokescreen - a ploy by you, Ban Ji, to stall us!"

Ban Ji narrowed his eyes, glaring at the Rust Disaster Artisan, his killing intent palpable. "Blacksmith, don't push your luck. You think I'd scheme against you? Do you even have family backing? My future prospects far surpass yours. Why would I waste my energy plotting against you?"

Provoked, the Rust Disaster Artisan took a step forward, closing in on Ban Ji.

Seeing the two were about to clash, the Mad Monk quickly stepped between them. "Enough! We haven't even dealt with Ning Zhuo yet, and we're already turning on each other? This won't do."

He addressed the Rust Disaster Artisan first. "The four of us have cooperated well with Ban Ji before, and we have an agreement to assist each other. This time, he's using that agreement to ask us to act. Let's honor our word."

The Rust Disaster Artisan snorted coldly but reluctantly retreated to his original position.

The Mad Monk turned to Ban Ji and said, "Young Master Ban, the Rust Disaster Artisan isn't wrong."

"We're all here for the Flying Cloud Assembly, hoping to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

"You're wasting our time and energy by making us harass this Ning Zhuo. We wanted to try the Soaring Cloud Trials multiple times - "

Ban Ji cut him off with a wave. "Since your time and energy are so precious, why aren't you getting to work?"

"Spare me the nonsense about raising the price."

"It's unnecessary!"

"After you succeed, I'll reward the one who completes the task with triple the agreed price."

"That's all there is to it!"

"My offer is already exceptionally generous. Don't get greedy, you four. Take it or leave it - one word!"

Ban Ji glared at the four cultivators, his dominance palpable.

The atmosphere in the cave grew tense.

Lady Coiled Silk suddenly laughed, breaking the tension. "I accept! At such a high price, how could I refuse?"

"What about the three of you?" Ban Ji asked, his hands clasped behind his back, a hint of arrogance in his smile.

The Mad Monk and the other two exchanged glances and nodded in unison.

Ban Ji paid the deposit, clasped his hands in a farewell gesture, and said, "Then I'll await your good news."

Watching the four figures depart, Ban Ji mused to himself, "Any one of these four is my equal in combat strength."

"I refuse to believe they can't subdue you!"

The challenge letter and the rumors targeting Ning Zhuo surfaced almost simultaneously.

"Mad Monk?"

"Who's that?"

Ning Zhuo read the Flying Message, puzzled.

Soon after, Old Chef came to report on the rumors.

Ning Zhuo suddenly understood. "The rumors concern the Mad Monk's challenge, and he's fabricated a pretext - claiming my family once nearly tortured him to death. He says he's here for revenge, to uphold the Righteous Path."

"This tactic... it's so cliché."

Ning Zhuo immediately thought of Ban Ji and Pi Fujie.

"The Mad Monk came prepared, his malice obvious. These two are likely involved."

"But slandering my family... does he even know where my family is? Who's in it? Does he know anything at all?"

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but let out a few cold chuckles.

If he were in Shen Xi's situation, this would be a real problem.

The Shen Family of Nine Palaces Immortal City held considerable prestige in the Flying Cloud Kingdom. As the family's foremost representative at the Foundation Establishment stage - a universally acknowledged genius cultivator - Shen Xi would undoubtedly be the first to step forward and defend the family's honor against such slander.

Lin Jinglong and Situ Xing would do the same.

Families, sects, and other factions deliberately cultivate figureheads. A Foundation Establishment stage figurehead represents the faction's future prospects, while a Golden Core stage figurehead represents its diplomatic prowess. After all, Nascent Soul-level cultivators cannot move freely and often require prior authorization.

In most cases, minor conflicts between factions are resolved through contests between Golden Core-level cultivators, establishing dominance and determining outcomes.

A Nascent Soul-level cultivator could single-handedly destroy an ordinary town. Using such power would escalate a minor conflict into a full-blown war.

Ning Zhuo was not Shen Xi, and the Ning Clan was not the Shen Family of Nine Palaces Immortal City. In the Flying Cloud Kingdom, Ning Zhuo and the Ning Clan's reputation was virtually nonexistent.

Therefore, when the rumors spread, people's first reaction wasn't to look down on the Ning Clan, but rather confusion: "Who is Ning Zhuo?" and "Which Ning Clan is that?"
