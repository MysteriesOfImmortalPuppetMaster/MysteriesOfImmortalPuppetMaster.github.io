Chapter 638: Forgetful River Crossing - Void Return Raft

Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's expression turned solemn. "I'm not joking with you, nor do I wish to see you fail."

"Little Sun, you've cared for my son for many years. I am deeply grateful to you."

"Your infiltration of the Immortal City is blessed by some unseen force, and you will receive unexpected assistance."

"Meanwhile, my situation is fraught with peril! I only regret having insufficient forces; more would be infinitely better."

Sun Lingtong frowned. "Could the Ash Bone Elder truly face a life-or-death crisis?"

Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin nodded slowly, her expression grave.

Sun Lingtong's heart sank. If Aunt holds him in such high regard, the enemies in Water Burial Valley must be far more terrifying than those in Forgetful River Immortal City!

After all, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-old scheme is about to be thwarted, and the Ash Bone Elder's role and contributions are immeasurable.

Aunt received guidance from the Ash Bone Elder even before her passing. The existence of our two cultivation armies is entirely due to his planning.

If I were the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and learned the truth, I'd hate the Ash Bone Elder bitterly and seek his elimination at the first opportunity!

"Auntie did this for my own good, deliberately separating from me..."

"But how can I cross the Forgetful River and enter the Immortal City?"

Sun Lingtong stared at the vast river before him, feeling utterly stumped.

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin had already led her army and departed. Before leaving, she reached out and plucked a wisp of her own aura from her body, forming it into a glowing Qi Orb.

"This is my aura. Use it to conceal yourself and to help you pass through the city gates."

Sun Lingtong accepted the orb with both hands, looking up at Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin as her war chariot accelerated into the distance.

Watching the departing chariot, Sun Lingtong called out, "Auntie, how am I supposed to cross the river?"

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin transmitted her voice through her divine sense: "Little Sun, it's not that I don't want to guide you further."

"It's just that my state is unique - I am neither living nor dead, nor a ghost or deity. My recent awakening and continuous divinations have already disturbed the flow of Qi Luck. Any more guidance from me could bring misfortune. Trust in the natural course of things."

With that, she led her army of Paper Persons away with a thunderous roar, carrying a solemn aura of battle as they marched toward another battlefield.

Sun Lingtong, a young boy, remained alone.

He gazed at the vast expanse of the river, momentarily bewildered and unsure of what to do.

If this were his first time here, he might have tried using spells or Theft Path Methods, only to suffer the consequences.

But he had already witnessed Luo Si's experience, which instilled in him a deep understanding and reverence for the Forgetful River.

Luo Si, a Nascent Soul-level cultivator and a great general leading an army to attack White Paper Immortal City, possessed extraordinary strength. Even he dared only to sit on the riverbank, fishing by the shore, rather than wading into the water recklessly.

"Wait, that's not right! That's not right!"

Sun Lingtong suddenly realized a crucial point: "Forgetful River Immortal City has a large population. It's impossible for everyone to be a great cultivator, capable of crossing the Forgetful River on their own."

"With so many people, they must have a stable passage to enter the city easily. Perhaps a teleportation array or something similar."

This realization invigorated Sun Lingtong.

He immediately began walking along the river, launching his investigation.

Before long, he emerged from the thick river mist to see a ferry crossing.

"Indeed, indeed! My theory was correct!" Sun Lingtong's spirits soared, his heart filled with excitement and caution as he approached the crossing.

The ferry crossing was crude and rudimentary, already crowded with a group of cultivators waiting to cross.

Out of caution, Sun Lingtong first observed from a distance. He noticed that among the waiting figures were not only Soul Cultivators but also various ghostly creatures. Their cultivation levels varied widely, with only one Golden Core-level cultivator, a few Foundation Establishment cultivators, and a larger number at the Qi Refining Stage. Surprisingly, the majority were ordinary mortals.

Sun Lingtong's wariness eased slightly.

He touched his face, confirming that he still appeared as a Ghost Cultivator from the Underworld. After verifying that his disguise remained intact, he strode casually into the ferry crossing as if nothing was amiss.

His arrival initially drew no attention, but as he wandered about, peering around, the number of curious glances directed his way steadily increased.

The ferry crossing was surprisingly crude, leaving Sun Lingtong with little to observe. His gaze eventually settled on the cultivators, who had quietly formed a line. He was secretly surprised by their orderly demeanor.

Standing near the front of the queue, Sun Lingtong was mentally crafting questions to probe for information when a nearby Ghost Cultivator suddenly spoke: "Young man, are you looking to join Forgetful River Immortal City?"

"Ah? Yes, I am," Sun Lingtong replied, nodding.

The Ghost Cultivator grinned widely, his enthusiasm palpable. "Then please stand in front of me."

Sun Lingtong was taken aback.

Before the Ghost Cultivator's words had fully faded, other ghostly creatures and Soul Cultivators began clamoring:

"Cut in front of me! Cut in front of me!"

"Why should he stand in front of you? I'm ahead of you - come here, young man!"

"Come, come! I'll give you my spot!"

The waiting cultivators were remarkably enthusiastic and deferential.

Sun Lingtong, quick-witted as he was, immediately sensed the unsettling undercurrent beneath their excessive politeness.

Seeing his hesitation, the Soul Cultivators grew even more clamorous, jostling to be the first to help Sun Lingtong. Some ghostly creatures glared with bloodshot eyes, baring ferocious expressions that they barely managed to suppress.

Sun Lingtong decisively moved away from the crowd and walked to the end of the line.

Once he reached the back of the queue, the ghostly creatures and Soul Cultivators fell silent. Some snorted in displeasure, while others turned to stare at Sun Lingtong, their calculating gazes barely concealed.

"You little brat, you're not entirely foolish," an old man suddenly spoke. He had been standing first in line, now second-to-last.

Sun Lingtong glanced at him and saw a Soul Cultivator of the human race. He ventured to ask, "Elder, is there some meaning behind this?"

The old man nodded. "They're trying to accumulate merit by seizing every opportunity to do good deeds."

"But true virtue and what they're doing here are worlds apart."

"Take me, for example. I'm the one truly practicing virtue - acting out of genuine kindness!"

The old man spoke openly, without resorting to divine sense or telepathy.

Hearing these words, many ghostly creatures and Soul Cultivators erupted in fury, turning to glare at the old man with rage.

"Old man, stop talking nonsense!"

"Who do you think you are, lecturing this Ghost Grandpa about doing good deeds?"

"Are you looking down on us? Hypocrite!"

The old man's words had incited a storm of anger, yet he chuckled and turned to Sun Lingtong with a smile. "Watch carefully, little ghost."

Then, he faced the crowd, glaring defiantly. "What's with the racket?! You fools! Got the guts to fight an old man like me?"

"Don't worry, I'm weak - just a Qi Refining cultivator, barely different from a mortal."

"You could kill me with a single punch! Come on, hit me in the chest. I guarantee I'll drop dead instantly!"

The crowd that had been shouting moments before fell silent.

Sun Lingtong observed their reactions and immediately understood that these creatures were deeply intimidated.

The old man's "victory of the weak" made Sun Lingtong realize that even before entering the Forgetful River Immortal City, they were already subject to its rules.

"Could it be that the Forgetful River Immortal City values respect for elders and care for the young, and encourages virtuous deeds?" he asked the old man.

The old man nodded. "The rules of the Forgetful River Immortal City are very strict. All Soul Cultivators, ghosts, and other creatures entering the city undergo rigorous scrutiny."

"The key focus of this scrutiny is the presence and extent of sins, as well as the presence and extent of virtues."

"The fewer the sins and the greater the virtues, the easier it is to enter the Immortal City and gain citizenship."

"At this Forgetful River Crossing, we must also strictly adhere to the rules. Loud shouting, cutting in line, and other unruly behavior could provoke the Cloud Dao Reflection and prevent you from boarding the Void Return Raft."

The more Sun Lingtong listened, the more questions he had. He couldn't help but ask, "Wait, old man. What is this Cloud Dao Reflection? And what is the Void Return Raft? Is it a ferry?"

The old man was startled by the question. "You want to enter the Forgetful River Immortal City, yet you don't even know these two things?"

Realizing he had been seen through as a newcomer, Sun Lingtong resolutely shook his head. "No, I don't."

The old man sighed, genuinely remarking, "Then you're lucky to have encountered me, brat."

"Let me explain it to you."

"All the ferry crossings and boats on the Forgetful River are connected to two esteemed predecessors."

"They were a Daoist couple: the female cultivator, Yueyi, and the male cultivator, Yundao."

"The pair were a perfect match, harmonizing like a zither and a se, deeply devoted to each other and the great Dao, vowing to attain immortality together."

"Senior Yueyi was as gentle as moonlight, her heart pure and her deeds virtuous. During a sudden calamity - the collapse of the Void Realm - she sacrificed herself to protect the lives of others, her soul falling into the Underworld."

"Senior Yunxiao was devastated, his Dao Heart nearly shattered. Without her, even ten thousand years of longevity would be nothing but an eternal prison of loneliness."

"Defying the counsel of his peers, he abandoned his cultivation path and, with solitary courage, forced open the Nine Netherworld Yellow Springs Road. He plunged deep into the Underworld, breaching multiple Underworld Prefectures."

"This journey was one of true hardship and peril, a path where death lurked at every step. He cut through hordes of demonic ghosts, endured the bone-corroding yin winds, traversed realms of fiery torment, and defied the ironclad laws of Ghosts. What sustained him was a single, unextinguishable obsession: to find her and bring her back!"

"At last, after enduring countless tribulations, he followed the familiar qi of his cultivation partner's soul to this place - perhaps even standing where we stand today."

"The bank of the ancient Forgetful River, which spans eternity."

"Where towering waves crash, carrying a foul, fishy stench, countless twisted souls struggle and float in the murky waters, wailing with mournful cries that pierce the soul. After being washed by the waters of the Forgetful River, their memories of the past are erased, their intense emotions stripped away, granting them release and peace as they finally rise to the surface."

"Senior Yunxiao found Senior Yueyi here. Yet his joy and urgency elicited no response whatsoever."

"Senior Yueyi had soaked for too long, too much of her emotion and memory washed away. When she saw Yunxiao, her brow furrowed slightly, as if straining to remember, but in the end, it proved futile."

"Though Senior Yunxiao had found his cultivation partner, the outcome was tragic. He tried to recover the emotions and memories Yueyi had lost, but they had scattered into the boundless waters of the Forgetful River. Even Senior Yunxiao was powerless against this."

"He stood by the bank of the Forgetful River, his numbed soulmate's spirit beside him, striving relentlessly for seven days and seven nights. In the end, all his sacrifices, all his arduous journeys, all his unwavering perseverance, gradually transformed into a despair colder than the waters of the Forgetful River itself."

"In that despair, overwhelmed by grief, he threw his head back and howled at the heavens. In that howl, heedless of the consequences, he unleashed his full power and potential."

"His howl merged with the crashing waves of the river. His entire cultivation, his innate talent, was deeply etched into the banks of the Forgetful River, manifesting as countless ferry crossings and ferry boats."

"Each crossing and ferry was identical in form. They became the Forgetful River Crossing and the Void Return Raft."

Sun Lingtong listened raptly, murmuring the names to himself, savoring their meaning. Unlike before, he could now sense the anguish, despair, and sorrow woven into those two names.

The old man continued, "Because Senior Yunxiao was a virtuous elder of the righteous path, anyone who enters the Forgetful River Crossing must abide by its rules."

"Poor behavior, such as fighting, arguing, or even speaking loudly, can result in being removed from the Forgetful River Crossing. The worst consequence is being permanently barred from ever entering the Forgetful River Crossing again after being expelled once."

"The Void Return Raft has limited space, and only the top ten performers during each crossing are selected to board."

"Top performance here refers to one's conduct throughout the Forgetful River Crossing."

"Only by boarding the Void Return Raft can we reach the Forgetful River Immortal City."

Sun Lingtong finally understood the full situation. He stared at the long queue before him, thinking, "So their earlier attempts to let me cut the line were all traps, while they pretended to show off their own virtue!"

He opened his mouth to ask further questions when suddenly, a cloud of Qi materialized and condensed into a Cultivator. Dressed in broad-sleeved white robes that made him seem ethereal, the figure stood with his back to the crowd, gazing serenely at the surface of the Forgetful River as it flowed by.

Forgetful River Crossing fell deathly silent.

The Ash Bone Elder's eyes widened as he stared intently at the retreating figure.

Sun Lingtong also watched, his thoughts racing back to the earlier introduction. "Could this be Senior Yunxiao's reflection?" he wondered.

The Cloud Dao Reflection remained visible for only a few breaths before mist began to rise around it, as if a dense fog were forming on the river's surface.

Amidst the swirling fog, a ferry gradually emerged.

The ferry was simple and cramped, its narrow deck barely accommodating more than a few passengers.

Sun Lingtong couldn't help but think, No wonder the old man said he only takes the top ten cultivators.

The Cloud Dao Reflection beckoned to the Void Return Raft, which hastened to dock at the crossing.

With a wave of its sleeve, the reflection signaled.

In the next instant, the elder who had helped Sun Lingtong vanished from his spot.

When he reappeared, he was already on the ferry, the first passenger on the Void Return Raft!
