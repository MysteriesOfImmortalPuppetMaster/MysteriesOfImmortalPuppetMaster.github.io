Chapter 495: The Xuanyuan Nine-Work Platform

Thousand Peaks Forest.

Dragon King Mountain.

In order to counter the expedition army of the Two-Note Nation, the various factions of Thousand Peaks Forest gathered around the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King and set up a grand hall on Dragon King Mountain.

Inside the hall, a small number of cultivators, demon cultivators, barbarians, and gods sat around a giant sand-table round table.

Only one green-robed cultivator stood at the table’s edge.

It was Lu Hongtu.

Lu Hongtu wore a cold expression, his gaze as sharp as a blade.

He condensed his magical power and lightly tapped the sand table before him. The sand table was a three-dimensional map of Thousand Peaks Forest.

Several threads of magical power formed four routes.

Some routes were longer, while others were shorter.

“Everyone,” Lu Hongtu spoke in a low voice. “Ever since our army launched that surprise attack on the vanguard forces and temporarily trapped them, Du Tiechuan was injured by Prince Sheng Xu yet reacted extremely quickly. He immediately dispatched four armies for a counterattack.”

“This is our latest military update.”

Lu Hongtu’s fingers curled slightly, and the longest route among them swelled and thickened.

He explained at the right moment: “The Golden Halberd Army led by Sun Gan has already broken through three checkpoints in a row with unstoppable momentum. For some reason, Du Tiechuan sent out this elite unit.”

“This army poses the greatest threat.”

“They will soon enter the territory of Bikun Mountain.”

“There are no barbarian tribes on Bikun Mountain, but at its peak lies a Bikun Pool. This pool yields Air Crystals and Bihu Stones in abundance, and void creatures often appear there.”

“Do we hand this precious resource over? If we don’t, Bikun Mountain has no natural barriers, so we must send a strong army to hold it. That’s the only way to possibly withstand the Golden Halberd Army.”

After a pause, Lu Hongtu continued introducing the other three armies’ situations.

“The Red Flower Camp has climbed Cold Moon Mountain and is currently resting.”

“The Barbarian-Demon Camp attacked Thunder Light Mountain but was defeated by the defending army and pulled back three miles to set up camp.”

“As for the Three Generals Camp, they should be on Dice-Bone Mountain, engaged in fierce battle with the Dice-Bone Demon God.”

As soon as Lu Hongtu finished speaking, a messenger arrived.

Upon hearing the urgent military report, Lu Hongtu’s expression changed slightly. He swept his gaze around and said in a deep voice, “Everyone, there’s a change in the situation.”

“Word just came: the Three Generals Camp has already taken Dice-Bone Mountain.”

At this, the cultivators in the hall gasped softly.

“What? The Dice-Bone Demon God actually lost?”

“Did he withdraw early to protect his followers?”

“That shouldn’t be. He signed the divine contract with the Dragon King as well, and it was his own choice to defend his territory.”

“Hahaha, when the Dice-Bone Demon God arrives at Dragon King Mountain, I’ll be sure to mock him well!”

“Where is he now?”

Lu Hongtu’s Adam’s apple moved once, but he held back and did not reveal that the Dice-Bone Demon God had defected on the battlefield.

Although the Dice-Bone Demon God only had Golden Core cultivation, his combat strength was outstanding. Once he activated his domain, he could hold off a Nascent Soul-level adversary for some time.

These facts were well-known throughout Thousand Peaks Forest.

Hence, everyone (including Lu Hongtu) had been confident in leaving the Dice-Bone Demon God to defend that area. No one had expected him to be quickly defeated and then surrender!

Lu Hongtu estimated that if he disclosed this piece of military intelligence, it would undoubtedly cause unrest in Thousand Peaks Forest and inevitably spawn a great deal of panic.

“Such a thorny matter is best left for the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King to handle.”

Lu Hongtu decided to focus on his duties as a strategist.

“Wait!”

His heart skipped a beat. Suddenly, he sensed something wrong.

“The Dice-Bone Demon God may be just Golden Core, but having become a god, he can unleash his domain.”

“His domain is very peculiar, so we had invited him before for the plan to ambush the Two-Note Nation’s transport convoy.”

“Now that he has defected on the battlefield, could this information be compromised?”

Lu Hongtu instantly did some quick calculations.

After sizing up the timings, cold sweat appeared on his forehead. “It’s risky.”

“If the information has already leaked, and the enemy sends word at top speed, they can be forewarned in time.”

“We have to make them act immediately!”

At that thought, Lu Hongtu immediately used his divine sense to pass down orders.

There were many people present in the hall, and ears were everywhere. Only a select few knew of this ambush plan. Before the outcome was decided, everything had to remain strictly confidential.

Wooden Wheel Town.

Marshal’s Residence.

Du Tiechuan and Shuang Ling were secretly discussing military affairs.

Du Tiechuan said, “Cough, cough, cough, Your Highness, you’ve only made six thousand units of your Treading Mountain Wheels, which is far short of the intended total of eighteen thousand. That leaves a gap of twelve thousand.”

“Right now, our vanguard army is trapped, and your Treading Mountain Wheels are crucial for lifting this crisis!”

Shuang Ling nodded. “Thousand Peaks Forest trapped our vanguard army, hoping to force our troops to rescue them. We must not fight on a battlefield arranged by the enemy, or else we’d be walking straight into their trap.”

“Rest assured, Marshal Du.”

“All the follow-up components and materials are in the most recent transport convoy.”

“I even spent most of my family fortune to purchase multiple mechanical bases from other nations. Using those to produce Treading Mountain Wheels, we can be thirty times faster than I could manage on my own!”

Du Tiechuan nodded slightly.

Shuang Ling said, “There’s no problem with my mechanical wheels. But, Marshal Du, what about your injuries? How much have you recovered?”

“If we launch a large-scale offensive on Dragon King Mountain, a huge battle is sure to break out.”

“At that time, we will likely have to face the domain of the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King and also Prince Sheng Xu, who can fight above his level at the Soul Formation stage.”

Du Tiechuan sighed. “Indeed, Sheng Xu deserves his title as a prince-level figure. His Void Devouring Sutra is peerless. It wasn’t he who injured me —it was I who injured myself.”

“Because of that, however, I am more certain of my recovery.”

“Don’t worry. By the time the great battle comes, my wounds will have healed. Then, my true body will come to reinforce our forces. We might even be able to enlist the help of a Soul Formation-level State Beast.”

Shuang Ling breathed a sigh of relief. “That would be for the best!”

No-Thief Valley.

“This is the place,” Sun Lingtong said as he controlled the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, comparing the map while he spoke.

He had used the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon far more times than Ning Zhuo had, so his skill was more refined.

They snuck the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to the vicinity of the valley. To avoid alarming the enemy, they dared not get too close.

They waited only a short while before hearing the sound of carriages and horses.

Before long, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo saw a transport convoy moving in a long, snaking line.

Scouts spread out in all directions, conducting detailed reconnaissance.

Many scouts returned from No-Thief Valley to report to the Two-Note Nation’s Nascent Soul cultivator who led the convoy. They found no sign of the enemy.

The Two-Note Nation’s Nascent Soul cultivators also personally employed various methods of detection. Having confirmed there was no hidden danger, they waved their hands and led the troops into No-Thief Valley.

No-Thief Valley had a bit of a backstory connected to a famous minister named Gu Wenjing.

Gu Wenjing was born into a prominent family but was intelligent and broad-minded. He understood the hardships of the people and was full of compassion.

He was never arrogant; in all his deeds, he put the people’s well-being first. At the age of thirty, he was appointed governor of this land.

At the time, it was a place of barren mountains and treacherous rivers, full of cunning folk and endless bandits who could not be eradicated.

Upon taking office, Gu Wenjing did not do what his predecessors had done —raising an army and going into the mountains to eliminate bandits.

Instead, he took swift and fierce measures to reorganize every industry within his jurisdiction, improve social customs, build water conservancy projects, pave roads, and vigorously develop agriculture and commerce.

He started with various measures to reassure the people, easing their resentment.

He then reduced taxes and labor obligations, lifting many burdens from the populace.

Afterward, he gathered manpower and resources to repair the run-down farmland dikes, waterwheels, and so on, improved farming techniques, and promoted them widely.

Day after day, year after year, Gu Wenjing’s reputation among the people grew steadily until it shone like the midday sun.

As the people’s lives became more prosperous, their hearts gradually grew secure.

Only in the final three months of his term did Gu Wenjing officially “make a move” against the bandits in the valley.

He did not dispatch any troops. He merely posted an “Innocence Notice” on the city gates, announcing that within three months, any bandit who surrendered would not be held accountable for past offenses—except for serious crimes.

Not only that, but the government allocated good farmland to any bandit who surrendered, giving them land to till so a typical cultivator’s family could live in peace.

With this decree, the bandits flocked to surrender.

Just like that, the bandit scourge that had plagued an entire nation for years was eradicated by Gu Wenjing.

When Gu Wenjing was transferred elsewhere, the valley that had once teemed with bandits was renamed by later generations. To commemorate Gu Wenjing’s great achievements, it was renamed No-Thief Valley.

Yet on this day, No-Thief Valley was crawling with numerous bandits.

“Fellow Daoist Wu Hen, we owe it to your technique. Otherwise, we’d have been discovered,” said Diao Ye, the Withering Poison General of the Hundred Poison Tribe, sounding very relieved.

Wu Hen wore a black robe, his long hair in disarray. He spoke blandly: “Let’s do it. I don’t know why, but I have a bad feeling.”

Boom! Boom! Boom!

In the next moment, as soon as the transport convoy entered the valley, this group from Thousand Peaks Forest launched their assault.

Aoo—!

Wolves poured down like a tide.

It was the work of Lone Fang from the Pale Moon Tribe, commanding the wolf pack’s advance.

Caught off guard, the transport convoy fell into chaos, suffering heavy casualties.

Enraged, the Nascent Soul cultivator escorting the convoy brandished his sword, employing battlefield tactics. First he reinforced the army’s defenses, then prepared to shift formation.

Among the ambushers from Thousand Peaks Forest, the Cang Vine King donned an ancient vine-armor and took out a black bow, firing arrow after arrow of green vines.

Soldiers at critical points in the formation sprouted vines from their bodies and died on the spot.

This disrupted the formation shift, slowing it by several times.

The Nascent Soul cultivator was furious. He first employed the Speed Is of the Essence tactic from his battlefield techniques and then activated his General’s Seal, channeling the embedded martial strategies to bolster the entire army’s defenses.

Finally, he produced a command token. While tossing it out, he issued constant orders.

The formless power of the army promptly dragged cultivators one by one to the key positions —by force if necessary —to help complete the formation shift.

The ambushers had prepared countermeasures long in advance. A Nascent Soul cultivator among them reached into his bag and threw a handful of green beans into the air.

In the next moment, those beans turned into one green-turbaned strongman after another, dropping down from the sky and charging into the ranks of the Two-Note Nation’s troops.

The soldiers still wanted to shift formation, but that became impossible.

These green-turbaned strongmen were each as solid as green rock, incredibly tough, with formidable defenses. Unless they were dealt with, there was no way the transport convoy could complete its formation shift smoothly.

The escorts had no choice but to switch orders, deploying their elite forces to deal with the hulking green-turbaned strongmen.

A blind barbarian cultivator named Di Lu, the eccentric Wu Hen, and the spear-throwing Withering Poison General Diao Ye charged into the fray, converging on the Nascent Soul officer in charge of the convoy.

That officer blocked attack after attack, gradually falling behind. He continued funneling the army’s power into himself to withstand the siege. As a result, the army’s strength was mostly centered on him, weakening the support to the rank and file. Many soldiers died in the fierce fighting.

Sun Lingtong fixed his gaze on the battlefield. “Really? Has the Two-Note Nation not learned their lesson from the last ambush?”

No sooner had he spoken than two Nascent Soul cultivators descended from the sky.

“Criminals of Thousand Peaks Forest, I, Floating Cloud Master (and I, Mountain Peak Master), have been lying in wait for you!”

They spoke in unison, matching each other perfectly.

One cast cloud-based magic, unleashing pure white cloud-ropes that immobilized many of the green-turbaned strongmen, turning them into motionless targets.

The other gripped a small mountain-shaped magic treasure, repeatedly releasing grand mountain seals that forced back many barbarian cultivators.

Ning Zhuo’s eyes glinted. “Those two are well-known rogue cultivators from the Two-Note Nation, with formidable Nascent Soul-level strength. Looks like the military recruited them this time.”

Suffering defeat in a previous ambush, the Two-Note Nation learned its lesson. They valued the security of their supply lines and secretly paid a large sum to hire Floating Cloud Master and Mountain Peak Master, who were close friends.

Their fame was well-deserved.

These two were indeed powerful, and above all, they could cooperate seamlessly: one active, one passive, one soft, one hard. They could even combine their moves to unleash tremendous power.

Thousand Peaks Forest had no army of its own, relying instead on individual cultivators of high skill and power.

The Two-Note Nation’s transport convoy had been severely disrupted, struggling to shift formation.

Under such circumstances, it was the individual experts who decided the battlefield’s outcome.

A fierce struggle ensued.

Heaven and earth were thrown into turmoil, the sun and moon lost their light. The killing cries were deafening, and blood flowed until it gathered around the spears.

Both sides fought till the sky turned dark and the earth shook, gradually wearing themselves out. The ones who truly suffered were the ordinary soldiers, who died in droves from the shockwaves of these high-level clashes.

“It’s about time. Let’s move!” Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo had waited patiently. Seeing the timing was right, they sprang into action.

Earth Burrow Technique.

In the next instant, a huge, round stone sphere emerged from underground, arriving before a mechanical carriage.

Steal Technique —Material Snatch.

Everything inside the mechanical carriage was swiftly swallowed up by the stone sphere.

“Old Stone Monster?!” Both sides paused in shock.

“Perfect, Old Stone Monster is here to help us! Victory is assured, and we can smash all these supplies!” shouted Chen Lingfeng, the hawk-headed demon cultivator, releasing a wind blade as he spoke.

Yet in the next moment, that wind blade was destroyed by “Old Stone Monster.”

The creature growled, “Don’t ruin my business. You fight your fight.”

With that, it instantly looted the carriage that had just been targeted by the wind blade.

Chen Lingfeng was momentarily at a loss.

“Old Stone Monster came for the supplies?”

“Stop him, stop him now!”

The three Nascent Soul cultivators from the Two-Note Nation grew flustered.

Only they knew how immensely valuable the contents of these transports were!

But Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo controlled the stone sphere, which burrowed back underground.

The three Nascent Soul cultivators of the Two-Note Nation could not block it, so they could only turn and engage Thousand Peaks Forest’s forces again.

After succeeding the first time, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo lay low and waited.

When both sides were once again locked in brutal combat, “Old Stone Monster” resurfaced to loot another mechanical carriage.

“These are mechanical bases?”

“Wait, this…this is the Xuanyuan Nine-Work Platform?”

Ning Zhuo was dumbfounded!

Any Xuanyuan Nine-Work Platform was a Nascent Soul-level mechanical base.
