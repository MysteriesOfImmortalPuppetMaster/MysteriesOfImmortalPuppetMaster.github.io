Chapter 694: Xue Cainü and Xue Shuyu

Ning Zhuo also unearthed the Enlightenment Diagrams of Ling Shuang and Ao Xue.

He sighed, realizing he hadn't had time to study them.

"Hopefully, I'll find the time someday."

The most valuable items were undoubtedly Gao Sheng's Lost Writings and the Netherworld Penal Code.

At the bottom of the chest, Ning Zhuo discovered a Myriad Phenomena Cloud Seed, a relic from his time in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

The prisoners - Lin You, Wu Hen, and Bone Tomb Daoist - were hardly worth mentioning.

Oh, and there was the Heavenly Frost Ghost Mask. If used skillfully, it could unleash Nascent Soul-level combat power!

Ning Zhuo's expression turned peculiar. "Strange... why didn't I think to use it during the battle against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord?"

"Not just that, I seemed to have forgotten about the Milk Butterfly Lady too."

"Was it just the pressure of the moment?!"

Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes, unable to fathom why he had forgotten such crucial assets.

It was utterly baffling!

He only remembered them while reviewing his possessions.

Overall, Ning Zhuo's wealth was staggering. While not enough to rival an entire nation, it could certainly rival a prosperous town.

Towns typically formed around abundant cultivation resources, attracting cultivators to gather and settle.

At the same time, Ning Zhuo's assets were distributed in a highly skewed manner.

This was evident in several ways.

For instance, as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he should have primarily used Magic Artifacts. Magic treasures were difficult for cultivators at this stage to fully utilize.

Even Foundation Establishment geniuses like Lin Jinglong and Shen Xi, who received family support, possessed only two or three magic treasures.

Moreover, they rarely used these treasures in combat, typically reserving them to shift the tide of battle or deliver a decisive blow, providing significant assistance.

After all, the spiritual energy of a Foundation Establishment cultivator was rarely sufficient to power a magic treasure-level artifact.

Ning Zhuo, however, possessed an excessive number of magic treasures, most of which were used for cultivation. He had two defensive magic treasures but none for offense.

The vast majority of cultivators invested their resources in Medicinal Pills and talismans. The former were essential for cultivation, while the latter offered cost-effectiveness, providing a far more convenient alternative to painstakingly practicing spells.

Yet Ning Zhuo had invested the least in these two areas, having never made any significant investments in them.

His talismans, many of which were gifts from others, were all high-quality, some even imbued with spiritual energy.

He had little need for Medicinal Pills, thanks to his National Power Bricks and the personal chef he kept by his side. Both Spirit Food and National Power Bricks produced far fewer side effects than Medicinal Pills.

After examining his resources, Ning Zhuo grew wary. He murmured to himself, "I need to adjust my approach within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, focusing more on Medicinal Pills and talismans."

"For starters, acquiring a batch of pills and talismans for Physical Body cultivation would definitely enhance my physical foundation. This could quickly resolve the issue of my Soul overwhelming my body."

"My Spirit Stone reserves are dangerously low... I need to replenish them immediately!"

Ning Zhuo was once a man of immense wealth, but the battle at White Paper Immortal City had left him penniless.

Having finished his assessment, Ning Zhuo retrieved the Floating Ice White Jade Hand and the Weather Orb - Ice Crystal Snow.

The large-headed youth let out a wry smile. "My Ning Clan is renowned for its mastery of ice, yet I'm so inept in this area."

"I'm still too weak. There's so much I need to learn."

"To free Yuan Dasheng, I might have to rely on my clan members after all..."

The spiritual energy within the Floating Ice White Jade Hand originated from Ning Xiaohui. It had already reached full potency, possessing the Innate Talent: Ice-Jade Hand.

The spiritual energy within the Weather Orb - Ice Crystal Snow came from Ning Xie. In life, he had been a Clan Elder of the Ning Clan; in death, he became a Foundation Establishment Ghost Cultivator, hidden as the clan's hidden strength. He possessed the Innate Talent: Snow Soul Ice Essence, and his spiritual energy had long since reached full potency.

With such conditions, creating a Mechanical Puppet should have been possible long ago.

Ning Zhuo hadn't done so for two reasons.

First, what he had was sufficient.

The Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng and Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu served as his primary combat forces, proving their worth even in the battle against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

The Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin remained Ning Zhuo's ultimate trump card!

The Floating Ice White Jade Hand provided healing capabilities, while the Weather Orb - Ice Crystal Snow could be deployed to shape the battlefield, offering crucial support.

Second, Ning Zhuo lacked the design expertise.

Designing a Mechanical Puppet was an immense challenge.

Consider the Mechanical Fire Monkey. Ning Zhuo had secretly devoted countless hours and invested tremendous effort and resources into its creation. Only after countless iterations and adjustments did he finally produce a relatively refined prototype.

Yuan Dasheng's Mechanical Puppet hadn't materialized out of thin air. When designing its mechanical body, Ning Zhuo had built upon the foundation of the Fire Monkey and incorporated templates from the Lava Immortal Palace.

Even with these advantages, Yuan Dasheng's mechanical form underwent numerous refinements before evolving into the Armored Blood Ape configuration.

Simply designing a Mechanical Puppet was no small feat. The true difficulty lay in continuously refining it through practical use, adding or removing mechanical components, and constantly improving its design until it reached maturity.

Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin was created using the design templates from the Lava Immortal Palace, essentially standing on the shoulders of the three great sects.

Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu was a special case. During a period of extraordinary luck, Ning Zhuo stumbled upon scattered design fragments that unexpectedly combined into a complete blueprint.

As it turned out, this design was remarkably effective.

Ning Zhuo had been using this Meng Yehu model ever since.

Now, Ning Zhuo aimed to upgrade both constructs to full Mechanical Puppet forms, facing the daunting challenge of redesigning them.

Compared to his previous attempts, he felt far more confident.

The reason for this newfound confidence was simple: the Luoshu Pages.

This Dao Artifact, the source of all worldly mathematics, allowed Ning Zhuo to save vast amounts of time and energy. With its assistance, he was certain to arrive at the correct calculations.

"I need to design and construct these two Mechanical Puppets."

"Perhaps with their help, I can rescue Yuan Dasheng from the ice."

"Even if that fails..."

Even if that failed, they would still provide crucial reinforcements to Ning Zhuo's mechanical combat capabilities.

With Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin, Heavy Armored Blood Ape Dasheng, and Shadow Blade Night Tiger Yehu all absent, Ning Zhuo desperately needed additional Mechanical Puppets to fill the void.

Netherworld Envoy - Qi Bai was not up to the task.

Despite his powerful mechanical body, equipped with magic treasure-grade mechanical components, his Golden Core from his past life, and his innate talent, his spiritual energy had not reached full potential.

Moreover, Ning Zhuo's absence during his travels had further diminished Qi Bai's spiritual energy.

Achieving full spiritual energy marked a qualitative shift.

Below this threshold, spiritual energy would gradually erode over time. Once attained, however, even if damaged, it could regenerate on its own.

"Boss, help me!" Ning Zhuo immediately transmitted a mental message to Sun Lingtong through the Life Hanging by a Thread connection.

Sun Lingtong, deeply immersed in studying the Formation Dao using the Luoshu Pages, was annoyed by the interruption. "What is it now?"

Ning Zhuo didn't immediately propose the Mechanical Puppet plan. Instead, he brought up another matter first: "Boss, I just reviewed my assets and made a startling discovery."

"Remember the Heavenly Frost Ghost Mask and the Milk Butterfly Lady?"

"During the battle with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, I completely forgot about these invaluable combat assets! That's highly unusual!"

Netherworld Envoy - Qi Bai was a different matter.

His spiritual energy was insufficient, so even if Ning Zhuo used him, he would have to control him personally.

Moreover, his combat strength was concentrated in the Soul Dao, making him a risky choice against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord or the Imperial Guard - a case of "teaching a master craftsman his own trade."

Sun Lingtong's expression turned grave, his eyes flickering with uncertainty. "Little Zhuo, you're right!"

"It's a bit frightening."

"I knew about them too, but I'd completely forgotten! I couldn't even warn you."

"Strange... this is too strange."

"Could it be... Qi Luck at work?"

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. Sun Lingtong had voiced his own suspicion - he believed the same.

"I'm the savior of White Paper Immortal City, sent here by Yang Heaven."

"Perhaps these two would bring me more harm than good. Under the influence of Qi Luck, I might have simply forgotten them entirely."

The two discussed the matter further, but their conversation yielded no conclusions. Instead, it only deepened their longing for the art of Qi Luck divination!

"I really want to learn that kind of legacy..."

"But my mother told me it would be incredibly difficult to obtain... sigh."

Sun Lingtong: "Alright, what did you want to see me about?"

Ning Zhuo explained his purpose.

Sun Lingtong immediately agreed without hesitation. He possessed some skill in Mechanical Arts, though not as much as Ning Zhuo.

In array formation, Ning Zhuo was similarly less skilled than Sun Lingtong.

Working together and aided by the Luoshu Pages, the two quickly produced a draft design.

Ning Zhuo, following the blueprint like a prescription, sent Old Chef and Gongsun Yan to procure the necessary precious materials.

Lacking sufficient Spirit Stones, Ning Zhuo first retrieved three Ghost Path Golden Cores and exchanged them at the Universal Commerce Hall for the required funds.

Observing Ning Zhuo's extensive purchases, Gongsun Yan guessed his intentions and volunteered, "Young Master, are you planning to refine artifacts? Though my skills are modest, I would be honored to contribute my humble efforts."

After considering Gongsun Yan's offer, Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. "Very well. I'll assign you some tasks. You can handle the refinement."

Gongsun Yan received the blueprints, his expression shifting with surprise. So, the Young Master intends to craft mechanical components. Does he also study Mechanism Art?

This cultivation technique is rare and notoriously difficult to master. Why would the Young Master be interested in it?

"But it seems his Innate Magic Fan incorporates some Mechanism Art techniques?"

Gongsun Yan couldn't quite grasp it. In his view, Ning Zhuo's mastery of the Five Elements was unfathomably profound, and such a bright future lay on the Righteous Path.

Mechanism Art seemed too niche.

Yet these doubts didn't hinder Gongsun Yan's full commitment.

"This is the Young Master's first task for me. I must give it my all and achieve perfection!"

He reviewed the Mechanism blueprints repeatedly, first selecting the Warm Jade Wheel for refinement.

Gongsun Yan's refinement process differed from the norm.

He first forged a rough blank, then placed it within the Melting Furnace Artifact.

Pressing his palm against the furnace wall, he channeled spiritual energy and his Innate Talent, transforming them into a gentle Heartfire that enveloped the jade wheel blank.

Heartfire excelled at precision work. Under Gongsun Yan's skilled manipulation, the Warm Jade Wheel blank was meticulously carved and refined.

Gongsun Yan retrieved Cold Steel and tossed it into the furnace.

Immediately, he formed a sword-like gesture with his fingers and swiftly pointed into the Void.

The Cold Steel melted and fused onto the Warm Jade Wheel, forming a honeycomb-like grid.

The Heartfire remained wrapped around the Warm Jade Wheel. Any excess Cold Steel was precisely burned away.

Gongsun Yan successively added three precious materials to the furnace.

The materials melted together, forming a unified, multicolored glaze. This glaze dripped onto the honeycomb grid, creating a three-colored enamel.

Gongsun Yan channeled his Heartfire into the Warm Jade Wheel, burning three hundred and sixty microscopic holes within it.

With this step complete, he infused the wheel with his divine sense, forcefully drawing the enamel glaze through the tiny holes and deep into the jade.

Finally, the Warm Jade Wheel emerged from the furnace.

It floated in mid-air, slowly rotating. The outer ring shimmered with swirling frost-like patterns of the three-colored enamel, while warm smoke billowed from the three hundred and sixty holes in the inner ring.

Exhausted but satisfied, Gongsun Yan declared, "This is the most intricate piece I've ever crafted. I wonder what kind of mechanism the Young Master will assemble with it?"

Gongsun Yan possessed extensive experience in Artifact Refinement. Though he lacked expertise in Mechanism Art, his keen eye for detail allowed him to recognize the rarity of such finely crafted mechanical components. Moreover, the use of two Golden Core-level precious materials as the primary components suggested that the final mechanical construct would also be at the Golden Core level.

"The Young Master and I are both Foundation Establishment cultivators," Gongsun Yan mused. "Attempting to create a Golden Core-level mechanism... Can we truly succeed?"

"Regardless of success or failure, this undertaking is truly grand!"

After resting for over two hours, Gongsun Yan had fully restored himself to peak condition.

Sundial Pillar. He began refining the next mechanical component, named Cold.

Three days later, Gongsun Yan presented Ning Zhuo with five completed mechanical components.

Ning Zhuo inspected them thoroughly and smiled with satisfaction.

Looking up at the utterly exhausted Gongsun Yan, he said warmly, "As expected of Heartfire. It's perfectly suited for crafting such intricate artifacts. Thank you for saving me considerable effort."

Gongsun Yan hastily demurred, saying he was delighted to contribute his skills.

Ning Zhuo nodded and urged him to rest well.

Disappointed at not seeing Ning Zhuo assemble the mechanism, Gongsun Yan obediently withdrew.

During those three days, Ning Zhuo utilized the three Mechanism Platforms to fabricate the remaining mechanical components.

Within the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon, two rudimentary Mechanical Puppets were already taking shape. They only lacked the assembly of their crucial components.

Soon, the assembly was complete. Ning Zhuo then used Life Hanging by a Thread to extract two wisps of spiritual energy and inserted them into their respective mechanical bodies.

In the next moment, the mechanical components activated one after another, and the two Mechanical Puppets... came to life.

The puppet on the left stood six feet three inches tall, with a slender, graceful figure and feminine features. Her body was covered in tri-colored Enamel Glaze armor, her face a mask of snow-white porcelain, and her dark hair woven from ice silk. Beneath her primary arms were two additional pairs of secondary hands.

Snow-Colored Lady Hui!

The puppet on the right was also six feet tall, though slightly shorter than Snow-Colored Lady Hui. She too had a feminine form, wearing an ice-mirror helmet designed for reconnaissance. Her hexagonal Profound Ice armor resembled interlocking honeycomb cells, with shoulder guards shaped like roaring ice dragons whose eyes were inlaid with aurora-glazed gems that could unleash freezing blasts.

Six mechanical orbs hovered around her, their cold steel surfaces covered in ice crystal spiderweb patterns. These orbs could spew icy currents and summon blizzards.

Snow Pivot Guard Xie!

Snow-Colored Lady Hui lowered her head, examining her hands - first her primary hands, then her two pairs of secondary hands - as they moved in alternating motions.

Snow Pivot Guard Xie, meanwhile, scanned her surroundings before fixing her gaze on Ning Zhuo.

She slowly lowered herself into a bow, her voice taking on the tone of an older woman as she said, "Greetings... Clan Leader."
