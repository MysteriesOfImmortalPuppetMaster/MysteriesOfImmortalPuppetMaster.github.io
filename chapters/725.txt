Chapter 725: The Great Utility of the Soul-Searching Art

Demon Cultivators are creatures of pure natural instinct.

Their most primal instinct is survival.

From the very beginning, regardless of the life form, the instinct for survival is deeply rooted in their bones, an overwhelming force. In other words, to survive, every living being will exhaust every possible means, and even as Demon Cultivators, they are capable of any act.

Rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame are meaningless.

As long as it secures their survival, Demon Cultivators will pay any price.

This was perfectly exemplified by Lady Spiderweb. After realizing her advantage in beauty, she altered her cultivation methods, repeatedly exploiting her charm to seduce others and improve her life.

Was she wrong to do so?

In Ning Zhuo's view: "Without life, what meaning can principles hold? Survival transcends right and wrong!"

As for sacrificing oneself for righteousness?

Ning Zhuo had recently been studying Confucianism and understood the concept, yet he couldn't fully accept it at his core.

"For my mother and my elder brother, I would gladly sacrifice myself. But for others, or for any other reason, I would never make such a foolish choice."

Without life, how can one pursue the Dao?

Life is the foundation of everything.

Survival is the ultimate justification.

Therefore, Ning Zhuo felt no aversion to Lady Spiderweb's shifting allegiances. He readily accepted her change of heart.

Her attitude shifted.

My cultivation level and age are insufficient to command respect.

If my battle records were exposed, the world would not judge me by ordinary standards.

Lady Spiderweb obtained her information about me from Ban Ji, whose knowledge was incomplete. In fact, when I dealt with Pi Fudong, I wasn't facing Pi Lidong himself, but rather the Tiger Demon he had recently recruited.

Lady Spiderweb possesses late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation and considerable strength. Though a rogue cultivator, she has enjoyed numerous opportunities in her life. For a renowned cultivator like her, the first instinct isn't surrender, but confrontation.

Lady Spiderweb's ability to "play" with Ban Ji and her willingness to accept his generous offer prove she is no weakling.

Ning Zhuo remained expressionless as he watched Lady Spiderweb kneel on the ground, begging for mercy.

His eyes probed her true nature, extending his analysis to the Demon Cultivator community as a whole.

After Lady Spiderweb pleaded for some time, Ning Zhuo finally spoke: "Very well. I'll give you one last chance. Tell me everything you know about Ban Ji's plans against me."

Lady Spiderweb's face lit up with relief, and she nodded eagerly.

She revealed the truth to Ning Zhuo, holding nothing back. She detailed not only Ban Ji's elaborate schemes against him, but also shared her previous collaborations with him.

Lady Spiderweb explained Ban Ji's plans to counter Ning Zhuo's preparations, revealing their past collaborations.

Ning Zhuo looked at her. "So, you and Ban Ji never signed any confidentiality agreements?"

Lady Spiderweb nodded. "Please forgive this servant, Young Master. I chose to fabricate those claims out of fear for my own safety."

"We four are Ban Ji's equals. There's no reason for us to sign confidentiality agreements for his sake."

"If we were to break such an agreement, we would face severe consequences, while Ban Ji would only lose a bit of face."

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, gaining a deeper understanding of the Demonic Cultivators' nature.

"Lady Spiderweb, Rust Disaster Craftsman, Delusional Monk, Liu Qingyan... Ban Ji hired these four at great expense to entangle me with sound-based attacks. Meanwhile, he seized the opportunity to participate in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, which suits him perfectly. This is undoubtedly the most effective strategy."

Having already demonstrated his mastery of the Soul-Searching Art, Ning Zhuo found Lady Spiderweb's candid confession largely credible.

"This time it's Che Zhuzi. According to Lady Spiderweb, he's Ban Ji's next target."

"Adding him to Qing Huangzi... I've thwarted his plans twice now."

"This feud is deepening."

Despite having gained the upper hand twice in succession, Ning Zhuo felt no complacency.

Ban Ji's very choice to retreat revealed his exceptional composure and strategic foresight.

Ning Zhuo's current favorable position was partly due to Ban Ji's lack of time to deal with him.

Moreover, Ban Ji had never been a rogue cultivator; he had the Ban Clan standing behind him!

Ban Ji cultivates a Demonic Path Cultivation Art instead of the Ban Clan's ancestral technique. He's an exception. How much support does he truly receive from within the clan?

To confront Ban Ji, Ning Zhuo had to consider the Ban Clan.

The Rising Cloud Minor Trial is crucial for newcomers. I need to actively disrupt Ban Ji's plans so that even if he joins the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he'll struggle to gain a foothold.

Ideally, I could force him out entirely, preventing him from joining the sect. But that's highly unlikely.

Secretly assessing the difficulty, Ning Zhuo concluded that his most realistic outcome was to suppress Ban Ji.

Having entered the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main gate, Ning Zhuo had participated in multiple Rising Cloud Minor Trials. Now, a true enemy had emerged.

Yu Heye, Lin Jinglong, Che Zhuzi, and even Lady Spiderweb - none of them had been genuine enemies. Their conflicts with Ning Zhuo could all be resolved.

Ban Ji was different, at least for now.

As a Mechanism Cultivator, the Rising Cloud Minor Trials he sought to participate in were precisely the ones Ning Zhuo also desired.

This vividly illustrates the truth of the saying, "There are many paths to the same destination."

Ning Zhuo asked Lady Spiderweb, "Do you know if Ban Ji has any other schemes against me besides hiring you four?"

Lady Spiderweb shook her head, earnestly denying any knowledge. Fearing Ning Zhuo's suspicion, she swore on the altar that she was telling the truth.

Ning Zhuo remained noncommittal, falling into deep thought.

Lady Spiderweb is likely telling the truth. With my Soul Search technique, I could easily verify her claims.

Now that she's at my mercy, there's no reason for her to risk deceiving me here. It would be pointless.

Even if she doesn't know Ban Ji's next move, it doesn't matter.

First, I can dispatch others to closely monitor Ban Ji and gather intelligence. Second, I can scour all the Rising Cloud Minor Trials within the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Any trials related to Mechanism Art could be Ban Ji's targets.

Ban Ji's ambush had caught Ning Zhuo off guard, but he was not one to passively accept defeat. He immediately began plotting his counterattack.

Doesn't Confucianism emphasize, "To receive without returning is contrary to Rites?"

Ban Ji's actions, though seemingly a setback, are actually an opportunity.

With his strength as his foundation, Ning Zhuo quickly analyzed the situation and concluded that retaliating against Ban Ji would be far more meaningful.

My true test will come from the Myriad Manifestations Sect's higher-ups, particularly City Lord Kai Yongzi, who will likely target me directly.

Wen Ruanyu protected me and Cai Wo by concealing the truth, but this couldn't last. He even enlisted the Puppet Cultivators to help me establish my reputation.

The Confucian cultivators' Rising Cloud Minor Trial has already completed two rounds, but there should be more to come.

With the assistance of the Servant Cultivators, I can gain renown and make a dazzling debut within the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Building on this foundation, if I can decisively crush Ban Ji, it would be the perfect finishing touch, further enhancing my external deterrent power.

Originally, Ning Zhuo could only defend passively. But his sudden breakthrough in the Soul-Searching Art had caused his learning ability to skyrocket dozens of times, an utterly absurd improvement.

As a result, he now had ample reserves of energy. Not only could he handle the ongoing Rising Cloud Minor Trial with ease, but he also had surplus strength for external conquests.

The Ban Clan is renowned throughout Flying Cloud Country.

Defeating Ban Ji would be the perfect way to establish my authority!

At this thought, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but chuckle softly.

Lady Spiderweb, ever observant, keenly noticed the cold, battle-ready glint in Ning Zhuo's smile and tensed up, fearing he might use the Dream Essence Rolling Manifestation Art on her.

Having made up his mind, Ning Zhuo turned his gaze back to Lady Spiderweb.

Unable to meet his eyes, Lady Spiderweb quickly lowered her head, staring at the floor tiles. Her posture had shifted from kneeling to both knees on the ground, adopting an utterly submissive posture, as if awaiting his judgment.

Ning Zhuo said calmly, "Lady Spiderweb, you are a Demonic Cultivator, bearing the Sinful Rong. However, your willingness to confess your crimes is commendable, so I will give you a chance.

"You possess some skill in setting up formations. Go to the cabin and arrange a Formation there. I intend to plant Literary Pines and Martial Pines there."

This plan had been brewing since Ning Zhuo mastered the Pine Wave Qi Nurturing Art.

Among Ning Zhuo's current subordinates, Qing Chi suffered from amnesia but excelled in military formations. Old Chef was loyal and skilled in cooking, while Arena Master was adept at preparing meals. Gongsun Yan, indebted to Ning Zhuo, was a master of Torch Artifacts.

What he lacked was a Formation expert.

Lady Spiderweb's surrender immediately filled this void.

Lady Spiderweb breathed a sigh of relief and immediately pledged to devote her full efforts to completing the task.

Ning Zhuo then tucked her into the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon at his waist, carrying her with him and monitoring her movements at all times.

After settling Lady Spiderweb, Ning Zhuo rose to his feet and surveyed the empty Formation space.

Spiritual Energy Threads.

In the next moment, ten threads of spiritual energy extended from the tips of his fingers. Woven from the Five Elements spiritual energy, they shimmered in swirling, multicolored patterns.

Ning Zhuo probed his storage ring with his Divine Sense and casually waved his hand, releasing a large number of small bamboo slips.

As the bamboo slips floated in mid-air, Ning Zhuo's Five Elements spiritual energy threads, like nimble serpents, precisely fastened themselves to each one.

Bamboo Buddhas.

The remaining bamboo pieces tumbled to the ground, but ten of them remained suspended in mid-air, tethered by threads of spiritual energy.

Each of these miniature Bamboo Buddhas carried a Primal Sound and a fragment - preparations Ning Zhuo had made for Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

Ning Zhuo manipulated the ten figures simultaneously using his spiritual energy threads.

The ten Bamboo Buddhas hung in the air, performing a variety of movements.

After a dozen breaths, their motions grew increasingly swift and precise.

"Effortless - far easier than before!" Ning Zhuo observed intently, a faint sense of joy stirring within him.

Earlier, he had extracted Lady Spiderweb's Three Souls, crafted a Soul Cloth, and then used the Burning Boat Soul Crossing Technique to incinerate the cloth, retrieving a wealth of memories.

Under the Dream Boat Soul Rolling Technique, Ning Zhuo had felt as if he had become Lady Spiderweb herself, his mastery over spider silk surging dramatically.

Lady Spiderweb's true form was that of a spider, and manipulating silk was as natural to her as humans using their limbs.

This time, when Ning Zhuo wielded his spiritual energy threads, he immediately reaped the benefits!

The slightest flick, pluck, snatch, or press of his fingertips felt like stimulating a nerve in his own body. The threads of spiritual energy had become extensions of his will, granting him the same intuitive control as moving his own fingers.

The ten bamboo figurines also benefited from this, moving with lifelike agility under Ning Zhuo's control, far surpassing their previous responsiveness. Their movements were now rich in detail and nuance.

For an ordinary person to achieve this level of control, it would take at least a decade of arduous practice.

Yet I've accomplished it with a single session of cultivation!

The Soul-Crossing Boat Technique... this is the advantage of Demonic Cultivators. Their methods are unorthodox and often come with severe side effects, but their cultivation progress is undeniably rapid.

Each subtle shift in Ning Zhuo's thoughts was instantly reflected in the movement of the spiritual energy threads. Varying degrees of force, speed, and urgency were all manifested through the threads, allowing him to control them as naturally as breathing.

Now, what's next...?

Ning Zhuo's fingers twitched slightly. The single spiritual energy threads extending from each fingertip suddenly split, doubling in number.

In an instant, he now wielded twenty Five Elements spiritual energy threads.

The ten newly created threads connected to the bamboo figurines on the ground, animating them to stand and move about.

As if imbued with life, the bamboo figurines scurried, rolled, and played across the ground.

Ning Zhuo's fingers occasionally trembled, curled inward, or retracted, deftly and swiftly commanding the twenty threads.

Just one use of the Soul-Crossing Boat Technique - burning a mere fragment of Soul Cloth - has saved me at least five years of grueling practice! Ning Zhuo mused.

Ning Zhuo grew increasingly delighted with his progress.

As his ten fingers danced across the bamboo slips, the miniature figures moved with lifelike fluidity, scattering and regrouping like playful children at play.

Whenever Ning Zhuo focused intently on complex manipulations, the little fingers of both his hands would subtly curl upward.

This frequent, unconscious gesture caught Ning Zhuo's attention.

After a moment's reflection, he realized its origin: "This is a habit Lady Spiderweb developed while manipulating her silk threads - a delicate orchid-finger movement."

On Lady Spiderweb, the gesture exuded a seductive charm. But on Ning Zhuo, it appeared awkward and incongruous.

Ning Zhuo himself felt a sense of unease.

"Still, it's manageable," he thought. "This habit can be corrected."

"The solution is simple enough: find a Spider Demon, extract and burn its soul. That should quickly diminish the influence."

"Even without that, given enough time and willpower, I could break this habit on my own."

Ning Zhuo gathered his bamboo slip figures and retrieved the Cai Tiehan Armor and Golden Swallow Trident, donning them.

He activated the Mechanical Armor, causing the twin wings on its back to unfurl and soar into the Void.

This time, his focus was entirely on the golden, shimmering wings.

With each flap, the mechanical stiffness of before vanished, replaced by a fluid, graceful motion, imbued with a natural beauty. They moved as if they were truly the wings of a bird.

"Excellent!" Ning Zhuo murmured in admiration.

His previous Soul Search of Lingfeng had proven invaluable. After all, flight was essential for a bird.

"If I use the Burning Boat Soul Crossing Technique, the progress will be even more dramatic!"

Ning Zhuo had mastered the Soul Reception Techniques and applied them in practice, reaping tremendous benefits.

Compared to these, the Burning Boat Soul Crossing Technique was undeniably the most effective. Other Soul-Searching Arts served only as auxiliary methods.

For example, the Three Souls Spinning Wheel Technique was designed to complement the Burning Boat Soul Crossing Technique, allowing a soul to repeatedly provide experience and memories.

Ning Zhuo resolved to make full use of the Burning Boat Soul Crossing Technique!
