Chapter 827: Crushing Learning

Ning Zhuo flipped through Shen Xi's class notes. It was simply clear at a glance, smooth sailing, and flowing without obstruction; there were absolutely no obstacles to speak of.

Not only that.

Ning Zhuo also saw follow-up content not recorded in these notes.

For example, "Fixed Calculation."

Shen Xi only wrote "deduce by fixed logic," but Ning Zhuo now "saw" that the so-called Fixed Calculation was actually pre-deducing every variation of the Nine Palace Formation and carving it into the Formation Core. The Formation Core was like a thick book of formation charts; when encountering a situation, one just flipped to the corresponding page. This method was stable and reliable, but the variations were limited.

For example, "Variable Calculation."

Shen Xi only wrote "adapt to real-time opportunity," but Ning Zhuo now "saw" that the so-called Variable Calculation was to let the Formation Core possess the ability of autonomous deduction. The Formation Core no longer relied on preset formation charts but deduced the best plan on the spot based on the real-time situation. This method was flexible and varied, but the requirements for the Formation Core were extremely high.

It is worth mentioning that these things were not learned from the memories or experiences of other Demonic Cultivators, nor were they seen in other classics. They were simply derived, calculated, and summarized by himself through extending existing knowledge.

The memories and experiences of the Demonic Cultivators were almost all about how to break through Killing Formations and Trapping Formations, how to avoid being trapped, how to crack defensive formations, and so on. Even if they could set up formations, they were usually just basic ones like Spirit Gathering Formations.

Currently, Ning Zhuo had not yet collected the soul of a Demonic Cultivator who was skilled in formations during their lifetime.

Ning Zhuo opened the large number of formation classics that Shen Xi had lent him not long ago.

He saw various variations of the Nine Palace Formation charts.

In the past, he found these dazzling and didn't know where to start. He had to study them patiently, and his speed was slow.

But looking at them now, those patterns suddenly became clear.

He "saw" that the patterns in every palace actually had laws. Some patterns gathered spiritual energy, some transported it, some stored it, and some released it. These patterns performed their respective duties without interfering with each other, yet they cooperated closely.

He "saw" that countless tiny silk threads connected the Nine Palaces. These threads were the formation lines, the channels through which the Nine Palaces echoed each other. Some threads were thick, some were thin; some were straight, some were curved. The thick ones transported more energy, the thin ones less; the straight ones transmitted faster, the curved ones slower.

These "sights" were partly due to the introductions and records in the formation charts, but the greater part was what Ning Zhuo actively comprehended.

And this comprehension came more from a certain "intuition," rather than being deduced based on abundant experience, memory, and precise logic.

One of the characteristics of the Master realm was the generation of relevant "intuition."

Such a formation realm was even higher than Shen Xi's, directly "crushing" his formation classics.

Ning Zhuo continued to flip through.

Those concepts that used to require repeated deliberation were now understood at a glance; those formation charts that required repeated scrutiny were now clear immediately; those results that required repeated calculation came out instantly, fast and accurate.

From a commanding height!

Ning Zhuo's current feeling was like a great Confucian scholar studying a primer from a neighboring country. Even though it was his first time reading it, he could still easily see through it.

He flipped through quickly and saw the Fixed Style basics.

There were a total of eighty-one Fixed Styles. He had only mastered three before, and each one took a long time to figure out. But now, he took them all in at a glance, and his understanding and memorization of each did not exceed thirty breaths.

By the time he read twenty or so, he had already deduced the remaining forty.

When he had accumulated sixty Fixed Styles, he let out an "Oh" in his heart; he already understood the remaining Fixed Styles clearly. Next, his Divine Sense swept over them, and sure enough, they were exactly as he had deduced.

"The eighty-one Fixed Styles all have their own laws. A total of... nine types. They can be set as: One White, Two Black, Three Jade, Four Green, Five Yellow, Six White, Seven Red, Eight White, Nine Purple. Each color corresponds to nine variations. Nine times nine is eighty-one, no more, no less, corresponding to the eighty-one Fixed Styles."

Ning Zhuo summarized the laws himself.

"There are also connections between the Fixed Styles. For example, the nine variations of One White can derive the three variations of Two Black; the nine variations of Two Black can derive the six variations of Three Jade. Layer upon layer, linked like rings."

"Just mastering all these Fixed Styles allows one to combine a massive amount of changes. Just like the Nine Palace Formation itself, the Nine Palaces echo each other, with myriad changes."

Ning Zhuo suddenly thought of what Shen Xi had said during their previous exchange: "Fixed Styles and Variable Styles are, to some extent, consistent. A proficient Fixed Style can be considered a Variable Style."

Variable Styles do not come out of thin air but are derived from Fixed Styles. Only by deeply understanding Fixed Styles can one truly master Variable Styles.

Just like Ning Zhuo at this moment; although he hadn't learned those Variable Styles yet, because he understood the laws of the Fixed Styles and deeply mastered the eighty-one Fixed Styles, he could already deduce many Variable Styles relying solely on himself.

Ning Zhuo read faster and faster.

Volume One, Nine Palace Foundation Detailed Explanation, finished in half an incense stick of time.

Volume Two, Nine Palace Calculation Method, finished in half an incense stick of time.

Volume Three, Nine Palace Formation Chart Collection, finished in one incense stick of time.

Volume Four, Volume Five, Volume Six...

One by one, the classics were opened by him; page by page, the content was absorbed. Those words, those formation charts, those formulas flowed into his mind like water, and were quickly digested, organized, and absorbed by him.

He seemed to have turned into a dried sponge, greedily absorbing all moisture.

Time passed unknowingly.

First watch.

Second watch.

Third watch.

Ning Zhuo was completely immersed in the ocean of learning, forgetting time, forgetting fatigue, forgetting everything.

"Nine Palace Calculation uses the Nine Palaces as the board, the Nine Stars as the pieces, and the Formation Core as the hand. The Nine Stars place pieces, the Formation Core deduces. One piece falls and the Nine Palaces move; one piece shifts and myriad phenomena are born..."

When reading this passage, a memory in Ning Zhuo's Divine Sea was triggered.

This was not his memory, but one from a low-level Demonic Cultivator who researched formations.

The Demonic Cultivator studied Dynamic Formations and borrowed theories from the Nine Palace Formation. He set up formations like deploying troops and calculated like drilling soldiers.

He treated the Nine Stars as "soldiers" to better understand the coordination between them; he treated the Formation Core as the "general" to better understand its command function.

"Interesting. Although this understanding is biased, it is not entirely without reason."

A small fragment of memory allowed Ning Zhuo to understand the Nine Palace Formation faster and more profoundly from another angle. It also allowed him to extend the scope of application from the Nine Palace Formation as the origin to Battle Formations and Dynamic Formations.

Although the Demonic Souls he absorbed did not have profound attainments in setting up formations, their life experiences were overly rich, and there were always various trigger points connecting to other cultivation fields.

Such scenes happened from time to time.

During the process of studying various classics, the various Demonic Souls Ning Zhuo absorbed also served as a textbook with very rich content.

Ning Zhuo's Divine Sense stopped on a formation chart.

"Nine Palace Trapping Dragon Formation," this was a variation of the Nine Palace Formation.

The Nine Palace Trapping Dragon Formation used the Nine Palaces as the base and entrapment as the function. Each of the Nine Palaces had a trap set; the nine traps were linked and echoed each other. Those who entered the formation were like falling into nine layers of hell, trapped layer by layer, unable to escape...

Ning Zhuo frowned slightly; he found a tiny flaw in this formation chart.

"Can it be improved?"

Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.

After just a dozen breaths, he had a method for improvement. Consuming Divine Sense and spiritual energy, he recorded the improvement method on the side.

Ning Zhuo opened another volume of classics, titled Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Combined Theory.

This book discussed the combination of the Nine Palace Formation and the Eight Trigrams Formation. The opening chapter wrote: "The Nine Palaces govern numbers, the Eight Trigrams govern positions. When numbers and positions combine, the formation is achieved. The Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation takes the mathematical principles of the Nine Palaces and matches them with the directions of the Eight Trigrams, forming the potential of the intersection of Heaven and Earth..."

He was immersed in it, and a segment of his memory was touched and surfaced.

This was no longer a Demonic Soul's memory, but content regarding Buddhist formations among the various foundations Ning Zhuo had learned and memorized in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

"Buddhist formations emphasize 'Unity of Heart and Formation' - the formation setter merges with the formation; the formation is my heart, and my heart is the formation. Therefore, Buddhist formations are thought to be the fastest to set up."

"This concept actually coincides with the Formation Core in the Nine Palaces."

Actually, the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Combined Theory and this realization of Ning Zhuo's had little correlation. But continuous, deep learning kept Ning Zhuo's thoughts active. Various thoughts rose and fell in his Divine Sea, leading to more inspiration being triggered the further he went.

Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual!

Although this cultivation method excelled in communication and control and was a technique exclusive to Mechanism Cultivators, it ultimately greatly deepened Ning Zhuo's Divine Sea foundation. If it were another cultivator who did not cultivate or dual-cultivate the Divine Sea, unless they used other means, they would not be able to maintain such a level of consumption as Ning Zhuo at all.

Time continued to pass.

Volumes of classics were opened by Ning Zhuo, and pages of content were absorbed by him. He was completely immersed in it, almost unable to extricate himself.

Sometimes, he would frown when encountering a contradiction or discovering an error.

Sometimes, he would suddenly smile because he understood some complex content or solved some confusion.

Sometimes, he would suddenly stop and close his eyes in deep thought. That was him deducing a certain formation in his mind or verifying a certain idea.

Sometimes, he would suddenly open his eyes and extend his finger to build a formation in the void. That was him having new inspiration and making various new attempts.

By the time the large number of classics Shen Xi lent to Ning Zhuo were all read once by him, Ning Zhuo looked dazed for a moment before reacting.

"Finished learning?"

His mind was exhausted, his eyes were dim. Due to intense mental exertion, his cheeks were flushed red, and bursts of white steam rose from his forehead.

As soon as he let go, the blood-stained wooden cone in his hand fell onto the floor tiles. While studying, he had also employed the two Confucian techniques of "suspending the head from a beam" and "piercing the thigh with a cone" to empower himself.

He pushed open the door of the cultivation room and immediately summoned Old Chef.

While serving the Spirit Food, the latter also told Ning Zhuo: "Young Master, your seclusion this time has lasted for one day and two nights."

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, ate the Spirit Food, and made up for it with a long sleep.

His physical body and soul foundations played their role again. When he woke up, his mind became agile again, and his eyes held a divine light.

He closed his eyes, and countless knowledge related to the Nine Palace Formation floated in his Divine Sea, along with various insights, a large number of laws he had summarized, experiences, and so on.

Just a small seclusion, and the big-headed boy's understanding of the Nine Palace Formation could no longer be mentioned in the same breath.

The knowledge in those classics had all been absorbed and digested by him, integrated into his own formation dao system. The memories of many Demonic Cultivators were also borrowed and merged, becoming his own foundation.

His current understanding of the Nine Palace Formation was no less than Shen Xi's. In some aspects, he might have already surpassed Shen Xi.

"As long as I learn more high-end knowledge, surpassing Shen Xi is a certainty."

Ning Zhuo knew that Shen Xi was stuck at the sixth curve, which showed that his formation realm definitely had not reached the Master level.

To be honest, with the help of Sun Lingtong's true intent, Ning Zhuo leaping to the Master level formation realm in one fell swoop had also exceeded Ning Zhuo's expectations.

"I didn't expect Boss to have such profound accumulation in the cultivation art of setting up formations!"

Ning Zhuo decided to make large-scale purchases and acquire high-level classics regarding the Dao of Formations from the Commerce Hall.

As for the Nine Curves Corridor Formation, Ning Zhuo already fully understood all the mysteries of the first three curves. He even had conjectures about the subsequent ones.

"But to break the formation, I'm still missing some magic artifacts and magic treasures."

Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo took out the Formation Gap-Roaming Shuttle.

This magic treasure was three inches and seven fen long, with green jade as the bone and star sand flowing inside. Cloud and water return patterns were incised on the shuttle body, and the head and tail were inlaid with Chiwen eyes, capable of shooting green-white rays of light. The handle was wrapped with a circle of deep blue rattan skin, while the tail was decorated with Five Elements Barrier-Breaking Silk Tassels.

This was originally Shen Xi's magic treasure, but he gave it to Ning Zhuo. Sun Lingtong liked it, so Ning Zhuo gave it to him.

However, now, in order for Ning Zhuo to practice breaking formations, this magic treasure had returned to his hands.

Sun Lingtong had once relied on the Formation Gap-Roaming Shuttle to crack the Thousand Vine Drinking Cloud Formation, thereby successfully infiltrating the Shuyu Studio.

But having the Formation Gap-Roaming Shuttle alone was not enough.

This time, Ning Zhuo decided to personally go to the Commerce Hall to make some purchases.

Revelation Talisman.

Activating the talisman can reveal the location of the formation eye.

Formation Fixing Stake.

The stake body is engraved with suppression runes. As long as it is nailed into the formation base, it can lock the flow of the formation at that location.

Source Severing Axe.

One chop can sever the connection between the formation eye and the formation source.

...

Ning Zhuo returned with a full load.

After he left, the cultivators who saw this scene whispered among themselves.

"Ning Zhuo didn't hesitate to spend such heavy funds to invest in formations; what is he after?"

"He was valued by Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang, yet he turned around to participate in the formation trial and returned in a crushing defeat. I really don't know what he's thinking."

"A foot may prove short, while an inch may prove long. He should understand such a principle! Could it be he still wants to have achievements and perform excellently in all aspects? Hehe, how is that possible?!"
