Chapter 546: Metal Path Lung Temple

Today was the appointed day.

A Ten Thousand Li Traversing dragon soared through the void and arrived near the frontline camp of the Twin Rivers Nation.

Soon, Ning Zhuo contacted Liu Er.

“Advisor, we meet again!” Liu Er, upon meeting Ning Zhuo again, enthusiastically grabbed Ning Zhuo’s arm, his eyes welling up with emotion.

“Since the battle of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, I have thought of you day and night, Advisor; today, upon seeing you, you appear even thinner. Please take good care of your health.”

Ning Zhuo nodded, and with both hands he also grabbed Liu Er’s arm, moved as he said, “General, you worry about me; what virtue or ability do I possess?! To encounter a General in Twin Rivers Nation is the fortune and destiny of a little fellow like me!”

“In this bag there are two hundred thousand mid-grade spirit stones; give them to the General, to serve as military supplies!”

Liu Er immediately became energized, and took the bag full of spirit stones, saying, “Without the Advisor’s support, the Three-General Camp would have long collapsed!”

Ning Zhuo said, “Without the assistance of the Three-Generals Camp and the three Generals, I would not have come this far.”

Liu Er also took out a storage bag, “This is a reward obtained through our battle merits. Zhao Xi originally wanted to put the Advisor in a bind; he was very much opposed to the Advisor not returning to the main camp...”

Liu Er then immediately recounted Zhao Xi’s harassment in a very tactful manner to convey his own achievements to Ning Zhuo.

Hearing this, Ning Zhuo immediately expressed his gratitude to Liu Er, “Many thanks for the General’s trust, and for persuading Zhao Xi at the critical moment, which saved a lot of trouble.”

This gratitude indeed came sincerely from Ning Zhuo’s heart.

Liu Er burst into a laugh, indicating, “What relationship do I have with Ning Zhuo? We are on the same side; if I don’t help you, who else will?”

Liu Er asked, “Advisor, are you not going to return to the main camp?”

After a sigh, Ning Zhuo nodded slightly and said, “In this battle of the Twin Ghosts, the danger was extraordinary; I had exposed my trump card, which aroused Zhao Xi’s covetousness.”

“But I cannot guarantee that the next battle will replicate the previous success.”

“Moreover, in the face of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, fleeing in advance was my optimal choice!”

“Returning to the main camp is impossible. Once I return, I am very likely to be placed under house arrest, or even be killed for my treasures.”

“After all, I am merely a person from a foreign land.”

Ning Zhuo looked up at the sky and sighed deeply.

His background and cultivation were indeed modest; the value he was now demonstrating completely undermined the previous cooperative relationship.

Liu Er fully approved of Ning Zhuo’s decision and nodded in amazement, “The Advisor’s reputation has now spread throughout the entire frontline camp of Twin Rivers Nation. In due time, it will undoubtedly be known across the nation!”

“Even, his fame has spread far to other nations. After all, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth are renowned strong figures in many countries.”

“To be able to contend with two Nascent Soul-level powerhouses using only foundation level cultivation is something that has not been seen for many years.”

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly.

“In this way, after this battle, as I journey across the world, I need to use a different name.”

For Ning Zhuo, he was pleased to see his reputation growing.

The greater his reputation, the easier it was for him to blend into the righteous world.

Furthermore, these battlefield achievements were very difficult to hide - the difficulty in concealing them was truly too high!

After their conversation had not lasted long, Ning Zhuo bid farewell to Liu Er.

Seeing the Ten Thousand Li Traversing dragon soar through the void and depart, Liu Er stood in place for quite a while before finally sighing softly and turning to leave.

In the previous battle of the Twin Ghosts, the Ten Thousand Li Traversing dragon had already been completely exposed to Liu, Guan, and Zhang.

Liu Er was not surprised; he only lamented that he had once been blind to the truth: “Ning Zhuo possesses such combat strength and such a mechanical trump card - no wonder the Ning family allowed him to travel the world.”

“The disciples of a great clan are just different from us!”

Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo, who was in the mechanical ship cabin, took out the contents of a storage bag to inspect.

A golden pill had exchanged for three pieces, belonging respectively to the Fire Path, the Water Path, and the Earth Path.

There were also eighteen National Power Bricks.

In addition, there were two protective magical treasures - one, a Golden Light Necklace, and the other, a Qingbai Jade Ring.

And the Nascent Soul that Sun and Ning previously anticipated was not obtained.

In the jade slip Zhao Xi gave to Ning Zhuo, he hinted that if the latter wished to exchange battle merits for a Nascent Soul, it was not impossible - but it required a face-to-face transaction!

After all, such a transaction, if exposed, would greatly affect official reputation and Zhao Xi’s personal future.

Zhao Xi’s proposal to conduct a secret, private transaction was quite reasonable.

But both Sun and Ning sighed in unison.

Sun Lingtong directly said, “Little Zhuo, do not trust Zhao Xi; he is no longer trustworthy!”

Ning Zhuo nodded, sensing the deeper implication behind Zhao Xi’s actions, and also fearing that if he met Zhao Xi in person, he might be surrounded and captured, thereby losing his personal freedom.

Not obtaining the Nascent Soul was indeed a great regret.

Among the three golden pills, Ning Zhuo chose one of the Earth Path golden pills and inserted it into the Five Elements Golden Pill Wheel.

He donned the Cang Iron Armor and once again took it for a test drive in the high sky.

Sure enough, with the continuous supply of the golden pill, his spiritual energy was exceedingly abundant, and the Cang Iron Armor cut through the wind and flew wildly, carving a long trail of departing fire in mid-air.

Ning Zhuo fully enjoyed the exhilaration of speeding through the sky, which made Sun Lingtong’s eyes light up as he repeatedly shouted, “Let me have a try, let me play a bit!”

“Hey, you have already been playing for a long time.”

“Don’t delay the serious matters, Little Zhuo; quickly let me have a play!”

Being incessantly urged by Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo reluctantly stepped out of the mechanical battle armor and handed it over to Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong piloted the Cang Iron Armor, drawing out in mid-air a series of extremely bizarre and irregular flight trajectories, which excited him to the point of exclaiming loudly.

Ning Zhuo then took out the mechanical Golden Swallow, attempting to command a large group of them to fly around in mid-air.

Sun Lingtong got so carried away with playing that, as Ning Zhuo repeatedly urged him, he eventually had the armor snatched back.

“Little Zhuo, you must custom-make a set of this for me!” Sun Lingtong made his request.

Ning Zhuo did not hesitate in the slightest and immediately nodded.

A request from a good brother was never something he would consider refusing.

But Sun Lingtong then added, “No rush. You are currently pressed for time; once this great battle is over and you have free time, making one then will not be too late.”

Ning Zhuo donned the Cang Iron Armor and flew up into the air again.

While piloting the mechanical battle armor, he also simultaneously directed the mechanical Golden Swallows.

The Golden Swallows circled around him, sometimes gathering together like a school of fish, and sometimes dispersing like the wind.

Their golden wings, under the sunlight, flashed with dazzling sharp brilliance, exuding an imposing aura.

By evening, Ning Zhuo stepped out of the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, ending today’s physical cultivation.

He ate some spirit food, and no longer feeling famished, then entered the interior of a mountain cave to begin an important cultivation practice!

Sun Lingtong was the first to cast the Fire Cremation Prajna Spirit-Resolving Sutra, igniting flames.

Ning Zhuo removed his own lungs and tossed them into the flames.

The void in his body was temporarily filled by false lungs formed by his blood-nerve bindings.

The pair of lungs burned in the flames and quickly melted away.

Ten-Thousand-Year Golden Essence!

Ning Zhuo threw a piece of treasured material into the fireball to be refined together with his lungs.

The Ten-Thousand-Year Golden Essence came from battle merit rewards.

After pondering for a long time, Ning Zhuo ultimately decided to expend a portion of his battle merit rewards to exchange with the Twin Rivers Nation for such a reward.

“I have already revised the terms of our cooperation; please ask Lin Bufan to bring back the Ten-Thousand-Year Water Essence for me.”

“The Ten-Thousand-Year Golden Essence has been exchanged from Twin Rivers Nation.”

“Then, only the Ten-Thousand-Year Wood Essence remains.”

Although Ning Zhuo had many battle merits, he still needed to be frugal and calculate meticulously.

After all, the opportunity to exchange for National Power Bricks was too precious, so he exchanged most of his battle merits for National Power Bricks.

For a cultivator to use National Power Bricks, they must receive recognition and permission from a cultivation state.

Otherwise, even if one managed to seize such treasures, they would be unusable.

National Power Bricks were allocated for exclusive use by individuals, as determined by the sovereign or high-level authorities; once regulated, not even one’s closest relatives could use any of them.

Unless the sovereign or other high-level authorities issue a decree with a broader usage scope covering more than one cultivator.

Ning Zhuo already possessed the Earth Path, Fire Path, and Water Path; only the Metal Path and Wood Path remained.

He chose the Metal Path because the Ten-Thousand-Year Wood Essence was easier to come by in the current environment.

Every high mountain in Thousand Peaks Forest was like a giant celestial pillar tree. The Wood Path environment here was exceedingly flourishing, and Ning Zhuo speculated that in the repositories of some large powers, it was very likely that Ten-Thousand-Year Wood Essence was stored.

Completely focused, Ning Zhuo quickly refined his lungs and the Ten-Thousand-Year Golden Essence.

Everything progressed smoothly, and the successful result had already become apparent.

Suddenly, something stirred in Ning Zhuo’s heart; he thought of the Fire Within Wood.

The profound realm of the Fire Path at that moment reminded him that employing the Fire Within Wood could accelerate the refinement and save thirty percent of the effort.

Ning Zhuo refrained.

By nature cautious, he decided not to take reckless risks. After all, the Ten-Thousand-Year Golden Essence was extremely precious; proceeding step by step was sufficient.

After a short while, Ning Zhuo achieved great success.

He opened his mouth and lightly inhaled, drawing a mass of golden light into his body.

When the golden light reached the position of his lungs, the previous blood-nerve cluster immediately disintegrated, making room.

The golden light reconstituted a pair of lungs, reinserted them, and reconstructed a circulation and balance together with the other parts of his body.

Metal Path Lung Temple!

Ning Zhuo’s strength increased once again.

In a certain valley of Thousand Peaks Forest, Lord Long personally set out to pay a visit to Master Shengxu.

Master Shengxu lay on his bed, as frail as a sheet of white paper, coughing twice, “What brings you here?”

Lord Long was silent for a moment, then said heavily, “We have agreed to your request.”

Master Shengxu: “Oh?”

He raised his eyebrows slightly, revealing a trace of delight.

Then, he laboriously propped himself up, leaning against the headboard, and looked at Lord Long, “Is that truly so?”

Lord Long had once invited Master Shengxu to intervene again to assist the Thousand Peaks Forest side.

But the latter had put forward a demand - namely, to obtain a mouthful of the Life Sea Dragon Spring. At that time, Lord Long had unhesitatingly and directly refused, with a very clear and resolute attitude.

Now, Lord Long’s attitude was also very clear, but it had completely reversed from before.

Life force - or rather, vitality - once accumulated too much, would form an ocean of vitality.

This was the Life Sea.

And as the Life Sea continued to accumulate, if its scale reached a certain point of qualitative change, a spring eye would form in the sea, from which new vitality would continuously emerge.

Thousand Peaks Forest was a land of the Wood Dao, with abundant vitality. In several locations there, a Life Sea had formed.

But there might not necessarily be spring eyes in the Life Sea.

However, Master Shengxu knew that in one of the Life Seas, not only had a spring eye been nurtured, but there were more than one - and moreover, they were Dragon Springs imbued with dragon aura!

That particular Life Sea was located within the body of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.

Master Shengxu proposed that he could act, but he demanded one spring eye of the Life Sea Dragon Spring from the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King. This, for the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, naturally would be a huge loss.

Therefore, at that time, as one of the temple attendants of the Dragon King Temple, Lord Long had unhesitatingly refused.

But now, with a great battle imminent, the higher-ups of the Dragon King Temple had urgently deliberated and still wanted to invite Master Shengxu to act.

After all, they were unable to contact the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth.

In this war to pacify Twin Rivers Nation, the most crucial contest was still a contest of Soul Formation powerhouses.

Although Master Shengxu’s cultivation was not yet at the Soul Formation level, he possessed battle strength at that level! This had an extremely significant impact on the current state of the war.

Lord Long sighed, then directly took out a divine edict and, in response to Master Shengxu’s inquiry, said, “It is naturally true.”

Master Shengxu merely glanced at the divine edict, and thereby confirmed Lord Long’s sincerity.

The divine edict contained a strong aura of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, with demon qi and divine intent intermingling, making it very difficult to forge.

One who could issue such a divine edict had to be the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King himself.

This transaction involved the Life Sea Dragon Spring, and only with the approval of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King himself could it proceed.

Master Shengxu used his divine sense to seize the object, suspending the divine edict in mid-air, and examined it carefully.

After a moment, he nodded slightly, “Since you have agreed to my conditions, I am indeed prepared to act.”

“However, this one divine edict alone is not sufficient.”

“We also need to sign an additional one!”

Saying this, Master Shengxu took out another divine edict.

On the back of the divine edict was the image of a deity.

He was draped in a moon-white, heavenly-silkworm cloud-patterned broad-sleeved Daoist robe, with a mysterious black dragon-shaped jade pendant hanging from his waist, and his feet were clad in Mountain-and-River Shoes.

His face was like crowned jade, and a third eye was open on his forehead. One hand held the Mirror of Preceding Causes, and the other held the Voucher for Binding the Outcome.

He rode a three-legged Qingyin Crane, whose feathers subtly revealed the maxims of the Dao; with each flap of its wings, contractual golden inscriptions were scattered.

Heavenly God-Contract!

He was a rather ancient heavenly deity, in charge of contracts. Because of his authority, he remained unyielding through the ages.

Upon seeing this, Lord Long’s eyes flashed with a fierce gleam, and he said expressionlessly, “So, Master Shengxu came prepared.”

Master Shengxu paid no heed; using his divine sense, he grasped the object and unfolded the blank will of the Contract God, writing the document with his divine sense.

After writing, he handed it over to Lord Long for review.

Lord Long nodded.

The two divine edicts met in mid-air and merged into a ball of radiant light.

The radiance shot upward like lightning, and in the blink of an eye disappeared from in front of the two, soaring straight out of the nine heavens into the clouds.

After a few breaths, Master Shengxu felt a constraint descend upon him. He silently recited a spell, confirmed that the divine edict had taken effect, and then nodded to Lord Long, “Thus, the contract is concluded. When do you want me to act?”

Lord Long presented the Life Sea Dragon Spring with both hands, then said, “For now, please, conserve your strength and wait for the most opportune moment to strike.”

Master Shengxu accepted the Dragon Spring, then lay down again, remaining immobile.

Lord Long sighed inwardly and turned to leave.

His mission was successful, yet his mood was rather heavy.

The Life Sea Dragon Spring could provide significant assistance in helping the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King recover from his injuries, but now, due to circumstances, only one spring could be extracted for reinforcements.

Upon returning to the frontline camp, Lord Long immediately dispatched the army and marched towards Dragon King’s Giant Pillar Mountain.

The allied forces of Thousand Peaks Forest advanced in vast numbers directly up to the frontline camp of Twin Rivers Nation, only then coming to an abrupt halt.

The second grand battle was on the verge of breaking out!
