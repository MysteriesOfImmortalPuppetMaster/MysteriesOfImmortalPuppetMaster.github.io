Chapter 663: A Hero's Son Should No Longer Be a Petty Thief

Beside the Branch of the Wangchuan River, Qing Chi knelt weakly, her head bowed, her sorrowful sobs revealing an unprecedented vulnerability.

Her youthful days, that naive and tender joy, the secret sense of reliance like a budding flower, had vanished like a sand painting swept away by the wind, dissolving bit by bit.

The soul-deep bond of life and death they had shared, the vows that transcended mortality, the earth-shattering emotions of shared existence burned into her soul like a branding iron - all extinguished like a flame, leaving only a cold emptiness.

These were the memories of her past with her beloved, the essence of her understanding and experience of love, all sacrificed by Qing Chi.

She had no choice. Only by doing this could she save her beloved.

"I will rescue you, even if the price... is forgetting you, is no longer loving you!"

Yellow dust gradually enveloped Luo Si's body.

"I can't suppress it any longer?" His expression shifted slightly.

His prolonged battle against the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God had come at a terrible cost. The injuries he had been desperately suppressing finally erupted.

This time, he was powerless to resist. He could only watch helplessly as his injuries worsened, gradually petrifying him into an earthen statue.

Yet his thoughts weren't on himself, but on Ning Zhuo.

"This can't be happening!"

"General Qing has sacrificed so much, willingly offering up so many memories as bait."

"Why? Why can't we lure the Young Master out?!"

Luo Si was utterly bewildered.

This was a colossal misunderstanding!

Ning Zhuo was playing the role of Jiao Ma, concealing his true identity, which had misled Luo Si. Qing Chi, meanwhile, had been mistaken from the start.

How could she possibly lure Ning Zhuo using memories and feelings meant for Jiao Ma?

"Damn it! We've already wasted so much time. If this continues, even if we manage to pull the Young Master ashore, he'll have lost all his memories, becoming a blank slate, a newborn child."

Thinking of this, Luo Si shouted, "Young Master! Why not voluntarily discard your memories? Lighten your burden and let General Qing pull you ashore!"

A cultivator's divine sense would be washed away and drowned in the Branch of the Wangchuan River, but their voice could still carry.

Submerged in the river, Ning Zhuo's ears twitched slightly as he faintly heard Luo Si's desperate plea.

"Voluntarily forget?"

"No, no..."

"Nothing can truly be forgotten. If I lose these memories, would I still be myself?"

The Forgetful River's waters sought to wash away his memories and emotions, while the Buddha Heart Demon Seal suppressed his soul, resisting the river's immense power.

Memories and emotions surged forth, each one vivid and clear as never before.

Ning Zhuo refused to yield.

"In Fire Persimmon Mountain, the plan to seize the Lava Immortal Palace is only half complete."

Ning Zhuo seethed with hatred.

"The enemies who killed my parents have yet to be found. I still have a great vengeance to exact!"

Ning Zhuo trembled with fear.

"If I forget the memories of my time with Mother, how will she ever be resurrected? I'm all she has left in this world."

Ning Zhuo clung to his memories.

He recalled Sun Lingtong, his countless battles fought side-by-side with Big Brother.

He remembered Linghu Jiu, the flower of friendship blooming in Ten Thousand Medicines Valley.

He thought of Mu Lan, his nominal wife. In the Two Note Kingdom, rewards for his merits remained unclaimed.

He remembered the campaign against Thousand Peaks Forest, the earth-shattering Iron Tide Sweeping the Plains, a spectacle of unparalleled grandeur.

He recalled donning the Black Iron Han Armor, soaring through the void with Sun Lingtong like the wind, and challenging the Golden Eagle in a thrilling aerial duel.

He thought of Zhu Xuanji, Ning Jiufan, Lin Shanshan, the Five Elements Divine Lord, Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei, and the Qing-Jiao Army.

When he thought of Qing Chi, the deepest, most hidden emotions within him finally surged forth, no longer concealed, laid bare.

Ning Zhuo... felt ashamed!

"I'm not the real Jiao Ma. This is just a coincidence, or perhaps the Living Realm's Heaven's Qi Luck at work."

"Qing Chi... I shouldn't have deceived her. But I never found the right moment to confess the truth!"

"And... Mother..."

Meng Yaoyin.

When Ning Zhuo saw the Paper Giant at the South City Gate of White Paper Immortal City, its face was his mother's. When he heard the City Lord of White Paper Immortal City, Wen Ruanyu, and others praise Meng Yaoyin, recounting her virtuous deeds and acts of kindness, Ning Zhuo felt - ashamed.

"I'm my mother's child, yet I'm nothing like her. I haven't done any good deeds or acts of kindness. Even after leaving White Paper Immortal City for years, people still sing her praises and even erected a statue in her honor."

"But..."

"But I'm just a thief, a petty thief."

What kind of existence was his mother to him?

She was countless gentle caresses, tender encouragement, heartfelt expectations, her dying wish, and even as a mechanism, she had protected him with all her might until her spiritual energy faded.

"I will save my mother, even if her soul no longer exists in this world."

"I will trace the remnants of her existence."

"I desperately want to understand her, to know her better."

"What kind of person was my mother, truly?"

When Ning Zhuo arrived at White Paper Immortal City, he received the first answer to this question.

Meng Yaoyin was the towering Paper Giant, a monument to White Paper Immortal City. Without her assistance, the city might have crumbled long ago. The unity between the Ghost-Human Tribe and the Humans was also a testament to her teachings.

To completely eradicate the city's crisis, she collaborated with the Ash Bone Elder, harnessing the power of the Profound Primordial Scholar. For decades, she had orchestrated a grand scheme to counter the variables of the Living Realm, becoming the true savior.

"Without a doubt, my mother was a hero!"

"But the son of a hero... a thief? A petty thief?"

The expectant gazes of Li Leifeng and Zhu Xuanji flashed before his eyes once more.

Ning Zhuo was no longer the restrained youth he once was.

In the fruit orchards at the foot of Fire Persimmon Mountain, Fire Persimmons silently grew, drawing magma and geothermal energy, waiting for the moment they ripened and fell to the ground, ready to self-detonate.

Ning Zhuo had finally emerged from the Fire Persimmon Mountain within his heart.

He was no longer that Fire Persimmon, enduring years of restraint, seeking only a fleeting moment of self-destruction.

He had come to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, where he faced public scrutiny, skepticism, and praise, ultimately becoming a Divine Seed of the Five Elements.

He participated in the Two Note Kingdom war, where the strategic acumen of a Military Strategist nourished his seed, sweeping away narrow-mindedness and filling it with grandeur and valor.

He had arrived at the Ghostly Black Marshlands, gazing up at the Colossus of his mother, accepting her and the Living Realm's Heaven's arrangements with gratitude.

He sought to follow in his mother's footsteps, driven by the deepest impulses of a child's heart to emulate his parents' actions.

"The son of a hero should no longer be a petty thief!" Overwhelmed with shame, he realized that the plan to become a savior was now within his grasp.

It was like a ray of sunlight striking a seed buried deep underground at the perfect moment.

This was an opportunity.

A gift from fate, a plan orchestrated by his mother, Ning Zhuo's path to confronting his shame, and, most importantly, his redemption - a chance to stand tall, bask in the sunlight, and live with dignity.

He had already escaped Fire Persimmon Mountain!

He possessed the Five Elements realm, unwavering courage, a yearning for light, compassion for the suffering, and reverence for the virtuous.

Like a seed sprouting, its tender shoot reaching for the sun.

And so, Ning Zhuo threw himself into the vortex without hesitation!

He outwitted the Internal Traitor, racking his brains to make the most correct choices possible. A single misstep could have led to a completely different outcome.

He faced life-and-death perils, enduring countless trials, and exhausting every ounce of his strength to seize the smallest sliver of opportunity.

He finally ascended the Sacrificial Altar and claimed the Heavenly Ghost Skull!

He was swept away by a branch of the Wangchuan River, plunging into a desperate situation.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord!

Such a being was no easy opponent.

He was the ruler of a nation, a Soul Formation-level expert, the master of the Forgetful River Prefecture, and a cunning ghost who had plotted for centuries to advance his Dao Path!

Even though he had been plotted against, besieged from all sides, and forced to divide his attention, leaving him severely constrained, he had still managed to hold out until this final moment through his cunning, combat prowess, and unwavering will.

He had pushed himself to the absolute limit, fighting until his strength was utterly exhausted.

His ancestral stronghold, Forgetful River Immortal City, was ablaze, and his Earth Fiend Turbid Corruption Avatar had crumbled...

The losses were catastrophic.

Yet, with his final gambit, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord could still condemn Ning Zhuo to death!

And he wasn't the only one to suffer such devastating losses.

The Soundless Ghost Monk, the Painted Skin Rakshasa, Lord Yin Jiuzhu of the Ghostfire Prefecture... and Luo Si, his entire body buried under yellow earth, was rapidly transforming into a clay statue.

He was completely immobilized.

Qing Chi knelt on both knees, her hands gripping the fishing rod tightly, channeling all her memories and emotions related to Jiao Ma into the bait.

Her heart felt like it was bleeding, forcing her to make the most agonizing decision of her life.

"I must abandon my memories first, but preserve my feelings for Little Ma at all costs!"

"Even if... I completely forget Little Ma, this overwhelming love will drive me to persevere and pull him ashore!!"

Tears blurred Qing Chi's vision as she gazed at Ning Zhuo sinking into the depths, her voice breaking with sorrow as she cried out.

"Little Ma, Little Ma..."

"Come back quickly."

"Discard those useless memories and emotions, even ours..."

"As long as you live, nothing else matters. Even if you forget me."

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, though far away in Forgetful River Immortal City, observed everything.

His gaze remained fixed on Ning Zhuo in the tributary, while he exerted all his strength to manipulate the Nether Dragon Scissors.

A dark glint flashed in his eyes as he gained a new understanding: "You're too stubborn, Little Ghost, and too shallow. Do you think the Living Realm's Heaven sent you here merely to oppose me?"

"No, it's orchestrating you as well!"

"The Forgetful River is the Sin-Washing River. Through my hand, it immerses you, cleansing your sins, allowing you to undergo Heart Cleansing and Reform, and attain a new life."

Ning Zhuo continued to resist the Forgetful River's relentless current with all his might.

"Qing Chi, Luo Si..."

He could hear Luo Si's cries and Qing Chi's anguished sobs, but he stubbornly refused to relax his grip even slightly.

Ning Zhuo hadn't truly refined the Buddha Heart Demon Seal; his Foundation Establishment cultivation was far from sufficient.

He could only exert his full strength to support it and rely on the magic treasure's power, unable to control it with ease.

He feared that if he loosened his grip even slightly, the pressure would spread like a ripple, causing a complete collapse.

And there was another reason...

"Must I forget my past to become a hero?"

"Even if forgetting my past could truly erase my sins and grant me the right to start anew..."

"Even if that were true, I still wouldn't do it!"

Because even as a thief, that was still me.

That was my way of survival.

That was the path that led me here.

I will never deny my past, no matter how lowly, ugly, dark, or shameful it may be.

"Buddha-Heart Demon Seal, give me the strength to endure!" Ning Zhuo's resolve remained unshaken.

If this were the main current of the Forgetful River, he would have already resorted to other measures. But this was merely a branch, lacking the Prefecture Lord's support and replenishment - a rootless source.

Branches of the Forgetful River could be depleted.

It had already suffered significant losses battling the Ice Coffin within his body. Now, as it tried to wash away Ning Zhuo's memories, it was being further drained by the power of the Buddha-Heart Demon Seal.

"I'd rather drain you dry!" Ning Zhuo's fighting spirit blazed.

He wanted to be worthy of his mother and refused to forget any memory related to Sun Lingtong.

At that moment, his descent abruptly halted. The fishing hook pulled him upward, lifting his entire body a short distance.

"Hmm?!" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's expression twisted in shock.

Luo Si rejoiced. "The Fishing Technique is finally working!"

Pain and sorrow no longer dominated Qing Chi's face; a flicker of joy had been added. "All the sacrifices... they were worth it."

It seemed the memories she had relinquished had finally caught up to the present.

The memories of the White Paper Immortal City defense war were ones she had shared with Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo).

These memories were now affecting Ning Zhuo himself.

Qing Chi's joy vanished, replaced by a misty confusion in the depths of her eyes.

"Where... am I?"

"What am I doing?"

"Saving someone? Why am I saving him?"

Though she had lost all her memories, the emotions she had deliberately preserved remained potent and intense.

Save him. I must save him, even if it costs me my life!

With a surge of strength, Qing Chi pulled Ning Zhuo slowly upward.

Forgetful River Immortal City.

"You won't succeed!" the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord roared, his face twisted in a grimace of extreme tension, all traces of his usual composed demeanor as a ruler gone.

Ning Zhuo clutched the Heavenly Ghost Skull. If he were rescued because of it, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long plan would be utterly ruined.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord would never allow that to happen!

He channeled every ounce of his spiritual energy into manipulating the Nether Dragon Scissors.

His prayer beads had been completely shattered, but the Ice Coffin in the Branch of the Wangchuan River had been reduced to a paper-thin layer.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's previous efforts had not been in vain.

The Nether Dragon Scissors within the Ice Coffin had long been restless, its power radiating outward.

Had the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form been present, he could have easily reclaimed this National Treasure and beheaded Ning Zhuo and his petty thieves in one swift move.

But the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was currently far away in Forgetful River Immortal City. Even the forces he had dispatched to the Altar Battlefield at the first sign of trouble had yet to arrive.

He could only transmit his divine sense and spiritual energy through the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Grand Formation, remotely activating the Nether Dragon Scissors.

Though the Grand Formation was severely damaged, its core remained intact. The Altar Battlefield served as this core, allowing the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's influence to reach across the distance.

The Nether Dragon Scissors shuddered violently, emitting an eerie glow as it shattered the surrounding Ice Coffin and lunged toward Ning Zhuo, who was submerged in the branch of the Forgetful River.

"Damn it!" Luo Si cursed inwardly.

His entire body was encased in thick clay, leaving only a trace of his original features visible on his face.

Ning Zhuo didn't see the Nether Dragon Scissors approaching.

He had his back to the Ice Coffin.

In the Forgetful River's waters, divine sense was useless, unable to extend beyond the body. More accurately, it would be immediately washed away.

Ning Zhuo was fully focused on maintaining the Buddha-Heart Demon Seal, leaving him no time to spare for anything else. He couldn't even manipulate Life Hanging by a Thread to send a single word of warning to Qing Chi.

In that moment, he was nothing more than a fish on the chopping block, utterly at the mercy of his enemies.
