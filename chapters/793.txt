Chapter 793: Gu Qing Chooses the Stable Option

Mountain-top Residence.

Gu Qing stood with his hands hanging by his sides. 

In front of the tea table, Zhao Hansheng funneled his spiritual energy into a jade slip, manifesting a battle scene - it was precisely the earlier fight between Gu Qing’s painted avatar and Ning Zhuo’s Golden Core puppet. 

Gu Qing’s lips were pressed thin and his eyes were bloodshot as he stared at the mid-air battle. These were scenes he found unbearable to recall! 

"That thief Ning Zhuo is actually so despicable and shameless!" 

"To use such a deceptive plot to swindle me!" 

"Hateful, utterly loathsome!" 

Gu Qing had suffered a massive, silent loss. He originally thought it would be a "staged fight" of tacit understanding. Now, even if he wanted to hold Ning Zhuo accountable for breaking their agreement, he didn't have a single contract in hand - there hadn't even been an exchange of words or divine sense between them. 

As Gu Qing watched the battle before him, he also reviewed the entire process. 

He realized he had fallen into a trap from the very beginning. 

"No, more accurately, I fell into the trap the moment I received Ning Zhuo’s reply!" 

"This fellow was acting the whole time, leading me to believe he would maintain the same tacit understanding as me." 

"Then, in the early stages of the battle, he even deliberately only used martial combat, using the guise of a spar to hint that this would be a staged fight. In the end, it was all a trap to lull me into a false sense of security!" 

But there was one point Gu Qing simply could not understand. 

Why? 

Why did Ning Zhuo harbor such hostility toward him? Why go to such lengths to deal with him? 

All along, Gu Qing had believed Ning Zhuo would be a potential ally. This was because, putting himself in the other's shoes, he would have been delighted to make friends with people like Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing. 

Consequently, this battle had completely revealed Ning Zhuo’s status as an enemy. 

As the images of the fight reached their conclusion, Gu Qing once again saw his painted avatar frozen within a massive block of ice. 

"Insidious, truly too insidious." 

Gu Qing trembled slightly with rage, wishing he could turn back time. He would have treated the fight with absolute caution, given it his all, and beaten Ning Zhuo into the dirt. 

In contrast, Zhao Hansheng watched with great interest. 

He even replayed the final moments of the battle over and over again. 

Initially, this display - which seemed to mock Gu Qing - caused Gu Qing’s eyes to fill with even more burst capillaries, his body shaking more violently. But gradually, Gu Qing began to grasp the meaning. His expression and mood miraculously smoothed out. 

Zhao Hansheng took in Gu Qing’s state, and once the timing was right, he gave a slight smile. "Qing’er, isn't this exactly the point of your travels and experience in this world?" 

These words were like a bucket of ice water, completely calming Gu Qing down. 

Gu Qing’s breathing returned to normal, and he lowered his head slightly. "Teacher, you are right. In the future, when I encounter such situations, I will definitely be more than cautious." 

Zhao Hansheng pointed his finger at the final battle image. "Even if Ning Zhuo hadn't used that tactic, or if the tactic had failed, you might not have necessarily won." 

Gu Qing was stunned. 

He hurriedly looked closer at the combat scene in the air. 

Zhao Hansheng thoughtfully began a replay. It was only a short segment, limited to the final moment of the battle. 

After three replays, Gu Qing’s expression changed again, revealing a hint of shock. 

"At the final moment, Ning Zhuo’s Golden Core puppet erupted with a profound and mysterious power." 

"Compared to before, the scale of this power wasn't large, but it contained a qualitative change." 

"That is why he won in the end, completely freezing my clone!" 

"He... what kind of method did he use?" 

Zhao Hansheng replied, "Judging only from this jade slip, that method has shadows of a divine ability; it's almost like the application of an innate talent."

Gu Qing frowned. "Is that possible? A mechanical puppet isn't a real living person. Furthermore, most living people lack innate talent." 

Zhao Hansheng shook his head slightly. "I can't see anything more for now. However, the current era is a golden age of cultivation; new branches of the hundred arts of cultivation are emerging constantly. Ning Zhuo’s background is clearly extraordinary, so it's normal for him to possess some unique methods." 

Gu Qing showed a look of shame. "Teacher, I lost my reason. After this battle, I've been wallowing in resentment and even lost my basic judgment." 

Zhao Hansheng said, "It's good that you've calmed down. Next, how do you plan to respond?" 

Gu Qing narrowed his eyes, falling into deep thought for a time. 

As his thoughts deepened and his internal analysis progressed, his expression became increasingly unsightly. 

After a long while, he said in a hoarse voice, "Teacher, my current situation is quite troublesome." 

"It would be one thing if Ning Zhuo simply designed a way to defeat me." 

"The key is that at the end, he used the record of this battle as a benchmark to pressure other geniuses to fight me with everything they have."

"This is an open scheme, a development the public loves to see."

"I've already been placed on the roasting rack by him. It will be very hard for me to step down from this high stage and fire!"

Zhao Hansheng did not speak, merely looking at his student calmly.

Gu Qing grit his teeth. "The upcoming battles cannot be taken back. It's not just that the challenge letters have been sent out; I've already told the public my intentions. If I back down now, my reputation will be utterly ruined."

"Therefore, I must fight with all my might, show my own style, and prove my strength to the public."

After a pause, he continued, "Even though this is exactly what Ning Zhuo wants to see, I have no choice but to do it."

The thought of having to follow the script Ning Zhuo had written made him feel incredibly disgusted.

Such a situation was undoubtedly quite passive.

But Gu Qing could only do this - who told him to fall for Ning Zhuo’s trap? 

Zhao Hansheng asked intentionally, "Have you thought about finding a suitable opponent and reaching a tacit understanding with them to perform an intense and long-lasting battle? On one hand, it would prove your strength, and on the other, it would break the time-comparison trap Ning Zhuo set at the end?" 

Gu Qing nodded. "Teacher, I've thought about it."

"But I found there is simply no suitable candidate."

"Most of the people I sent challenge letters to are from the Righteous Path. Each has their own power and background within the Flying Cloud Kingdom. They have too many concerns; with my current standing, it would be difficult for them to risk their reputations to agree to a staged fight with me."

"As for specific individuals from the Demonic or Heretical Sects, I don't trust them!" 

Zhao Hansheng nodded, satisfied with the result of this small test. He sighed. "As teacher and student, we are newcomers here. We are unfamiliar with the people and the land, which puts us at a disadvantage in this regard."

"Our hands and feet are tied in everything we do."

"However, because of this, it is all the more reason for us to take control of the Confucian cultivator group here."

Gu Qing pondered, "We lack reliable and effective intelligence too much. To this day, I still don't know why Ning Zhuo is opposing me. Looking at it now, there might be some hidden details regarding the two previous Rising Cloud Minor Trials held by the Confucian group."

Thinking of this, a name suddenly jumped into Gu Qing’s mind. 

His eyes lit up. Just as he was about to speak, Zhao Hansheng spoke first: "Are you thinking of getting the inside story from Situ Gu?"

Zhao Hansheng shook his head. "I already asked. Situ Gu stated that he cannot answer me." 

Gu Qing’s expression immediately turned strange. "Situ Gu yearns for the Huazhang Kingdom and was the first Confucian cultivator we won over. For him to give such an answer even to you, Teacher... that stance alone is enough to explain the problem."

Gu Qing struck his palm with his fist. "So that's how it is. The top spots in the two Confucian trials were likely crafted specifically for Ning Zhuo. Therefore, because we intercepted the third Rising Cloud Minor Trial, we triggered Ning Zhuo’s hostility!"

Deeply versed in the ways of the Righteous Path, the teacher and student analyzed the situation and immediately sensed the hidden truth.

Even without evidence, they felt this guess was extremely close to the truth!

Zhao Hansheng asked the crucial question: "The upcoming battle in the Martial Arts Hall is very important. Whom do you plan to choose?"

Gu Qing fell into thought once more.

Following Ning Zhuo being the first to reply, several others had also sent back responses. Some declined, but even more had accepted.

"The geniuses of the Demonic and Heretical paths are excluded first. They aren't worthy of trust, and they want nothing more than to use me as a stepping stone; they don't follow the rules."

"Among the Righteous Path... although there are rumors that Situ Xing is at odds with Ning Zhuo, they cannot be fully believed. Ning Zhuo is too insidious; what if he deliberately set this up in advance?"

"In my opinion, Zhu Fenxiang is the most stable option."

"On one hand, their Zhu family is a traditional Righteous Path power. They understand the rules well and are good at maintaining the face of the Righteous Path. On the other hand, the foundation of the Zhu family lies in the Divine Summoning Art, which is different from other powers and organizations. They are better at maintaining connections with people and divine lineages."

"Finally, Zhu Fenxiang just had a major battle with Situ Xing and won a pyrrhic victory."

"Even if Ning Zhuo is at odds with Situ Xing, it is only an internal conflict. On matters of great importance, he will surely have a clear mind. This means Zhu Fenxiang is definitely not on the same side as him!"

"The enemy of my enemy is a friend. I might be able to use this to reach some kind of alliance with Zhu Fenxiang."

Zhao Hansheng nodded. "In that case, go ahead and do it."

Based purely on analysis, Gu Qing was not wrong.

The teacher and student still suffered from a lack of intelligence. Of course, the relationship between Ning Zhuo and Zhu Fenxiang had already leaked within the Zhu family.

It was very likely the two of them would find out after some time.

-----
While the two were discussing, a female cultivator who had concealed her original appearance knocked on the door of the Green Stone Cave Dwelling. 

"For what reason has this fellow Daoist come?" Old Chef opened the door. 

The female cultivator wore a thin veil over her face. She had a full figure and exuded an air of elegance and nobility, yet she merely handed over a visiting note without speaking. 

Seeing the person's extraordinary bearing and how her movements suggested composure and mystery, Old Chef did not dare to be careless. He accepted the note and accompanied the woman as they waited, while he funneled spiritual energy to fly the visiting note into the depths of the cave dwelling. 

Ning Zhuo soon received the note. 

His eyebrows shot up. "Zhu Fenxiang’s mother, Zhu Guizhi?" 

"She specifically instructed me not to notify Zhu Fenxiang. What is the purpose of this?" 

Ning Zhuo immediately sensed an unusual aura. 

"Is it because I learned the Zhu family’s Divine Summoning Art?" 

"No matter what her purpose is, I should meet and talk with her first to ask why she has come." 

He immediately halted his work on the mechanical design of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, stood up, and walked out of the cultivation chamber to personally welcome Zhu Guizhi.

After all, she was Zhu Fenxiang’s mother; according to etiquette, he should act this way.
