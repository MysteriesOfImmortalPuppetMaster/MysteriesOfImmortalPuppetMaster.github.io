Chapter 514: Iron Flow Levels the Plains!

Ning Zhuo’s capability in long-range combat also included two Divine Temple organs.

The Dirt-Walking Spleen Temple and the Fire-Walking Heart Temple —these two internal organ Divine Temples—not only provided extremely strong assistance to Ning Zhuo’s Spiritual Energy ( Qi ) Sea cultivation but also increased his combat power, of course, specifically referring to the earth and fire elements.

After accounting for his whole body, Ning Zhuo then estimated his own treasures.

The strongest magical treasure was undoubtedly the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.

This trump card had repeatedly helped Ning Zhuo, especially during the Fire Persimmon Immortal City period.

Even though Ning Zhuo had now acquired numerous treasures, nothing could shake its position.

Under the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, the second should be the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.

This magical treasure-level mechanized creation brought enormous help to Ning Zhuo in his journeys across the world.

Its ability to traverse the void allowed Sun and Ning to advance or retreat, which had enormous strategic significance.

It had, several times, saved the lives of the two.

The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon also suffered significant damage; each time, Ning Zhuo spared no expense and immediately repaired it.

Now, the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon had, compared to when it was just forged, undergone great changes in appearance.

“Third place belonged to the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat.”

This magical treasure had already acquired a trace of spirituality; given time, it would be promoted to the spiritual treasure level, and in essence would be superior to the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.

At present, it provided great assistance to the two, Sun and Ning, in their corporeal cultivation.

Although the two’s period of cultivation was rather short, the effect was unexpectedly good.

It was very useful now, and would surely be even more useful in the future.

In fourth place must be the YinYang One Qi Kettle.

This demonic treasure could transform yang energy and yin energy into one another, extremely mysterious, and possessed tremendous potential for development.

Ning Zhuo then envisioned practicing dual cultivation with himself, and that this treasure might play a crucial role in the future.

“Even if the envisioned dual cultivation did not come to fruition, the mere fact that it could better solve the problems of the cultivation technique on Mu Lan gave it considerable value.”

Regarding this point, Ning Zhuo had always kept it hidden from Mu Lan.

He and Mu Lan were in an interest-based relationship, and had not yet had the energy to plan matters in this regard.

Both being cultivation magical treasures, Ning Zhuo placed the YinYang One Qi Kettle behind the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat in his mind, and there was a reason for that.

The reason was that the YinYang One Qi Kettle was a demonic treasure.

It was better suited for demonic cultivators, and only barely suitable for half-demons.

In Ning Zhuo’s case, to exert the same effect from a demonic treasure, he would expend several times the magical power of a demonic cultivator.

And if Ning Zhuo used only his own magical power, he could not fully unleash the full might of the YinYang One Qi Kettle.

Fifth and sixth place were the Soldiers’ Unified Helmet and Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings.

These two magical treasure-level items both shared a mutual affliction —they were both in a state of disrepair.

The Soldiers’ Unified Helmet was originally a complete set of armor, but Ning Zhuo only possessed a helmet.

The Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings was in very poor condition, with its content severely incomplete.

Only when the two were combined did they have practical value for Sun and Ning.

Additionally, there was another drawback, namely that these two treasures were inconvenient for Ning Zhuo to use.

The Soldiers’ Unified Helmet came from Lu Hongtu, and the Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings was snatched by the “Old Monster in the Stone” from Shuangjing.

If he were to bring them out, it would be tantamount to self-exposure for Ning Zhuo.

There were also the magical treasure-level Soul-Disturbing, Wave-Shaking Drum and the Underworld Ghost God Seal in Ning Zhuo’s possession.

These two were obtained from Qi Bai, a Golden Core cultivator of the Soul Devouring Sect.

These two treasures were almost equivalent to nothing.

They were specifically suited for ghost cultivators, and Ning Zhuo’s magical power did not match, making it impossible to unleash their full might.

The Soul Devouring Sect was a major demonic sect, and Ning Zhuo did not wish to use these two treasures to draw attention.

He was traveling abroad, shouldering heavy responsibilities, and only had a mere Foundation Establishment cultivation, not wanting to attract more trouble.

Besides that, there were two more reasons.

One was that the use of these demonic treasures was very detrimental to Ning Zhuo’s image as a practitioner of the righteous path.

The second was that these two treasures were already components of the Underworld Emissary, Qi Bai.

In addition, there was a Black Iron Cloud, also at the magical treasure level.

Originally, Ning Zhuo had purchased it in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City from the Cloud Whale Caravan, intending to equip it to Yuan Dasheng so that he would have some aerial combat capability.

The idea was splendid, but the reality was far from satisfactory.

On one hand, Yuan Dasheng’s spiritual aptitude was not as good as that of Shadow Blade Night Tiger; on his own, it was difficult for him to command the Black Iron Cloud in battle.

On the other hand, after actual combat, Ning Zhuo found that he did not need Yuan Dasheng’s aerial combat assistance at all.

He himself was very skilled at long-range combat; by using the five-element spells in rotation, he could usually leave the enemy struggling to keep up.

“So, this was a wrong investment!”

Compared to the magical treasures, Ning Zhuo had many more magical implements.

The meditation cushion, the dragon-tornado wheel, the five-element ruler, and the Tranquility Bell used for cultivation had once brought enormous assistance to Ning Zhuo.

Now, the assistance brought by these magical implements had greatly diminished.

Some were even on the verge of obsolescence.

There was one type of magical implement that was the most numerous.

That was the magical mirror.

In the Foundation Establishment chapter of the Mirror Platform Spiritual Communication Technique, the methods for making and using the Eight Layers of Magical Mirrors were recorded.

Now, Ning Zhuo had mass-produced the Vajra Mirror, the Spirit-Dividing Mirror, as well as the Lime Mirror.

Next in quantity was the Jade-Steel Heavy Armor.

After the Ning faction intervened in Jade Steel Mountain, the raw materials became abundant.

And by making use of the Zheng family’s original smelting facilities, the production increased even further.

When Ning Zhuo, as the branch family head, issued an order, his subordinates naturally went all out, entrusting all the inventory to Lin Bufan, who then transferred it to Ning Zhuo.

Therefore, after Ning Zhuo equipped the Red Flower Battalion and the Three Generals Battalion, he still had quite a surplus on hand.

Ning Zhuo’s spiritual sense scanned over his several storage devices, and he discovered that there were still some magical implements that, having been rarely used, were almost forgotten by him.

There were over a dozen magical implement-level Poison Smoke Black Spheres; Ning Zhuo had once used them in Fire Persimmon Mountain, and they worked quite well.

But still, this kind of toxic smoke was downright dangerous —Ning Zhuo, for the sake of his reputation, would never resort to it unless absolutely forced to.

The Soul-Capturing Shuttle, the Four-Direction Inversion Array Plate, the Warm-Heart Pendant, the All-Phenomena Cloud Seed… these were really left aside, gathering dust.

As for treasure materials, the corpse of the Old Monster in the Stone was the top one, and the Ghost Gate Escape Grass could be ranked second; the rest need not be listed.

The total value of spirit stones was still 13.8 million, calculated in units of mid-grade spirit stones.

As for talismans, the magical treasure-level Flowing Clouds and Running Waters Talisman and the Slick and Slippery Talisman were both expressions of the Ning family’s main lineage.

Ning Zhuo also had two Substitute Talismans, one Protection Spirit Talisman, and two Directional Escape Talismans; previously, one Directional Escape Talisman had been expended in an ambush.

These almost all came from Ning Jiufan.

They were what Ning Zhuo had milked from his own clan ancestor in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

The Ning family was renowned for talisman-making, and this was the embodiment of the clan’s heritage!

However, the aforementioned external items were not the main component.

Ning Zhuo’s true focus had always been on mechanized creations.

At the Golden Core level, there were mechanized automata such as: The Buddist Medic Meng Yaoyin; Butterfly Puppet Rudie Niang; Heavily-Armored Blood Ape Dasheng; Phantom Shadow Blade Night Tiger; and Underworld Emissary Qi Bai —these five.

Mechanized beasts included the Thunder Silent Bird, the Fiery Explosive Monkey, the Fire Bamboo Snake, and so on.

Mechanized human puppets serving as soldiers were stocked in a reserve of over eight hundred.

Mechanized weapons included the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor, the Azure Iron Han Armor, the Great Snake Scythe, and the Riveted Rapid-Fire Crossbow.

Mechanized platforms included the Xuanyuan Nine-Work Platform, the Xuangong Gear Platform, and the Giant Spirit Molding Platform.

Mechanized components included the Mechanism Ring, the Weather Ball: Ice Crystal Snow, the Floating Ice White Jade Hand, the Mechanized Fists and Feet: Bitter Cold, the Up-and-Down Ruyi Rope, the Dangling Hair Death-Fishing Whip, the Hanging Ring, the Honest Man, the Wind-Fire Wheel, and so on.

With this tally, Ning Zhuo’s expression became somewhat dazed.

“Unknowingly, I had already accumulated so many treasures.”

“Once all of them are unleashed, my combat power will completely surpass almost all Golden Core cultivators in the world, capable of contending with Nascent Soul level foes.”

“What if I further combined the Life Hanging By a Thread Divine Ability and the Hero's Return Art, and received the backing of the national power and military might of the Two Note Nations... what would happen?”

“Hiss, I am so powerful!”

Thinking thus, his inner tension and anxiety about the imminent great battle lessened significantly.

But in the next moment, he again showed a cautious expression.

“No, I cannot be arrogant.”

“These are nothing.”

“Even among the Golden Core cultivators stronger than me, there are many – for instance, Zhu Xuanji, or Linghu Jiu of the Myriad Medicine Sect?”

“I was merely lucky, having received help from my mother, my clan members, and my friend, Old Brother Sun, to achieve even these modest accomplishments today.”

“My personal effort, though present, was not the key.”

“What I relied on mainly was mechanized techniques.”

“It is that mechanized techniques as a school are outstanding, capable of integrating all cultivation technologies, to maximize leverage and extract the greatest power.”

“The pioneers who invented mechanized techniques were truly formidable.”

“I was merely basking in the brilliance of the sages’ great power.”

“I cannot be complacent or blindly arrogant; I must earnestly learn from outstanding individuals, and work doubly hard, and then again!”

After this bout of mental fortification, Ning Zhuo’s face was calm, his eyes shining brightly, and his heart was once again filled with a strong yearning for progress and self-improvement.

The next day.

After yesterday’s rest, the entire army was full of vigor, properly equipped, and gathered below the parade platform.

The banners fluttered, and there was an atmosphere of grim solemnity.

Du Tiechuan, alone, stood on the parade platform, overlooking the army, and began his speech of oath.

He declared in a loud voice, “Fellow soldiers.”

“My Two Note Nations, with their prosperous states, enlightened sovereigns, proper governance, and peace across the lands, except for Thousand Peaks Forest, which is occupied by evil demons —a lawless land where demonic miasma darkens the sky and brings calamity to the innocent.”

“Now I, Du Tiechuan, under the orders of our sovereign, command the three armies to campaign against Thousand Peaks Forest. This mission is not for personal gain but for justice; not for fame or profit, but for the people. We must hold loyalty and righteousness in mind, with bravery as our goal, to drive out evil and support the just, and to level the demonic miasma!”

“Now that battle is at hand, I wish to head to the front lines with you all, vowing to slay the demons and exalt the might of our nation.”

“Today, we must unite, avoid arrogance and haste, and charge forward. Our blood will surely dye the enemy’s formation red; our souls will surely guard our homeland.”

“We must embrace this battle with the belief in certain victory. Today, we vow to slay the demons, exorcise evil, and bring peace to the world.”

“May our soldiers triumph and return in victory, making their names known far and wide. May our Two Note Nations prosper eternally, and may our sovereigns be wise. Soldiers, charge with me, defend our homeland, and exalt our national might!”

“Charge! For the glory of our Two Note Nations! For the dignity of our sovereign! For the peace of our people! Fight without ceasing, victory will surely be ours!!”

Military Strategy – Uniting the Soldiers’ Hearts.

Military Strategy – Inspiring Morale.

Military Strategy – Clad in Armor and Wielding Sharp Weapons!

At that moment, Du Tiechuan put forth his full strength, demonstrating the might of his Transcendent Transformation.

With the three military strategies bestowed upon the entire army, the might was immense, causing every soldier in the three armies to be stirred with passion, their morale surging, as they all shouted in unison in response to Du Tiechuan.

In an instant, the drill ground echoed with shouts like wind and thunder, overpowering all sounds of the heavens and the earth.

“With the soldiers’ hearts as such, in this battle of Thousand Peaks Forest, I am certain to succeed!” In that moment, Du Tiechuan’s heart brimmed with heroic spirit.

The next moment, he slightly leaned back, took a deep breath, and gathered all his magical power to fully activate the Dragon Shadow Nine-Pillar Parade Platform.

The tall parade platform suddenly burst forth with a dazzling, intense light, outshining even the brightness of the clear sky.

The intense light, like a pillar, shot straight into the nine skies.

The earth trembled mightily, as a spectral long dragon spanning ten thousand Li, like a vast river altering its course, shifted its majestic body akin to a mountain range, and poured into the light pillar of the parade platform.

Dragon Vein!

This was the dragon vein of the Two Note Nations.

The Dragon Soul Pearl on the parade platform was completely exhausted within just three breaths.

The unparalleled power of the dragon vein, poured into the parade platform, caused the entire tall platform to develop heavy cracks, rendering it unsustainable.

In the sky, calamity clouds suddenly formed, unleashing dozens of bolts of lightning.

But every bolt of lightning was absorbed by the guardrails.

These guardrails, tall and heavy, were made from Lei Xiao Iron, capable of absorbing and storing thunder and lightning.

Ning Zhuo was filled with shock: “Dragon Vein!”

“This is indeed the primary source of national power.”

“Du Tiechuan’s mobilization of the dragon vein’s power defied the harmony of heaven, and thus gave rise to the calamity clouds and calamity lightning.”

“But they were all perfectly absorbed by the parade platform!”

“What a grand stroke!”

The mighty wind swept like a tornado, enveloping the high parade platform.

Du Tiechuan stood upright, unmoving; only the finger formations he had formed trembled slightly, clearly showing that mobilizing such massive external power was a heavy burden even for someone at the Soul Formation level.

He altered his finger formations continuously thirty-three times, then long recited: “Golden spears, iron horses, mountains and rivers in turmoil, merciless iron blood, all enemy bandits destined to perish. Crush!”

Hand seals, mouth seals, mental seals.

The three seals were applied simultaneously.

Military Strategy – Iron Flow Levels the Plains!!!

The power of the dragon vein burst forth wildly, and the towering parade platform collapsed with a roar.

Endless power was bestowed upon the entire army.

Countless soldiers felt an invisible massive pressure envelop their bodies; many had their bones creaking, and severe pain swept over them, leaving them to grit their teeth in endurance.

Layer upon layer of steel phantom images fell upon everyone, forming numerous human silhouettes, phantom images of blades and armor, and phantom images of mounts.

On the armor, black as ink, it contrasted with the resolute faces of the soldiers.

Ning Zhuo, being in the midst of it, felt a surging power filling his body, yet at the same time, he was burdened with several hundred jin of weight, which grew heavier and heavier.

Du Tiechuan leaped, transforming into a streak of light, descending from the sky and landing in the middle of the army.

He rode an Iron-Horned Magical Beast, waved the command flag, and shouted, “Army, forward!”

His voice resounded throughout the entire army.

The grand army gradually mobilized.

The soldiers’ footsteps were heavy, and with every step, they could imprint deep pits in the solid stone.

Then, the soldiers gradually quickened their pace.

The entire army resembled a colossal, wild python, slowly beginning to move, gradually accelerating, with an increasingly ferocious momentum!

The entire army, clad in heavy armor, produced a continuous clashing of metal as their armors collided.

The sound of mounts thundering on the ground, the rhythmic footsteps of soldiers, the flapping of battle flags—these sounds merged together like a raging storm and surging waves.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

The dark silhouettes of the entire army began to move, seeping into every soldier’s being, causing each individual’s form to become blurred.

Endless dark shadows flowed beneath the entire army, forming into a heavy river.

The river lifted the armored soldiers, transforming them into a torrent of steel!

The torrent rolled on mightily, vast and overwhelming, like a calamity from the heavens, charging unstoppable towards Thousand Peaks Forest.

Forward! Forward!

The whole army advanced!

In an instant, the sky darkened and the earth dimmed, with nothing but the roaring sound of the iron flow, shaking the heavens and the earth.

Upon reaching a mountain, the steel torrent did not pause for a moment, charging straight ahead.

Boom, boom, boom...

The mountains collapsed and crumbled in the iron flow, ground to dust by the mighty army!

Magnificent, the armored great army!

Mighty indeed, the iron flow that levels the plains!

Du Tiechuan, commanding the central army, with a face as hard as iron and a surging heart, declared: “Today, with this military strategy, I shall eradicate the demonic miasma and reshape the land!”
