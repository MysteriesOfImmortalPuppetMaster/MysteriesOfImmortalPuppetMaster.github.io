Chapter 587: One Versus Three!

"Little Zhuo!" Amidst the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingtong was both surprised and happy.

Although he had never met Meng Yaoyin, when Ning Zhuo was young, he often looked at his mother's picture album out of longing, silently shedding tears. Sometimes, he even slept holding the picture album.

For such an important person to his own brother, Sun Lingtong was naturally clear about Meng Yaoyin's appearance.

Therefore, Sun Lingtong also, in an instant, only a beat slower than Ning Zhuo, recognized her.

He mobilized his divine sense, "looked" towards Ning Zhuo, but the words stuck in his throat, his expression froze - it was the first time he had seen Ning Zhuo with such a demeanor.

"Destroy, destroy, destroy!" The Three-Mouth Ghost General spoke with three mouths simultaneously, his blue-black thigh muscles bulged, exerting sudden force, wanting to crush the head of the paper figure statue.

But the statue's head shone with brilliance, not without defense. The Three-Mouth Ghost General, for a moment, actually could not succeed.

He immediately showed anger on his face, clenched his fists, raised both arms high, and fiercely smashed down towards the statue's head.

Clang - !

It happened faster than words could tell.

A golden light suddenly shot out, the momentary brilliance was extremely blinding, causing all the cultivators present to involuntarily narrow their eyes.

Gold Element Technique - Mystic Gold Slash!

Metal Path Lung Temple!!

The spiritual energy in his Qi Sea was consumed by a small fraction; different from the previous great battle in Two Note Country, after continuously advancing two minor stages, Ning Zhuo's spiritual energy reserves were much larger, possessing enough foundation to support a large energy consumer like Mystic Gold Slash.

Fast! Too fast!

The Mystic Slash was so fast that the Three-Mouths Ghost General didn't even have time to react before being split into two segments.

Cut at the waist!

His upper body fell to the ground, his lower body still standing, feet stepping on the head of the paper figure statue.

"Golden Core level! Who is it?" Such mighty offensive power made Wen Ruanyu both surprised and delighted, he quickly turned his head.

Although his divine sense covered the battlefield and he already knew this was unleashed by Ning Zhuo.

But he still couldn't help but turn his head, looking at this unremarkable, yellow-faced young man.

"Are you Golden Core level? No, still Foundation Establishment."

"Did you use some forbidden technique? Or perhaps talismans?"

The Three-Mouth Ghost General opened his three mouths, simultaneously sucking in a cold breath.

"Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die!" While speaking, he activated a ghost technique.

The separated lower body immediately transformed into a plume of dark green smoke, flew to his upper body, connected, gradually solidified, and took the appearance of legs and feet again.

Mirror Makeup Ghost General and Butcher Ghost General looked at each other, then immediately acted, surprisingly attacking Ning Zhuo simultaneously.

Regardless of whether Ning Zhuo used some kind of forbidden technique, or rare talismans, he was an unknown variable.

Under the circumstance that Wen Ruanyu could not be quickly taken down, eliminating the variable first was the consensus the two ghost generals reached in an instant.

Mystic Gold Slash was too threatening.

Even if defending with full power, the ghost generals had no confidence they could completely block it.

Otherwise, when clashing with Wen Ruanyu, to be suddenly hit by such a slash released by Ning Zhuo, who could endure that?

The three great ghost generals were all ghost cultivators, their bodies different from living humans, lacking fatal weaknesses in the usual sense.

But even so, recovery like that of the Three-Mouth Ghost Cultivator also consumed foundation, the cost was quite high, unable to withstand it many times.

Mirror Makeup Ghost General and Butcher Ghost General did not use divine sense to communicate, just exchanged a glance, and adopted the most correct tactic. This action alone was enough to show the two were battle-hardened and possessed rich combat experience.

"A mere Foundation Establishment, daring to interfere in our clash!"

"Die for me!"

Instantly, the two great ghost generals lunged forward, Yin qi surged, killing intent permeated.

Compared to the two of them, Ning Zhuo's figure was thin and small; after releasing the Mystic Gold Slash, he just stood motionless on the spot, as if scared silly.

Wen Ruanyu's heart instantly leaped: "Not good!"

He struck with full force to intercept them.

Mirror Makeup Ghost General suddenly flew into the air, dodging his interception. Butcher Ghost General, however, had a large and heavy body, and was entangled by Wen Ruanyu's Literature Technique.

Butcher Ghost General suddenly raised his head, looked at Mirror Makeup Ghost General, and let out a low cry: "Switch."

The two generals had fought side-by-side for many years, long having developed sufficient tacit understanding.

Mirror Makeup Ghost General immediately held her makeup mirror, facing the mirror towards herself, letting the back of the mirror face Butcher Ghost General.

The next moment, she activated a magic treasure, causing her and Butcher Ghost General to swap positions.

Butcher Ghost General, gaining freedom, let out a roar and continued to lunge towards Ning Zhuo.

And although Mirror Makeup Ghost General landed in a situation entangled by the Literature Technique, she also avoided a direct confrontation with Ning Zhuo. If Ning Zhuo still had the ability to execute a second Mystic Gold Slash, striking the thick-skinned Butcher Ghost General was definitely better than striking Mirror Makeup Ghost General.

This was an excellent choice for tactical positioning in actual combat.

Wen Ruanyu still wanted to act, to support Ning Zhuo, but Mirror Makeup Ghost General, in turn, entangled him.

"Run quickly!" Wen Ruanyu anxiously transmitted via divine sense, attempting to startle Ning Zhuo who was standing frozen on the spot.

Butcher Ghost General had already rushed to within a dozen steps of Ning Zhuo, couldn't help but burst into wild laughter.

Wen Ruanyu exerted his full strength, his offensive power suddenly intensifying.

His individual combat power naturally surpassed that of every Golden Core ghost general. Mirror Makeup Ghost General couldn't withstand it, immediately shouted delicately: "Three-Mouth, come over to help!"

"Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die." Three-Mouth Ghost General still remained in place, continuously speaking.

Mirror Makeup Ghost General was about to curse, but suddenly her face showed a strange color, all because her divine sense covered the battlefield, she discovered: although Three-Mouth Ghost General had recovered, he was still sitting on the ground.

He stared at the distant Ning Zhuo, his whole body breaking out in a cold sweat, even trembling slightly, his face terrified.

"Could it be when he said 'Gonna die', he didn't mean this kid is gonna die, but that we are gonna die?" Mirror Makeup Ghost fell into shocked suspicion.

She knew very well, among her comrades, Three-Mouth Ghost General's spiritual perception was the most acute, skilled at sensing danger.

"Be careful!" She quickly warned.

A beat too slow.

Butcher Ghost General had already rushed right in front of Ning Zhuo, like an out-of-control carriage, directly ramming towards Ning Zhuo.

According to Ning Zhuo's small frame, not even reaching thirty percent of Butcher Ghost General's physique, if he were truly hit squarely, he would likely be smashed to pieces, sent flying high, and die vomiting blood in mid-air!

Wen Ruanyu couldn't help but narrow his eyes, unable to bear seeing Ning Zhuo's miserable state.

But the next moment, a mirror light flashed.

A red copper "city wall" suddenly blocked the path of Butcher Ghost General.

Looking closely, it was a mechanical ape.

What an ape!

It rose from the ground nearly two zhang, like a small building, its imposing body robust, not inferior to Butcher Ghost General.

Cast from myriad-strike mystic iron, red sun copper guarding its entire body, diamond-made fangs as long as half an adult's arm, wind-fire wheels inlaid in its calves with a diameter exceeding six chi.

The Mechanism Heart Sphere Furnace activated within the ape's body, driving high-temperature airflow to begin erupting.

The Blood Oil Bottle and Blood Spring Pot formed a cycle in its abdomen, emitting a faint blood mist.

It was precisely Heavy Armored Blood Ape · Dasheng!

Bang!

Butcher Ghost General solidly crashed into Yuan Dasheng's chest.

Yuan Dasheng took one step back, completely neutralizing the impact.

Instead, Butcher Ghost General was hit until his head spun.

Bang.

Yuan Dasheng delivered an uppercut, striking Butcher Ghost General's abdomen.

Butcher Ghost General took this hit, immediately bent over, opened his mouth wide, glared fiercely, his eyeballs almost popping out.

He quickly brandished his butcher knife, striking back randomly.

Yuan Dasheng sidestepped, then turned, smoothly elbowing out like a spear, directly hitting Butcher Ghost General's face.

Instantly, Butcher Ghost General's head snapped back violently, his face dented by the heavy blow.

Yuan Dasheng took a stance, directly throwing a kick out

As he exerted force, the wind-fire wheels on his calves suddenly spun, bringing up a trail of fire, causing his leg strength to double explosively.

Bang!

Another muffled sound, Yuan Dasheng kicked Butcher Ghost General flying.

Bang bang bang......

Butcher Ghost General flew backwards all the way, knocking down two walls, and numerous facilities in the workshop.

Then, he was buried amidst the collapsed wall bricks and stones.

Wen Ruanyu's held heart immediately relaxed, he felt quite fortunate: "Almost forgot, Jiao Ma was hiding a Golden Core level mechanical puppet."

"This Golden Core level mechanism is truly ferocious."

Roar!

Butcher Ghost General roared, the sound wave shattering the dust and smoke, walking out with large strides, filled with anger and hatred.

Yuan Dasheng, however, had already lunged before him.

Bang bang bang......

A series of attacks landed on Butcher Ghost General's body.

The butcher knife held by Butcher Ghost General had already slipped from his hand during the backward flight just now; he, without any scruples, used fists and feet to fight fiercely with Yuan Dasheng.

The two sides exchanged blows, each punch and kick was powerful and heavy, creating deafening impact sounds.

On the surface of the Mechanical Heart Sphere Furnace inside the Heavy Armored Blood Ape · Dasheng, twenty-seven bronze cylinders rapidly extended and retracted like living beings, crimson fire essence was continuously consumed, large amounts of steam rose up.

The nested wind-fire wheels in its calves spun rapidly, emitting whistling wind sounds, curling up tails of flame.

As the fight went on, Butcher Ghost General fell into a disadvantageous position.

"Damn it! This mechanical ape's martial combat ability is higher than mine?!" Butcher Ghost General was extremely surprised, wanting to turn the tables, but was always seen through in advance by the mechanical ape.

"Good control!" Wen Ruanyu, while entangled in battle with Mirror Makeup Ghost General, took in the battle situation.

In his view: Yuan Dasheng was obviously a mechanism; being able to display such profound martial combat ability was all thanks to Ning Zhuo.

"Jiao Ma is actually a mechanical arts cultivator?"

"This doesn't quite match the intelligence." Wen Ruanyu sighed.

Ghost Technique - Nether Soul Cast Iron.

Butcher Ghost General cried out, performed the ghost technique, his overall defense greatly increased. Yuan Dasheng's punches and kicks hitting him produced sounds of metal striking.

Mirror Makeup Ghost General was startled: "He actually forced out this ghost technique from Butcher. But that's fine too, with this enhancement, victory is certain!"

Mirror Makeup Ghost General knew this was a powerful trump card of her comrade. In many past instances of fighting side-by-side, she had seen the formidability of this technique.

Indeed, with the stance of this technique, Yuan Dasheng's attacks instantly became ineffective.

Butcher Ghost General was just about to turn the situation around, vent his anger properly, when he was unexpectedly hit by a spell.

Wood Element - Root Vine Entanglement!

Wood Path Liver Temple!!

Emerald green vines drilled out from the ground, directly entangling Butcher Ghost General on the spot.

Butcher Ghost General couldn't move and was forced to release another ghost technique, forcefully cutting the green vines.

But although the green vines were severed, the parts wrapped around Butcher Ghost General's body writhed like snakes and pythons, binding his arms, pulling at his thighs, causing his every move to be greatly distorted.

As a result, Butcher Ghost General's openings reappeared, easily handled by Yuan Dasheng, beaten until clanging sounds echoed, reduced to a punching bag.

"How could this be?!" Mirror Makeup Ghost General was greatly shocked, this was extremely inconsistent with her expectations.

Ning Zhuo merely released one Wood Element technique, and easily thwarted Butcher Ghost General's scheme to turn the tables.

Within the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingtong felt deeply moved.

He seemed to see, within the Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo coordinating with Yuan Dasheng just like this to pass the trials.

"How long has it been? Little Zhuo's strength has grown to this stage."

"The progress is too great!"

"The Ghost General is a Golden Core, yet beaten by the combination of one person and one ape, completely unable to fight back."

Seeing the performance of Ning Zhuo and Yuan Dasheng, Wen Ruanyu was clearly invigorated, thinking to himself: "We can win! I see the chance for victory!"

"Didn't expect this kid Jiao Ma's combat power to be actually so formidable."

"The City Lord is wise, she must have recognized this child was extraordinary, that's why she indulged him, letting him come here to the South City Gate to investigate."

Thinking of this, Wen Ruanyu immediately transmitted via divine sense, giving to Ning Zhuo: "Jiao Ma, how long can you maintain this state?"

"If you can hold on, I can repel the other two Golden Core ghost generals."

"If this battle is won, I will personally report to the City Lord, to commend your merits!"

Ning Zhuo slightly turned his head, gazed at Wen Ruanyu, transmitted via thought: "Step aside."

Wen Ruanyu: ?!

The next moment, a Mystic Gold Slash grazed past his shoulder, directly slicing through the air.

Wen Ruanyu's eyes were filled with a sheet of golden yellow, all afterimages left by the Mystic Gold Slash.

"Hey! Jiao Ma, you almost slashed me." Wen Ruanyu was flustered and exasperated.

Mirror Makeup Ghost General was also startled. She was entangled in battle with Wen Ruanyu, quite close, the second Mystic Gold Slash also posed a strong threat to her.

"Fortunately, I kept part of my attention, closely watching this kid, and dodged in time... No!"

Mirror Makeup Ghost General looked towards another direction.

There, Three-Mouth Ghost General was split into two, divided into left and right pieces.

"Ah, ah, ah!" Three-Mouth Ghost General shouted three times, recovering with all his might.

But even after restoring his body, he was somewhat dimmer than before.

"Terrifying, terrifying, terrifying!" Three-Mouth Ghost General was deeply provoked, disregarding the cost, shockingly unleashed a trump card.

Ghost Technique - Ghost Bat Tide.

Yin qi surged explosively from his entire body, transforming into a surging tide of Yin qi. Within this tide, countless ghost bats flew out.

The scale of the ghost bats was numerous, momentarily obscuring the battlefield.

Mirror Makeup Ghost General saw the opportunity, fully entangled Wen Ruanyu.

On the other side, Yuan Dasheng was locked in an inseparable fight with Butcher Ghost General.

The vast majority of the ghost bats descended from the sky, all lunging towards Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo slowly raised his head, his eyes, tranquil as a deep pool, clearly reflected the countless ghost bats.

The ghost bats shrieked, swooping down, carrying chilling killing intent.

Ning Zhuo neither dodged nor evaded, slowly opening his arms.

Fire Element - Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique!

Fire Element Heart Temple!!

In an instant, flames surged, blazing fiercely, rapidly spreading across most of the battlefield.

Roar.

Three fire dragons condensed their forms from the sea of fire, the air was severely distorted, the paving bricks on the ground were burned red hot.

The fire dragons roared, lunging towards the sky full of ghost bats.

The crimson color, with an incomparably fierce and unrestrained posture, swiftly overwhelmed the gloom and black tide, becoming the dominant color occupying this battlefield!

Flames were everywhere!

The floor bricks were burned until melting, the ghost bats vanished like smoke.

The fire dragons struck precisely, one dragon per general, sweeping the three ghost generals in respectively.

The three ghost generals, seeing such a vast and mighty fire, already knew it was bad, but their retreat speed couldn't match the speed of the fire dragons' attack, all were burned until they screamed miserably.

Wen Ruanyu was forced to flee this battlefield, seeing such a fiery situation, couldn't help but become bewildered.

The remaining craftsmen were also forced into a corner, one of them shouted: "No, this is the workshop, using such a technique, everything will be burned down!"

Wen Ruanyu heard, his heart immediately tightened.

He quickly prepared to act, to save whatever he could, especially the paper figure statue.

"Hiss......"

The next moment, facing the blazing fire, Wen Ruanyu actually took in a cold breath.

All because he observed carefully, only then discovering that in this sea of fire, the fire's momentum was fierce, yet completely orderly. Even including those three fire dragons, despite their magnificent aura, every move had a fixed measure, the flames converged, never scorching the paper figure statue even a bit.

"What kind of fine control is this!"

"This is a Fire Element technique!!"

At this moment, Wen Ruanyu's heart stirred: "Is this Jiao Ma really Jiao Ma?"

The flames dissipated.

The three ghost generals were all burned to the brink of death, bound by streams of water all over their bodies, unable to move.

"Fire Element turning to Water Element?! Hiss......" Wen Ruanyu inwardly sucked in another cold breath.

Ning Zhuo slowly walked over.

Wen Ruanyu had a solemn expression, looking at Ning Zhuo with new eyes.

Ning Zhuo stretched out a hand, the water streams advanced, bringing the three captured ghost generals before Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo glanced at Butcher Ghost General and Mirror Makeup Ghost General, then fixed his gaze on Three-Mouth Ghost General's expression.

"Spare me, spare me, spare me." Three-Mouth Ghost General yelled.

Ning Zhuo was expressionless, lightly crooked a finger.

The next moment, the water streams, like blades, scraped across Three-Mouth Ghost General's entire body, cutting off pieces of his flesh.

"Ahhh......" Three-Mouth Ghost General let out painful wails, convulsing uncontrollably.

Butcher Ghost General struggled forcefully, Mirror Makeup Ghost General tightly pressed her lips together.

Ning Zhuo extended a second finger, releasing a Metal Path technique, causing hundreds and thousands of golden needles to continuously pierce through Three-Mouth Ghost General.

"Pain, pain, pain!" Three-Mouth Ghost General shouted until his voice was hoarse.

Ning Zhuo then cast an Earth path technique, stacking it onto one side of Three-Mouth Ghost General's body, crushing half of his ghost body into powder.

Three-Mouth Ghost General could no longer make a sound, his eyes rolled back, fainting away.

Unconsciously, Butcher Ghost General had already stopped struggling; Mirror Makeup Ghost General saw Ning Zhuo's gaze turn towards her, her body trembled slightly.

Ning Zhuo, however, turned his head to look at Wen Ruanyu.

Wen Ruanyu was walking over, his heart tightened, he clasped his fist in thanks, completely lacking the previous attitude of a Golden Core looking down on a Foundation Establishment.

Ning Zhuo remained unmoved while facing the thanks, then he finally cast his gaze onto the head of the paper figure statue.

"Who is this?" Ning Zhuo, worried about misunderstanding, asked knowingly.

Wen Ruanyu was momentarily surprised: "Are you talking about Senior Sister Meng?"
