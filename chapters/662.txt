Chapter 662: But Fate...

The Forgetful River.

In the Nine Hells, beyond the reach of the living, the Forgetful River, the lifeblood of the Netherworld, had flowed through countless cycles of reincarnation.

It was a river of absolution, a river of oblivion, a river of rebirth. Neither good nor evil, it embodied the cyclical nature of the Heavenly Dao.

Joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure; love, hatred, passion; memories etched into the bone; obsessions rooted in the soul... all were deemed "impurities" of the soul, mercilessly extracted, cleansed, and dissolved by the Waters of the Forgetful River.

This was the shedding of earthly dust, this was baptism.

This was the final farewell, this was the Underworld's welcome.

The river churned and surged, its waves revealing fleeting glimpses: an infant's face, a wildflower-strewn hillside, a tragic farewell...

There were also golden ecstasies, deep blue sorrows, crimson rages, and ghastly green jealousies...

Countless memories, boundless emotions, tumbled, collided, merged, and settled within the river's depths.

They became the Forgetful River's mineral wealth, marking the myriad joys and sorrows of countless living beings across eons.

Unminable by mortals, untouchable by human hands, it stands as the grandest monument between heaven and earth.

Washed clean of their past lives, souls as light as air rise to the surface, drifting to the shore. There, with the innocence of newborns, they step into a new world, both outwardly and inwardly transformed.

Forgetting marks both an end and a beginning.

The endless Forgetful River flows ceaselessly across the vast, shadowy lands of the Underworld, its course without end. Within its depths, new souls, still burdened by their past lives, constantly plunge into the waters, sinking, struggling, being cleansed, becoming lighter, rising, drifting...

With its timeless currents, the river washes away the souls' histories, carrying away both joys and sorrows, and even the very proof of their existence. It flows silently, the pulse of the Underworld, the cornerstone of reincarnation. Before this river, even the most epic sagas and the most profound loves ultimately amount to nothing more than... a speck of dust on the riverbed, a wisp of smoke on the water's surface.

Forgetful River: the place of rebirth, the place of oblivion.

Even a branch of the Forgetful River retains its formidable power.

Ning Zhuo was ultimately swallowed by a branch of the Forgetful River, plunging into its depths, unable to escape.

The waters of the Forgetful River were bone-chillingly cold, the terrifying cold seeping into his very soul. A violent force relentlessly scoured his spirit, attempting to tear apart his memories and emotions, forcibly stripping them away, washing them clean, and purging them!

"No! I can't forget! I mustn't forget!" Ning Zhuo roared, his eyes blazing with fury as he gritted his teeth in the river's depths.

He struggled desperately, casting spells to break free from the current and escape the Forgetful River.

But it was futile.

His body grew impossibly heavy, plummeting toward the riverbed like a massive iron anchor dragged from a warship.

The cruel, icy reality remained unchanged, unmoved by his rage and stubbornness.

Memories and emotions blurred, on the verge of being stripped away, washed clean, and lost forever.

At the critical moment, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal within his Divine Sea Dantian erupted with radiant light, anchoring his soul.

The brilliant glow enveloped his entire soul, resisting the overwhelming power of the Branch of the Wangchuan River!

Those deeply ingrained memories and emotions surged forth, becoming vividly clear.

Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Little Ning Zhuo knelt by the bedside, weeping and pleading.

Meng Yaoyin, on the verge of death, whispered: "Secretly cultivate the Mechanical Arts. Wait for the opportune moment when the Lava Immortal Palace emerges. Seize that chance and rise, Zhuo'er!"

His aunt feigned concern, coaxing him repeatedly, "Little Zhuo, be a good boy. Hand it over and let your Eldest Aunt take care of it... We'll give it back when you're older..."

In the echoing emptiness of their home, every valuable item - even traces of his mother's existence - had been completely cleared out.

In a corner, the young Ning Zhuo had pored over the mechanism manuals until they were tattered, reading them countless times. Reciting them backward was second nature.

Hiss!

He gasped, jerking his small hand back.

A deep cut had opened on his fingertip, blood gushing freely. The pain brought tears to his eyes.

Yet he persisted, finally managing to assemble his first miniature mechanical puppet.

Outside the schoolhouse, young Ning Zhuo stood before a small stall, his eyes fixed on the intricate mechanical toys with undisguised longing and envy.

Nearby, Ning Ji, dressed in fine silks and jade, passed by, casting a scornful sneer.

Sun Lingtong pressed a brand-new mechanical toy into Ning Zhuo's arms. The boy's face instantly lit up with a pure, radiant smile.

That smile illuminated his otherwise bleak childhood.

"My sorrow, my endurance, my warmth - these forged the child I was. Without them, what would I be?"

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, desperately channeling spiritual energy into the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, striving to unleash its full power.

He refused to abandon these memories, even as his body sank deeper into the water.

Beside a branch of the Ten Thousand Streams, Luo Si's face was etched with anxiety as he urged Qing Chi, "General Qing, this is no time for hesitation! The Young Master is sinking!"

Qing Chi's eyes burned crimson, her heart pounding with panic. She couldn't decide - "Which memory or emotion should I use as bait?"

The small courtyard was overgrown with weeds, wildflowers climbing the fence.

A young Qing Chi, her hair tied in a skyward bun, chased a butterfly, giggling merrily. She tripped and landed hard on her bottom, tears welling in her eyes.

The weeds parted as a small boy, Jiao Ma, rushed over. Barely taller than her, his face was taut with concern, he asked anxiously, "What's wrong? Did you hurt yourself?"

He clumsily pulled out a faded, well-worn handkerchief and carefully wiped her tears. Then, he retrieved a sweet treat he had been saving for a special occasion from his pocket and gently placed it in her mouth.

"Qingqing, be good. Don't cry," a tender voice filled with genuine concern said.

This vivid memory, like a painting dissolving in water, blurred and faded. The sweet taste of candy, the earthy scent of sun-baked soil, the slight sting of scraped knees, and the comforting presence of that clumsy little figure... all were being extracted, rapidly separating from Qing Chi.

Qing Chi groaned softly, feeling as if a piece of her heart had been torn away, leaving an aching void. Scalding tears surged forth without warning, instantly blurring her vision as they streamed down her face.

Her heart ached with regret, but when she saw Ning Zhuo struggling in the branch of the Forgetful River, her gaze hardened with resolve.

"Little Ma, childhood isn't the most important thing. Don't blame me - I have to sacrifice this!"

Yet, when she cast the bait into the river, it failed to lure Ning Zhuo even an inch closer.

Luo Si's expression darkened. "Could it be... the bait isn't strong enough?"

The radiant glow of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal had forged an impenetrable dam around Ning Zhuo's soul.

The relentless currents of the Forgetful River crashed against it, causing the Precious Seal to tremble faintly within Ning Zhuo's divine sea.

Under Sun Lingtong's guidance, Ning Zhuo developed the skills of a thief.

He would sneak into wealthy homes and secretly place the stolen money in the homes of the poor.

As he vaulted over a wall and landed, the young Ning Zhuo was startled to find Sun Lingtong standing before him, arms crossed, tapping his foot impatiently, watching him with amusement.

Ning Zhuo immediately wore a guilty, embarrassed expression. "L-Leader..."

Sun Lingtong: "What have you been doing?"

Ning Zhuo lowered his head. "I... I saw how pitiful these people were during the day and wanted to help them."

Sun Lingtong snorted. "How many families did you 'help'?"

Ning Zhuo answered truthfully.

Sun Lingtong snorted again. "Quite a few, huh? I told you, we're thieves."

Ning Zhuo: "But... but my mother always told me to be kind and help others whenever possible. She wanted me to be a good person..."

The young Ning Zhuo's voice was timid, yet it held a stubborn resolve.

Sun Lingtong, however, wore a playful smile. "Then let's just wait and see how this plays out."

Some time later...

The impoverished families "sponsored" by Ning Zhuo quietly prospered, their lives becoming increasingly comfortable.

Ning Zhuo secretly observed them, his heart swelling with joy as he saw their genuine smiles and their newfound freedom from financial worries.

But this idyllic period was short-lived. Conflicts soon erupted within these families.

Some households descended into bitter infighting, squabbling over the sudden windfall and shattering the bonds of brotherhood and filial piety. Others indulged in reckless extravagance, squandering their wealth on gluttony, gambling dens, and brothels. Still others flaunted their newfound riches, attracting the attention of malicious individuals who, through flattery or extortion, quickly reduced them to poverty.

Worse still, cultivators from the City Lord's Mansion followed the trail of stolen funds, nearly uncovering Ning Zhuo's role as the thief.

Terrified, Ning Zhuo apologized to Sun Lingtong: "Boss, thank you! If it weren't for you, I would have been discovered and thrown into prison."

Sun Lingtong let out a triumphant snort, stood on tiptoe, and patted Ning Zhuo's large head. "Now do you realize how foolish you were?"

"Being a hero isn't as easy as you think."

"Sudden wealth is something most people can't handle. It only brings disaster."

Ning Zhuo, wise beyond his years, nodded immediately. Only a handful of families, silently planning and using their newfound wealth, were slowly improving their lives. The vast majority of poor families, however, were worse off than before. Some even cursed the air in their homes, demanding why money no longer appeared out of thin air.

Sun Lingtong pointed at himself. "True change in life starts with oneself, not with a sudden windfall!"

"Their poverty and suffering have reasons."

"Some deserve wealth, while others deserve poverty. Those who can truly change don't need your money; they'll improve on their own, just with more time."

Ning Zhuo nodded. "I understand, Boss."

Sun Lingtong's expression turned serious. "No, you don't."

"We all live together - the poor, the rich, the heroes, and the thieves."

"Snakes have their paths, and rats have theirs. Since these roles exist in reality, they all have their purpose and deserve to live."

"We are thieves, little brother."

"This is our way of survival!"

"If we didn't become thieves, if we didn't hide ourselves, our lives would be far worse. Do you think your eldest uncle and aunt, knowing your potential, would treat you well?"

"You still want to oppose the City Lord's Mansion, don't you? Do you have the power to do so? Would you dare challenge them openly, with real swords and spears?"

"We are weak. How should we achieve our goals?"

Ning Zhuo recalled his mother's dying words, his eyes dimming but his voice firm: "Follow the way of the thief."

Sun Lingtong grinned. "Heh, that's more like it!"

On the pavilion, Zhu Xuanji instructed Ning Zhuo, "Every path is forged by those who walk it!"

"...Just like Li Leifeng... that's why he commands such respect."

"In truth, everyone carries a scale, constantly measuring others and events. Those who bear burdens and strive forward, who gather firewood to warm the masses, are the ones who radiate light."

"You've been touched by that light too! Li Leifeng has already shown you the way."

Ning Zhuo remained silent, then met Zhu Xuanji's gaze, unflinching.

"Lord Zhu, people are different."

"And I will always be one of the audience."

"Do you know what it's like to steal leftover pastries from the guests?"

"I'm from the bottom, always have been."

"Though my surname is Ning, I've never felt noble."

"I'm despicable."

"I'm a thief!"

"A scavenger who eats from the trash."

"I'm not afraid of getting dirty, only of going hungry."

"No one can truly help me. Humans are solitary; we can never fully understand each other."

"Most of the time, I can only rely on myself."

"The path I walk is my own choice!"

As Ning Zhuo performed the pivotal scene of the puppet play Fang Qingxue's Grievance, his heart stirred deeply.

He understood Zhu Xuanji's meaning.

Zhu Xuanji was urging him to confess and walk the righteous path.

Can I truly walk this path? Ning Zhuo asked himself. He did yearn to be bathed in the light of justice.

But fate...

Heh, fate - always forcing us into helplessness, making us mere puppets of circumstance!

Tears streamed down Qing Chi's face.

The fishing line remained taut, transmitting the cruel weight of reality to her.

Ning Zhuo continued to sink. The previous bait had been utterly insufficient.

"What else can I sacrifice from my memories?" Qing Chi gasped, her chest heaving with pain. "Then it must be these."

A summer night.

In the damp, dark Ghostly Black Marshlands, a rare moonlight bathed the courtyard. The night breeze rustled the leaves of the ancient locust tree, its branches swaying gently.

Qing Chi lay sprawled across her desk, sighing over her studies, her face etched with frustration.

Through the open window, a night breeze carried the fragrance of locust blossoms and the clean, soapy scent of a young man's sleeves.

Qing Chi jerked her head up, just in time to see Jiao Ma's soot-stained face peering in through the window.

"Little Ma!" she exclaimed in delight.

"Quiet!" Jiao Ma hissed urgently. "Do you want your father to throw me out again?"

The girl quickly covered her mouth. "Little Ma, come help me! I'm about to go crazy from all this homework."

Jiao Ma smiled helplessly, his eyes soft with affection. "I knew you couldn't handle it..."

Millennial Cold Pool.

In this perilous adventure, the pair was on the verge of escaping to safety.

But Jiao Ma was struck by the Cold Fiend, his body nearly frozen solid. His spiritual energy stagnated, and his consciousness rapidly faded.

"Little Ma!" In a desperate moment, Qing Chi disregarded her own safety and turned back to rescue him.

She transferred the protective energy shielding her heart meridian to Jiao Ma, enveloping him in a faint blue flame.

Jiao Ma gasped for breath, his eyes fluttering open.

Though Qing Chi was barely holding on herself, she sent a telepathic message through her divine sense: "Little Ma, wake up! Don't you dare fall asleep!"

"Wake up, you big idiot!"

"Listen to me! Don't you dare fall asleep! Hold on! If anything happens to you, Qing Chi... I won't live another day without you!"

Inspired by her words, Jiao Ma gritted his teeth and forced his eyes wide open.

Together, they struggled against the bone-chilling water, swimming upward. Their burning affection, like a tempered blade, shattered their former restraint, driving them to overcome the final obstacle and burst through the surface.
