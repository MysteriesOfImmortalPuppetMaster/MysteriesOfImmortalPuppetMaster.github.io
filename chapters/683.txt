Chapter 683: Sun Lingtong's Perilous Exploration of Jade Cleansing Hall

The Teleportation Stone Chamber within Jade Cleansing Hall was small.

The floor, walls, and ceiling were covered in intricate formation patterns.

Sun Lingtong stepped out of the Formation and approached the only door.

Instead of immediately pushing it open, he cautiously activated his Theft Path Methods to probe the world beyond.

After employing five different detection techniques, he finally confirmed the door was safe.

He took a deep breath and transmitted a message to Ning Zhuo via divine sense: "Little Zhuo, I'm opening the door now."

A Life Hanging by a Thread connection had always linked Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo nodded inwardly and replied, "I'm ready."

The large-headed youth sat in his Cave Abode at Vine-Clasping Cliff, his mind fully focused.

Jade Cleansing Hall had been his mother's Cave Abode in life, and Ning Zhuo naturally wished to explore it himself. However, reason dictated a more sensible arrangement.

Sun Lingtong's higher cultivation level and mastery of numerous Theft Path Methods made him the ideal candidate for this perilous exploration.

During the battle in Forgetful River Prefecture, Sun Lingtong had even infiltrated deep behind enemy lines, reaching the capital city of a nation. After wreaking havoc, he had made a daring escape.

His achievements had a profound impact on the Altar Battlefield.

Clang.

Although he relied on Zeng Jide, a senior fellow sect member, if Ning Zhuo were in Sun Lingtong's position, he knew he could never match Sun Lingtong's performance.

Sun Lingtong was suited for frontline exploration, while Ning Zhuo excelled at providing backup.

No one was better suited for this role!

Ning Zhuo had mastered the Divine Technique: Life Hanging by a Thread. Combined with his Spirit Communication Realm, rescuing Sun Lingtong would be as simple as a thought. Back in White Paper Immortal City, not even the Dao Field could prevent Ning Zhuo from saving Sun Lingtong.

Of course, within the Jade Cleansing Hall, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were separated by formations and magic restrictions. Whether this external rescue method would still work remained uncertain.

But this arrangement was the greatest insurance they could devise.

Exploring the Jade Cleansing Hall was risky.

In her message on the Jade Slip, Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin revealed no further details. Her condition had reached its limit, forcing her to prioritize the most critical information for Ning Zhuo.

She only warned him that the Jade Cleansing Hall was heavily guarded and lacked bloodline recognition mechanisms, urging him to proceed with extreme caution.

After all, when she left the Myriad Manifestations Sect, she had no idea she would give birth to a son.

Sun Lingtong pushed open the door and entered a secret chamber.

In the center of the chamber sat a formation plate the size of a millstone, slowly rotating on the floor.

The plate was carved from a single piece of Lake-Sinking Jade Marrow and inlaid with three hundred and sixty Water-Patterned Steel Beads. The beads were interconnected by a network of fine lines, through which faint traces of flowing water could be seen.

Extending from the plate's base were over a hundred formation patterns, varying in thickness and resembling crystalline veins of water or the roots of a living creature burrowing into the surrounding walls.

A sharp glint flashed in Sun Lingtong's eyes. "This is the Formation Nexus Chamber that controls the entire Jade Cleansing Hall Cave Abode!"

Ning Zhuo exclaimed joyfully, "In that case, as long as we control this place, we can bypass all the defenses within the Jade Cleansing Hall! No wonder Mother didn't explain much in the Jade Slip."

Sun Lingtong remained silent, a sense of unease stirring within him.

He had always taken such feelings of unease very seriously.

With his extensive experience in theft, Sun Lingtong knew that whenever he felt something was off during a heist, it meant he had sensed some ominous detail without fully understanding it.

Instead of rushing into action, Sun Lingtong carefully observed the chamber.

He activated his Innate Spirit Eye, focusing his gaze for a moment, and broke out in a cold sweat.

"These Water-Patterned Steel Beads are actually condensed Water-Attribute Yin Lightning. Once triggered, the formation patterns will seal the entire room, locking down the Void."

"At that point, anyone who has breached the formation will meet a gruesome end. No, the entire Jade Cleansing Hall will be instantly annihilated."

Ning Zhuo was stunned.

Sun Lingtong wiped the sweat from his brow, sighing, "Aunt placed the teleportation array in the Formation Nexus Chamber. How could she not have taken precautions?"

"That's exactly what felt off to me!"

"If it were me, having set up a secret passage connecting to the outside world, I would have anticipated enemies using it to teleport into the Jade Cleansing Hall."

"This formation plate has identity recognition capabilities. Until I crack this layer and achieve proper disguise, I absolutely cannot touch it!"

Sun Lingtong made his decision.

His gaze swept the room. "Next, I need to choose one of these six doors."

The Formation Nexus Chamber housed the formation plate for the entire Cave Abode. A small, clearly added-on room contained only the teleportation array.

Apart from these, there were six doors distributed across the four walls.

Maintaining his detection spell at all times, Sun Lingtong began to move cautiously through the Formation Nexus Chamber.

Every two or three steps, Sun Lingtong would pause, activate a round of Theft Path Methods to scan the formation patterns around him, then pull out various talismans and release them in quick succession.

Even Ning Zhuo, watching his movements, felt dizzy from the speed and complexity of his techniques.

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but hold his breath, his body and mind tense with anticipation.

He knew Sun Lingtong well. He understood that Sun Lingtong was now using his full strength. In their decade-long friendship, he had never seen him exert himself like this more than five times.

Sun Lingtong pressed on with all his might, moving in fits and starts, sometimes backtracking or taking detours. It took him the time it would take to drink half a cup of tea to finally reach a door.

Yet the straight-line distance between his starting point and the door was no more than twenty steps.

After informing Ning Zhuo and receiving confirmation, Sun Lingtong pushed open the door.

A flood of light poured in, causing Sun Lingtong's pupils to contract.

Before him lay a curved corridor supported by twelve ice-crystal jade pillars. An invisible force held back the surrounding lake water.

Outside the corridor, the Jade Lake's fish and aquatic plants were visible in perfect detail. A school of fish darted overhead, their tails stirring ripples that seemed about to spill into the corridor.

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo stood frozen, stunned by this unexpected sight.

Sun Lingtong's heart pounded. He transmitted a message with his divine sense: "This is an Array Void Construction Realm!"

Ning Zhuo, reminded of this, was equally shocked. "Y-yes, it seems so."

The Array Void Construction Realm was an advanced formation technique, far beyond the capabilities of cultivators with only a superficial understanding of the Formation Dao.

Ning Zhuo had already encountered a similar level of difficulty with the Formless Pivot technique.

During the Black Cloud Battlefield incident, Ning Zhuo had located the formation's pivot but was unable to destroy it - precisely because of the Formless Pivot technique!

Sun Lingtong, whose mastery of the Formation Dao surpassed Ning Zhuo's, was the first to recognize it. Staring at the corridor before them, his eyes gleamed with awe as he exclaimed, "This is the first time I've ever witnessed this formation technique firsthand!"

"Creating internal space within a formation is already rare. But the Array Void Construction Realm allows you to dismantle, reshape, and reconstruct that internal space."

"From the outside, the Jade Cleansing Hall Cave Abode appears to be merely a palace at the bottom of the lake."

"But from the inside, the palace has been reconfigured and integrated with the cave abode's formation, creating a wondrous state where architecture and formation are seamlessly fused!"

"Little Zhuo, what level of mastery did your mother truly achieve in the Formation Dao?"

Ning Zhuo's mouth went dry. "I don't know either, Elder Brother. You know my situation. You've read all the classic texts my mother left behind."

"Wait, how are you so sure this was set up by my mother and not just part of the Jade Cleansing Hall's original design?" Ning Zhuo asked.

Sun Lingtong shook his head, his conviction unwavering. "The Jade Cleansing Hall's status is comparable to the Boulder Cave Abode - both are among the top cave abodes on their respective peaks."

"But you've already been to the Boulder Cave Abode. What was its formation like?"

"Even Xie Tang's Nine Palaces Formation, in terms of grade and complexity, is far inferior to the Grand Formation here."

"This must be Aunt's work!"

Ning Zhuo blinked, his eyes slightly reddened. He sighed. "Ah, if only Mother had left me some classic texts on the Formation Dao, my mastery might have rivaled Shen Xi's by now."

Sun Lingtong shook his head. "This was likely your mother's deliberate choice. Leaving advanced texts behind might have attracted trouble. After all, you were only two years old at the time. Your mother wouldn't have fully trusted an outsider like me either."

Sun Lingtong stood motionless.

He dared not move.

This corridor was clearly not designed for sightseeing. Beneath the beautiful underwater scenery lay traps and lethal mechanisms.

This was undoubtedly another layer of anti-theft measures.

Sun Lingtong observed for the time it takes to burn an incense stick, his brow furrowed in concentration, before finally attempting to proceed.

He tiptoed forward, taking an incredibly cautious step. As his front foot landed on the stone tile, ripples of water surged across the surface.

Sun Lingtong took several more steps, his path zigzagging wildly. The ripples multiplied, creating a qualitative change.

Several water arrows materialized from thin air and shot toward him simultaneously.

Forced to evade, Sun Lingtong retreated hastily.

This only triggered more defenses. A stream of water lashed out from behind, coiling around his waist and binding him tightly.

Sun Lingtong tried to retaliate, but the water carried the power of a restriction, preventing him from reacting in time.

Life Hanging by a Thread!

Spirit Communication Mirror!

In that critical moment, Ning Zhuo acted swiftly to rescue him, pulling Sun Lingtong away from the danger and into their Cave Abode at Vine-Clasping Cliff.

Sun Lingtong, still shaken, exclaimed, "That formation is terrifying! Little Zhuo, if you hadn't intervened, I would have been seriously injured."

Ning Zhuo replied, "Boss, you took the hit for me."

Sun Lingtong waved his hand dismissively. "No, I should be thanking you for giving me this chance for theft and adventure. It's absolutely exhilarating, ha ha ha!"

Sun Lingtong laughed heartily, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

"You know what? The tougher the challenge ahead, the more my competitive spirit burns. Little Zhuo, let's decipher the formation in this corridor together."

Ning Zhuo nodded emphatically.

The brothers first compiled the intelligence they had gathered, then discussed the formation within the corridor.

During their discussion, Ning Zhuo brought out the classic texts left behind by his mother, inviting Sun Lingtong to study them together.

Although the texts covered basic principles and focused more on Mechanism Art, they still offered subtle clues.

After all, these were the works of Ning Zhuo's mother. Through them, they could discern the author's temperament, thought patterns, and habits.

"This is difficult, far too difficult," Sun Lingtong sighed.

Despite their efforts, they had gained little insight.

Ning Zhuo: "We'll need to probe it a few more times to fully understand the corridor's formation layout."

Sun Lingtong's expression turned grave. "I don't think we have many attempts left. Aunt wouldn't have designed it this way.

Based on the current formation patterns, triggering it a few more times could seal the entire corridor."

"At least that's what we can expect."

"What I'm more worried about is that it might activate the central formation plate, triggering the Jade Cleansing Hall's self-destruction!"

Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment. "If that's the case, we'll need to deepen our understanding of the Formation Dao."

Sun Lingtong shook his head. "That's unreliable. Mastering the Hundred Crafts of Cultivation isn't something you can achieve overnight. Miraculous encounters like your breakthrough in the Five Elements Realm are exceedingly rare."

Ning Zhuo sighed. "Well, let's try it first and see what happens."

His foundation in the Formation Dao was solid, and Sun Lingtong's skills were even more advanced. Yet, working together, the brothers felt their own inadequacy before the Formation laid by Meng Yaoyin.

Despite possessing the formidable Formation Gap Shuttle, Sun Lingtong couldn't find an opportunity to use it - he couldn't detect any flaws or gaps in the Formation.

Using the Earth Evasion Technique to burrow into the mountain, Sun Lingtong guided the Formation Gap Shuttle through the Thousand Vine Cloud-Drinking Formation and entered the Teleportation Stone Chamber.

Activating the teleportation array, he once again entered the Jade Cleansing Hall.

Passing through the Formation Nexus Chamber, he chose the same door as before.

Pushing it open, he and Ning Zhuo faced the same dilemma as before.

The corridor hadn't fully returned to calm; ripples of water still echoed across the brick floor. This hadn't been the case previously, confirming Sun Lingtong's ominous suspicion - they didn't have many attempts left!

Just as Sun Lingtong was about to continue testing the formation, a thunderous explosion suddenly erupted.

"What's happening?!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed, startled, as he looked up at the sky.

He was currently at the bottom of Jade Lake, where he witnessed the water violently churning into surging currents. The tremors weren't confined to the lake; the entire Cloud Demon Peak was shaking.

Ning Zhuo tensed, nearly activating his Divine Art to pull Sun Lingtong back.

Shaking! He realized with surprise that Vine-Clasping Cliff, where he stood, was also trembling.

"What's going on?" Sun Lingtong was the first to regain his composure, certain that the disturbance wasn't caused by his actions.

Ning Zhuo immediately dispatched Old Chef to investigate.

Old Chef was new to the area and lacked expertise in intelligence gathering. Aware of this limitation, Ning Zhuo sent a second message via flying letter to contact Yu Heye.

Shortly after, Yu Heye's flying letter arrived first.

Yu Heye reported that he had also been startled by the tremors. He informed Ning Zhuo that a young cultivator named Niu Cheng was attempting to locate Xie Tang's Array Dao Magical Treasure, triggering the Nine Palaces Formation.

The Nine Palaces referred to the nine mountain peaks, including Vine-Clasping Cliff and Cloud Demon Peak. Consequently, all nine peaks trembled simultaneously.

At the end of his letter, Yu Heye shared his deduction: Niu Cheng, possessing innate talent capable of causing such a massive disturbance, was likely about to succeed. If Ning Zhuo desired the Array Dao Magical Treasure, Yu Heye pledged to exert every effort to assist him, repaying Ning Zhuo's life-saving debt.

Ning Zhuo wrote back to reassure Yu Heye, advising him to disregard the matter.

However, Old Chef had yet to return.

Without any guards by his side, Ning Zhuo hesitated to fully immerse himself in exploring the Jade Cleansing Hall.

Meng Yehu and Yuan Dasheng were still under repair, and the process remained complicated.

He had originally relied on Old Chef, but the man had been dispatched to gather intelligence.

As for Qing Chi, Ning Zhuo couldn't depend on a girl suffering from amnesia.

By nature cautious, Ning Zhuo immediately sent a flying message recalling Old Chef. He also contacted Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong sat cross-legged on the tiled floor, his eyes gleaming with insight.

"Little Zhuo, don't rush! I've already deciphered the secrets of the corridor's Formation."
