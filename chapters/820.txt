Chapter 820: The Demon Seed Inflicts the Body

The cultivator from the Demon Subjugation Hall sucked in a breath of cold air. "That was close! If we had actually gone to the ancient tomb, we would have not only come up empty-handed but also wasted precious time!"

Yun Niaoniao looked at Ning Zhuo with a gaze full of admiration.

Lu Xuan nodded slightly. "Fellow Daoist Ning, please take the Golden Light Talisman and strike quickly."

Unexpectedly, Ning Zhuo shook his head and sat down cross-legged. "At this moment, I am merely a 'mortal.' How can I strike? How can I suppress the Demon Seed?"

"The most suitable person right now is not me, but..."

Having said this, Ning Zhuo looked toward the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator.

The medicinal effects had been working continuously; the cultivator's heavy injuries had already turned into light ones.

He stood up with a solemn expression. "I have failed once, but how fortunate I am to have three righteous heroes risk their lives to help me with all their might!"

"The Demon Seed still retains my sealing power. I will definitely do my utmost and fight to the death."

"This time, even if I must discard my life, I will succeed!"

After speaking, he burst forth with a resolute aura, activated the talisman, and, shrouded in golden light, charged out of the temple doors.

Inside the dilapidated temple, some sat while others slumbered. The female cultivator, whose strength was clearly weaker than the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator, was barely maintaining the spell technique.

With Ning Zhuo sharing the burden, the pressure on Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xuan was instantly alleviated significantly.

"Fellow Daoist Ning, I indeed did not misjudge you," Yun Niaoniao said with a faint smile.

Lu Xuan stared blankly at Ning Zhuo for a long time before letting out a long sigh. "Fellow Daoist Ning... Lu has learned a lesson."

At this moment, he had finally realized from Ning Zhuo's actions that this trial tested not only a cultivator's intellect and strategy but also their understanding of their own positioning.

Guarding the Righteous Path sometimes required letting go of the obsession that "I must personally save everything," recognizing one's own position, and thereby making the most appropriate choice.

Therefore, the talents the Demon Subjugation Hall wanted to select were not merely hot-blooded and courageous boors, but true righteous cultivators who possessed wisdom, understood trade-offs, and could cooperate.

The Demon Subjugation Hall cultivators who witnessed Ning Zhuo's entire performance were also praising him profusely.

"Distinguishing priorities, making good use of available abilities, and not acting with the courage of a brute - this is true wisdom!"

"This Ning Zhuo is indeed worthy of being the genius valued by the Hall Master."

"In his actions, he even employed social maneuvering. Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xuan's temperaments were controlled by him, and they obeyed his arrangements. He first had the two of them bear the blood fog, quietly reducing their impact on him. Such thoughtfulness is truly thorough."

With his previous display of noble righteousness as an endorsement, no one who saw Ning Zhuo using tricks and schemes now felt it was a problem.

More and more people came to this realization: "Making the best use of everything and everyone... this child has the style of a leader!"

Mist and clouds rose before their eyes again, and Ning Zhuo, Lu Xuan, and Yun Niaoniao were all notified that they had passed this stage.

When the floating clouds dispersed, Ning Zhuo found himself on a desolate mountain path.

The moonlight was pale, casting tree shadows all around like ghostly spirits.

Ning Zhuo immediately felt strange anomalies in his body - at this moment, his body was filled with a strange demonic power. It was viscous, constantly writhing, and full of malice!

This was a power that felt both strange and familiar to Ning Zhuo - the Blood Fog Demon Seed!

A divine sense transmission sounded in his mind, informing him of the details and context of this level.

It turned out that the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator who had set out from the broken temple was named Zhou Sumuo. He had attacked with all his might, disregarding life and death, and ended up in a mutually destructive struggle with the Demon Seed.

Although the Demon Seed was sealed, it was also implanted into his body.

Now, Ning Zhuo was assuming the role of Zhou Sumuo. He had to use his physical body to seal the Demon Seed and carry it back to the sect as quickly as possible.

The divine sense transmission provided the direction of the sect. Ning Zhuo could even feel the distance between them.

Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo immediately began to run.

Sensing his determination, the Demon Seed frantically eroded him.

The encroachment of demonic power was like ten thousand ants devouring his heart, like suffering a hundred tortures at once.

The pain intensified rapidly. Soon, it felt like red-hot iron nails were piercing through his chest and then thrusting along his meridians into his limbs and bones.

After a hundred steps, Ning Zhuo felt as if every inch of his skin was being peeled off, and every bone was being crushed and reassembled.

Veins popped out on his forehead, cold sweat soaked his clothes, and his pace grew slower and slower as he began to stagger forward.

At the same time, on similar desolate mountain paths, the moonlight was cold as frost.

One by one, the cultivators who had reached this stage walked slowly alone.

Lu Xuan clenched his teeth, protecting his body with spiritual energy that formed a thin halo around him, barely resisting the erosion of the demonic power. However, blood was already seeping from the corners of his mouth, his eyes were bloodshot, yet his spine remained straight and his gaze firm. "The erosion of demonic power is the Demon Art carving its principles onto my body. But the cultivation art I practice has engraved principles into me deeply and firmly. This is my unique advantage; those who can surpass me are extremely rare!"

Yun Niaoniao's hands constantly formed seals, chanting incantations softly. Her gentle face was full of pain as she struggled to persist. With every step she took, her body trembled, looking as if she might collapse at any moment.

Gu Huaijiu, however, was in a very sorry state. This well-known cultivator, who specialized in killing demonic path practitioners because his family had been wiped out by evil cultivators, was gasping for breath. A look of madness flashed through his eyes occasionally, interspersed with moments of clarity; he was clearly teetering on the edge under the impact of a Heart Demon.

The obsession with revenge supported him, but it also gave the Demon Seed's negative emotions a breakthrough point. Anger and despair intertwined in his heart, almost tearing him apart.

The demonic qi was like a living poisonous insect, drilling frantically through Ning Zhuo's blood vessels, constantly biting and tearing!

The power of the Demon Seed radiated freely, leaving traces of various techniques on Ning Zhuo's body. However, these were perfectly accommodated, causing no interference with the Three Sects' Supreme Methods and other principles.

The harm of the Demon Seed was not limited to demonic power.

All kinds of negative emotions flooded into his Divine Sea like a dam bursting, assaulting Ning Zhuo's mental barriers.

"Zhou Sumuo! You know it deep down, you know!"

"The Demon Seed is entangled with you, inseparable. If you go back now, for the sect to destroy the Demon Seed, they must destroy you! Going back now is actively sending yourself to death. Is it worth it?"

"Zhou Sumuo, ah, you fought to the death to seal the Demon Seed, yet in the end, you will die because of it. How ironic is that?"

"Why? Zhou Sumuo, you braved death for the Demon Subjugation Hall, slaying demons and protecting the common people! Why must you end up like this? The Heavenly Dao is unfair!"

"Give up. Flee with the Demon Seed. Find an uninhabited place and slowly study how to control it. This is essentially a fortuitous encounter in your life."

"Living is more important than anything!"

Despair, anger, gloom, and other negative emotions bombarded the lake of Ning Zhuo's heart, causing various distracting thoughts to fly about.

Especially the last sentence, which made Ning Zhuo's heart tremble violently. Because this was exactly his own deep-seated thought!

However, his Innate Talent - the "True Self" - constantly maintained Ning Zhuo's perception, letting him know that these emotions were external things and not produced by him.

Upper Dantian, inside the Divine Sea.

The Buddha Heart Demon Seal vibrated gently, triggering quietly.

All the demonic thoughts and malice were suddenly swallowed whole by the Buddha Heart Demon Seal!

Ning Zhuo's entire body suddenly felt light.

Gu Huaijiu finally could not hold on any longer.

"No... I can't die... I still have to take revenge..." The last shred of clarity in his eyes was replaced by madness, and he actually turned around and charged into the depths of the dense forest.

He chose to "flee," choosing to live on with the Demon Seed. He could no longer distinguish between himself and Zhou Sumuo's identity.

Not long after.

Yun Niaoniao fell to her knees, tears streaming down her face. "I can't do it... I really can't do it."

Lu Xuan was still persisting, but with every step, the glow of spiritual energy around him dimmed a fraction. Under the erosion of demonic power and thoughts, his originally upright and solemn expression gradually became twisted.

Ning Zhuo had already regained his calm.

His gait became steady, as if what was wreaking havoc in his body was not the terrifying Demon Seed, but a gentle breeze.

Seeing this scene, the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivators were all greatly shaken, their reactions enthusiastic.

-----
At this very moment.

Deep within the Demon Subjugation Hall, at the lowest level of the dungeon.

In a dim cell, an elder with disheveled white hair and a withered, skeletal appearance was staring fixedly at Ning Zhuo's figure through a water mirror in front of him. His body emitted a thick aura of death, his dry skin clinging to his bones, but his eyes shone with a terrifying brightness.

If Ning Zhuo were here, he would find this person's appearance quite familiar.

That's right, he was Zhou Sumuo himself!

The real Zhou Sumuo - the former deacon of the Demon Subjugation Hall who had fought to seal the Blood Fog Demon Seed eighty years ago, was ultimately parasitized by it, and had been imprisoned here waiting for death for the rest of his life.

At this moment, watching Ning Zhuo's performance, his withered, stick-like fingers trembled violently.

"Good... Good... Good!"

He said the word "good" three times in a row, his voice hoarse like a broken bellows, but his eyes welled up with a joy bordering on madness.

"A vigorous foundation, a will like iron... This is the heir I want! This is the best candidate to perfectly suppress the Demon Seed, inherit its power, and use demons to control demons!"

Zhong Dao stood beside him, hands clasped behind his back, watching the scene in the water mirror.

He shook his head slightly. "Senior Brother, you should choose another heir. This Lu Xuan is quite good. Ning Zhuo... I cannot give him to you."

"Why can't you give him to me?!" Zhou Sumuo flew into a rage, questioning Zhong Dao. This was an agreement they had reached long before this second test of the Demon Subjugation Hall.

Zhong Dao shook his head. "I only promised to let you select an outstanding disciple from among them. I did not say you could designate anyone you pleased."

"Lu Xuan, Gu Huaijiu, Yun Niaoniao... these cultivators can also inherit the Demon Seed."

"They won't do!" Zhou Sumuo said decisively. "Lu Xuan's cultivation method is righteous, but it errs on the side of rigidity; he doesn't know how to adapt. Gu Huaijiu has a flaw in his character and is easily exploited by the Demon Seed. Yun Niaoniao is too gentle and severely lacks decisiveness."

He pointed at Ning Zhuo in the water mirror. "Only him! I want him!!"

Zhong Dao sighed deeply. "Senior Brother, you have been entangled with the Demon Seed for too long; your temperament has become so paranoid."

"Paranoid?" Zhou Sumuo sneered, his eyes terrifying. "Eighty years ago, I risked my life to seal the Demon Seed for the sake of the greater good. For eighty years, I have used my body as a prison to confine this demon, to fulfill my duty. Now that I am about to die, I only want to find a successor to continue suppressing this scourge, the Demon Seed, and turn it to righteous use - am I wrong?"

Zhong Dao sighed. "You are not wrong, but Ning Zhuo is not suitable."

"How is he not suitable?!" Zhou Sumuo roared. "Aside from you, I have never seen such an outstanding youth! If such a person is not suitable, who else in the world is?!"

Zhong Dao shook his head. "It is precisely because he is so outstanding that he should not inherit the Demon Seed."

Zhong Dao's voice was calm. "Senior Brother Changqing, the Demon Seed is ultimately an external object, and even more so, a shackle. Inheriting the Demon Seed certainly allows one to obtain powerful strength in a short time, but the demonic nature invades, gradually changing one's temperament, and will eventually limit the upper bounds of their Dao Path. A genius like Ning Zhuo has limitless potential relying solely on his own cultivation. Why must you ruin his future?"

"Hehehe. I don't care!" Zhou Sumuo laughed, his face full of madness. "Zhong Dao, I will say this one last time: Ning Zhuo is my only choice. If you do not allow it, then I would rather let the Demon Seed rot inside my body. After I die, let it explode right here. When that happens, you can clean up the mess yourself!"

Zhong Dao gave him a deep look, and his figure gradually vanished from the spot.

The two parted on bad terms.

-----
In the trial grounds.

Waves of intense survival instinct wrapped around Ning Zhuo's mind like venomous snakes, whispering temptations: "Why go back to die?"

"Leave with the Demon Seed, live in seclusion and cultivate. When you completely master the Demon Seed and emerge again, who will be your match?"

"To live and become strong, this is the original intention of a cultivator. Those so-called greater goods and responsibilities are merely shackles for the weak."

Ning Zhuo sighed from the bottom of his heart. "What a formidable Demon Seed. It speaks so persuasively that even I am somewhat moved, as if I were a person of the Demonic Path myself."

"But I know all this. These are not my thoughts; this is just the Demon Seed influencing me!"

Ning Zhuo's steps paused slightly.

He had reached the end of the mountain path. The outline of the mountain gate, representing the sect, was faintly visible in the moonlight. The dense forests on both sides represented the final chance to "carry the Demon Seed and flee into seclusion."

The moment of true decision had arrived.

Ning Zhuo let out a light chuckle and stepped directly forward, walking toward the mountain gate, displaying utmost determination and composure.

When he finally stepped through the mountain gate, the entire trial scene dissipated with a boom.

Gu Huaijiu, Lu Xuan, Yun Niaoniao, and the others appeared next to Ning Zhuo one after another.

Ning Zhuo looked around; he and a dozen other cultivators were standing within a grand formation. The Demon Subjugation Hall's formation hummed, slowly coming to a halt.

"The second test of the Demon Subjugation Hall is concluded."

"First place - Ning Zhuo!" The elderly cultivator in charge of the main formation shouted.

The voice spread throughout the venue; no one raised an objection.

The many Demon Subjugation Hall cultivators who maintained the formation and watched the whole process discussed in low voices, almost all praising Ning Zhuo.

The remaining cultivators looked at each other, observing each other's sorry states, and then seeing Ning Zhuo's calm and breezy demeanor, they all understood the gap between them. In particular, Yun Niaoniao, Lu Xuan, and Gu Huaijiu felt it most deeply.

Ning Zhuo's first place was truly deserved!

The Demon Subjugation Hall immediately distributed rewards. Any cultivator who passed the second test received generous rewards.

Ning Zhuo's was the most special.

"Fellow Daoist Ning, you are the top ranker this time. The Hall Master will personally distribute your reward. Please, this way." A cultivator actively guided Ning Zhuo away from the grand formation.

At the main hall of the Demon Subjugation Hall, Ning Zhuo paid his respects to Zhong Dao.

Zhong Dao waved his sleeve, and a warm, lustrous jade slip flew toward Ning Zhuo.

"This is the inventory list of the Demon Subjugation Hall's A-grade treasury. You may choose any one item from it as the reward for first place."

Ning Zhuo received the jade slip with both hands but did not check it immediately. Instead, he looked up at Zhong Dao and bowed solemnly. "This junior has a request. I do not know if it is appropriate to speak."

"Speak freely."

Ning Zhuo then mentioned the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone.

Zhong Dao was slightly stunned, then shook his head and laughed. "You brat, you have quite the appetite."

But in the next moment, his tone changed, his voice resonating throughout the hall. "However - if you do not select a reward this time, and wait until you formally join the Demon Subjugation Hall and achieve three A-grade great merits for the sect, this Seat can make the decision to formally bestow the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone upon you!"

As soon as these words came out, sounds of people sucking in cold air filled the great hall.

The White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone!

That was the symbol of the Demon Subjugation Hall, its foundation, the treasure that anchored the Hall! Since the founding of the Demon Subjugation Hall, there had never been a precedent of bestowing it upon a disciple, or even an elder!

But for Ning Zhuo, Zhong Dao made a direct promise. This made everyone realize once again how deeply the former appreciated the latter.

The gazes of the many Demon Subjugation Hall cultivators present changed as they looked at Ning Zhuo!

Ning Zhuo thought seriously for a few breaths, then solemnly thanked Zhong Dao, stating that he wanted to look at the treasury list first.

Zhong Dao naturally granted permission.
