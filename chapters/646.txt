Chapter 646: Luo Si! Young Master!

Given the Qing-Jiao Army's current state, engaging in a direct confrontation was like throwing an egg at a rock.

"This isn't the time to conserve resources."

"Qing Chi, disregard logistics consumption. Use that move!" Ning Zhuo shouted.

"Understood." Qing Chi immediately acted.

Military Formation - Money-Penetrating Ghost!

The military seed exploded with blinding light within Qing Chi's divine sea.

The vast stockpile of military logistics, prepared in advance, poured out like a flood—ten percent, thirty percent, fifty percent, eighty percent!

Guided by her sharp intuition, Qing Chi drained eighty percent of the military seed's stored logistics, unleashing a world-shattering power.

Under the influence of the military strategy, countless ghostly creatures, like Luo Si before them, rebelled on the spot and pledged allegiance to Qing Chi.

Blood streamed from Qing Chi's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth as she strained to maintain control, issuing military commands.

These ghostly creatures converged into a massive tide, overwhelming the remaining Imperial Guard.

The great battle finally came to an end.

"I can't believe we actually won!"

"Did we really kill all of them?"

The Qing-Jiao Army gradually reacted, their faces a mix of shock and disbelief at their own achievements.

Throughout the fierce battle, they had endured immense psychological pressure. Their enemies had been overwhelmingly powerful, their numbers far surpassing their own.

Yet after Luo Si's betrayal, the course of the battle had taken an utterly absurd turn, culminating in this astonishing outcome!

"No wonder Ash Bone Elder instructed me to prioritize capturing these ghostly creatures while commanding the Living Realm's armies and bring them back here," Luo Si said. After a moment of rest to stabilize his injuries, he slowly flew before the Qing-Jiao Army.

Facing Ning Zhuo, he clasped his fists and said, "This humble general, Luo Si, pays his respects to Young Master."

In an instant, countless surprised and curious gazes turned toward Luo Si and Ning Zhuo.

Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo), merely at the Foundation Establishment Stage, had persuaded a Nascent Soul-level great general to defect. Moreover, this general was an enemy commander who had defected in the midst of battle.

Although Luo Si had once brought great suffering and casualties to White Paper Immortal City, the Qing-Jiao Army had to admit that without his last-minute betrayal, they would have faced certain annihilation in this crisis.

From this perspective, Luo Si was their savior.

It wasn't as if no Qing-Jiao soldiers had died defending White Paper Immortal City.

For a moment, the Qing-Jiao soldiers' emotions were complex.

Jiao Ma's father trembled slightly, his lips trembling with emotion.

He had long suspected his son's true identity.

A father knows his son best, especially after years of close observation. How could he not understand his son's true capabilities?

But life has a fundamental truth: sometimes it's best to remain blissfully ignorant.

Why dwell on the details?

Whether Jiao Ma was truly Jiao Ma or not, this version of him was undeniably the most advantageous for the Jiao Clan!

For the sake of the entire Jiao Clan's interests, Jiao Ma's father had long ago committed all the clan's able-bodied members to the White Paper Immortal City's faction. Only the elderly, infirm, and disabled were sent away from the Ghostly Black Marshlands.

For the good of the clan, even he himself was willing to be sacrificed.

So why couldn't his son, Jiao Ma, be sacrificed as well?

Naturally, he was also within the scope of sacrifice!

By sacrificing Jiao Ma alone, they had gained such tremendous benefits. Though Jiao Ma's father secretly grieved, he was also overjoyed.

He wasn't just a father; he was the clan leader!

Having a "Jiao Ma" like this meant the Jiao Clan was rolling in it!

Now, witnessing Luo Si, a Nascent Soul-level Great General, defect in mid-battle and prostrate himself in submission—

Jiao Ma's biological father was nearly overwhelmed with happiness!

He couldn't believe it, feeling as if he were in a dream, something utterly inconceivable.

"So what if I can't believe it?"

"This is reality!"

He secretly pinched his thigh, wincing at the pain, and inwardly shouted, "Even more inconceivable! What if the Prefecture Lord himself were to submit? That wouldn't be beyond possibility!"

The Qing-Jiao Army was primarily composed of two clans: the Jiao Clan and the Ghost Clan Qing Family.

Jiao Ma's biological father's attitude represented the Jiao Clan's stance.

However, the cultivators of the Ghost Clan Qing Family harbored more complex emotions.

At that moment, Qing Chi cried out, breaking the deathly silence: "Heavens, Little Ma, you're incredible!"

"You're just as I expected, Jiao Ma!"

Jiao Ma's biological father shifted his gaze to Qing Chi, sighing inwardly: Ah... this foolish girl is still the same.

But perhaps this is also a kind of happiness.

Qing Yan opened his mouth as if to speak, but ultimately said nothing.

Ning Zhuo, however, turned his attention to the assembled ghostly creatures.

Among them were not only Luo Si's forces, but also several Ghost Kings meticulously cultivated by the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts.

Ning Zhuo looked up at the sky and sighed. "The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord defies the heavens, daring to attempt a blood sacrifice of the White Paper Immortal City. I, blessed by the Qi Luck of the Living Realm's Heaven, am the variable in this calamity—the bane of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord."

"I have long resolved to save the people from the flames of calamity."

He lowered his gaze to Luo Si. "Luo Si, for coming to aid me, abandoning darkness for light, I am deeply grateful!"

Luo Si accepted the acknowledgment, standing tall with a calm gaze. "Though I died in the Living Realm and became a ghostly creature, I have always yearned for the light."

"We owe much to Ash Bone Elder, who began his painstaking scheming and strategic planning a century ago."

"Without his guidance, I would never have met you, my lord."

Ning Zhuo nodded and sighed. "Exactly. Once I dismantle the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's schemes, I will certainly pay my respects to this venerable elder!"

With Luo Si's formal submission, the battle's outcome was sealed.

The Qing-Jiao Army achieved a decisive victory.

The true winner, however, was neither Qing Chi nor the Jiao Clan, but Ning Zhuo himself.

The unexpected defection of a Nascent Soul-level Great General filled Ning Zhuo with boundless delight.

Yet he knew that his greatest enemy yet awaited him. Suppressing his joy, he focused on strategizing his next move.

His gaze pierced through the former position of the Imperial Guard's formation, revealing a towering, pitch-black Cloud Wall.

"Luo Si," he asked, "how do we breach this fortress?"

Luo Si frowned, deep in thought. "Young Master, I was only recently dispatched to assist with defense. My appointment as commander of this campaign against White Paper Immortal City was a fluke, a scapegoat position. I haven't truly earned their trust."

His unspoken implication was clear: he didn't know either.

Ning Zhuo nodded, his mind stirring.

He had quietly noticed a subtle detail: although Luo Si had voluntarily pledged allegiance, he addressed Ning Zhuo as "Young Master" rather than "Lord."

Unlike Yuan Dasheng, this showed that Luo Si still held back, maintaining a cautious stance.

"It seems we still have a long way to go before Luo Si will truly submit."

"Indeed."

"I'm only at the Foundation Establishment stage, while he's a Nascent Soul-level expert. Whether in terms of command or individual combat power, he's far beyond ordinary!"

Both the defense of White Paper Immortal City and Luo Si's recent formation-assisted execution of Immortal Hanyan had demonstrated the Si Yuan Ghost General's terrifying overall strength.

Convincing such a formidable expert to submit wouldn't be easy.

This distance might prove to be quite lengthy.

Ning Zhuo didn't dwell on this. The most pressing task remained dismantling the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-old scheme!

Luo Si continued, "There are two matters I must report to you, Young Master."

"First, my orders to besiege White Paper Immortal City were actually a command for blood sacrifice. The casualties on both sides—White Paper Immortal City's defenders and my own troops—were all part of the ritual."

"I withdrew because I had already met the blood sacrifice's requirements."

"Second, my service record is kept in the City Lord's Mansion of Forgetful River Immortal City. Immortal Hanyan's earlier threats were not empty."

"Therefore, I urge you to make full use of me while I still remain!"

Ning Zhuo felt another stirring in his heart, grasping the art of interacting with Luo Si.

This guy lives up to his reputation—constantly thinking deeply but only expressing part of his thoughts.

To communicate with someone like this, you must understand the unspoken words and the true intentions hidden within his speech!

Ning Zhuo understood this all too well.

He had spent over a decade enduring in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, studying people all the while.

His imagined adversaries were the City Lord's Mansion and several Nascent Soul-level experts. Coupled with the Ning Clan's oppressive and even hostile environment, these goals and experiences had given him a profound understanding of human nature far beyond his years.

Without hesitation, he let out a derisive laugh, his contempt for the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord plain.

"Though the Blood Sacrifice has been achieved, the reliance on the Imperial Guard's active defense and the deployment of your troops for assistance proves the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is still far from true mastery."

"I have come, guided by the Living Realm's Qi Luck, as the greatest tribulation to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's attempt to defy heaven and alter fate!"

"This mission will undoubtedly succeed, and I will have ample time!"

Ning Zhuo's gaze flashed like lightning, his derisive laughter brimming with unwavering confidence in victory.

He turned to Luo Si again, his gaze piercing as if it could reach the very depths of the Ghost General's soul. "Let me tell you one more thing."

"I've already dispatched another contingent of my military might, their advance directly targeting Forgetful River Immortal City!"

"The subordinate you met earlier is one of my capable lieutenants, leading that very force."

"That army's strength far surpasses ours. It's a hidden reserve left behind by the Profound Primordial Scholar, commanded by an exceptionally powerful leader. Someone like Immortal Hanyan would likely be defeated in a single exchange."

Luo Si nodded calmly, remaining silent, but his heart stirred.

Ning Zhuo's overwhelming confidence was infectious.

More importantly, Ning Zhuo's response resonated deeply with him.

On one hand, Ning Zhuo's strategic deployment alleviated much of Luo Si's survival pressure. On the other, their interaction felt effortless and natural.

Ning Zhuo seemed to grasp Luo Si's unspoken thoughts and responded with pinpoint precision.

At that moment, Luo Si felt as if he were basking in a gentle spring breeze beside Ning Zhuo.

Is this just a fluke of exceptional performance?

He's still so young!

As he hurried his troops to the Cloud Battlefield, he received a divine sense transmission from the Ash Bone Elder.

The Ash Bone Elder directly told him that he would meet his wise ruler here and should not hesitate to pledge his allegiance. This was the greatest opportunity and turning point of Luo Si's life!

Luo Si's heart surged with emotion, but he maintained a calm expression as he carefully surveyed the battlefield.

As he observed, he became deeply captivated by Ning Zhuo.

At that moment, Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan were facing off against Immortal Hanyan. Though battered, their performance was remarkably impressive.

After all, Ning Zhuo was still only at the Foundation Establishment stage, yet he wielded such profound mastery of Five Elements Spells and demonstrated exceptional skill in commanding military might.

His formidable physical body, soul, and the aura of cultivating three dantians simultaneously, all at such a young age, made him truly a one-in-ten-thousand prodigy, utterly extraordinary!

Even Immortal Hanyan secretly marveled at Ning Zhuo's brilliance, stoking his resolve to kill him.

Luo Si grew increasingly excited the more he watched.

He had been waiting for this moment for years!

This was what the Ash Bone Elder had foretold long ago, and Luo Si had placed complete trust in his words.

Wise ruler... Wise ruler... I've finally found you!

Though his heart churned with emotion, Luo Si restrained himself, maintaining a composed expression as he calmly executed his move.

With this single, decisive strike, he shattered the stalemate, completely overturning the course of the battle!

Though this act of surrender didn't align with his original plans, Ning Zhuo didn't want to give the future Mingzhu a negative impression of a traitor during their first meeting.

But he had no choice!

If he didn't act, Hanyun would kill the Mingzhu.

To mitigate this negative impression, Luo Si delivered a stirring proclamation at the critical moment. He had racked his brains to craft this document!

Of course, his outward demeanor remained calm and detached, as deep as the Abyss.

Qing Chi's gaze fixed on Ning Zhuo, filled with admiration and a newfound reverence. "Little Ma, tell us what to do. We'll follow your lead!"

Ning Zhuo glanced at Qing Chi, gave a soft affirmation, then turned his piercing gaze toward the distant Black Cloud Wall.

His outward confidence was one thing; the nervousness in his heart was another.

When it came to surface appearances, this youth who had endured years of suppression had honed his composure to rival even Luo Si's.

"We'll have to take a calculated risk and probe the situation," Ning Zhuo thought. No sooner had the thought crossed his mind than the situation shifted.

Boom... rumble...

The towering Black Cloud Wall began to churn, releasing plumes of Earth Lung Turbid Qi.

The turbid qi surged with overwhelming force, pushing aside the Cloud Wall and expanding outward, forming an even greater and thicker barrier!

At the Sacrificial Altar, a branch of the Forgetful River flowed around it, within which lay the slumbering True Form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

Meanwhile, his Divided Spirit, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, intensified his assault on the Ice Coffin while channeling the turbid qi into a Turbid Qi Sky Curtain, greatly enhancing his defenses.

The moment Luo Si defected, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God immediately sent a message back to the base.

By now, Luo Si should have been cursed to death by Immortal Hanyan during their confrontation.

Yet he still lived.

Clearly, something had gone wrong at the base, the Forgetful River Immortal City!

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God naturally heard Ning Zhuo's confident declaration. To claim he wasn't apprehensive would be a lie.

What he truly feared wasn't Ning Zhuo himself, but the Qi Luck of the Living Realm!

Although Ning Zhuo was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, his combat prowess rivaled that of Nascent Soul-level experts—a rare phenomenon.

Moreover, the fact that General Luo Si, a high-ranking officer, had defected mid-battle proved that Ning Zhuo was the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's greatest calamity!

The Cloud Wall was formed by the Grand Formation, but this Grand Formation could be disrupted from the outside.

Any disruption to the Formation would inevitably affect the Sacrificial Altar. The backlash from its destruction would bolster the enemy's strength.

To prevent this, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God decisively shattered the Cloud Wall and adopted the most conservative strategy, deploying his most potent means to create the strongest possible defense.

This defense manifested as a thick, viscous, and roiling Turbid Qi Sky Curtain.

"With this Sky Curtain, I can buy more time."

"Fighting a Child of Destiny like this, the crux lies in the contest of Qi Luck!"

"I must retrieve the Nether Dragon Scissors from the Ice Coffin and deliver it to my True Form."

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God understood the critical importance of this.

However, the Ice Coffin was formed from the Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle, a masterpiece and trump card of the current Ghostfire Prefecture Lord. Only eight other Fire Candles could rival its power.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's methods were limited, and eroding the Ice Coffin would require tremendous effort and time.

With no other choice, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God had no alternative but to proceed.

The two National Artifacts for suppressing Qi Luck, the Nether Dragon Scissors and the Lord of Forgetful River Seal, were the optimal solutions. The Nether Dragon Scissors were within reach, but the Lord of Forgetful River Seal was already embedded within the Grand Formation, suppressing the Soundless Ghost Monk's Lifebound Buddha Wheel. Retrieving it now would cause the Lifebound Buddha Wheel to stir up trouble again!

If the Lifebound Buddha Wheel were unleashed, might it summon the Soundless Ghost Monk back?

That was a very real possibility!

Ning Zhuo led the group, standing before the Turbid Qi Sky Curtain.

They took turns employing various methods, but the results were as discouraging as trying to scrape off the qi—utterly ineffective.

More and more expectant gazes turned toward Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo couldn't think of a way to break the deadlock. Though he maintained a calm facade, inwardly he grew increasingly anxious.

Luo Si cleared his throat and paused his efforts.

His injuries still lingered, and his condition was far from optimal. Sensing the vibrations within his Storage Belt, he retrieved a luminous goose.

This luminous goose was a transformed form of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, which Luo Si had forcefully sealed. However, the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale was a treasured artifact left by the Profound Primordial Scholar, possessing profound and immense power. Luo Si's seal was only temporary, not permanent, and now needed to be reinforced.

"Hmm?" In that instant, Ning Zhuo's gaze was irresistibly drawn to the luminous goose!
