Chapter 641: Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan vs. Immortal Hanyan

Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and the others remained on high alert throughout their journey.

As they penetrated deep into the Cloud Layer, they encountered no obstacles whatsoever.

"Strange. Why is there no ambush?"

"Could it be that the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord faced a formidable enemy and his defenses have been completely dismantled?"

The Ash Bone Elder had once guided Sun Lingtong, explaining that the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, defying the natural order, would inevitably be entangled and suppressed by his own Qi Luck, plagued by calamities, and ultimately reduced to Nascent Soul-level combat prowess by the time of their final confrontation.

Ning Zhuo rubbed the Mechanism Ring on his finger.

Throughout their entire ascension, the Mechanism Ring had remained dormant.

His confidence stemmed not only from this magical artifact but also from his mother.

"Mother would never harm me!"

"If Mother sent me here, she must have ensured my safety."

"At worst, there will be some challenges to overcome."

"Perhaps the defending forces have already been annihilated. With the Qing-Jiao Army and Military Power Amplification, I can challenge the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord!"

While Ning Zhuo pondered, Qing Yan had already taken action.

As a Golden Core-level cultivator, he began channeling military might and unleashing spells.

The spell's immense power left even Qing Yan momentarily awestruck, a surge of satisfaction washing over him.

Yet when his signature technique struck the roiling black clouds, it barely dissipated a thin layer, revealing only a tiny gap that was almost negligible compared to the vast expanse of darkness.

Within moments, the small opening vanished, swiftly filled by the encroaching clouds.

Qing Yan stared in astonishment.

"What now?" Many soldiers of the Qing-Jiao Army halted, hovering in the sky.

"Let me handle this!" Qing Chi stepped forward, her fists blazing with azure flames.

The fiery fists struck the black clouds, but like Qing Yan's earlier efforts, they proved futile.

"Mother never warned me about this."

"It seems we'll need to carefully probe for weaknesses to make any progress!"

Just as this thought crossed her mind, Qing Chi frowned, her anger flaring. "I refuse to believe this is impossible!"

She charged toward the black clouds.

Qing Yan shouted urgently, "Don't be reckless... uh."

In the next instant, a dark aura surged around Qing Chi, yin wind swirling violently. Like a drop of water merging into the ocean, she vanished into the heart of the black clouds.

Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up. "Could it be...?"

Immediately, Qing Chi emerged again, exclaiming excitedly, "It's a Divine Art!"

Ning Zhuo's speculation had been confirmed, and he couldn't contain his excitement. "Although the Night Wanderer is a common deity, that one we just encountered was extraordinary. The Divine Art it granted us actually has the power to pierce through obstacles."

Jiao Ma's father sighed. "Night Wanderer, Night Wanderer... Even from its name alone, one can see the divine power to roam freely across the world, transcending all obstacles."

This revelation filled the entire Qing-Jiao Army with delight.

What were they waiting for?

Qing Chi was about to give the order when Ning Zhuo held out a hand. "Not so fast."

First, he recalled Qing Chi. Then, he dispatched a small team deeper into the black cloud for reconnaissance.

Within the black cloud, the defending troops stood at high alert.

The remaining two Nascent Soul-level cultivators exchanged glances, urgently consulting each other.

Mother of a Hundred Ghosts looked alarmed. "This cultivation army is truly strange! A Divine Art cast across the entire army can so easily pierce through the Formation's barrier!"

"They've sent out scouts. How should we respond?"

Immortal Hanyan's expression turned grave. "Would a mouse ever provoke an elephant? This Cultivation army seems both reckless and cautious—both likely just pretenses."

"We should remain steadfast and vigilant, maintaining a strict defensive posture!"

The two were clearly still shaken by the previous ambush by powerful foes.

Originally, there had been five Nascent Soul-level Cultivators, but now only two remained, both injured and unable to recover fully.

Moreover, they had never truly engaged in direct combat, often being caught in the crossfire of clashes between stronger opponents.

Crucially, the True Form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had issued orders to defend rigorously and buy as much time as possible.

Though unaware of the specific events on the Altar Battlefield, they inferred from the Prefecture Lord's commands that their lord must have sustained severe injuries.

Under these circumstances, they dared not take any risks.

A scouting party ventured into the black clouds and, upon sighting the 10,000-strong Imperial Guard standing at full alert, was startled and hastily reported back.

Upon receiving this military intelligence, Qing Chi, Ning Zhuo, and the others paled.

The Qing-Jiao Army numbered only a few hundred soldiers, and being a newly formed unit, they stood no chance against the Imperial Guard.

Qing Chi, unsure of what to do, turned to her lover for guidance.

Ning Zhuo frowned, deep in thought.

"We must fight!" Qing Yan suddenly declared, clenching his fists, his eyes burning with conviction. "This is just a bluff! If they were truly so powerful, they could have easily sent a small force to intercept us halfway here!"

"Why are they holed up here?"

"They must be weak—severely depleted—and using illusions to deceive us!"

"By charging in, we'll shatter their facade!"

Qing Chi's eyes lit up. "Father, you're just as formidable as I thought!"

Qing Yan puffed out his chest, snorting dismissively. "What nonsense! Your old man has always been strong."

Ning Zhuo rubbed his Mechanism Ring, his expression grave. "Mother entrusted me with this mission. If we fail, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme will succeed, bringing untold suffering upon the world."

"Let's charge in!"

With Ning Zhuo's resolve firm, Qing Chi naturally followed.

The Qing-Jiao Army dove into the black clouds as one.

Witnessing this, Immortal Hanyan and Mother of a Hundred Ghosts' expressions darkened.

"They've clearly scouted the area already!" Immortal Hanyan said. "With the enemy stronger than us, they wouldn't come to fight unless they had some advantage!"

"This is obviously a trap to lure us in!" Mother of a Hundred Ghosts added. "When we clash, we must hold our formations steady. No impulsive moves—don't give the enemy an opening."

"Activate the Formation first! Neutralize the Divine Power in their bodies!"

The two communicated through divine sense, quickly agreeing on their battle strategy.

The Formation hummed to life, emitting beams of black light that illuminated the space within the clouds.

The moment the Qing-Jiao Army penetrated the clouds, they were suppressed. They plummeted down until their feet touched the solidified black clouds, which, bound by restrictions and stabilized by the Formation, felt like solid ground beneath their feet.

The two armies faced each other.

The Qing-Jiao Army scrambled to reorganize their formations, while the Forgetful River Prefecture's defenders remained utterly motionless.

Ning Zhuo focused his gaze and observed that the enemy soldiers were universally wounded, some even dragging severely injured bodies. They had clearly just endured a fierce battle and hadn't had time to rest or heal.

His gaze settled on the two enemy commanders.

On the left stood a figure like a human-shaped wisp of cold smoke, his features blurred and indistinct, radiating an icy chill. Countless icicles floated around him.

This was Immortal Hanyan.

On the right was a hunchbacked figure leaning on a staff, her black robe occasionally shimmering with pale, agonized faces—countless faces, each twisted in pain and despair.

This was the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts.

Both emanated the aura of Nascent Soul cultivators, anchoring the enemy's central forces.

Qing Chi bristled with impatience, but Qing Yan restrained her. "We've already pushed the enemy to this point. There's no need to rush this momentary advantage."

"Let's probe their defenses first."

Ning Zhuo glanced at him and nodded slightly.

He tossed his hand, summoning a horde of Mechanical Puppets, which he sent charging into the enemy lines.

But before they could advance a hundred paces, they were blasted to scrap by the enemy's spells and firepower.

The Ten Thousand Streams defenders remained steadfast, relying solely on ranged attacks.

Ning Zhuo frowned, thoughts swirling in his divine sea:

Is this a Formation disguise, or do they have some unspoken weakness?

It's a pity the Qing-Jiao Army's Military Seed is so homogeneous; they can't accommodate my Mechanism troops.

Otherwise, I could replicate the advantages I had in the Two Note Kingdom.

The Qing-Jiao Army had just been established, its Military Seed consisting solely of Paper Money Spirit Envoys. Ning Zhuo's Mechanical Puppets were far too different from these spirit envoys to gain recognition within the army's hierarchy.

Moreover, the Military Armament lacked treasures like the Military Registry, leaving them with no viable alternatives.

Qing Yan suddenly suggested, "Given the current situation, we should take the initiative as commanders. By probing their defenses, we can discern their true capabilities before ordering a full-scale assault. Alternatively, we could have them provide Military Might Amplification for us."

Ning Zhuo nodded. "That's our only option."

Qing Chi struck her palm with her fist, her eyes gleaming with determination. "Excellent! I'll take on that old woman first."

"Dad, why don't you try attacking that cold Qi smoke figure?"

Qing Yan waved his hand. "No, you're the commander. Stay here and oversee the troops. Jiao Ma's father and I will go."

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "As the Great General, Qing Chi shouldn't act rashly. I'll make the first move."

Jiao Ma's father opened his mouth to volunteer, but Ning Zhuo's firm expression cut him off with a single word: "This is final!"

Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan stepped out of the army ranks, striding into the no-man's-land between the two forces. They raised their voices, challenging the enemy to send out their champions.

"Something's amiss."

"The enemy is trying to lure us into a trap again. What tricks do they have up their sleeve?" Immortal Hanyan and Mother of a Hundred Ghosts exchanged divine senses, their suspicions reignited.

"Currently, there are only two of us left as Imperial Guard Commanders. I'll go out to fight, and you stay to command the troops. If anything happens to me, we won't be left in a position of having soldiers but no leader," Immortal Hanyan said.

Mother of a Hundred Ghosts nodded. "My injuries are indeed more severe than yours. Do your best to buy time, and I'll secretly do everything I can to recover!"

After settling their plan, Immortal Hanyan stepped out of the military formation and shouted, "One Golden Core and one Foundation Establishment cultivator! I alone can satisfy both of your death wishes!"

"Come, hand over your lives!"

Qing Yan and Ning Zhuo exchanged a glance, then attacked simultaneously without hesitation.

Immortal Hanyan focused his gaze on Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan, and with a thought, the icicles floating around him shot forth.

As they soared into the air, their speed multiplied, transforming into streaks of freezing light that surged in power by over tenfold.

Ning Zhuo, already prepared, reacted swiftly. He activated his Earth Element Technique, channeling the power of the Earth Element Spleen Temple and amplifying it with Military Might. A thick wall of Wutu earth rose from the ground before him.

Qing Yan relied on the earthen wall for defense, refusing to dodge. He held his long spear, unleashing a flurry of azure spear flowers.

The azure spear flowers shot forth like a shower of blossoms, enveloping the charging Immortal Hanyan.

With a thought, Immortal Hanyan sent out over a dozen icicles, transforming them into frost shields that intercepted the azure spear flowers mid-flight.

The earthen wall was pierced through by the icy spears!

The thick earthen wall offered only a fleeting resistance before being completely breached.

Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan reacted swiftly, dodging the attack.

The remaining earthen wall instantly froze into a solid block of ice.

Thud, thud, thud...

A series of muffled impacts echoed as all the spear flowers were blocked by the frost shields, their momentum sapped, inexorably heading toward annihilation.

Surprise flickered across the faces of Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan.

It wasn't just them; Qing Chi and the others watching from behind also felt their hearts jolt.

This was merely a probing attack, yet Immortal Hanyan had already demonstrated overwhelming combat prowess.

Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan had the advantage of Military Power Amplification, but Immortal Hanyan possessed the same. Moreover, as the commander of the Imperial Guard, Immortal Hanyan held a clear advantage in this regard!

Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan could leverage various techniques to enhance their combat power. But Immortal Hanyan inherently possessed Nascent Soul-level cultivation and combat strength!

As Immortal Hanyan closed the distance, his assault intensified.

With a flick of his sleeve, Immortal Hanyan unleashed vast waves of the Profound Yin Cold Tide. With a curl of his finger, countless razor-sharp Profound Ice spikes erupted from the ground like bamboo shoots. With a wave of his palm, countless Ice Soul Needles coalesced in the sky and rained down.

As the battle began in earnest, Immortal Hanyan immediately gained the upper hand. Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan frantically dodged, occasionally managing a desperate counterattack, looking utterly battered and disheveled.

Ning Zhuo cycled through Five Elements Spells, channeling the spiritual power of his five viscera into every strike, while simultaneously drawing upon his Military Might. Without this dual amplification, he would be utterly unfit to participate in such a battle.

His sharp Metal Element Spells, which could usually take lives, now barely managed to pierce the ice barriers. His surging Water Element Spells froze in place the moment they manifested. His scorching Fire Element Spells quickly sputtered out under the crushing cold. His Earth Element Technique, usually his primary defense, proved as fragile as paper. His Wood Element Spells struggled to grow forests and vines, only to be swiftly frozen to death.

Qing Yan faced similar struggles. His magic artifacts were rapidly depleted, cracks spreading across his Lifebound Treasure, and he coughed blood with each strike, fighting on the verge of collapse.

Qing Chi watched with fury and growing anxiety, itching to join the battle. But Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan simultaneously sent her stern warnings through their divine sense, forcefully dissuading her from intervening.

The enemy had only sent a single fighter, but if their own commander joined the battle, they would be even more passive.

Immortal Hanyan sneered. "Two little mice, how audacious. Go die."

Ice Technique: Frozen Kill Line!

Immortal Hanyan's icy aura condensed into a finger, from which a pale blue ice line shot forth.

The ice line emitted a white light as it streaked silently through the air. Wherever it passed, even the space around it was affected, leaving behind a trail of icy blue frost.

"Damn it!" Qing Yan's hair stood on end, sensing mortal danger.

He erupted with all his strength to dodge, but the surrounding cold rapidly closed in, enveloping him and slowing his movements.

He could only activate his magic treasure shield to block the attack.

The ice line sliced through the shield as easily as a sharp blade cutting through tofu.

Qing Yan suffered a rebound, coughing up a mouthful of blood. Seizing the opportunity, he twisted his body to avoid his vital points.

The result was that the ice line severed one forearm and half a leg.

No blood flowed from the wounds; instead, they instantly froze over. The terrifying cold rapidly spread through his limbs, drilling toward his vital organs.

Immortal Hanyan flicked his finger, and the pale blue ice line swiped toward Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo let out a soft shout, channeling spiritual energy to erect thick barriers of Earth and Wood Elements.

The ice line pierced through his defenses in three breaths.

Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng!

At this critical moment, Ning Zhuo played his trump card.

Yuan Dasheng shielded Ning Zhuo, forcefully shoving him backward.
