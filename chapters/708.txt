Chapter 708: Secret Meeting at Dragon Loach Mountain

Southern Bean Kingdom.

Ten Thousand Medicines Sect.

"Father, you called for me?" Lin Shanshan asked as she entered the study, a hint of resentment in her voice. "I'm busy preparing for battle. If it weren't urgent..."

After Ning Zhuo left, he entrusted the Spirit Hidden Willow to the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, leaving Hua Guzi to care for the tree.

Lin Shanshan and Hua Guzi's relationship had started off rocky, quickly spiraling into intense rivalry.

Their clashes began in the training grounds, but as they sparred, a peculiar camaraderie blossomed.

The two women became close friends, yet remained fierce rivals, locked in a love-hate dynamic.

Driven by their competitive spirit, Lin Shanshan and Hua Guzi had both made remarkable progress in their cultivation, becoming the two most dazzling figures in the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect's training grounds.

Their win-loss records were nearly even, but in their last match, Lin Shanshan had narrowly lost to Hua Guzi. Determined to redeem herself, she had been training relentlessly, preparing for a rematch.

Lin Bufan, her father, was well aware of this situation.

He couldn't help but feel pleased with this development. After all, his beloved daughter had shown remarkable diligence and rapid progress in her cultivation during their rivalry.

Lin Bufan handed a letter to Lin Shanshan, and with a single sentence, he banished the resentful look from his daughter's face: "This is a letter from Ning Zhuo."

"Ah! Ning Zhuo finally wrote to me?!" Lin Shanshan exclaimed, her face lighting up with joy.

Suppressing his irritation, Lin Bufan shook his head with a cold smile. "It's addressed to me. I just don't have the patience to explain it. Read it yourself first."

Lin Shanshan immediately unleashed her divine sense, scanning the letter repeatedly.

Her initial excitement faded, replaced by a hint of disappointment, though her tone remained cheerful. "I didn't realize Ning Zhuo had already reached the Flying Cloud Kingdom."

"I wonder what strange customs they have there?"

"How did he get so many Golden Cores? And all of them from the Ghost Path?"

"These are valuable, Father! Many medicinal formulas require Ghost Path Golden Cores as ingredients."

Seeing his daughter defend Ning Zhuo only deepened Lin Bufan's irritation. He shook his head again. "Many formulas? Can you name ten?"

Lin Shanshan rolled her eyes at him. "Father, why are you being so stubborn?"

"Ning Zhuo wants to reclaim the Spirit Hidden Willow and trade Ghost Path Golden Cores for it. This is a great opportunity!"

"Even if Ghost Path Golden Cores aren't common medicinal ingredients, such a precious material is still exceedingly rare. We could buy it now and resell it later for a profit."

Lin Bufan nodded slightly. "Your last point does make sense."

Lin Shanshan's face lit up with a smile.

"The Spirit Hidden Willow has fully recovered. Ning Zhuo must have an important purpose for wanting it."

"We need to secure it as soon as possible."

"If you ask me, we should form a trade caravan, load up with Medicinal Pills, Spirit Stones, and the Spirit Hidden Willow, and set off for the Flying Cloud Kingdom immediately."

"Father, the Spirit Hidden Willow is extremely rare and of vital importance. If something were to happen during a long journey, it would be disastrous. I can personally escort it, ensuring its safety every step of the way."

Lin Bufan stared at Lin Shanshan, his gaze piercing through her pretense. "You just want to see Ning Zhuo, don't you?"

Lin Shanshan blushed slightly but stood her ground. "Ning Zhuo is my friend and our ally. Of course I miss my friend."

"I'm sure Eldest Brother misses him too."

"Father, don't you miss him too?"

Lin Bufan shook his head. "My feelings can't possibly compare to yours."

His brow furrowed. "Didn't I tell you? Ning Zhuo has already settled down in Two Note Kingdom. His wife is none other than Mu Lan, the sole heir to General Mu's Residence!"

Lin Shanshan chuckled. "Father, you can keep up the act for a while, but I've already uncovered the truth about Thousand Peaks Forest. Ning Zhuo was forced into marriage with Mu Lan by a series of unfortunate circumstances."

"Their marriage is a sham, not genuine."

Lin Bufan tapped the table lightly with his knuckles. "And if it were real? I think they make a handsome couple."

Lin Shanshan's face darkened with displeasure. "Father, you're being unfair! If Mother were still alive..."

The mention of his deceased wife caused Lin Bufan's expression to falter. Struck at his weak spot, he sighed heavily. "Alright, alright. You know I only want what's best for you."

"Sigh... Take this letter and find Hua Guzi. Before leaving, Ning Zhuo arranged for her to care for the Spirit Hidden Willow."

"Alright," Lin Shanshan nodded, turning to leave, but paused. "Father, I want to join this trade caravan. You can't refuse me!"

Lin Bufan's heart stirred. He ventured, "Then what if I leave Hua Guzi behind and only let you join the caravan?"

Lin Shanshan froze, then gritted her teeth. "That... won't work! Hua Guzi and I are close friends. We agreed to compete fairly... she has to come too!"

She forced a bitter smile. "If we move the Spirit Hidden Willow, we can't hide it from her. Knowing her temperament, if we truly exclude her, she might even betray us."

Lin Bufan finally smiled, waving Lin Shanshan off. "Discuss it with her first. Forming a trade caravan isn't easy."

"Ning Zhuo mentioned in his letter that he's also using Ghost Path Golden Cores to trade with Zhu Xuanji. I'll send a letter to inquire about Zhu Xuanji's arrangements."

The Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, Southern Bean Zhu Clan, and Fire Persimmon Ning Clan had already forged a secret alliance.

The caravan needed to traverse the Two Note Kingdom and the Northwind Kingdom to reach the Flying Cloud Kingdom, a journey fraught with peril and extreme difficulty. While it wasn't impossible for the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect to accomplish this alone, the cost would be immense.

Under these circumstances, Lin Bufan naturally sought out Zhu Xuanji to inquire and discuss the possibility of cooperation.

However, just as Sect Leader Lin finished writing his letter, he received one from Zhu Xuanji himself.

It turned out that Ning Zhuo's letter had been relayed through postal stations across various regions until it reached the Southern Bean Kingdom.

The Southern Bean Kingdom was controlled by the Zhu Clan, so the distribution of such letters was naturally restricted.

Zhu Xuanji had received Ning Zhuo's letter a full day before Lin Bufan.

Upon reading Zhu Xuanji's reply, Lin Bufan immediately understood his intentions.

Zhu Xuanji had agreed to Ning Zhuo's proposal and would accompany the caravan to the Flying Cloud Kingdom, but he would not meet with Ning Zhuo directly. Instead, he instructed Lin Bufan to arrange a suitable representative.

Lin Bufan couldn't help but feel puzzled. "Divine Constable Zhu is the Golden Core-level public face of our kingdom's royal family. What urgent mission requires him to personally intervene?"

"With him escorting the trade caravan, I can finally rest easy," Lin Bufan thought, immediately penning a reply.

Within half a day, the letter reached Zhu Xuanji's hands.

Divine Constable Zhu extended his divine sense to read the message, his expression darkening with concern.

"I never expected Ning Zhuo to have already reached the Flying Cloud Kingdom."

"Sigh, I'm heading there myself. Fortunately, with the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect acting as our representative, I won't need to meet him."

"It's best to maintain distance from the Child of Destiny."

As for Lin Bufan's inquiry about why Zhu Xuanji was traveling to the Flying Cloud Kingdom, the constable could only maintain secrecy.

"This is a covert operation secretly agreed upon long ago between our kingdom and the Flying Cloud Kingdom. I cannot disclose the details to Lin Bufan."

"Ning Zhuo is at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main headquarters, while I'm heading to Dragon Loach Mountain."

"We won't cross paths. There's no chance of us meeting."

The Southern Bean Royal Family had deliberated extensively before selecting Zhu Xuanji for this mission.

Zhu Xuanji had long anticipated his selection. After all, a Nascent Soul-level cultivator entering another kingdom required a travel permit; otherwise, it would be considered an act of provocation.

However, this particular meeting between the Southern Bean Kingdom and the Flying Cloud Kingdom was not meant to be publicized. Therefore, obtaining a standard travel permit was impossible.

Under these circumstances, Zhu Xuanji, as the strongest Golden Core cultivator without the restrictions of a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, posed no risk of escalating tensions between the two nations even if his presence were revealed.

From this perspective alone, Zhu Xuanji was undoubtedly the ideal candidate.

Two Note Kingdom.

Capital City.

General Mu's Residence.

"Imperial decree arrives!" An envoy strode into the courtyard.

"We receive the decree," Old General Mu declared, leading the assembled cultivators in kneeling.

The envoy slowly unfurled the scroll and began reading aloud.

Among the cultivators, Mu Lan's expression shifted to surprise halfway through the announcement. "What? I'm to be sent as an envoy to the Flying Cloud Kingdom?"

A thought struck her. "Hmm, this is a good opportunity."

"Ning Zhuo sent a letter the day before yesterday requesting a trade for Ghost Path Golden Cores. I was just considering organizing a merchant caravan."

"Now that I'm going myself, it will save a lot of trouble."

"I wonder, though, what the true purpose of this mission is?"

Flying Cloud Kingdom.

Prime Minister's Residence.

Kong Zhaoming was in his study, attending to official duties.

Judging by his appearance, he was likely between forty-five and fifty years old. His square face featured sharp, angular features, slightly prominent brow bones, and eyes as deep and cold as a winter pond. His nose was straight and high, and his lips were pressed into a firm, unwavering line.

Even seated, his tall, upright posture was evident, with broad shoulders and a sturdy back.

He exuded an aura of restrained yet profound authority. Approaching him would instinctively cause one to straighten their spine, hold their breath, and focus their mind, daring not to commit the slightest impropriety.

His temples were lightly frosted with gray, and his long hair was meticulously bound by a simple, unadorned black crown - neither gold nor jade - leaving not a single strand out of place.

He wore a plain, wide-sleeved robe of unadorned fabric, devoid of elaborate embroidery. Only the collar and cuffs were trimmed with meticulously woven black cloud or geometric patterns.

A dark jade belt, fastened with an ancient, square buckle, encircled his waist.

Like the man himself, his temperament was rigid, upright, and deeply rooted in tradition. He adhered strictly to the Rites, holding himself to the same exacting standards he demanded of others.

"Hmm?" He noticed a letter from his son, Kong Ran.

"Someone wants to purchase a method for extracting Early Wisdom Innate Talent at a high price?"

"This brat actually wants to agree?" Kong Zhaoming scoffed coldly, his displeasure evident.

He mentally rebuked the idea: "With proper cultivation of Innate Talent, one can advance to master Divine Arts. Divine Arts are the standard for Nascent Soul-level cultivators. If a cultivator below that level masters them, they will inevitably possess the ability to challenge opponents far above their rank."

"The method for cultivating Innate Talent is of paramount importance - how could we lightly impart such knowledge?"

"What if our enemies gain Nascent Soul-level combatants? What then?"

"Even if they don't reach Nascent Soul-level, any assistance to Golden Core cultivators is unacceptable!"

In the current cultivation world, the Cultivation Nations are actively arming themselves, constantly facing off and guarding against each other.

Nascent Soul-level cultivators are restricted from freely entering and exiting the nations, but Golden Core cultivators are exempt from these controls.

Therefore, even if a Golden Core cultivator obtains this method, it could potentially cause significant trouble for the entire nation.

"For example, our nation is currently holding secret talks with envoys from various nations on Dragon Loach Mountain."

"Those attending are likely Golden Core-level cultivators."

"During these discussions, mutual sparring and competitions are inevitable."

"In other words, the outcomes of Golden Core-level battles will determine our nation's prestige and influence subsequent negotiations."

Kong Zhaoming, well-versed in the Rites, was the official responsible for organizing and hosting the secret envoys from various nations for the Flying Cloud Kingdom.

"Kong Ran is my eighth son. Though he possesses early wisdom and innate talent, he is ultimately low-grade."

"His flaw lies in his impatience and lack of perseverance. He never takes a steady, methodical approach, and his considerations are always incomplete."

"To sell his innate talent for a mere Intent Comprehension Brush? What kind of prodigal son would do such a thing?"

"Absolutely not!"

Myriad Manifestations Sect.

Green Stone Cave Abode.

Ning Zhuo emerged from the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.

He stretched, and the stone-like skin covering his body peeled away in flakes, revealing his normal flesh beneath.

He glanced down at his arm. The symptoms of soul power suppressing his Physical Body had almost completely vanished. Only upon close inspection could faint shadows and dark spots still be detected.

"However, this isn't solely due to the strengthening of my Physical Body's foundation. The weakening of my Soul also plays a role."

Ning Zhuo had expended a significant amount of soul power when using the Intent Comprehension Brush earlier. He had deliberately refrained from intervening, allowing his Soul to recover naturally.

After stowing the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, Ning Zhuo resumed studying the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.

Progress was slow but steady.

Without other opportunities, Ning Zhuo could only continue to grind away diligently.

After a period of contemplation, the agreed-upon time arrived.

Ning Zhuo summoned Qing Chi and Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, resuming his instruction in talisman crafting.

Time slipped by in an instant.

Seeing her reluctance to leave, Ning Zhuo had an idea. "Qing Chi, why don't you stay here and continue training with my Mechanical Puppets?"

Qing Chi's face lit up with delight, and she nodded enthusiastically. "Yes, yes!"

Ning Zhuo activated his Five Elements spiritual energy, linking the Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and the Snow Pivot Imperial Guard - Xie, and began sparring with Qing Chi.

Qing Chi was quickly overwhelmed and defeated.

Each victory caused the Snow-Colored Maiden Hui to tilt her head slightly upward.

Qing Chi's combat prowess also improved rapidly.

The spiritual energy of the Snow Pivot Imperial Guard - Xie remained dormant. But Ning Zhuo had anticipated this and wasn't concerned.

The sparring sessions also deepened Ning Zhuo's understanding of both Mechanisms, allowing him to control them with increasing skill.

Gongsun Yan arrived to report the results of his investigation. He presented Ning Zhuo with a Jade Slip containing detailed information about Ban Ji.

"The Ban Clan... a renowned mechanical clan in the Flying Cloud Kingdom!"

"Ban Ji possesses Golden Core-level mechanical constructs?"

"He doesn't cultivate the Ban Clan's orthodox Method, but a Demonic Art..."

"After my polite refusal, he intends to participate in Qinghuangzi's Flying Cloud Minor Trial?"

After reviewing the information, a faint smile curved Ning Zhuo's lips.

Qinghuangzi was a Golden Core cultivator and one of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's foremost mechanical cultivators. He had organized the Flying Cloud Minor Trial, attracting cultivators from across the region.

Ban Ji's involvement piqued Ning Zhuo's interest.

"Given Ban Ji's relationship with Pi Fuhai, they are enemies, not allies."

"I've reviewed his intelligence. Now, I'll confront him directly to verify the information and deepen my understanding."
