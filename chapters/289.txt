Chapter 289: Wooden Arrow Hero

The Five Elements Soldier's framework is sturdy, with an outer layer of charcoal-baked clay further enhancing its defense. In addition to spirit stones, its spiritual power is supplemented by a spirit gathering formation to extend its endurance. Inside, it uses ancient wooden strips as conduits, making it extremely convenient.

The characteristic of the Five Elements Soldier is that it has no distinct characteristics. Or rather, it is balanced. In terms of offense, defense, spiritual power, speed, and so on, there is no standout feature. This is intentional on Ning Zhuo's part. Without a standout feature, it won't be easily countered.

The second round of the palace examination has just begun, and he needs to gain as much combat experience as possible. Therefore, this type of balanced mechanical construct has a chance against anyone and can last longer in battle.

Ning Zhuo crafted enough fire essence firecrackerss to maximize the Five Elements Soldier's ammunition capacity. After completing this step, he still had the time it takes to brew a cup of tea before the deadline. The actual completion was even better than he had planned in his mind.

He closed his eyes to rest for a moment, then opened them and used the remaining time to inspect the Five Elements Soldier from the beginning. He also used strings to control it, testing its performance in various aspects. After a brief control test, Ning Zhuo confirmed everything was correct and stopped.

Before the battle, excessive testing is not advisable. After all, once a mechanical construct starts moving, it begins to wear out. After the practical operation, Ning Zhuo still had some time left. He carefully checked the workbench and the mechanical crafting tools, finding nothing new or unusual.

In the final moments, Ning Zhuo closed his eyes, adjusted his breathing, and quietly awaited the end of the time limit. When the time was up, Ning Zhuo opened his eyes and found the scene before him suddenly clear. He saw his opponent.

He was a short man, dressed in a martial artist's outfit, with his face covered, revealing only a pair of small, narrow eyes. Ning Zhuo immediately recognized the opponent's identity: "Feng Dao, one of the three sub-leaders of the City Lord's Mansion Reformation Team."

Feng Dao was somewhat flustered. As the time limit arrived, he was still crafting arrows for his mechanical puppet. However, once the time limit was reached, the arena transported both mechanical puppets to the central area.

Ning Zhuo focused intently on the opponent's mechanical puppet. This yellow-green puppet was tall and slender, holding a longbow, with a quiver on its back and two small sections tied at its waist. The quiver contained many arrows, but it wasn't full.

Seeing the burly Five Elements Soldier, with its surface layered with charcoal-baked clay, Feng Dao immediately pulled his wooden arrow hero back towards his direction. On the arena, the mechanical wooden arrow hero retreated explosively, quickly widening the distance between itself and the Five Elements Soldier.

"This speed..." Ning Zhuo couldn't help but frown slightly. The wooden arrow hero moved as swiftly as the wind, easily widening the gap. Its advantage in speed was evident.

Ning Zhuo quickly assessed: "From its appearance and this action, it seems the opponent used ancient wood with spirit patterns as the primary material." "It seems they completely abandoned heavy materials like fist-sized gold and charcoal-baked clay." "Therefore, it performs exceptionally well in terms of speed!"

After creating distance, the wooden arrow hero swiftly drew its bow and began shooting at the Five Elements Soldier. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. Arrows flew, some exploding with green bursts, while others transformed into ice chains with piercing effects.

It turned out Feng Dao used fire essence and frost flower dewdrops to craft the arrows. Ning Zhuo controlled the Five Elements Soldier, advancing step by step while enduring the barrage of arrows. Fortunately, he had invested considerable effort into its defense.

Almost the entire frost flower dewdrop was used to set up formations, hidden within the Five Elements Soldier, flowing like blood. The frost flower dewdrop surged out, quickly forming a large round shield that covered almost the entire body of the Five Elements Soldier.

Most arrows struck the shield, having little effect. A glint of brilliance flashed in Feng Dao's eyes, but he remained unflustered. When designing the wooden arrow hero, he had considered how to deal with iron lumps like the Five Elements Soldier.

In the next moment, his fingers moved rapidly, controlling the wooden arrow hero to draw three arrows from the large quiver on its back. The wooden arrow hero placed all three arrows on the bowstring and shot them simultaneously!

The three arrows didn't hit the Five Elements Soldier but landed at its feet. The arrows rooted into the arena floor, rapidly growing into countless thorns, swiftly spreading towards the Five Elements Soldier.

Ning Zhuo quickly pulled back the Five Elements Soldier a few steps. Simultaneously, his fingers moved rapidly, commanding the Five Elements Soldier to reach into its belly and retrieve a handful of fire essence firecrackerss. The firecrackers were thrown down, exploding with a roar.

The thorny growth was blasted apart, leaving the ground charred black. The Five Elements Soldier continued to advance towards the wooden arrow hero. Feng Dao's brow furrowed. His offensive methods were exhausted, yet he couldn't achieve victory.

"The only option now is to engage in a war of attrition to seize the chance of victory." "Ning Zhuo's mechanical construct is heavy, and every move consumes much more spiritual power than mine." "Moreover, its shield is large and heavy, maintaining such a large shield surface also consumes a lot of spiritual power."

"In contrast, my wooden arrow hero is almost entirely made of ancient wood with spirit patterns, absorbing surrounding spirit energy far more efficiently than the opponent. With a spirit gathering formation inside, in terms of spiritual power consumption, I have the advantage!"

The situation reached a stalemate. Ning Zhuo's Five Elements Soldier advanced with its shield, while Feng Dao's wooden arrow hero maintained distance, continuously shooting. The offensive and defensive stances of both sides were quite clear.

The arena space was limited, and Ning Zhuo used this to his advantage, carefully planning the Five Elements Soldier's movements to gradually close the distance. Feng Dao's experience was also quite seasoned, utilizing the circular edges of the arena to maneuver without a single mistake in positioning.

Ning Zhuo's expression remained unchanged as he began to frequently throw mechanical firecrackers with the Five Elements Soldier. These firecrackers had an inherent area of effect, forcing the wooden arrow hero to constantly roll and leap, increasing its spiritual power consumption.

The wooden arrow hero retaliated with arrows, but they were mostly blocked by Ning Zhuo's water shield. Occasionally, a few arrows hit the body, but due to the charcoal-baked clay, they had little effect.

Feng Dao's face gradually darkened. He realized one of his disadvantagesâ€”he was running out of arrows! In contrast, Ning Zhuo seemed to have an endless supply of fire essence firecrackerss.

For Feng Dao, the time to craft mechanisms was insufficient. But for Ning Zhuo, he had ample time. Ning Zhuo's advantage in crafting mechanisms was retained and manifested on the battlefield at this moment.

Realizing this, Feng Dao immediately reduced his shooting frequency, cautiously using each arrow. Seeing this behavior, Ning Zhuo immediately reduced the size of the water shield to a conventional shield size, protecting only half the body instead of almost the entire body.

"This water shield can actually shrink, not just a single form!" Feng Dao received another blow. A smaller water shield naturally consumed less spiritual power.

Feng Dao forced himself to remain calm: "Even so, my absorption of spiritual power is still much higher than yours!" "In this prolonged war of attrition, I will be the ultimate victor!"

Ning Zhuo maintained a serious expression. He had also analyzed where the opponent's advantage lay. Therefore, he put his full effort into every throw of the firecrackers.

As time passed, the mid-grade spirit stones on the wooden arrow hero were exhausted, and it relied on the external spirit energy absorbed at the start of the battle to function. Without abundant spiritual power, its speed decreased significantly.

Ning Zhuo's situation was far from as dire as Feng Dao imagined. Under normal circumstances, the Five Elements Soldier's mid-grade spirit stones would have been depleted long ago. But now, it still retained a tenth of its spirit stone reserves.

This was because Ning Zhuo employed a Five Elements Mutual Generation setup, reducing the magical power consumption for each use of the water shield, firecrackers, and earth defense, significantly lowering the direct consumption.

The Five Elements Soldier's spiritual power reserves kept pace with the wooden arrow hero, not falling behind. At this moment, the scales of victory began to tilt in its favor.

The wooden arrow hero's speed greatly diminished, making it increasingly vulnerable to the area damage of the fire essence firecrackerss. These accumulated damages gradually disrupted the spirit patterns, reducing its efficiency in absorbing external spirit energy, adding insult to injury.

Finally, the slow-moving Five Elements Soldier cornered the severely speed-reduced wooden arrow hero. The two engaged in close combat. The wooden arrow hero's fists scraped layers of stone skin off the Five Elements Soldier.

The Five Elements Soldier's fists struck down with resounding thuds, leaving fist-sized dents on the wooden arrow hero. The disparity was too evident!

Ultimately, the Five Elements Soldier broke the wooden arrow hero's legs and arms, leaving it paralyzed on the ground, motionless. Feng Dao stared at this scene, his hands trembling, veins bulging, almost cramping.

During the close combat phase, his control was pushed to the personal limit. After all, the wooden arrow hero was weak in close combat, requiring more operations to maintain the situation. He was so busy that his fingers almost tangled, but in the end, he tasted the bitter fruit of defeat.

Ning Zhuo defeated his first opponent, gaining a point of battle achievement. A new message arrived, allowing him to rest for the time it takes to brew half a cup of tea. He was transported to the plaza.

Standing outside the arena, he noticed that almost all arenas were engaged in battle. Even the arena he had just been in quickly blurred, becoming indistinct, clearly indicating another two cultivators were competing.

In the plaza, there were only two people. One was Ning Zhuo, the other a Golden Core stage cultivator from the City Lord's Mansion. There was no need for any exchange between them.

Ning Zhuo's heart stirred slightly: "After the first round of the palace examination, before the second round, another Foundation Establishment cultivator was assassinated." "This means only twenty-two people are participating in the second round."

"But with only two people in the field, it indicates that the quota still exists. This means in the upcoming matches, I might encounter this empty slot." On the arena, Ning Zhuo couldn't see the situation below, but he could calculate it early on.

"The message stated that everyone must face each other once. Although one person is lost, the quota remains, just like the first round of the palace examination." "So, it can still be considered twenty-three participants."

Ning Zhuo calculated: "In that case, the total number of matches reaches two hundred and fifty-three." "With ten arenas, assuming simultaneous start and end, it would require twenty-five rounds." "This is just the first round of the competition. According to the dragon turtle fire spirit, the second round of the palace examination will have at least three rounds." "Including the rest time between each round, the total duration of the second round of the palace examination is at least ten days."
