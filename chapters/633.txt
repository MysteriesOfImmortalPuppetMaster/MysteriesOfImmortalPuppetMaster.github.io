Chapter 633: Storming the Underworld

At that moment, the thick earth trembled violently.

The City-Protecting Formation of White Paper Immortal City was activated in full, channeling the waters of the Underworld Flood Dragon River from the outside world.

Tens of millions of tons of Underworld Flood Dragon River water, mixed with immeasurable amounts of Yin Qi and combined with the Ink River water within White Paper Immortal City, formed a continuously rotating "mountain" of black water!

This Blackwater Mountain lifted the entire White Paper Immortal City, like a giant whale raising its head.

After a dozen breaths of time, the once-flat Immortal City had transformed into a mountain fortress.

Blackwater Mountain White Paper Immortal City!

The heavens darkened, and swirling, ominous clouds filled the sky.

The previously open South City Gate had already slammed shut, trapping the enemy forces in a "shut the gate and beat the dog" formation.

Luo Si's command tent erupted in commotion!

Xie Sichao's expression changed dramatically, and he gasped in panic, "Such a sudden development!"

Many Ghost Generals felt a chill run down their spines.

They even suspected that the South City Gate's earlier easy breach by Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had been a trap set by White Paper Immortal City.

Now, the numerous Golden Core-level Ghost Generals and the Three-Headed Dead Bone Giant Spirit had been lured in like fish!

With the city gates closed, the only remaining escape route was the Path of Returning to Silence.

"Should we order a retreat or continue to reinforce our forces?" All eyes turned to Luo Si.

At this critical moment, they suddenly realized that Luo Si's previous caution had been correct, and the Vanguard General's proactive attack had been a reckless gamble.

Under the expectant gazes of the crowd, Luo Si remained motionless, offering no indication of his intentions. He simply observed.

Within the Paper Giant, Ning Zhuo's eyes shone with keen intelligence. A surge of realization washed over him as he discerned that the earlier events had been a carefully orchestrated trap.

"This aligns perfectly with the City Lord's modus operandi," he thought. "She has used everyone, including me, as mere pawns in her grand scheme!"

For her larger strategy, any piece could be sacrificed.

"Mother, now's our chance to eliminate Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer! Without her Curved Path Retreat, we can devour the enemy's crucial military might in one fell swoop!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed excitedly.

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, however, kept her eyes tightly shut, communicating solely through her divine sense: "Little Zhuo, restrain your impatience. This is not the time for us to act. Trust me, the City Lord will make her move. The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord has inevitably targeted the White Paper Immortal City for blood sacrifice. This binds his fate to the City Lord's, ensuring a violent clash."

After a pause, she continued, her voice strained: "We... must wait patiently... Wait for our opportunity... Only by disrupting the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme can we truly end this calamity and grant the city's people a life of... true peace."

Ning Zhuo jolted upright. "Mother?!"

He sensed that Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's divine sense was flickering intermittently.

This scene was all too familiar.

Once, Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin had experienced the same condition, rapidly deteriorating until she lost consciousness and became unresponsive.

But this time, the process was accelerating far too quickly.

In such a short span, she already showed signs of collapsing.

White Paper Immortal City.

City Lord's Mansion.

The City Lord's Main Body sat quietly, awaiting Luo Si's next military command.

No retreat. No reinforcements.

Her expression darkened, and she sneered inwardly. "This enemy general is rather interesting."

Since the Vanguard General and his forces had recklessly charged through the South City Gate, withdrawal was now pointless.

Mercy has no place in warfare!

Luo Si's inaction was itself an order: continue serving as bait to lure White Paper Immortal City into further action.

Luo Si needed to gauge their true strength.

"Very well, see for yourselves," the City Lord's Main Body thought, unable to draw out any more enemy forces. She tossed a ruler into the air.

The ruler transformed into a streak of light, piercing the sky and appearing above the battlefield at the South City Gate within moments.

The scale hung suspended in mid-air, drawing the attention of many.

It measured exactly three feet and six and a half inches, its surface smooth and uniformly dark green. The body of the scale was straight and rigid, its sides densely covered with intricate patterns resembling ice-cracked porcelain glaze—seemingly chaotic yet possessing an underlying beauty.

A faint, gray-white aura of Great Primordial Qi emanated from the scale's surface, enveloping it like a gauzy veil over jade. As the threads of qi flowed and swirled, they emitted the softest rustling sound.

Great Primordial Dispersal Scale!

In the next instant, Great Primordial Qi surged forth, merging with the jade radiance of the scale, and shot toward Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.

Rock Demon Ghost General stepped forward, shielding Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer with his body. Overcome with a profound sense of foreboding, he immediately erected his strongest defensive barrier.

But as the Great Primordial Jade Light struck him, he instantly disintegrated into a wisp of Yin Qi, a Golden Core, three souls, and six corporeal spirits.

The magic treasures and weapons he had equipped clattered to the ground.

The Great Primordial, essence before form; Dispersal, the end of calamity, returning to the void!

Just as the verse inscribed on the back of the jade scale proclaimed:

Jade measures the span of calamity; The Great Primordial returns to dust.

The Rock Demon Ghost General, powerless to resist, shattered into fragments and perished on the spot.

This spectacle sent chills down everyone's spines, and they instinctively recoiled, desperate to put distance between themselves and that terrifying jade scale!

Amidst the chaos, the Vanguard General roared, "Protect Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer!"

The generals of the Underworld Army quickly realized that with the South City Gate closed, the Curved Path was their only means of swift retreat.

Stiffening their resolve, they surged forward en masse, forming a protective barrier around Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.

"Quick!" they shouted. "Adjust the direction of the Curved Path so we can escape!"

It was then revealed that the Path of Returning to Silence was a one-way passage, functioning either from outside the city to inside, or vice versa.

Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer stood motionless, her face blank, showing no reaction.

As they spoke, the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale emitted its mystical light once more, illuminating the surrounding area.

The Ghost Generals paled in terror. Despite their desperate defenses, every ghost within the light's range was disintegrated, their forms dispersing. Countless magic treasures and weapons shattered into fragments, their components scattering.

Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was also affected, her soul and spirit scattering, leaving behind only a Golden Core.

Even the Return to Silence Path Candle, burned down to a stub, was reduced to a pool of wax, a severed wick, and a flickering flame.

This astonishing spectacle froze the entire battlefield in silence!

Beyond the mystical light, several Ghost Generals remained, their souls still trembling with fear. They knew they had been lucky to cling to their lives.

Without the support of wax or wick, the flame of the Return to Silence Path Candle rapidly shrank, causing the Path of Returning to Silence to contract sharply, on the verge of vanishing completely.

Within the Paper Giant, Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin opened her eyes and sighed softly. "The time has come, Little Zhuo," she said to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo hesitated for a moment, then abruptly unleashed the Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra.

Familiar flames ignited once more, this time spreading rapidly outward from within the Paper Giant.

Meanwhile, Meng Yaoyin made a subtle gesture, causing ripples to spread through the surrounding space.

In the next instant, she summoned the magic treasure, the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern.

The lantern was an eight-sided prism, four feet and two inches tall, with a diameter of one foot and eight inches. Its top tapered to a domed shape, while the base was flat and square. It appeared to be made of brass and sandalwood.

The Interwoven Field Paths Lantern could significantly regulate Earth Qi in an area, transforming it into fertile, productive land, and could even create intricate networks of paths and fields.

During her lifetime, Meng Yaoyin had secretly installed this lantern within the Paper Giant, harnessing its power to secretly connect several hidden territories in the Underworld.

Within each of these hidden territories lay an army of paper soldiers!

Boom!

Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's Golden Core glowed brightly, erupting with a torrent of spiritual energy that poured into the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern, unleashing its full power.

This, in turn, activated related Formations, linking Yin and Yang.

The flames ignited by the Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra now blazed fiercely.

The Paper Giant suddenly burst into flames, startling both sides.

Under the cover of the firelight, the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern's power directly influenced the battlefield, causing the Path of Returning to Silence to abruptly expand!

What was once a narrow path now transformed into a swirling black vortex, revealing a broad avenue that directly connected to the Underworld instead of the outskirts of the Living Realm.

The flaming Paper Giant, under the astonished gazes of all present, strode purposefully into the vortex. Its figure vanished into the Underworld, swiftly disappearing.

Before leaving, it casually swept up several Golden Cores, along with a disassembled pile of magic treasures and weapons.

"Little Ma!" Qing Chi shouted, leading the charge without hesitation into the Underworld.

The Qing-Jiao Army followed closely behind.

"Everything's going according to plan," Sun Lingtong observed as the Qing-Jiao Army charged into the passage. He then led the ox cavalry as the third wave to enter.

Among the Underworld Army, the remaining Ghost Generals reacted swiftly, rushing into the passage.

Luo Si frowned deeply.

This passage leading directly to the Underworld reeked of conspiracy. He issued a decisive order.

Receiving the new command, countless Headless Ghost Riders within the White Paper Immortal City immediately changed direction and charged into the passage, becoming the fifth wave to enter.

Within the City Lord's Mansion, the City Lord's Main Body observed the entire scene unfold.

Her brow furrowed as she pondered the situation, then remotely commanded the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale to strike at the black hole channel once more.

The Great Primordial Dispersal Scale's power was overwhelming. Just as it was about to disperse the channel, the Bone Tomb Daoist let out a shrill cry and, moving like lightning, desperately squeezed into the passage.

He had no other choice!

The situation had changed too quickly.

The City Lord's Main Body's intervention yielded tremendous results. She was extraordinary in her own right, and as the City Lord, she was amplified by the full power of the Immortal City.

White Paper Immortal City was unlike Fire Persimmon Immortal City. The former, crafted by the Profound Primordial Scholar, served mysterious purposes, seemingly tailored specifically for the City Lord. The latter, built collaboratively by the Southern Bean Royal Family and local aristocratic clans, strictly constrained the City Lord, making it difficult for her to personally enhance herself using the City-Protecting Formation.

This marked the first public debut of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale!

Its profound and eerie capabilities left onlookers in awe.

As the City Lord's Main Body officially entered the fray, the defensive battle for White Paper Immortal City took a decisive turn.

Blackwater Mountain now supported White Paper Immortal City, transforming the battlefield into an easily defendable position.

The Underworld Army suffered catastrophic losses: numerous Golden Core-level Ghost Generals, three Three-Headed Dead Bone Giant Spirits, vast numbers of Headless Ghost Cavalry, and the treacherous Bone Tomb Daoist himself.

Although the White Paper Immortal City had successfully executed its "close the gate and fight the dog" strategy, it had lost crucial combat forces, including the Paper Giant, Ning Zhuo (Jiao Ma), and the Qing-Jiao Army.

Both sides suffered casualties, but the Underworld Army sustained greater losses overall.

In the Underworld, at the Offering of Tribulation Altar, a yin wind swept across, billowing the robes of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. Despite his best efforts to recover, his healing progress was disappointingly slow. After the battles against the Lady of Sorrowful Bones and the Soundless Ghost Monk, his combat strength had dwindled to just sixty percent of his original capacity.

Yet, a formidable enemy had arrived!

Amidst the dark, silent mists, candlelight flickered to life. Illuminated by the flames, a charred lotus platform drifted steadily toward them. Upon the platform sat a Cultivator.

His body was entirely composed of blackened bones, draped in a tattered, billowing cloak that whipped in the wind. He possessed no flesh, skin, or organs—only a skeletal frame. Yet his eye sockets blazed with candlelight. A bronze chain coiled around his left arm, while his right arm was swathed in a layer of oily yellow cloth, from which wax dripped continuously. With each breath, sparks erupted from his mouth and nostrils.

Around his body, nestled within the lotus seeds of the lotus platform, stood nine uniquely shaped candles. These unlit candles each possessed a peculiar and mystical form.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord took a deep breath, his expression carrying an unprecedented solemnity.

He sighed deeply. "So, you've come after all."

This formidable adversary was no ordinary enemy; he was Lord Yin Jiuzhu of the Ghostfire Prefecture, the strongest and most feared entity in the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart.

The Ghostfire Prefecture and the Forgetful River Prefecture had been neighbors for eons, their relationship tense and unimprovable. Regardless of who held the upper hand, both harbored schemes to swallow the other whole.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's bold move would inevitably provoke a violent reaction from Lord Yin Jiuzhu.

In the Underworld, none would be more eager to see the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord fail than Lord Yin Jiuzhu himself!

"You've ventured far from the Ghostfire Prefecture, deep into the heart of my Forgetful River Prefecture, abandoning your geographical advantage to launch this reckless assault," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord said. "It seems you've truly lost sight of reason."

He shook his head, his expression filled with pity for his opponent.

Lord Yin Jiuzhu scoffed. "Stop the pretense. Lady of Sorrowful Bones and the Soundless Ghost Monk were both my pawns."

"Besides them, there's also the Jade-Faced Rakshasa."

"Heh heh heh, why don't you guess where she is now?"

A sense of foreboding welled up in the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, but he quickly suppressed the thought. "She must be here, doing everything in her power to prevent my attainment of the Dao."

"If she's truly not here, that would be a great pity."

"After your defeat, you'll bitterly regret not focusing all your efforts on targeting me."

Lord Guihuo sneered. "Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, do you think I haven't had someone perform divination? The Jade-Faced Rakshasa has already infiltrated your Forgetful River Immortal City. She will wreak havoc within the city, for I've had it divined that destroying the Forgetful River Immortal City will greatly hinder your attainment of the Dao!"

Before he finished speaking, Lord Guihuo made his move.

A candle directly in front of him lit itself.

The candle was as pale as a withered bone, its surface covered in tiny holes that resembled countless wailing mouths. Its wick was a tangled strand of translucent, grayish-white smoke.

Once lit, the flame burned faintly, revealing countless struggling soul shadows that emitted heart-pounding, mournful whispers.

Soul-Summoning Candle!

The candle flame erupted with terrifying suction, violently drawing in the souls of the surrounding Underworld Cultivators.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord also felt his soul destabilize and hastily cast a spell to steady himself.

Lord Guihuo tested a move and, having achieved the desired result, threw his head back and laughed heartily. "Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, you've truly grown weak."

Secret Realm

"Where are we?!"

"How are there so many paper figures?!"

The Qing-Jiao Army soldiers were filled with apprehension.

"Little Ma!" Qing Chi shouted, rushing toward the Paper Giant.

The Paper Giant collapsed with a thunderous crash, its spiritual energy, gathered from the flames, converging entirely into Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's body.
