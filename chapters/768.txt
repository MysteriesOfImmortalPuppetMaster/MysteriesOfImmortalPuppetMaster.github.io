Chapter 768: Eliminating Ban Ji

The wind came from the heavens, rolling up ten thousand hectares of cloud wisps.

The sea of clouds churned, sometimes gathering like the collapse of a snow-capped mountain, other times scattering like tearing white silk.

Under the shade of a pine tree, Ban Jie sat upright.

She held a teacup in one hand, inhaling the fragrance of the tea, while her mind pondered the latest battle situation in the Profound Armor Cave.

Just a moment ago, the latest intelligence had been delivered to her hands.

"In the battle of the three Golden Core cultivators, Tie Zheng won."

"This was expected, and it is also the result I wanted to achieve."

Ban Jie knew well the strength of the Blade Beast! Especially since Tie Zheng had already used the Blade Beast in the second trial.

If Ao Pan and Lu Zeng did not have other trump cards, Tie Zheng would inevitably win. The advantage the Blade Beast brought him was too great.

Sure enough, Ao Pan and Lu Zeng were eliminated one after another, and Tie Zheng, fighting one against two, won by relying on the Blade Beast.

"Even so, the Blade Beast cannot fight for long periods; he has been weakened as much as possible."

If it were before, Tie Zheng and Ao Pan would have joined forces to deal with Lu Zeng. The final winner would still have been Tie Zheng.

But now, although Tie Zheng had eliminated Ao Pan and Lu Zeng, his consumption was much greater than in the previous scenario.

"An artifact like the Blade Beast is inherently unsuited for prolonged battles. And the Blade Beast 'Sweeping Light', being made primarily of Profound Weapon Armor materials, is even less durable."

"Tie Zheng has a Heart Demon; he must have fought with all his might just now. After this bloody struggle, how much longer can the Blade Beast 'Sweeping Light' fight?"

Ban Jie smiled faintly, thinking of Ban Ji.

"My second wave of ambushers has already severely injured Ning Zhuo. Next, they will fight Tie Zheng with all their strength, which will definitely weaken the latter further, creating the final opportunity for Ban Ji."

"Ning Zhuo has been heavily injured and has even lost his shield. He is Ban Ji's Human Tribulation; it is only meaningful if Ban Ji breaks it himself."

As Ban Jie pondered, the pair of profound copper brow studs at her temples rotated incessantly like gear pivots.

"Next, under the watch of the second wave of ambushers, Ban Ji will personally eliminate Ning Zhuo, and then sweep away the other Foundation Establishment cultivators."

"After Tie Zheng is weakened, he will engage in the final struggle with Ban Ji."

"Whether victory can be achieved in the end depends on Ban Ji's performance."

"Going to this extent should be just right."

Ban Jie needed to leave enough difficulty for Ban Ji; without tempering, the Royal Mandate could not be stimulated.

The sea of clouds was reflected in her deep, dark eyes.

"It is just that the second wave of ambushers is, after all, a bit excessive."

"I will need to proactively apologize to the Profound Armor Cave afterward! After all, when Ban Ji joins the Myriad Manifestations Sect in the future, he will be seeing the Profound Armor Cave side constantly."

Ban Jie was appointed here by the Ban family, so naturally, she possessed strategic acumen.

At this moment, the Rising Cloud Minor Test had not yet ended, but she was already calculating how to wrap things up.

The cultivators of the Profound Armor Cave generally had unsightly expressions.

"One wave of people came before, and now there is a second wave?"

"The Ban family is going too far! Blatantly cheating - where does that leave the reputation of our Profound Armor Cave?!"

In every session of the Flying Cloud Assembly, the Profound Armor Cave held countless Rising Cloud Minor Tests with the same content. If they left people with the impression of large-scale fraud, it would be a significant blow to their prestige.

As long as there was fraud, it proved they lacked fairness, and cultivators coming to participate in the Rising Cloud Minor Test would consider and hesitate more. At the same time, it also proved that their internal personnel had been corrupted. This would also make outsiders look down on the internal force that was the Profound Armor Cave.

Cultivator Hao crossed his arms, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.

He was exactly one of the people who had been corrupted.

"The Ban family isn't playing by the rules. To support Ban Ji, they actually made it this obvious!"

"Once this Rising Cloud Minor Test is over, the higher-ups will definitely send someone to investigate."

When that time came, and they found out that Cultivator Hao had accepted bribes, he would inevitably suffer punishment.

"The Ban family didn't just bribe me alone."

"Fortunately, I saw the situation was bad and made preparations in advance."

"Otherwise, I would be in a compromised position right now!"

Cultivator Hao quickly scanned the surroundings, sneering in his heart.

---

Ban Ji watched as several people cupped their fists and bowed to him. He squeezed out a smile on his face, but his feet retreated repeatedly.

He muttered in his heart: "Is this also Ban Jie's handiwork?"

The second wave of ambushers made up an excuse, saying they had received kindness from the Ban family and were ambushing Ning Zhuo to repay that kindness. No one present believed this reason, and Ban Ji was naturally no exception.

He just couldn't quite figure it out: "Since so many people infiltrated, why didn't they attack with full force during the first wave?"

"Is it that Ban Jie didn't want to make a big fanfare?"

"This move is tantamount to public cheating; it will indeed strain the relationship between our side and the Profound Armor Cave!"

"Regardless of that, I'll eliminate this kid Ning Zhuo first!"

A sharp glint flashed through Ban Ji's eyes.

From the very beginning of this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, Ning Zhuo had brought him a lot of trouble; now he was going to settle the score properly.

Ning Zhuo was in poor condition. His physical body had undergone multiple repairs, and at this moment he was exhausted, his wounds still bleeding.

"Take his life while he is hurt!"

Upholding this concept, Ban Ji held his weapon and prepared to lunge at Ning Zhuo.

Xiu xiu!

Two arrows struck, carrying the power of the Fire Element and Ice Element respectively.

Ban Ji hurriedly dodged, looking at the source of the arrows in bewilderment: "Lord Tie Zheng, what is your intention?"

Tie Zheng's eyes were filled with disdain and disgust: "Do you not know that I hate hypocrisy and betrayal the most?"

He had a Demonic Heart.

At this moment, although he had eliminated Ao Pan, he was still in a certain state of stress response.

Previously, the second wave of ambushers had been cooperating with Ning Zhuo to besiege Ban Ji, but then suddenly "betrayed" their comrade Ning Zhuo and helped Ban Ji.

Although Tie Zheng cultivated alone in the wilderness, he came from a large clan and was certainly not stupid; he saw through the trickery at a glance.

The situation of Ning Zhuo suffering betrayal was just like how he had just suffered "betrayal" by Ao Pan.

Tie Zheng walked slowly toward Ban Ji: "Nothing but hypocritical and shameless people. If you had set out your chariots and horses from the start and said you wanted to repay a debt, besieging Ning Zhuo would have been fine. But you insisted on pretending to be comrades first, then sneak attacking..."

"How many times have you done this? How many people have you framed?"

"Meeting me today means Heaven wants to teach you a lesson!!"

After speaking, Tie Zheng attacked Ban Ji and his group.

Ban Ji: ?!!

He hurriedly spoke up to explain, but the more he explained, the more resentful Tie Zheng became, recalling how when he had sought confrontation with those who had harmed him after suffering betrayal, they had behaved exactly the same way.

"Go to die, go to die!!" Tie Zheng's eyes were filled with bloodshot streaks as he whipped up a storm of gold and iron once again.

Ban Ji was so angry he wanted to vomit blood.

What kind of huge grudge is this? Acting like I killed your father.

Ban Ji had no choice but to step forward and fight. Fortunately, there were several experts there to help him.

Added to the suppression of the Profound Armor Cave's Grand Formation, Tie Zheng could not display the true combat power of a Golden Core cultivator. Thus, although the fight between the two sides was intense, it fell into a stalemate.

There were other Foundation Establishment cultivators present. Seeing these two sides fighting, they looked at each other in dismay for a moment.

"Hmph, I've seen through the Ban family."

"This Righteous Path family is somewhat shameless. They spare no effort in cheating just to support their own Foundation Establishment figurehead."

"Before, I thought it strange - why would the Ban family tolerate a Demonic Cultivator like Ban Ji? Now I understand. Although this family is of the Righteous Path, they are hypocritical to the bone!"

Regarding Tie Zheng choosing to fight Ban Ji and the others, even if some cultivators didn't know Tie Zheng's intelligence, they didn't find it strange.

After all, after Ning Zhuo was sneak-attacked, Ban Ji's group was exposed as the most threatening group.

Tie Zheng dealing with Ban Ji's gang was just like him eliminating Lu Zeng and Ao Pan in advance.

"By the way, Ning Zhuo is injured quite badly." Some people stared maliciously at the big-headed youth.

Ning Zhuo's name as a genius had already been circulating constantly in the Myriad Manifestations Sect main mountain gate. In the hearts of the cultivators, he was also very threatening.

Now, many cultivators saw that Ban Ji's gang and Tie Zheng were at each other's throats, wearing each other down in fierce combat. They couldn't intervene and didn't want to intervene, so they focused their gazes on each other.

Ning Zhuo sensed the atmosphere was wrong. Gritting his teeth, he supported himself against the wall and stood up.

He still preserved quite a few Profound Weapon Armors. At this moment, they floated around him, circling defensively. especially the bronze fan among them, which had the most deterrent effect. After the gazes of many cultivators who were eager to make a move touched the bronze fan, they clearly hesitated.

Seeing this scene, Cultivator Hao had a gleam of appreciation flash in his eyes: "This kid Ning Zhuo is quite good at acting! Abandoning the bronze shield directly showed great boldness. As expected of a figurehead meticulously cultivated by a major clan."

Among the cultivators of the Profound Armor Cave, only Cultivator Hao saw through this point.

The others were all kept in the dark. One of them suddenly said: "Ning Zhuo is in danger!"

Just as his voice fell, three people moved against Ning Zhuo together.

Ning Zhuo immediately controlled the Profound Weapon Armors, executing defense and counterattacks.

Ban Ji and the others were fighting a bitter battle around Tie Zheng. Tie Zheng constantly whipped up a gold and iron storm, creating the momentum of one person surrounding several.

His Blade Beast 'Sweeping Light' had shrunk back into a sphere and hung at his waist. As long as it didn't move out, it brought immense pressure to others at all times.

A large number of bronze weapons collided, chased, and slashed at each other in mid-air. Some weapons could spew forth sharp edges, sweeping across the battlefield. There were also weapons that could affect others' emotions and spirits; this was the seventh bronze artifact, and the number of such items in the whole venue could be counted on one hand.

One cultivator fought to a heated state; his flesh expanded, and his height increased. He tore open his upper garment, transforming into a muscular giant, brandishing a bronze axe and cleaving everywhere, severing stalagmites one by one, sending crushed rocks shooting out like shrapnel.

Another cultivator moved like a ghost, the long spear in his hand stabbing repeatedly. The spear shot out like lightning, instantly piercing a cultivator's body and ruthlessly eliminating the opponent.

There was also a cultivator hiding in the shadows, occasionally throwing out a hook and line to snare a cultivator in the midst of fierce battle, dragging them directly into the darkness and eliminating them silently.

Those who could persist until now naturally included many experts.

Ning Zhuo had already successfully taken out two cultivators through "difficult" counterattacks.

Seeing that Ning Zhuo still had spare strength, the other cultivators gave up one after another, dealing with targets that were easier to handle.

The Profound Weapon Armors were not durable in prolonged combat. With the battle intensity this high, a situation where weapons were insufficient would soon arise. The more weapons one had, the stronger one's strength, and the more one could persist to the end.

Ban Ji was forced into a corner by the gold and iron storm. With a roar, he fully urged his divine sense.

He cultivated the Greedy Mechanism Demon Heart Art, and his divine sense possessed unique attack power, which Ning Zhuo had experienced before. Attacking with full force now to oppress Tie Zheng, he immediately caused Tie Zheng's offensive to slow, revealing a flaw.

One of the cultivators besieging Tie Zheng, short and stout with muscles bulging on his arms, held a handle with both hands and swung an eight-edged bronze mace, sweeping heavily toward Tie Zheng's left waist.

Tie Zheng erected a bronze long staff to block the bronze mace.

But in the next moment, the bronze long staff, bent in the middle, reached the standard of being damaged and was seized by the Profound Armor Cave's Grand Formation.

Tie Zheng immediately frowned tightly.

He hadn't expected that apart from Ban Ji, this wave of opponents cooperated tacitly with each other and mastered combined attack tactics, making them extremely difficult to deal with.

Tie Zheng fought fiercely for a while. Not only did he gain nothing, but he also lost a bronze staff from his hand.

"In that case..." Tie Zheng drew a kitchen knife from his bosom.

The knife came out.

There was no display of sharpness, nor was there brilliant light or strange colors. Only a condensed dark shadow flashed through the field of vision of Ban Ji's group.

At the same time, an artistic conception that was upright, hard, and fierce - one that could sever all obstacles and crush all hardness regardless of what lay ahead - was conveyed.

Before the bronze mace could be taken away, it was swept by the dark shadow and snapped into two pieces.

A rapier attacked; Tie Zheng gently wiped against it. The rapier was immediately shaved off, and the broken blade spun and flew out, nailing into the distant cave wall with a duo sound!

Qiang qiang qiang...

After a series of metallic explosions, several Profound Weapon Armors were severed by the kitchen knife.

This was the seventh kitchen knife Tie Zheng had harvested, containing the martial logic of Intent.

Tie Zheng's kitchen knife pressed forward with indomitable will!

The cultivators encircling him were all wounded and retreated in panic.

The encirclement collapsed, and they were immediately submerged by Tie Zheng's gold and iron storm.

In the time of a few breaths, this group of people was miserably eliminated. Only Ban Ji remained alone!

Qiang qiang!

Peng.

Ban Ji looked like a torn sack as he was ruthlessly chopped away, scattering a rain of blood in mid-air.

Then, he heavily smashed into a massive stalactite and slid limply to the ground.

His arms were twisted, his face was like gold paper, and his aura was weak to the extreme.

He stared dead at Tie Zheng, his gaze carrying intense unwillingness and resentment.

But it was useless.

In the next moment, he was also teleported away.

Ban Ji was eliminated!

Tie Zheng also paid a huge price; his clothes were already dyed red with his blood, and his wounds were not few. The outburst just now had exhausted him physically and mentally. To activate the intent contained within martial arts, the consumption was not just physical stamina.

"Only you few are left." Tie Zheng looked around and found that besides him, only four people remained.

Ning Zhuo was exactly one of them. He spoke up at this moment: "Fellow Daoist Tie Zheng, although we will not be your match, we are still willing to give it a shot."

"It won't be easy for you to retain nine pieces of Profound Weapon Armor in the end."

Tie Zheng was slightly stunned. Reminded by Ning Zhuo, he quickly scanned the whole venue and found that there were only twenty-three pieces of Profound Weapon Armor left.

There would be another round of fierce fighting next; to save nine pieces was indeed quite difficult.

Tie Zheng huffed coldly, carrying a touch of arrogance: "Those of my generation who cultivate the Martial Path naturally rise to face difficulties. You all come at once."

Tie Zheng was the most dominant person present. Relying on the bronze kitchen knife and his own profound martial arts attainments, he had directly eliminated Ban Ji's gang, displaying his sharpness fully. Facing such a powerhouse, Ning Zhuo and the others naturally had to join forces to resist him together.

In fact, before Ning Zhuo even spoke, the other three actively transmitted thoughts via divine sense, expressing an invitation to ally.

Ning Zhuo naturally agreed, going with the flow.
