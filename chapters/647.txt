Chapter 647: The Lone Wild Goose Carrying a Candle?

The Light Goose struggled weakly in Luo Si's grasp. The seal's power had significantly weakened, causing the magic treasure's aura to intermittently leak out.

This aura felt familiar to Ning Zhuo. He immediately recalled the magical ruler he had seen on the battlefield of White Paper Immortal City.

That ruler had been clearly thrown by the City Lord of White Paper Immortal City, possessing extraordinary power that swept all before it on the battlefield!

However, later, Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin had taken Ning Zhuo through the Curved Path directly into the Underworld, bypassing the subsequent defensive battle.

Therefore, he was unaware that the City Lord's Clone had taken the ruler out of the city to pursue the enemy, transforming it into a Light Goose to attack Luo Si's forces, ultimately losing this Legacy Treasure.

So, while the Light Goose itself felt unfamiliar to Ning Zhuo, its aura was unmistakably familiar.

He turned to Luo Si. "Could this be..."

Before he could finish, Luo Si nodded, confirming that the Light Goose was indeed the transformed ruler. He had captured and sealed it on the battlefield, carrying it with him ever since.

Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up, his gaze fixed intently on the Light Goose.

His heart stirred. The goose's form inevitably reminded him of a crucial piece of information—

that prophetic poem!

Ghost tides surge, White Paper in peril,
A lone goose carries a candle, piercing heaven’s veil.
The guest star appears in the north of the literary pivot,
Myriad Manifestations Lamp ignites, shattering calamity.

The City Lord's Paper Doll Clone had revealed this prophetic poem to Ning Zhuo from the beginning, believing him to be the savior destined to resolve White Paper Immortal City's great calamity.

Ning Zhuo had always believed this to be true.

"This prophetic poem was divined by Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer."

"It was a prediction made to resolve White Paper Immortal City's calamity."

"Don't forget, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord suffered Divine Retribution from the Living Realm's Heaven. It's highly likely that the Living Realm's Destiny is secretly aiding Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer."

"The prophetic poem she divined was almost certainly prepared for me!"

"Could this be the correct method for me to defeat the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and dismantle his century-long scheme?"

Although Ning Zhuo's literary cultivation might not match that of a Confucian cultivator like Wen Ruanyu, his foundation was still remarkably solid.

During his time in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he spent years immersed in the Library Pavilion, devouring countless books.

Therefore, he knew: the Lone Wild Goose often refers to a solitary wild goose, a common imagery in poetry. Many poets use the Lone Wild Goose's mournful cry and solitary figure to express their own feelings of loneliness, wandering, and political disappointment.

Could this Light Goose be the perfect embodiment of the "Lone Wild Goose" in the prophetic poem?

After making this natural connection, Ning Zhuo instructed Luo Si, "Release the seal slightly."

Luo Si: ?

A simple guess, so shallow, wasn't enough to warrant such a command from Ning Zhuo.

The key was that after seeing the Light Goose, a profound sense arose within him, as if he could control her!

It was miraculous, this feeling so natural, like hands and feet belonging to the body, imbuing him with innate confidence in his ability to command her.

Luo Si's expression turned solemn. After a moment's consideration, he decided to follow Ning Zhuo's instructions.

Though he didn't understand and felt it was risky, he remembered that he had only recently joined the group and needed to demonstrate greater obedience. He also thought of the Ash Bone Elder.

Luo Si carefully channeled his energy, slightly loosening the seal. As the restraints lessened, the Light Goose instantly became more lively.

The Light Goose began to struggle fiercely.

Her remaining power was rapidly being drained by the seal's resistance!

Luo Si's face flushed crimson as he forcefully channeled more spiritual energy to reinforce the seal and suppress the Light Goose.

The Light Goose's struggles grew increasingly violent, causing Luo Shang to lose his grip, his entire upper body swaying violently.

Every member of the Qing-Jiao Army had participated in the defense of White Paper Immortal City and had witnessed firsthand the divine might of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.

Having just learned Light Goose's identity from Luo Si and Ning Zhuo's conversation, the soldiers instinctively took large steps back as they watched her struggle.

Ning Zhuo, however, was incredibly bold. He stepped forward and reached out his hand to Light Goose.

"Little Ma!" Qing Chi cried out, her voice filled with concern.

Ning Zhuo knew that if he didn't stop her, Qing Chi's impulsive nature would make her run over and embrace him. He turned to her with a confident smile. "Don't worry. I'm chosen by the heavens, the savior of White Paper Immortal City."

Qing Chi was captivated by Ning Zhuo's confident smile, hesitating. "But..."

Qing Yan placed a hand on her shoulder.

Ning Zhuo turned back to Light Goose, slowly extending his hand, gradually closing the distance between them.

Sensing Ning Zhuo's presence, Light Goose miraculously stopped struggling. She raised her head and returned his gaze.

This extraordinary phenomenon caused a collective gasp from the onlookers.

Luo Si's pupils widened, his expectations for Ning Zhuo growing.

As Ning Zhuo continued to reach out, Light Goose grew increasingly calm, her earlier agitation completely gone.

Yet Luo Si's expression grew more serious. Though his confidence in Ning Zhuo had grown, as the commanding general, he remained vigilant and wary of all possible dangers.

Ning Zhuo feared that Light Goose's calm was merely superficial, concealing a potential eruption. He secretly gathered his strength, preparing for any crisis that might arise.

Ning Zhuo's hand drew ever closer to Light Goose.

This was undoubtedly a risky move!

His mouth went dry.

He had witnessed firsthand how the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale instantly disintegrated Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer. This magical scale was incredibly powerful, capable of overwhelming even Golden Core cultivators with a single strike.

Ning Zhuo himself was merely at the Foundation Establishment stage.

Yet despite his inner anxiety, Ning Zhuo maintained a composed facade.

"The Mechanism Ring remains silent," he thought. "This means I'm in no danger!"

He continued to extend his hand toward Light Goose.

Light Goose lifted her head, nuzzled Ning Zhuo's palm, and let out a resonant cry.

The sound, like a wave of white light, radiated outward in concentric ripples, spreading rapidly through the air.

The light swept over Ning Zhuo without causing any harm.

Nor were the nearby cultivators affected.

Ning Zhuo's heart swelled with joy. Though he didn't understand why, the smile on his face grew increasingly confident and assured. He declared in a clear voice, "Just as I expected!"

Jiao Ma's Father's lips trembled with excitement.

He shouted inwardly, "The magic treasure has acknowledged its master! Such a powerful treasure has actually submitted to Jiao Ma. Doesn't that mean it belongs to our Jiao Clan by right? Fantastic! This is fantastic!"

Qing Chi clasped her fists in excitement. "Little Ma, you're amazing!"

Her eyes sparkled with admiration for Ning Zhuo.

Qing Yan frowned. "But what exactly is going on here?"

Ning Zhuo knew about the prophetic poem, but he hadn't revealed it.

How would I know the reason? Ning Zhuo thought.

Just as he was debating whether to share the prophetic poem to gather everyone's wisdom, Luo Si had already put the pieces together. "So that's how it is."

Ning Zhuo was secretly surprised, but the smile on his lips widened. Adopting a questioning pose, he looked at Luo Si. "Explain."

Luo Si seized the opportunity to show off. "The Profound Primordial Scholar created the White Paper Immortal City. The City Lord's Paper Doll Clone is his Legacy Treasure. And this magic ruler was likely left behind by him as well. Young Master, since you are the savior of the White Paper Immortal City and the chosen one of the Living Realm's Destiny, the Profound Primordial Scholar must have foreseen this calamity long ago and made preparations to resolve it."

Qing Chi couldn't help but exclaim, "I know the Profound Primordial Scholar! He died so long ago—could he really predict so far into the future? And with such precision?"

Luo Si glanced at Qing Chi, confirming once more that the Ghostmen girl was rather naive. Didn't she notice that no one else was asking such a question?

Luo Si's response served two purposes: first, to address Ning Zhuo's query and offer an explanation; second, to publicly speculate and create a space for hopeful imagination, thereby boosting the army's morale and spirit.

Therefore, even if one harbored doubts about this conjecture, they should keep them to themselves.

Qing Yan cleared his throat and declared loudly, "Exactly! Lord Luo Si's conjecture must be the truth!"

As Qing Chi's father and a seasoned Golden Core cultivator with vast life experience, he immediately spoke up to compensate for his daughter's oversight.

Jiao Ma's biological father, however, trembled violently, his entire body shaking with excitement.

He began to daydream again: "My Jiao Ma is a great savior, making the Profound Primordial Scholar's Legacy Treasure come to him of its own accord. If that's the case, then the White Paper Immortal City must also be the Profound Primordial Scholar's legacy—a treasure left by him too."

"My Jiao Ma should rightfully control the White Paper Immortal City! At the very least, he definitely qualifies!"

"If one day Jiao Ma becomes the City Lord of the White Paper Immortal City, wouldn't our Jiao Clan then..."

Jiao Ma's biological father's scalp tingled with the thrill of possibility.

We're rich, we're rich!

Hearing this exchange among the senior officers, the entire Qing-Jiao Army erupted in chatter, buzzing with speculation.

As Luo Si had predicted, the Qing-Jiao Army's Military Heart remained remarkably stable, their morale steadily rising, and their Military Might soaring accordingly.

Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered with realization.

Luo Si's answer had filled in the missing piece of information, instantly revealing the true reason.

"I was once granted the position of Vice City Lord by the White Paper City Lord."

"Although within the White Paper Immortal City, this title was largely honorary, carrying little real authority, it was nevertheless genuine and not a falsehood."

"Now it seems that as a Legacy Treasure, the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale is also under my control due to my position as Vice City Lord."

Ning Zhuo then recalled the City Lord's Paper Doll Clone.

"That too was likely a Legacy Treasure of the Profound Primordial Scholar, later acquired by the City Lord."

Having grasped the situation, Ning Zhuo turned to address the assembled Qing-Jiao Army, proclaiming loudly, "Indeed!"

"I am the savior of the White Paper Immortal City—no, of the entire Ghostly Black Marshlands! I am the Child of Destiny of the Living Realm's Heaven, and above all, the greatest tribulation for the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord!"

"So what if the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is the Monarch of the Underworld Prefecture?"

"He has acted against the natural order, bringing calamity upon all living beings, plotting for a century solely for his own gain!"

"Such an evil entity is destined for utter defeat!"

"Our army of justice is certain to triumph!" Ning Zhuo declared, seizing the moment to boost morale.

The entire army erupted in cheers!

In that instant, Ning Zhuo's prestige within the Qing-Jiao Army soared.

The soldiers were electrified, sharing a common belief: this would be a legendary battle, destined to be widely celebrated and passed down for at least a century. And they wouldn't just witness it—they would be active participants. What an honor!

Luo Si exhaled a long breath, his confidence surging.

Adding another seal would have required a tremendous sacrifice. Having just slain Immortal Hanyan, he was already in a weakened state. By avoiding that effort, he felt far more prepared for the critical battle to come.

The Light Goose, now completely freed from its seal, circled and danced around Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo extended his divine sense toward it and effortlessly took control.

"Go," he commanded, pointing at the churning Turbid Miasma before them.

Obediently, the Light Goose flapped its wings and plunged into the Massive Turbid Qi Miasma. Wherever it went, the swirling turbid qi was separated and dispersed.

Yet even after being analyzed and dispersed, the qi remained turbid.

After circling once, the Light Goose returned to Ning Zhuo's side.

The turbid qi had merely been diluted slightly by its analysis, quickly thickening again into its original roiling mass.

The soldiers' soaring hopes crashed down, replaced by a chorus of disappointed sighs.

Standing with his back to the Qing-Jiao Army, Ning Zhuo felt an overwhelming pressure weighing down on him.

He frowned deeply, scrutinizing the Light Goose.

He observed the Light Goose's form growing significantly dimmer. Her once-solid, lifelike body had thinned and become translucent, revealing the faint outline of a treasured ruler within her core.

"According to Luo Si, the Light Goose's current form is a spell conjured by the City Lord Clone, using her spiritual energy," he thought.

"No matter how much spiritual energy the City Lord Clone initially invested, it's still finite."

"After just one flight around, the remaining energy likely only allows for one more activation."

Ning Zhuo keenly understood the situation and sighed inwardly: "My cultivation is still too weak!"

He was only at the Foundation Establishment stage.

By leveraging superior tools like Military Might and the Five Organs Temple Divine Technique, and drawing upon the profound reserves of his body and soul, he could unleash Nascent Soul-level combat power.

This was remarkably rare and exaggerated, but his cultivation still held him back.

There was truly no other way.

He could blame his youth and insufficient cultivation time.

He could also blame the Three Sects' Supreme Methods, which, while allowing simultaneous cultivation of the Three Dantian, greatly slowed his progress.

Sweat beaded on Ning Zhuo's forehead.

This was his last chance. He had to seize it!

Fortunately, he wasn't completely clueless.

He recalled the prophetic poem once more:

Ghost tides surge, White Paper in peril,
A lone goose carries a candle, piercing heaven’s veil.
The guest star appears in the north of the literary pivot,
Myriad Manifestations Lamp ignites, shattering calamity.

Lone Wild Goose carries candle, shatters Heavenly Veil...

"Lone Wild Goose, I know, is just another name for Light Goose. This Heavenly Veil... isn't it just the Massive Turbid Qi Miasma before my eyes?"

"The Lone Wild Goose must carry a candle to pierce the Heavenly Veil. But..."

"A candle?"

"Where would I get a candle?"

"I don't have any candlelight!"

"Wait!"

"Actually, I think I do."

With this realization, a sudden insight flashed in Ning Zhuo's divine sea, and his heart raced with excitement.

He himself hadn't possessed one, but Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had once used the Return to Silence Path Candle!

During the previous defense of White Paper Immortal City, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had opened the South City Gate and used the Return to Silence Path Candle to pierce through space, creating a Curved Path that allowed numerous powerful forces to be teleported into the city.

This had posed a grave threat to the defenders, nearly leading to the city's downfall.

Tie Guzheng, Ning Zhuo, the Qing-Jiao Army, Wen Ruanyu, and others had thrown everything they had into stabilizing the situation. Ultimately, the City Lord of White Paper Immortal City had personally intervened, unleashing the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale to disperse Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer and the other invaders.

The partially burned Return to Silence Path Candle, reduced to less than half its original length, had been disassembled—wax, wick, and flame all separated, the flame extinguished.

In full view of the crowd, Ning Zhuo reached into his storage pouch and pulled out the remaining half of the wickless candle.

The candle's body was square, resembling a miniature Spirit Coffin. Its original length had been about nine inches, but now only four inches remained.

The coffin lid fit perfectly onto the coffin body.

All four sides of the candle were engraved with scenes of the "Hundred Ghosts Carrying the Coffin."
