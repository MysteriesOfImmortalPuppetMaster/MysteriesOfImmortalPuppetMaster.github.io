Chapter 494: The Banquet of Hidden Intentions (Hongmen Wine)

Because the Bone-Dice demonic god surrendered, this fierce battle abruptly came to a halt.

The domain quickly dispersed, restoring the original appearance of Heaven-Pillar Giant-Tree Mountain.

All the soldiers still fixed their gazes on Ning Zhuo. More precisely, on the bead bracelet on his wrist.

Ning Zhuo’s gaze was no exception.

At the same time, he used his divine sense to communicate: “Bone-Dice demonic god, are you… truly willing to submit to me?”

The Bone-Dice demonic god sighed. “I lost six times in a row. What else can I do?”

“Master, you need not doubt me.”

“I was originally a white-bone die that transformed into a demon. I received offerings and incense, which strengthened my power but also created drawbacks, namely being bound by certain principles.”

“One of those principles is that losing six times in a row means a total loss.”

Ning Zhuo naturally did not believe him at face value and pursued further: “How can you prove it?”

“That’s simple. In a moment, this old servant will reopen the domain. If you, Master, enter it to comprehend the Dao, and enough time passes, you’ll be able to understand those principles. Then you’ll naturally know that my words are not false.”

“The domain…” A keen light flashed in Ning Zhuo’s eyes.

Cultivation, in one explanation, meant pursuing the true principles of the world.

Once a cultivator grasped certain principles, they could pave out their own Dao, forming a field. This field often became its own space, like the Bone-Dice demonic god’s domain, able to cover up the original mountains and forests.

Within the domain, intelligent beings could come into closest contact with the ‘Dao,’ and those with strong comprehension would gain insight from it.

When a cultivator unleashed a domain, their strength would reach its peak state.

But with that came a downside: intelligent beings within the domain, due to being exposed to the Dao, would gain all kinds of understanding and quickly learn the cultivator’s foundations.

Just now, Liu Er had learned about the rule of losing everything thanks to this.

“But Liu Er was able to perceive that layer of insight too quickly,” Ning Zhuo thought, and so he asked the Bone-Dice demonic god.

The Bone-Dice demonic god nodded. “That is one of the deepest secrets at the lowest level of my domain, yet he managed to probe it. He must have some relevant technique or special aptitude that enabled him to quickly understand the Dao I possess.”

Hearing this, Ning Zhuo mostly confirmed that the Bone-Dice demonic god spoke the truth. Because by following the method it provided, it would be very easy to verify.

Ning Zhuo then asked about matters of fate: “What cultivation technique do you practice? It seems related to fate?”

The Bone-Dice demonic god answered, “The arts of divination and fortune are part of the hundred arts of cultivation, hidden among them. This old servant never had such good fortune to acquire that true legacy.”

“The reason I grasp these principles is purely due to my origins.”

“However, if Master wishes to inquire about the Dao of fate, this old servant does have some insights.”

“For instance, fate (qi shu) and fortune (qi yun) are not the same.”

“Shu is ‘number,’ foundation, cornerstone; yun is ‘movement,’ revolving, operation.”

“Shu is still, yun is moving.”

“Shu is already a result, whereas yun is a trend.”

“Master’s fate is not bad, and your fortune is extremely vigorous, which is why this old servant lost six times in a row.”

“Rolling a six every time is actually not all that rare. As long as someone’s foundations exceed mine, within this domain they can usually roll high values. If one is at the Nascent Soul level, with cultivation far beyond mine, then they would get six every time for sure.”

“Yet even if they got six every time at the Nascent Soul level, that would not necessarily mean I would lose six times in a row.”

“After all, this old servant is the domain’s master. Others only have one die, but I have two, which is an enormous advantage.”

Ning Zhuo had a moment of realization: “You mean that getting six every time isn’t odd; what’s odd is that every time you rolled your two dice, their combined total was still less than six for six consecutive throws?”

The Bone-Dice demonic god said, “Exactly!”

“That shows that Master’s fortune forcefully influenced my fate, causing every one of my rolls to be worse than yours.”

“This old servant humbly dares to ask: Master, just what kind of method is this?”

Ning Zhuo was perplexed: “I don’t know!”

He paused. “I do have a treasure on me that suppresses fortune.”

The Bone-Dice demonic god denied it: “That can’t be the case. Suppressing fortune is a means of resisting negative external influence and safeguarding your own fate, creating a baseline.”

“Master, I’m certain that something else happened behind your back without your knowledge.”

“As a result, it affected your fortune.”

Ning Zhuo was very puzzled. “Who in the world would be so kind?”

While he communicated with the Bone-Dice demonic god, Liu, Guan, and Zhang took charge of the scene, cleaning up the battlefield.

Seeing Ning Zhuo standing in place, his gaze fixed on the dice bracelet on his wrist, Liu Er felt that familiar emotion rise once more in his heart.

He felt empty inside, as though someone had stolen an extremely important treasure.

He had felt that way for the first time when Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan publicly signed their engagement.

Thus, his dislike for Ning Zhuo deepened further.

“Gah-gah-gah!”

A series of piercing bird cries came from high above, drawing the soldiers’ attention.

After that, an Iron-Feather Eagle beat its wide wings, descending from the sky.

Some people wanted to strike it down, but Liu, Guan, and Zhang quickly stopped them.

This was because the three Gold Core cultivators saw the token on the Iron-Feather Eagle, and their own seals reacted to it.

Hovering in midair, the Iron-Feather Eagle looked down on the assembled soldiers with a raspy voice: “I am Marshal Du’s messenger. Third General Camp, you’ve done well, actually subduing a local demonic god.”

“You must know that local demonic gods are very familiar with the enemy’s secrets. Such intelligence is especially important for our country to conquer the Thousand-Peak Forest.”

“Not only that, but once news spreads that you have subdued the Bone-Dice demonic god, it will definitely deliver a heavy blow to the morale of the Thousand-Peak Forest.”

“You, that Foundation Establishment kid, quickly bring your Bone-Dice demonic god and return with me to report your deeds. Marshal Du will surely reward you!”

“As for the rest of you, continue advancing without delay!”

The Iron-Feather Eagle was arrogant, showing no courtesy.

All three generals’ expressions changed slightly.

Zhang Hei spoke first: “What reward?”

The Iron-Feather Eagle immediately became displeased: “Impudent! Having enlisted, you must devote yourselves to earning merit. How dare you hold the exploit hostage for reward? Is that the loyalty expected of a subject?”

Ning Zhuo bowed: “I am not a citizen of Two-Note Country, but from Southern Bean Country. Please, Messenger, tell me what reward is at stake?”

Hearing Ning Zhuo say this, the Iron-Feather Eagle’s tone shifted slightly: “With the battle imminent, of course Marshal Du won’t waste time submitting a report for such minor merit.”

“But rest assured, our Marshal Du is always fair in rewards and punishments. You won’t lose out, kid.”

Zhang Hei immediately furrowed his brows.

He could tell that this messenger intended for Ning Zhuo to go back and hand over the Bone-Dice demonic god, and that for now, there would be no reward. Only after the war ended, when the dust settled, would Du Tiechuan submit a report and grant Two-Note Country’s reward.

Zhang Hei opened his mouth to speak, but in the next moment Liu Er sent him a divine sense transmission, telling him to hold his tongue.

Zhang Hei fell silent.

Liu Er’s feelings were complicated.

He loathed the fact that Ning Zhuo had gained the Bone-Dice demonic god, feeling deeply unhappy about it.

Now, hearing that Du Tiechuan wanted to claim it, he inevitably felt a sort of relief and thus chose to watch quietly.

A faint smile appeared on Ning Zhuo’s face, and he bowed. “I shall follow the military orders!”

“However… we just experienced a fierce battle, and I’m in poor condition.”

“If I go back to Wooden-Wheel Town in this state, I might meet misfortune. It would be prudent to rest for a while, regain peak condition, then set out.”

The Iron-Feather Eagle snorted: “Military needs are urgent, and you’re nothing but a minor Foundation Establishment cultivator, not terribly important.”

“I saw the entire battle just now.”

“You remaining with Third General Camp to command the puppet army could still be of some use.”

“Hand over the white-bone bracelet to me at once. I’ll deliver it to Marshal Du myself.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the white-bone bracelet shook, emitting the Bone-Dice demonic god’s voice: “You insignificant Iron Eagle, you dare try to seize me?”

“What fate do you have? Dare to gamble dice with me?”

“Apart from my Master, not even the King of Heaven can control me!”

The Iron-Feather Eagle shouted, “You! How bold!”

The white-bone bracelet radiated a ghastly white light, looking as though it would strike the next instant.

The Iron-Feather Eagle instinctively flapped its wings and soared higher.

Ning Zhuo immediately rebuked it, and only then did the white light recede.

The Iron-Feather Eagle glared fiercely at Ning Zhuo. “Kid, you had better discipline your servant properly! Here, I represent Marshal Du!”

Ning Zhuo promptly bowed in apology: “Iron Eagle, please don’t blame me. I only just subdued this servant and will certainly give it a proper beating. If it offended you, I beg your pardon. Perhaps you’d allow me to prepare a bit of humble wine and set up a command tent to treat you well?”

The Iron-Feather Eagle snorted, neither accepting nor declining.

At that point, Guan Hong stroked his beard and said, “Our Third General Camp also needs to rest after this fight. Monitor, why not enter the tent for a break, so you can recover before returning to the Marshal’s location?”

Only then did the Iron Eagle nod and slowly descend onto a large tree.

Afterward, while Third General Camp cleaned the battlefield, they also built a temporary camp.

One stick of incense later, with the camp constructed, the Iron Eagle entered the main general’s tent, personally accompanied by Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning.

The Iron Eagle was a demon cultivator that had just not taken human form yet.

“What is this wine? It’s strong and profound, with a rich bouquet that leaves one savoring it.”

The Iron Eagle gazed at the cup of dark-red wine, both surprised and pleased.

Ning Zhuo answered, “I have a friend in the Thousand Medicines Sect of Southern Bean Country who loves to drink. So when I came to Green Forest Immortal City, I brought along some fine wines.”

“This is one of them, called Hongmen Wine.”

“It uses an ancient brewing method, fermenting wine dregs with clear spring water, adding dark-fragrance grass and blood-vine flower as supplementary ingredients.”

The Iron Eagle thought for a moment. “Dark-fragrance grass? Blood-vine flower?”

“These two spirit plants, one commonly grows around powerful ministers and strategists, and the other in dark corners, nourished by wrongful blood.”

“I never imagined that using these two spirit plants could produce such fine wine… Hm?!”

Mid-sentence, the Iron Eagle’s expression changed drastically, its voice becoming shrill: “Why can’t I use any of my powers? What did you put in the wine?”

“How dare you, Ning Zhuo! What are you trying to do?!”

Liu, Guan, Zhang were startled, while Ning Zhuo remained seated with a faint smile: “Monitor, have you heard this saying—when a general is in the field, he need not follow every order from above?”

“What’s more, this wasn’t even an official order.”

The Iron Eagle scolded, “Audacious! Even though I’m not Marshal Du’s direct command, if he were here, he’d surely give such an order!”

“Ning Zhuo, you insolent traitor ignoring king and country, you desire only your own benefit and refuse to hand over the Bone-Dice demonic god!”

“Furthermore, you drugged the wine to hold me captive!”

Ning Zhuo’s expression became odd. “Monitor, how do you figure I’m trying to hold you captive?”

With that, he lifted his own wine cup, but instead of raising it to his lips, he cast it to the ground.

The cup shattered.

A squad of barbarian cultivators charged into the tent, surrounding the Iron Eagle.

The Iron Eagle let out a shrill cry of panic: “Don’t kill me, don’t kill me! I’m wrong, I’m wrong, Lord Ning Zhuo! Spare me, I’ll speak well of you!”

“Don’t kill me, I promise I won’t say a word!”

“Ahhhh!”

Along with the Iron Eagle’s screams came the incessant rise and fall of blades and axes in the barbarian cultivators’ hands.

The Iron Eagle was just at the Foundation Establishment level, and after drinking the Hongmen Wine, its body was weak and powerless to summon any magical power.

Very soon, it was hacked into a pile of shredded bone and flesh.

Inside the tent, the stench of blood filled the air.

Liu Er sighed. “Is this really okay?”

Zhang Hei instantly replied, “It’s perfectly fine! That damned bird was so arrogant. This is exactly the end it deserved.”

Guan Hong also spoke in support, “With that Iron Eagle soaring overhead, all our Third General Camp’s doings would be seen. Revealing our troop situation is a major taboo in warfare. Brother, the fact that they assigned us out here at this juncture shows Marshal Du doesn’t value us at all and wants to use us as pawns to probe the enemy.”

Finally, Ning Zhuo said, “We didn’t kill the Monitor. Everyone saw how a group of barbarian soldiers ambushed the Monitor, costing him his life.”

That squad of barbarian cultivators had been summoned by the Bone-Dice demonic god.

“Sigh…” Liu Er let out another deep sigh. “I hoped to earn meritorious service, but it’s so difficult. Since my two brothers speak this way, let’s proceed as such.”

Ning Zhuo waved his hand to send the group of barbarian cultivators away.

They gave him resentful looks, but their faith in the Bone-Dice demonic god was stronger, so they retreated unwillingly.

With the Bone-Dice demonic god’s defection, they no longer needed to destroy the White-Bone Temple.

Many barbarian cultivators were secretly recruited. Once Third General Camp departed, they would reoccupy the Bone-Dice Giant-Tree Mountain. Should Third General Camp collapse, it would serve as a retreat route.

As for the culprit who killed Monitor Iron Eagle, naturally Third General Camp pursued and slaughtered those barbarian soldiers, avenging him.

In reality, they just selected a few barbarian corpses from the battlefield and chopped them into mincemeat. A portion would be handed over, and the rest discarded on the spot.

No longer under the Monitor’s watchful eye, Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning felt relieved.

Third General Camp officially began resting at Bone-Dice Giant-Tree Mountain.

While the wounded received medical treatment, the three generals conducted small-scale, low-intensity drilling.

Ning Zhuo had plenty to do.

On one hand, he questioned the Bone-Dice demonic god about all kinds of information on Thousand-Peak Forest. On the other hand, he worked with Sun Lingtong to repair the puppet soldiers.

After this engagement, of the more than four hundred puppet soldiers, half were lost outright, leaving only around two hundred.

That figure included those that had already been repaired.

“The battle losses are too great,” Ning Zhuo lamented. “If I had known, I would have bought more.”

He simply lacked experience in this area.

But now it was too late to return to Green Forest Immortal City.

Ever since Princess of Mechanisms, Shuang Ling, entered the city with her domineering manner and purchased all the puppet soldiers, she had even secured all future orders from every shop.

“Master, you want more puppet soldiers? This old servant just remembered a piece of information.”

“Two-Note Country has dispatched a transport unit carrying a large number of mechanical creations. By my estimation, they should be close to reaching No-Thief Valley.”

Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

Within the Myriad Roaming Dragon, Sun Lingtong’s eyes lit up, letting out a long “Ohhh.”
