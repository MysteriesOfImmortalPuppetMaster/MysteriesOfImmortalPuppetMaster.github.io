Chapter 703: Primer for Young Scholars

Chu Xuangui finally breathed a sigh of relief when Ning Zhuo arrived at the summit of Inkdot Peak.

Instead of immediately starting the test, he filled the blank space on the Xuan paper before him with ink.

After practicing on the paper, he slowly raised his head to address the dozens of cultivators gathered at the summit. With solemnity, he declared, "The time has come. Begin the test."

He pointed a finger skyward, and spiritual energy coalesced into the test question: Using talisman-making techniques, write the Primer for Young Scholars.

The moment the question was announced, the cultivators exchanged bewildered glances.

How bizarre!

This test format was completely different from previous years!

The question itself was utterly peculiar, requiring them to write a Confucian classic using the brushstrokes and techniques of talisman-making.

The Primer for Young Scholars was not a profound text; on the contrary, its content was remarkably simple. The term "蒙童" (mengtong) referred to young children, and the book was designed as an introductory text for childhood education.

It served as a primer on calligraphic fonts, covering four of the five major scripts: Clerical Script, Regular Script, Running Script, and Cursive Script. Seal Script, deemed too difficult for beginners, had been deliberately omitted.

These five major scripts formed the core of calligraphy and were used for writing various Confucian classics.

Talisman-making emphasized spellcasting, demanding precise control over every brushstroke, pause, and detail. It required careful selection of Talisman Paper and ink, and reflected the cultivator's understanding of spells.

Stroke style?

I've never considered that.

As long as the talisman works, it's considered a success.

"Why use talisman-making strokes to write Confucian texts?"

"What exactly is Mr. Chu Xuangui testing?"

"What font is used in talisman-making? I've cultivated for decades and never once pondered this question."

These were two unrelated matters. For a moment, the cultivators couldn't fathom why Chu Xuangui would link them.

Bai Jiyun, a prominent Foundation Establishment Confucian cultivator from the Flying Cloud Kingdom, was known for his travels and appreciation of scenic beauty, making him a well-traveled and knowledgeable figure.

Even he felt puzzled. "Legend has it that Ancestor Cang created Seal Script by drawing inspiration from talisman collections. Yet the Primer for Young Scholars specifically excludes Seal Script."

Liu Fushu, who deeply admired Chu Xuangui, thought to himself, "Mr. Chu's actions must have profound meaning. It's just that my dull mind can't grasp it immediately."

Chu Xuangui surveyed the crowd, taking in their bewildered expressions.

This reaction was precisely what he had anticipated.

It was natural for them to be confused.

The true purpose behind Chu Xuangui's peculiar question was to bring Ning Zhuo to the forefront.

Without waiting for the cultivators to ponder further, Chu Xuangui retrieved a writing brush from his sleeve.

He channeled spiritual energy to levitate the brush above the crowd, showcasing it for all to see.

"The victor of this Flying Cloud Minor Trial will receive this Intentional Brush."

Ning Zhuo raised an eyebrow slightly. "A magic treasure?"

He was genuinely surprised. He hadn't expected such a significant reward for a mere Flying Cloud Minor Trial.

The cultivators around him erupted into a frenzy of excited chatter.

"Heavens! Am I seeing things? Is that really an Intentional Brush?!"

"What's going on with this trial today? Why would Mr. Chu offer such a prize?"

"Crafting an Intentional Brush is no easy feat. Just obtaining the primary material, River Luo Jade, requires enduring a Thunder Tribulation!"

"That's just the beginning! This brush is a magic treasure, meaning it must have weathered at least three Calamities!"

"The primary material is usually River Luo Jade. Surviving the Thunder Tribulation means passing the Heavenly Tribulation. But the Earthly and Human Tribulations still need to be overcome. Otherwise, it couldn't reach such a high level!"

Ning Zhuo remained silent, listening to the cultivators' discussion. He suddenly realized he had underestimated the brush's significance.

Bai Jiyun narrowed his eyes, already understanding. "This Flying Cloud Minor Trial is no ordinary event. Offering an Intentional Brush... I fear those Golden Core Stage seniors will regret missing this opportunity for the rest of their lives."

The Flying Cloud Minor Trial had always been a modest affair. The Confucian cultivator community had long maintained a low profile within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, and the rewards had never been so substantial.

"It's easy to imagine how news of this trial will spread like wildfire throughout the sect and beyond."

Liu Fushu was the most excited.

He stared intently at the Intentional Brush hovering in mid-air, his fists clenched, his breathing growing heavy, and faint bloodshot streaks appearing in his eyes. "Legend has it that the number of Intentional Brushes is limited."

"When cultivators use these precious brushes to copy texts or calligraphy, they can grasp the author's profound intent. Over time, this accumulated understanding can elevate their cultivation realm in specific areas!"

"These brushes are true treasures of cultivation. This one isn't just a Magic Artifact - it's a magic treasure! For most cultivators, it could serve them for a lifetime!"

"Precisely because these magic treasures can enhance cultivation realms and rapidly cultivate experts, they defy the natural order."

"The total number of Intentional Brushes in the world has never exceeded ten thousand! Each subsequent brush forged invites calamity. Only by overcoming these trials can the forging succeed."

"Moreover, the difficulty of crafting each Intentional Brush grows exponentially."

Liu Fushu was a master calligrapher, intimately familiar with the world's most renowned brushes. Among the Thirty-Six Great Spirit Brushes, the All-Mysteries Comprehension Brush ranked twenty-seventh.

The Thirty-Six Great Spirit Brushes were the most celebrated treasures in the history of the cultivation world, each of Spirit Treasure grade or higher!

Every Intentional Brush in existence was crafted in imitation of the All-Mysteries Comprehension Brush. Though mere imitations, their scarcity made them exceedingly rare and precious. Any Confucian Scholar who had the chance would pursue one with all their might!

Kong Ran's eyes blazed with fervor, his chest heaving as his breath quickened. "A treasure! What a treasure!"

"Joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect was the right decision after all."

"Many have said I have an affinity for Confucianism, urging me to specialize in the Confucian path. Now it seems this brush was waiting for me here. Could this be the arrangement of fate?"

Though young, Kong Ran possessed a mature mind. Despite his limited experience compared to others, he understood the political significance of the Intentional Brush.

"This magic treasure is primarily used for daily cultivation, yet its value far surpasses ordinary combat treasures."

"There's likely only one such brush in the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect."

"Whoever obtains it will undoubtedly be recognized as a promising newcomer among the sect's Confucian cultivators!"

"If I get this brush, I'll have a significant head start right from the beginning."

"No, not just a head start - it'll be several times ahead, several times ahead!"

Chu Xuangui smiled inwardly as he observed the shifting expressions of the crowd, their minds completely captivated by the precious treasure he had revealed.

He then formed a sword-like gesture with his fingers, channeled his spiritual energy, and conjured a series of characters in mid-air: eighty-eight Eternal Characters.

"Imitate these characters using the Primer for Young Scholars I provided. The fastest and most accurate will be judged superior."

"However, any mistake will invalidate your entire attempt. You must restart from the first character of that section."

Having swiftly explained the rules, Chu Xuangui didn't wait for questions. He immediately declared, "The Inkdot Peak Flying Cloud Minor Trial officially begins now!"

No sooner had the words left Chu Xuangui's mouth than Ning Zhuo acted first, channeling his spiritual energy to conjure characters in the Void.

The other cultivators jolted into action, immediately following suit, eager to compete.

Though they started almost simultaneously, within a dozen breaths, one cultivator surged ahead, his lead rapidly widening.

It was Liu Fushu!

Born into poverty, this young cultivator had diligently practiced calligraphy since childhood, mastering the art. His exceptional skill had earned him considerable renown.

The first chapter of the Primer for Young Scholars was the "Song of the Eight Virtues of the Eternal Character."

In calligraphy, the Eternal Character is fundamental.

The "Song of the Eight Virtues of the Eternal Character" not only elucidates the essential strokes of the character but also embodies Confucian principles:

A dot like the first stirrings of benevolence,

Two horizontal strokes like the righteous sword that pacifies borders,

Three vertical strokes like the staff of Rites that supports the heavens,

Four hooks like the blade of wisdom that turns back upon itself.

The Primer for Young Scholars was widely circulated throughout the cultivation world, studied by nearly every child learning to write.

Liu Fushu completed the eighty-eight Eternal Characters first, barely breaking a sweat.

Seeing this, Chu Xuangui immediately extended another finger, channeling his spiritual energy to write a poem in Clerical Script in the Void.

The Primer for Young Scholars consisted entirely of eighty-eight Eternal Characters, followed by twenty-two poems each in Clerical Script, Regular Script, Running Script, and Cursive Script. Each poem was not only melodious and easy to recite but also served as an excellent calligraphy practice piece.

The poem Chu Xuangui had written was the third poem in the Clerical Script section:

Silkworm's head opens, embracing sea and mulberry,

Swallows tailor clouds, their hidden rhymes profound.

Stone gates stand wide, guarding dragon and elephant,

Bamboo and silk record the Way's eternal sound.

Liu Fushu knew this poem by heart. He glanced at it once before burying his head in his writing.

He was about to surge forward when he made a mistake on the third character, its strokes deviating from the standard.

He had to start over from the beginning.

Soon, he erred again on the seventh character, forcing him to restart.

Then, he stumbled on the fifth character.

Three consecutive mistakes trapped him on the first line, preventing him from progressing.

Liu Fushu stared in disbelief, utterly stunned by what was happening.

"W-what's wrong with me?"

"Is this still me?"

"Am I just too nervous?!"

Chu Xuangui observed the scene with keen eyes. Deep within his gaze, a fleeting glint of calculation flashed.

This was exactly as he had anticipated.

The Primer for Young Scholars was widely disseminated, and virtually every child with access to schooling practiced it extensively.

Liu Fushu was no exception. His exceptional calligraphy skills were undoubtedly the result of countless hours of dedicated practice and painstaking effort.

Each time he practiced the Primer, he strove to perfectly replicate the requirements of each font and poem.

For him, these verses were not merely memorized; he could write them fluently in reverse. He could write these characters with his eyes closed, the strokes so deeply ingrained in his bones that they had become instinct.

But now, Chu Xuangui's exam required them to write the Primer using the techniques of talisman-making.

This posed an immense challenge for those who had diligently practiced the traditional methods!

Liu Fushu had ingrained the writing of these verses into his very being. The stronger his instinctive muscle memory, the greater the difficulty he now faced in resisting it.

Moreover, Chu Xuangui had revealed the Intentional Brush before the exam began.

This magic treasure-level reward was so significant that it drove the Confucian cultivators into a frenzy of competition, each fearing to fall behind.

Under such pressure, Liu Fushu, a young scholar from humble origins, would inevitably suffer from anxiety, disrupting his mental equilibrium and making errors more likely.

Chu Xuangui scanned the crowd, secretly observing Ning Zhuo.

"Hmm, not bad," he murmured.

Ning Zhuo's speed was impressive, placing him among the top five.

Wen Ruanyu had shared some intelligence about Ning Zhuo with his fellow Confucian cultivators.

Thus, Chu Xuangui knew that Ning Zhuo excelled at talisman-making more than calligraphy. The latter knew little about Confucian cultivators and likely didn't grasp the profound significance of the Intentional Brush.

This ignorance would help Ning Zhuo maintain a calm and ordinary demeanor.

Ning Zhuo needed to remain composed to avoid revealing any flaws in his performance. This would allow the Confucian cultivators to elevate him to higher positions without raising suspicion.

If suspicion arose, not only would the Confucian cultivators face criticism, but their entire plan to assist Ning Zhuo would fail.

Therefore, the Confucian cultivators had deliberately withheld their specific strategies from Ning Zhuo. Firstly, they feared his youth might lead to a poor performance, believing it better for him to act naturally. Secondly, any prior communication or scheming could leave behind incriminating evidence.

Should such evidence be discovered by someone with ulterior motives, it would plunge both the Confucian cultivators and Ning Zhuo into immense trouble.

Given the stakes involving the White Paper Immortal City's profits, this matter would undoubtedly attract intense scrutiny.

The safest approach for the Confucian cultivators was to avoid any contact with Ning Zhuo or prior communication, proceeding directly with the Flying Cloud Minor Trial.

This would test the Confucian cultivators' ability to control the situation - precisely one of their greatest strengths!

The trial began anew.

Liu Fushu scanned the scene, realizing he was already severely - 

"No, no, no! How could this be? I should be far ahead!" Liu Fushu grew increasingly agitated, his eyes bloodshot, his expression rigid.

The top three positions had remained stable for some time: Bai Jiyun, Kong Ran, and Ning Zhuo.

"Ning Zhuo is in third place... It's only natural that he lags behind the top two," Chu Xuangui mused inwardly.

He had a thorough understanding of Bai Jiyun, Kong Ran, and Liu Fushu.

At each Flying Cloud Assembly, various organizations and factions within the Myriad Manifestations Sect actively recruited fresh talent. The Confucian cultivator groups were no exception.

They secretly monitored promising newcomers, investing considerable time and effort in observing them.

Chu Xuangui remained unhurried, confident that everything was under his control.

In the next moment, he conjured another poem in the air:

Wisp-Tied Peaks, a lingering grace,

Sweeping strokes, dew-kissed embrace.

Dry and moist in spring's gentle rain,

Brush breaks, yet mountains rise again.

While Liu Fushu was still writing the previous poem in Clerical Script, this new verse was composed in Running Script.

Many cultivators were momentarily stunned.

According to the established order, Clerical Script should be followed by Regular Script, then Running Script, and finally Cursive Script.

Yet Chu Xuangui had abruptly skipped Regular Script, moving directly to the Running Script section.

"Excellent! Now we're getting to my specialty," Bai Jiyun exclaimed, his spirits lifting. Running Script was his favorite font. At this point, he still failed to grasp the gravity of the situation.

Sure enough, he made his first mistake on the eleventh character.

Writing too smoothly, he unconsciously slipped into the style of Running Script.

Forced to start over, he stumbled again, and again, and again!

Bai Jiyun became a mirror image of Liu Fushu's earlier struggles, his rank plummeting from first place due to repeated errors.

"How could this be happening?" The once-composed and dashing Bai Jiyun now stood dumbfounded.
