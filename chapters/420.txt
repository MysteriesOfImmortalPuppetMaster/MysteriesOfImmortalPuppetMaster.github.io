Chapter 420: Sworn Brotherhood in the Pear Orchard

Seeing that Ning Zhuo and his companion had left the camp, Zhang Zhongyi immediately called a servant boy: "Go and fetch General Mulan."

Before long, a female general lifted the curtain of the tent and walked in.

She had a dignified and heroic appearance, with distinct facial features. Her sharply defined jawline exuded a determined temperament.

Her gaze was firm and sharp, with a high nose bridge and beautifully shaped lips that were slightly pressed together, revealing an undeniable resolve.

The female general had her jet-black long hair tied up high into a ponytail, with a few strands left at her forehead, appearing valiant and spirited.

She was tall and fit, with tight and well-proportioned muscles, showcasing the results of years of training and combat. Especially notable were her long, strong legs; every step she took was decisive and forceful, exuding strength.

She wore a set of simple bronze armor and draped a bright red cloak over her shoulders.

Her hands were clad in black leather gloves, reinforced with brass at the palms and fingertips. She wore black leather high boots that were both durable and non-slip, with thick brass plates on the soles, uppers, and around the calves.

"Uncle Zhang, you wanted to see me?" General Mulan immediately spoke.

Zhang Zhongyi nodded. "Mulan, a young hero just came by, tirelessly seeking medical help for a friend."

"This person has considerable strength and a deep background. Despite only being at the Foundation Establishment stage, he possesses Golden Core combat power. He could be a strong ally for you."

Ning Zhuo had revealed his Buddhist healer, Meng Yaoyin —a mechanical puppet undoubtedly at the Golden Core level.

He also demonstrated the ability to find an Earth-element Grandmaster cultivator, indicating deep connections and a wide network.

A Dao injury.

Could an ordinary person sustain such an injury without venturing into extraordinary places?

General Mulan showed a slight wry smile. "Uncle Zhang, as the saying goes, 'All is fair in love and war.' You've only heard about him, but as a commander, I can't take things lightly. I need to investigate and confirm Ning Zhuo's identity and so on."

Zhang Zhongyi became anxious. "Niece Mulan, you've joined the army in place of your father, but you have too few reliable people by your side."

"Old General Mu has been bedridden for a long time. Many at court covet the position of Grand General."

"You now hold the Grand General's military seal but are only at the Golden Core stage yourself. You really need support. The tasks assigned by the court are arranged for the Nascent Soul level."

"Celestial City of Green Forest is in the rear, yet you're being ostracized and targeted here. The White Jade Camp set up right opposite the Red Flower Camp, deliberately doubling their recruitment fees —full of malice."

"Recently, our recruitment efforts have been ineffective. The cultivation levels and numbers of the soldiers we've attracted are declining."

"A young man like Ning Zhuo is truly a rare find. If other camps discover his potential, they'll surely compete to recruit him."

"After all, he can be considered to have Golden Core combat power."

Mulan was silent for a moment, then showed a resolute expression. "Uncle Zhang, what you say is reasonable. But that's not my way of doing things."

"My achievements and fame should be earned by me personally, using my own bow and horse."

"This is my way of warfare!"

The female general spoke decisively.

Zhang Zhongyi was momentarily stunned, then sighed. "You and your father are carved from the same mold in temperament."

"But you have to understand, times have changed..."

Just as Zhang Zhongyi was about to persuade her further, Mulan cupped her hands and interrupted, "Uncle Zhang, if there's nothing else, I'll return to the main tent. I have a lot of military affairs to handle."

After saying this, Mulan turned around without looking back and walked straight out of the medical camp.

Ning Zhuo sat on the second floor of a tavern, looking out the window directly at the city gate.

The city walls were built with massive bluestones, wide enough for two war chariots to pass side by side. On both sides of the gate stood towering towers equipped with mechanical crossbow carts, manned by soldiers. Small patrol squads came and went from time to time.

The city gate was a huge wooden door, black as ink, with clear growth rings. The bluestone ground under the gate had been worn smooth by countless footsteps, even slightly sunken.

Inside the gate, along both sides, many notices were posted.

Among them, the largest and most conspicuous was the "Recruitment of Worthies" notice.

<div style=" padding: 8px; font-style: italic;">"Demons and evils run rampant in the Thousand Peaks Forest, disturbing the people's hearts. Now, a grand army is organized to sweep away the wicked and restore clarity to the land.

"Therefore, we specially recruit heroes from all over the world to eliminate the demons and uphold the righteous way.

"Any aspiring person may sign up to join the army. The monarch swears by the fate of the Twin Rivers Nation: rewards will be based on military merit, fair and impartial!

"Foundation Establishment cultivators who join the army will receive the rank of squad leader; Golden Core cultivators will be directly appointed as Roving Generals. Other positions will be awarded according to merit. Those with achievements will be granted noble titles, benefiting their wives and children, with glory for generations.

"This is a grand event of the righteous way, to sweep away all evil and restore peace to our land. May talented individuals respond, contribute to the nation, achieve great deeds, and return the world to brightness and clarity."</div>

Below was the seal of the monarch of the Twin Rivers Nation.

Naturally, the cultivators reading this recruitment notice were the most numerous.

Ning Zhuo was also at the second-floor window, silently observing.

He overheard the discussions among nearby patrons.

"If you're going to join the army, naturally you should choose the one with the highest pay. General Shuangjing's White Jade Camp is the first choice!" said a cultivator with small, shrewd eyes.

"Hmph," another cultivator with thick hair and rabbit ears shook his head. "There are too many young masters in the White Jade Camp. If you want a good atmosphere, General Xu Dali's Barbarian Demon Camp is fairer."

These words immediately drew rebuttals from others.

"Although the Barbarian Demon Camp has many people, they're just a rabble. They're useful for easy battles or cleaning up the battlefield. If you really want to achieve merit, you have to go to General Lu Chi's Fire Cloud Camp."

A bald cultivator shouted loudly, "As long as you have some fire-element spells, after joining, you can attack the battlefield from afar, killing countless enemies—not only safe but also easily gaining lots of military merits!"

"Hmph! A bunch of greedy people," a young cultivator with a black mole at the corner of his mouth said indignantly, standing up and looking around as he raised his arms to shout.

"If you really want to join the army, the best choice is the Red Flower Camp!"

"Not to mention anything else, just that the Red Flower Camp was established by Old General Mu, who has made countless meritorious contributions to the kingdom."

"Right now, Old General Mu is bedridden; General Mulan has joined the army in place of her father and needs us heroes to fully assist her. Joining the army is to serve the country, not just to think about rewards and merits. Such cultivators —we are ashamed to be associated with!"

Such provocative words immediately aroused the displeasure of the surrounding patrons.

A quarrel broke out immediately.

Several groups each chose their preferred camps and cursed at each other. Among them, the small-eyed man, the one with big buck teeth, the bald man, and the young man with the mole were the representatives, arguing until their faces were red.

Just then, a local cultivator appeared from the city gate area. He was seven feet six inches tall, had four ears, and arms that reached past his knees. He came to the recruitment notice next to the inner city gate, looked at it for a long time, and sighed deeply.

In the crowd, a burly man was displeased. "What are you sighing about? A real man should just join the army!"

The local cultivator turned back to look at the speaker, seeing that he was eight feet tall, had a short neck, and a face full of black beard like steel needles. His aura was surging, reaching the Golden Core stage.

The local cultivator asked, "May I ask your name, hero?"

"Heh!" The black-bearded man laughed. "My surname is Zhang, given name Hei, courtesy name Feisheng. I have recently moved to Celestial City of Green Forest and enjoy making friends with heroes. Seeing you sighing at the notice, I spoke up."

The local cultivator sighed. "I am originally a royal kinsman of the Blood Remnant Dynasty, surname Liu, ranking sixth among siblings, so I am called Liu Er."

"Now, seeing that the kingdom wishes to conquer the Thousand Peaks Forest, I aspire to defeat the rebels and bring peace to the people but hate that I am alone and powerless. Thus, I sighed."

Zhang Hei laughed heartily. "I have considerable wealth, and my cultivation has reached the Golden Core stage. Although you conceal your aura, you should be at the same level. Why don't we join together and undertake great deeds?"

Liu Er was delighted upon hearing this and immediately invited Zhang Hei. "Brother Zhang, you have a keen eye. Come, let's eat and talk."

With that, he led Zhang Hei into the nearest tavern to drink.

The two entered the hall, went up the stairs, passing the second floor.

The quarrelling voices of the small-eyed man, big buck-teeth, bald man, and the young man with the mole naturally diminished due to the arrival of the two Golden Core cultivators.

Liu Er and Zhang Hei reached the third floor, found a table to sit at, eating and talking.

During their conversation, a big man, travel-worn and dusty, flew directly in through the third-floor window, shouting, "Waiter, quickly get me some wine. I'm hurrying to go outside the city to join the army."

Liu Er saw that this big man had a Golden Core aura, was nine feet tall, with a beard eight feet long that nearly reached his feet, and a face glowing red—quite majestic. He invited, "This hero, we two are also going to join the army. Since we are on the same path, why not come and drink with us first?"

The Golden Core big man saw this, glanced at the two, and readily agreed.

After sitting down, he introduced himself, "My surname is Guan, given name Hong, courtesy name Maicheng. I usually enjoy the 'Spring and Autumn Annals of Military Strategy' and have studied it extensively. This time, hearing that the Twin Rivers Nation is raising a grand army to start a war, I came to enlist and test my military strategies."

Although the three had just met, the more they talked, the more congenial they felt.

After several rounds of drinking, the atmosphere among the three became even more enthusiastic.

At this moment, Ning Zhuo took out some White Jade Wine and approached them proactively. "Three seniors, I am Ning Zhuo from the Ning family of Huoshi Immortal City in the Southern Bean Nation."

"By coincidence, I also wish to join the army to avenge my family's enmity."

"Years ago, the Six Cave Sect of Thousand Peaks Forest betrayed an agreement and schemed against my clan, almost leading to our annihilation. I am small and weak and was considering which camp to join. Seeing the three of you full of heroic spirit, clearly not ordinary Golden Core cultivators, I wish to attach myself to you and humbly ask you to accept me."

Liu Er, Zhang Hei, and Guan Hong looked at each other.

They had originally intended to join together and enlist in a camp, but from Ning Zhuo's words, it seemed he thought they wanted to set up their own faction.

"Life hangs by a thread!"

"Eh?" Ning Zhuo's heart trembled silently. The 'Life-Hanging Thread' technique landed on Zhang Hei and Guan Hong's heads but missed Liu Er's.

He tried again, but it deviated once more. Ning Zhuo quickly withdrew his hand.

"Heart Demon Seal of the Buddha!"

He secretly influenced Zhang Hei and Guan Hong.

Guan Hong stroked his beard and pondered, "According to the recruitment notice, if we Golden Core cultivators join the army, we'll all be given the position of Roving General."

"Although it's a miscellaneous titled general, it does allow us to command an army."

Ning Zhuo smiled and interjected, "The three generals are full of heroic spirit and grand aura. Even just seeing you once, I deeply believe that commanding an army independently befits your abilities!"

Zhang Hei laughed heartily. "Well said! If we three work together and command an army, we can look after each other and be relatively free, not too constrained. On the battlefield, we can act according to our wishes, advance and retreat freely, and gain more military merits!"

Liu Er pondered silently without speaking.

Ning Zhuo said, "Three generals, why not drink while talking? This is the White Jade Wine unique to my family."

"Fine wine matches heroes; White Jade Wine has an icy and refreshing taste, which complements your heroic spirit perfectly!"

"Please allow me to pour wine for you."

Liu Er hesitated, Guan Hong was self-assured, but Zhang Hei laughed heartily. "Kid, if the wine is good, we'll take you in!"

Ning Zhuo proceeded to pour wine for the three.

The White Jade Wine was indeed unique; after tasting it, the three Golden Core cultivators all nodded in approval.

They continued their conversation, with Ning Zhuo standing by, occasionally pouring wine and interjecting, pushing the atmosphere to new heights.

Under Ning Zhuo's assistance, the three felt that the more they drank, the more congenial they became, regretting not having met sooner.

Zhang Hei said, "I have an estate in Celestial City of Green Forest. Behind it is a pear orchard, and the pear blossoms are in full bloom now."

"Why don't we three go to the pear orchard, offer sacrifices to heaven and earth, become sworn brothers from now on, work together with one heart, and then accomplish great things."

Liu Er and Guan Hong said in unison, "Good!"

Ning Zhuo clapped his hands. "Such a grand and elegant affair! Please allow me to witness it."

"You speak nicely, so we'll bring you along," Zhang Hei nodded, grabbed Ning Zhuo by the collar, took big strides, and flew out of the window.

Guan Hong followed closely behind. Liu Er was the last to leave and, before departing, placed some spirit stones on the table.

The three arrived at the pear orchard.

Zhang Hei immediately had servants prepare black oxen, white horses, and other sacrificial offerings, then lit incense.

Seeing Ning Zhuo standing by in white robes, Zhang Hei became more enthusiastic. "You kid, I like the look of you. Why not join us in the worship today and become brothers too."

Ning Zhuo's heart skipped a beat, but he showed a look of joy on his face. Just as he was about to speak, Liu Er coughed.

Guan Hong gave Ning Zhuo a sideways, contemptuous glance. "A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator—how can he be on par with us Golden Cores?"

Seeing that the two were displeased, Zhang Hei laughed awkwardly and waved his hand at Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo secretly breathed a sigh of relief but appeared very disappointed on the surface.

Then, Liu, Guan, and Zhang knelt together and swore, "Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei, though of different surnames, now become brothers. We will work together with one heart, help those in distress; serve the country above, bring peace to the people below. We do not seek to be born in the same year, month, and day but only wish to die in the same year, month, and day. Heaven and Earth, witness this heart. If we betray righteousness and forget kindness, may both heaven and man strike us down!"

After the oath took effect, the three looked at each other and laughed heartily.

Zhang Hei said, "Although we are brothers, we should determine who is elder and who is younger."

The three arranged for Ning Zhuo to wait outside and went into the training ground to spar.

After a short while, they emerged from the training ground, having determined the outcome.

Liu Er was the eldest brother, Guan Hong the second, and Zhang Hei the third.

Liu Er looked troubled and proactively suggested, "Now, we need to consider recruiting soldiers and buying horses. But I am alone and have little wealth; we three brothers might as well pool our resources."

Zhang Hei laughed heartily, pointing around. "I have considerable wealth; let me contribute. How much can mere recruitment cost?"

Guan Hong stroked his beard and reported a figure.

Zhang Hei's expression immediately froze.

Ning Zhuo stepped forward. "Three generals, I come from the Ning family and am willing to offer precious materials."

Saying this, he took out Xuanhuang Mother Stone, Blood Fiend Demon Stone, and Netherworld Black Soil.

These were precious materials obtained from the corpse of the Old Stone Monster, each at the Nascent Soul level.

"I have considerable wealth... hmm?" Zhang Hei was about to refuse, not believing that a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator like Ning Zhuo could offer anything valuable. But upon seeing the items, his eyes bulged.

Guan Hong's beard-stroking hand froze mid-action.

Liu Er was also greatly shocked, looking at Ning Zhuo with new respect and beginning to regret not having included him in their brotherhood earlier!
