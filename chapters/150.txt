Chapter 150: Ning Zhuo Satisfied Them

True disciples hold a very high status and are extremely important to a sect, being one of the core strengths and future leaders.

Immediately, an elder pondered, "I remember this matter. Not long ago, Cheng Bai took on a mission to investigate Fire Persimmon Immortal City in the Southern Bean Kingdom. There are rumors that an Immortal Palace might have emerged from Fire Persimmon Mountain, possibly the Lava Immortal Palace of the Three Sects' Ancestors."

The Sect Master of the Soul Devouring Sect's gaze darkened slightly, "The Three Sects' Ancestors... This person was extraordinary, able to contend with Integration Stage cultivators despite being at the Void Refining Stage."

"He practiced the techniques of the demonic, daoist, and buddhist paths simultaneously, indeed a talent. However, his later years were unfortunate, seemingly suffering from Qi deviation and committing suicide." The Sect Master thought for a moment and looked at one of the sect elders, "Elder Luo, what do you think should be done about this matter?"

Elder Luo pondered aloud, "Our true disciple has fallen, we must investigate the true culprit and punish them severely! However, the Lava Immortal Palace is located in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. If we dispatch an elder-level figure, it might cause unnecessary misunderstandings. I believe it would be more appropriate to send one or two capable Golden Core cultivators, along with a few ghost generals for protection. First, we should identify the true culprit, then discuss and decide further actions."

The Sect Master smiled, "This is indeed a wise strategy. So, Elder Luo, who do you think would be a suitable true disciple for this task?" Elder Luo understood the Sect Master's intention in asking him and immediately replied, "I recommend my nephew, Luo Shang."

"Very well, Luo Shang it is," the Sect Master ordered, dispatching Luo Shang to Fire Persimmon Immortal City to investigate, accompanied by a ghost general with Nascent Soul-level combat power to protect him.

This was already the operational limit under normal circumstances.

In a major demonic sect like the Soul Devouring Sect, elders were at least at the Nascent Soul stage.

Dispatching an elder would undoubtedly make the Southern Bean Kingdom nervous, potentially leading to unnecessary conflicts.

If misunderstandings escalated, causing the Soul Devouring Sect to provoke a behemoth like the Southern Bean Kingdom, it would be unfavorable.

In the cultivation world, great power is often concentrated in one individual.

A Nascent Soul-level existence can guard a region, like Meng Kui guarding Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Similarly, a Nascent Soul cultivator can invade a region.

Such powerful beings should not be lightly moved.

Therefore, when the Soul Devouring Sect previously wanted to investigate the soul reserves in Fire Persimmon Mountain, they only sent the Golden Core true disciple Cheng Bai.

It wasn't that the Soul Devouring Sect lacked Nascent Soul-level cultivators, but under normal circumstances, sending Cheng Bai was the most appropriate.

Now that Cheng Bai was suspected to have died in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the Soul Devouring Sect had a reason to send a stronger investigator.

This investigator might not be at the Nascent Soul stage, but they must at least possess Nascent Soul-level means.

Hence, sending a ghost general with Nascent Soul-level combat power for protection was within the rules.

As for why a grand demonic sect like the Soul Devouring Sect would adhere to rules?

The reason is simple.

With significant assets comes a cautious heart.

The Soul Devouring Sect occupies vast territories and controls countless cultivation resources.

With such a large foundation, they naturally have many concerns.

After receiving the order, Luo Shang immediately set off for Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Not long after he left, an inner disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect quietly sent out a message.

The message was relayed through several intermediaries, eventually reaching a town.

The town's leader then transmitted the message to the nearest secret sect outpost.

In the outpost, several cultivators were discussing and analyzing various pieces of intelligence.

"A true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect has died? This is a major event!"

"The Soul Devouring Sect has preliminarily determined that the death occurred in Fire Persimmon Immortal City in the Southern Bean Kingdom."

"Isn't there a rumor that an Immortal Palace has emerged there?"

"The Lava Immortal Palace? That's just one of the twelve palaces of the Three Sects' Ancestors, indeed buried within Fire Persimmon Mountain. This has been confirmed."

"Wait, doesn't our Void Sect have any disciples in Fire Persimmon Immortal City?"

"Yes, there's Sun Lingtong, who manages the black market in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and is quite well-informed. However, he hasn't confirmed the emergence of the Immortal Palace, only reporting some disturbances."

"Sun Lingtong... Isn't he the sole disciple of Xu Wuyan?"

"Yes. Many years ago, Elder Xu was trapped in the Lava Immortal Palace. Sun Lingtong stayed in the Immortal City, always believing his master wasn't dead, just trapped within the city. The sect wanted to recall him due to his talent, but he refused."

"Heh, quite admirable."

"I believe this child's determination is commendable! Even if he returns to the sect, it might not be a good choice. Don't forget, Elder Qing is Elder Xu's arch-enemy and now holds significant power within the sect."

"Enough idle chatter, let's report this matter first."

"Regardless of the Soul Devouring Sect or Fire Persimmon Immortal City, our sect should send disciples to investigate further."

A few days passed.

The Void Sect's secret outpost gathered more intelligence.

The Void Sect cultivators discussed again.

"Strange, recently the number of reports about the emergence of Fire Persimmon Immortal City has suddenly surged."

"The source has been verified; it's from the Meng family of the Southern Bean Kingdom."

"The Meng family?"

"Meng Kui, one of the four generals of the Meng family, is the city lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Why would he heavily promote this matter?"

"Indeed, very strange."

"Has the higher-ups decided to send elite disciples to investigate Fire Persimmon Immortal City? I feel there might be an opportunity."

Just then, a voice suddenly came, "I have arrived."

In the secret chamber, the cultivators were startled, scattering in all directions, frantically channeling their Qi, ready for battle.

A female cultivator slowly revealed her figure, showing her identity token.

Only then did the cultivators relax their guard and salute her.

The female cultivator acted swiftly.

After appearing, she requested all the intelligence related to Fire Persimmon Immortal City and immediately set off for Fire Persimmon Mountain.

"It's true disciple Yang Chanyu."

"The sect actually sent her!"

"Yang Chanyu is Elder Qing's favored disciple. Her purpose this time must be significant. Sun Lingtong is in trouble."

Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Ning Zhuo reviewed the recent intelligence, frowning, "The recent atmosphere in the city seems a bit off!" Without the black market channel, he mainly relied on street rumors for intelligence, significantly reducing the quality of information.

Even so, Ning Zhuo still sensed a subtle atmosphere, "There seem to be many unfamiliar faces in the city recently. The inns' business has improved. Some places frequently have fights and accidents. Upon careful review, these places are near important areas or key buildings in the Immortal City."

In recent days, he stayed in the Ning family territory, rarely stepping out.

He was either diligently cultivating or tinkering in a makeshift workshop.

The Tree Martial Ape was destroyed, and the remaining skeleton became fragile after bearing the Golden Bone Fortification.

Ning Zhuo had to start from scratch, crafting a mechanical ape.

This time, he lacked many materials.

Last time, he was in the Zheng family, thanks to Zheng Jian's support, using many precious materials to create the Tree Martial Ape.

This time, Ning Zhuo wasn't so lucky.

While diligently cultivating, a messenger brought a summons.

Ning Zhuo followed the order and secretly met with Zheng Jian and others.

"Ning Zhuo, it's good to finally meet," Zheng Jian greeted warmly.

Ning Zhuo not only saw Zheng Jian but also Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zesheng.

"Congratulations on your recovery!" Ning Zhuo smiled sincerely.

Zhou Zhu remained silent, while Zhou Zesheng said, "I heard you and Ning Xiaohui explored the Immortal Palace and encountered Meng Chong?"

Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly.

"Shameful," Ning Zhuo sighed, showing a trace of fear, "The gap between us and Meng Chong is too vast; we had no chance to fight back. Honestly, I've been feeling heavy-hearted these past few days, unable to be cheerful. With Meng Chong ahead, how can we be his match?"

Zhou Zesheng nodded, his face darkening.

Zheng Jian patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder, encouraging him, "If we unite, we might still win. It's too early to talk about failure, Ning Zhuo."

Ning Zhuo forced a smile, looking deeply disheartened, "To contend with Meng Chong, I can't do it. I'll have to rely on you all!"

Ning Xiaohui snorted, "Ning Zhuo, with such a mindset, how can you bear the Ning name? Failure and humiliation should make you hold your head high and strive harder to wash away the shame. Follow me closely and watch!"

In the subsequent actions, Ning Xiaohui was the first to have her soul extracted by Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai.

Amidst her screams, her soul nearly shattered, triggering the Immortal Palace's mechanism, sending her soul back to her body.

Zhou Zesheng continued, "This mission is crucial. We must clear as many checkpoints as possible to catch up with Meng Chong."

Ning Zhuo satisfied him.

In the following actions, Ning Zhuo communicated with Sun Lingtong, allowing the three allied teams to reach the preparation room.

The three sects' cultivators were excited upon seeing the leaderboard.

"Meng Chong is indeed first!"

"There are so many people from the City Lord's reformation team on the list."

"Outrageous! Meng Chong must have made significant progress while we were recovering!"

"As we suspected, the City Lord's team is far ahead."

Zhou Zesheng was the second to have his soul extracted.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong's attack order was logical.

The first target was Ning Xiaohui, as her talent could not only control various mechanisms but also freeze wounds for treatment.

The second was Zhou Zesheng, whose sharp mind and command skills made him a significant threat if left on the battlefield.

"Meng Chong is so powerful, I really want to face him personally. Even if I lose, it doesn't matter. It would be good to see the gap and work harder afterward," Zheng Jian said expectantly.

Ning Zhuo doubled his satisfaction - letting Yuan Dasheng focus on him.

"Going to die, going to die, going to die!" Seeing Yuan Dasheng charging at him, Zheng Jian's talent triggered, frantically warning him.

Zheng Jian became the third to have his soul devoured.

Zhou Zhu remained silent, left for last.

Seeing his dull-witted appearance, Ning Zhuo chose him as a witness to see Ning Zhuo's "death" firsthand.
