Chapter 138: Cloud Hand Seeking Treasure

"Don't kill!" Sun Lingtong shouted.

Without needing his reminder, Ning Zhuo had already given the order to the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng.

Yuan Dasheng, being a martial arts grandmaster, could control his actions with ease and immediately halted his attack.

"Little Zhuo, use the talismans I gave you!" Sun Lingtong added.

Ning Zhuo nodded, "Don't worry, boss, I'm familiar with these."

Ning Zhuo took out several talismans and rushed to Cheng Bai, sticking them on his three dantians and other vital points.

The talismans activated, emitting a continuous glow that completely sealed Cheng Bai.

"Hurry and leave!" Sun Lingtong urged before his vision went black, and he fainted.

At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain.

Meng Kui's expression slightly changed as he observed the outcome of the battle between Cheng Bai and Ning Zhuo.

The result of this battle surprised him somewhat.

When he saw Ning Zhuo applying the talismans without immediately taking Cheng Bai's life, his brows furrowed even more.

Immediately, he murmured softly, sending a transmission.

Chi Han and Fei Si had been on standby.

Chi Han immediately soared into the sky, heading towards the site of Cheng Bai's defeat.

Ning Zhuo's retreat was very timely.

By the time Chi Han landed, the place was already a wasteland, devoid of any people.

"Sigh, too late." Chi Han quickly used a spell, attempting to find some clues.

How could Ning Zhuo have left any obvious traces?

Seeing Chi Han in action, Zhu Xuanji, who was hundreds of miles away, immediately felt a stir in his heart, "The City Lord's Mansion has started to intervene. Meng Kui's divine technique is coming to an end!" Zhu Xuanji immediately realized this.

When the entire fate energy field was activated, the City Lord's Mansion, under Meng Kui's orders, had retracted all its tendrils, remaining inactive and watching from the sidelines.

Zhu Xuanji understood: This was because the City Lord's Mansion and Meng Kui's fate energy were intertwined, especially Fei Si and Chi Han, who were Meng Kui's right-hand men, their fate energy closely linked and inseparable.

If the two of them were drawn into the fate energy field, Meng Kui would be unsettled and also implicated.

"Meng Kui's divine technique ended very quickly this time, far beyond my expectations."

"According to previous battle records, he could sustain the technique for a long time. This time, he restrained himself a lot, considering the citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City."

"Perhaps, he is also taking care of the Lava Immortal Palace."

"The performance of the Lava Immortal Palace under the beast horde attack was far below expectations. Sigh, its weakness also far exceeded my expectations."

Zhu Xuanji ceased observing the battle and moved once more.

He cautiously advanced towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

During this process, whenever the wind chime rang, he would halt and retreat a certain distance, ensuring his fate energy remained unaffected.

As Zhu Xuanji had anticipated, the intangible and formless field of fortune was rapidly contracting.

Moreover, the speed of this contraction was increasing.

Ning Zhuo retracted the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng and, along with Sun Lingtong and Cheng Bai, arrived at an underground base.

For over a decade, he and Sun Lingtong had secretly searched for gaps in the Immortal City, constructing more than twenty underground bases in secret.

Many of these bases had never been used since their construction.

Ning Zhuo typically only used one of these underground bases—the one his mother had left for him, which had also once held Han Ming captive.

This particular underground base was small in space.

Since its completion, Ning Zhuo had never returned.

Primarily, it housed a healing formation.

Due to the solid materials used, with almost no regard for cost, the healing effects were exceptionally outstanding.

At the beginning of his battle with Cheng Bai, Ning Zhuo had continuously teleported, deliberately exposing over a dozen underground bases to exhaust his formidable enemy.

However, there was no need to expose this healing-focused underground base.

Such exposure would be a pure waste, and Ning Zhuo was not foolish.

Thus, when Sun Lingtong awoke again, weakly opening his eyes, he found himself within the formation.

The ineffective green light points swiftly merged into his body, vigorously repairing his physical injuries.

As soon as Sun Lingtong woke up, he said, "Little Zhuo! Help me up, I need to disarm Cheng Bai!" Ning Zhuo immediately stopped the healing formation and brought Sun Lingtong out.

Sun Lingtong was extremely weak.

In the recent battle, both his body and soul had been severely injured, the wounds terrifying.

If not for the nearly miraculous Autumn Life-Saving Pill, he would likely have already perished.

Sun Lingtong, unable to walk on his own, leaned on Ning Zhuo for support, breathing heavily, his face pale, and soon a layer of cold sweat appeared on his forehead.

"Boss, can you manage?" Ning Zhuo asked with concern.

Sun Lingtong extended his small hand, "Give me a Vigorous Spirit Pill."

This pill could make a cultivator enter a powerful state in a short time, significantly restoring their magical power, energy, and spirit, sweeping away any fatigue.

The side effect was that they would fall into a very weak and lethargic state for a long period afterward.

In fact, Ning Zhuo had already taken one during his battle with Cheng Bai.

At that time, he was controlling the Blue Azure Iron Armor, unleashing its ultimate stance, but failed to hit Cheng Bai's fatal spot, striking his chest instead.

Afterward, with Sun Lingtong's reminder, Ning Zhuo had mustered his strength to fight again, rekindling his vigor, and charged towards Cheng Bai amidst the ruins.

It was at this moment that Ning Zhuo, within the Blue Azure Iron Armor, secretly consumed a Vigorous Spirit Pill.

Only one Vigorous Spirit Pill could be taken within a day; taking more would have no effect.

For those with weak constitutions, taking it rashly could even result in sudden death.

Sun Lingtong had taken it many times.

When he lost contact with his master and was saved by Ning Zhuo, he was only at the Qi Refining Stage.

Living in the vast Fire Persimmon Immortal City was very difficult.

Sometimes, facing danger, he had no choice but to take a Vigorous Spirit Pill to cope with immense crises.

Due to frequent consumption, Sun Lingtong had gained much experience.

At this moment, after taking one, his breathing immediately became rougher, and his pale cheeks turned rosy again.

His energy, spirit, and vigor surged significantly, and his eyes began to sparkle once more.

Even his hair stood on end, as if electrified.

He lowered his head, pulled down his pants, and took a glance inside, nodding in satisfaction. "This pill is of superior grade." The superior-grade Vigorous Wind Pill could make Sun Lingtong's entire body stand tall and proud.

The medium-grade one wouldn't have the same effect. 

So far, Sun Lingtong had never consumed a supreme-grade Vigorous Wind Pill.

Supreme-grade pills were extremely rare and often possessed miraculous effects.

Sun Lingtong, with his head held high and chest puffed out, marched confidently towards Cheng Bai.

Cheng Bai's body was covered with talismans and placed within a formation.

He was unconscious, showing no signs of waking, and his three seas of essence, qi, and spirit were precisely suppressed by the talismans.

Sun Lingtong extended his delicate hand and gave Cheng Bai a light slap.

Cheng Bai remained motionless, but the part of his cheek that was struck swelled up visibly.

Sun Lingtong sat down cross-legged, clasped his hands together, closed his eyes, and began to chant a profound incantation.

After a while, he slowly opened his eyes.

His sclera and pupils were covered with spiritual light, and his hands emitted white smoke, which swirled like clouds and mist.

Tiny silver lights, like countless shattered diamonds, sparkled continuously within the white smoke, dazzlingly bright.

Sun Lingtong's chanting grew quieter and quieter, almost to the point of being inaudible.

After a few breaths, his hands completely disappeared, replaced by two streams of cloud smoke connected to his wrists.

Void Sect Technique—Boundless Sea Cloud Grasp!

The white cloud smoke touched Cheng Bai's body and quickly penetrated into his upper dantian's divine sea.

The cloud smoke churned, flowing endlessly.

Moments later, the cloud smoke retracted.

Unlike before, it was now greatly swollen, clearly enveloping something.

Sun Lingtong manipulated the cloud smoke to float to an empty spot beside him and then slowly dispersed it.

A seal was immediately revealed.

It was a square jade seal, perfectly square, resembling black jade, cold and eerie.

On the seal's surface was a human skull, as clear as crystal, with a spirit pearl clutched within its teeth.

The pearl constantly burned with blue Nether Fire.

The inscription on the bottom of the seal read: "Netherworld Ghost God!"

The Netherworld Ghost God Seal.

This was not just a magical tool but a Magical Treasure! Cheng Bai had relied on this Magical Treasure to summon the avatars of the Judge and the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier.

This was Cheng Bai's primary treasure, the core of his combat strength, and the first item Sun Lingtong had stolen.

"This kind of jade seal can be refined with yin-attributed magical power. Even though we are not ghost cultivators, if we ever venture into the underworld, this will be a powerful weapon!" "Let's seal it first."

Sun Lingtong took out talismans and placed them on the front and back of the Magical Treasure.

He once again stirred the white smoke, sending it surging into Cheng Bai's Sea of Consciousness.

Not long after, the white smoke returned, bringing out a rattle drum.

It was the very Soul Shaking Rattle Drum that had given Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong such a hard time in battle.

Like the Netherworld Ghost Seal, it was also a Magical Treasure.

Sun Lingtong used a talisman: easily subduing it.

After all, it was not a Spiritual Treasure and did not contain spirituality.

There were no treasures hidden in the upper dantian of the Sea of Consciousness.

However, Sun Lingtong still extracted a lot of divine sense, storing it all in a jade slip.

He then used the Sea Gazing Cloud Catching Hand, probing into Cheng Bai's Qi Sea.

There were no tangible treasures in the Qi Sea, but there were quite a few spell talisman seeds.

When a cultivator practices a certain spell to a certain extent, it will form a spell talisman seed.

Continuing to develop along this path can also lead to the development of divine abilities.

However, the difficulty and cost far exceed those of innate talents.

Moreover, the divine abilities formed are relatively common.

Innate talents are recognized as the soil for divine abilities, and the divine abilities condensed from them are either exceptionally powerful or uniquely extraordinary.

Sun Lingtong used the cloud smoke to extract the talisman seeds, obtaining only some shadowy images of the seeds.

He took out talisman paper, and the cloud smoke, carrying the shadowy images of the seeds, fell onto it, immediately turning the talisman paper into one talisman after another.

"All are top-quality, they can be sold for money!" Sun Lingtong nodded in satisfaction.

Ning Zhuo, however, said, "It's better to stockpile some for ourselves first."

In the recent battle, he had almost exhausted his accumulation of Mechanical Constructs over the past ten years, leaving him feeling very uneasy.

Finally, Sun Lingtong used the cloud smoke to extract a large amount of Cheng Bai's magical power, infusing it into the Spirit Storage Orb.

The cloud smoke formally entered the lower dantian of the Essence Sea.

Sun Lingtong fumbled around for a while, suddenly his body shuddered, and a look of surprise appeared on his face.

He blurted out, "It turns out to be this item, what a treasure, what a treasure!"
