Chapter 720: Cheating - He's Kneeling!

It turned out that Lady Spiderweb's seductive techniques had never worked on Che Zhuzi!

The Void Spider was a eunuch!

Lady Spiderweb stared at the Demon Cultivator before her, still unable to believe it.

Look at his thick beard, his incredibly muscular physique - so overwhelmingly masculine. How could this be?

Following her gaze, Che Zhuzi stroked his beard and puffed out his chest proudly. "I know what you're thinking. I've been absorbing massive amounts of Yang Qi from the outside world. It cost me a fortune, but every penny was worth it. Compared to the seventeenfold increase in production, the investment in Yang Qi is a mere pittance!"

Lady Spiderweb: ......

Che Zhuzi produced a contract. "Come, sign it."

He channeled spiritual energy into the document, causing it to unfurl completely before Lady Spiderweb.

After carefully examining the contract, Lady Spiderweb struggled again, her voice a mix of shock and resentment. "This... this is a slavery contract?!"

But no matter how fiercely she fought, she remained completely immobilized.

In a fair fight, even if she couldn't defeat the Golden Core-level Che Zhuzi, she would have stood a good chance of escaping. Now, having fallen victim to his trap, her fate was utterly wretched.

I underestimated him! I saw Che Zhuzi as prey, never imagining I'd become the hunted - and willingly walked into his lair.

Lady Spiderweb's expression was one of utter despair.

Realizing she couldn't break free, she pleaded, "Lord Chezhuzi, are you truly going to take such drastic measures?"

"Let me be frank with you. My involvement in this scheme against Ning Zhuo was for the benefit of the Ban Clan."

"You must know what kind of power the Ban Clan wields!"

Instead of mentioning Ban Ji directly, Lady Spiderweb strategically invoked the entire Ban Clan to pressure Che Zhuzi.

Che Zhuzi remained unmoved. "The Ban Clan is part of the Righteous Path. Would they really hire a Demonic Cultivator like you?"

"You misunderstand," Lady Spiderweb retorted. "I have no desire to be entangled in this mess. If you have any secret information, take it to Ning Zhuo yourself."

Lady Spiderweb tried to evade him, but her face paled. "W-what do you mean? Are you going to - "

A chilling premonition surged through her.

Che Zhuzi's smile turned sinister. "Ah, yes. I'm just an outsider, dragged into this by the Boundless Realm. My only interest is making money. Who has time for your petty squabbles? I'm a businessman; neutrality is all that matters."

His status as a disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect gave him this confidence.

"Your affairs are your own to settle!" Che Zhuzi emphasized, his voice final.

Could it be... I'm going to become Ning Zhuo's dog? No! Never! A wave of intense absurdity and shame washed over Lady Spiderweb, draining the color from her face.

Che Zhuzi suddenly ceased communicating, sensing something amiss. He turned his gaze, piercing through the Grand Formation to focus on a specific point within.

Ning Zhuo was retreating while fighting!

There was simply no other choice. Facing two opponents in a two-on-one battle, the numerical disadvantage was overwhelming. Ning Zhuo's fists couldn't match four hands.

If his opponents had been novices or lacked skill in controlling their mechanical constructs, there might have been a chance. But the reality was that the two cultivators blocking Ning Zhuo's path had no weaknesses whatsoever. They were even more adept at manipulating mechanical constructs than Ning Zhuo himself!

In truth, Ning Zhuo's opponents were two elderly cultivators.

Having been allies for years, they had already agreed to eliminate Ning Zhuo, the "outsider," first, and then settle their own rivalry afterward.

They relentlessly pursued Ning Zhuo.

Under these circumstances, the outcome of the battle seemed inevitable.

Then, Che Zhuzi suddenly intervened.

Rumble...

The Maze underwent another dramatic transformation. Walls shifted, mechanisms activated, and traps erupted, intercepting Ning Zhuo's two pursuers.

Walls sliced through space, swiftly cutting Ning Zhuo off from his pursuers' sight and granting him a precious moment to catch his breath.

A chance to catch his breath.

Then, under Lady Spiderweb's wide-eyed gaze, Che Zhuzi lightly tapped his finger, instantly teleporting a brand-new Profound Iron Ni Jie into the heart of the Grand Formation.

"A puppet! Someone's got a puppet here!" Lady Spiderweb wanted to shout.

"What's going on?!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed, overjoyed at the sight of the pristine Profound Iron Puppet.

This wasn't just a chance to catch his breath; it was a golden opportunity to turn the tide!

Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo immediately swapped out his Buddha Avatar.

He had long coveted this replacement, eager to discard his worn-out, near-obsolete avatar.

"Continue resting?" Ning Zhuo shook his head, decisively rejecting his previous plan.

"What I need to do is seize this moment and immediately counterattack to eliminate the enemy!"

A fierce battle intent blazed in Ning Zhuo's eyes.

He reasoned that the Maze's recent transformation must have introduced numerous new Mystic Iron Buddha Avatars.

"It's impossible that I'm the only one getting a replacement!"

"The other two enemies might also have encountered new puppets and swapped out their old ones."

"I must seize this opportunity, striking while they're at their weakest, to fully exploit our advantage!"

In a two-on-one situation, relying solely on Profound Iron Tokens and Void Spider Silk, Ning Zhuo was at a disadvantage.

"The longer this drags on, the less advantage I have."

"Where are you?"

"I'm coming!"

Ning Zhuo desperately wished he could teleport right in front of his opponents.

Che Zhuzi and Lady Spiderweb observed Ning Zhuo's latest movements with keen eyes. They knew the truth: the only brand-new Profound Iron Token in the entire arena was in Ning Zhuo's possession.

Without exchanging a word, they watched silently.

The distance between Ning Zhuo and his two opponents continued to shrink.

Unseen by either side, Che Zhuzi manipulated the Grand Formation, altering the Maze's layout. After several adjustments, he drastically reduced the distance between them.

"Again, again!" Lady Spiderweb, despite being a Demonic Cultivator with vast experience, couldn't contain her frustration. She turned to Che Zhuzi, her voice sharp with suspicion. "Why are you so eager for Ning Zhuo to win? Why? Have you known him all along?"

"Of course not," Che Zhuzi replied, shaking his head. He then glanced at Lady Spiderweb with a hint of amusement. "Isn't all this for you?"

Lady Spiderweb froze, momentarily stunned.

She didn't deny it, and a pleased expression quickly spread across her face. "So that's how it is. Che Zhuzi wants to clear himself of suspicion and withdraw from this affair. He wants Ning Zhuo to..."

"If you deal with me, you must show sincerity to Ning Zhuo!"

"This time, Che Zhuzi secretly manipulated events, covertly helping Ning Zhuo secure first place. This was his way of laying the groundwork for future interactions with Ning Zhuo."

"So... I actually helped Ning Zhuo win the Ghost Head?"

Realizing this, Lady Spiderweb's mouth fell slightly open, her heart twisting with unbearable anguish.

Ning Zhuo's strength had been glaringly evident during the recent chase. On his own, he would have struggled to claim first place. But now, thanks to Lady Spiderweb's actions and Che Zhuzi's machinations, Ning Zhuo had gained the organizers' covert assistance and was ascending to the throne of first place.

"Because of me, that little rabbit Ning Zhuo is going to become number one?"

"And what's even more infuriating is that I might end up as his slave?!"

Where was the justice in this?

Lady Spiderweb trembled with rage, feeling utterly humiliated. It was truly unbearable.

Under the organizers' deliberate arrangements, Ning Zhuo smoothly encountered his two rivals.

Their first reaction was shock. Their second was elation.

"Found you."

"Why aren't you running this time... huh?!"

"That's wrong!"

"What's going on? How did he get a brand-new Profound Iron Puppet?!"

The two Profound Iron Puppets suddenly froze mid-charge, realizing the reality of the situation.

The scene was momentarily absurd.

In contrast, Ning Zhuo charged forward like a fierce tiger descending from the mountains, his momentum unstoppable.

Retreat was no longer an option.

The two cultivators exchanged a silent, knowing glance: "We'll cover each other and wear him down together!"

Their Profound Iron Puppets had already sustained significant damage from previous battles. While they hadn't lost limbs, their joints were jammed, their armor was warped, and their movements were sluggish.

Ning Zhuo's eyes burned with determination as he adopted the most effective strategy.

Piloting his Profound Iron Puppet, he charged straight at his opponents, unleashing a relentless barrage of attacks.

He prioritized offense over defense, guarding only vital areas and joints. Then, he relentlessly targeted the weaker of the two puppets, enduring blows to land devastating strikes on his chosen target.

Like Ning Zhuo, his opponents relied on limited techniques and hoped to exploit their coordinated positioning to drag the battle into a war of attrition.

But Ning Zhuo immediately threw caution to the wind, launching a reckless assault with moves that would inflict a thousand points of damage on his enemies while costing him eight hundred.

Ning Zhuo's newly equipped Profound Iron Puppet was quickly battered and scarred.

But the price he paid yielded its reward - he had successfully reduced a fully operational Profound Iron Full-Body Puppet to scrap!

"Excellent. Now it's one-on-one," Ning Zhuo growled, his gaze fixed on his last opponent.

After a tense silence, both sides launched simultaneous attacks.

Clang...

The Profound Iron Buddha Puppets clashed like two heavily armored melee cultivators, their legs and arms moving in a relentless dance of offense and defense, a blur of motion too fast for the eye to follow.

In terms of mechanical control, Ning Zhuo remained at a disadvantage.

His opponent lunged forward, aiming a strike at Ning Zhuo's puppet's knee.

Ning Zhuo's Buddha Avatar ducked and retreated, but when evasion proved impossible, he braced his left shoulder to absorb the blow.

Thud!

The enemy's powerful, decisive strike crushed Ning Zhuo's puppet's left shoulder, rendering the entire arm useless.

Seizing the opportunity, Ning Zhuo withdrew, creating distance between them.

Despite landing a successful blow, the enemy immediately turned and fled.

The battle's outcome was now clear.

Ning Zhuo's Profound Iron Buddha Puppet held a distinct advantage and pursued relentlessly.

Its superior speed allowed it to steadily close the gap.

The opponent's full-force strike had been aimed at breaking Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Buddha Avatar's leg, but Ning Zhuo had chosen to sacrifice his own arm rather than let the enemy succeed.

This crucial detail, meticulously controlled, further diminished the enemy's chances of turning the tide.

Ning Zhuo caught up to his opponent and, with a flying leap from behind, stomped him to the ground.

Caught in the trap, the enemy cultivator's back visibly caved in. Yet instead of turning to fight, he rolled forward along the ground, continuing his desperate escape.

His combat experience was considerable; he knew that a direct confrontation would be disastrous.

He executed the most rational tactic, maintaining his composure: "If the opponent obtained a new Profound Iron Puppet, it means there must be a second, a third... hidden somewhere in this maze."

"All I need to do is find one, exchange it for a new one, and turn the tide!"

The strategy was sound.

The logic behind his deduction seemed flawless.

Lady Spiderweb watched the cultivator's frantic flight within the formation, feeling a pang of sorrow.

For there was truly only one brand-new Profound Iron Puppet in the entire maze - a puppet Che Zhuzi had prepared specifically for Ning Zhuo!

"There is none."

"No, no!"

"Damn it! Why haven't I found a new Profound Iron Buddha Puppet yet?!"

The cultivator sprinted frantically, desperate for a chance to turn the tide. Lacking any will to fight, he was repeatedly ambushed by Ning Zhuo, who mercilessly pummeled him, further damaging his Mystic Iron Buddha Avatar.

"Since I've chosen this path, there's no turning back now."

"Profound Iron Buddha Puppet (Fake), where are you hiding?"

This was the cultivator's only hope.

After observing for a moment, Che Zhuzi lightly tapped his finger, sending a new Ni Zhen puppet to a spot just ahead of the cultivator.

"Changing your mind?" Lady Spiderweb glared at Che Zhuzi, her eyes narrowed.

Che Zhuzi responded with a knowing smile.

The cultivator rounded a corner and suddenly froze.

"There! Finally, there it is!"

"I've finally found a brand-new Mystic Iron Buddha Avatar."

"It wasn't easy..."

At that moment, the cultivator nearly wept with joy.

But in the next instant, Ning Zhuo pounced, delivering a flying kick that sent the newly arrived Ni Zhen puppet crashing to the ground.

The cultivator tried to dodge, but his Profound Iron Transformation was too damaged, leaving him no time to react before he was knocked sprawling.

The Cultivator frantically manipulated his Profound Iron Buddha Puppet, attempting to rise, but Ning Zhuo lunged forward, striking the Void Spider Silk with a palm strike.

The Cultivator swiftly maneuvered the Suspended Threads to evade the blow.

Seizing the opportunity, Ning Zhuo closed the distance and stomped down with his foot, crushing the puppet's head with a resounding thud.

A fatal blow!

Ning Zhuo had won!

His dedicated training and meticulous preparation had paid off in this final clash.

The Cultivator remained frozen in place, letting out a long sigh after a long moment.

Clenching his fists, his face twisted with resentment, he muttered, "Damn it! Just a little more... just a little more, and I could have turned the tide!"

Lady Spiderweb had observed the entire battle. Her gaze finally settled on Che Zhuzi, her understanding of him deepening.

Che Zhuzi had played a cunning game. Sending in the second Profound Iron Buddha Puppet was merely a trap, offering false hope and creating the illusion of fairness.

The Cultivator, seeing the new puppet, had finally stopped fleeing, falling right into Che Zhuzi's scheme.

"How treacherous!"

"Who would have thought Che Zhuzi, with his hulking frame, could be so cunning and devious? If only I had known..."

Lady Spiderweb couldn't bring herself to dwell on it any longer.

If only I had known sooner!

Ning Zhuo exhaled a turbid qi. "I never imagined I would actually win in the end."

Through the Profound Iron Union Puppet, he glanced at the second Profound Iron Transformation Puppet, which was less than a foot away, and secretly marveled at his extraordinary luck.

With the three trials completed, the victor had been decided.

Che Zhuzi formally entered the stage, dismantling all the mazes and gathering the cultivators in one place.

As promised, he awarded Jade Tokens of Identity to the top ten winners. These tokens would grant them a 20% discount on future purchases of Void Spider Silk here.

Nearly every cultivator departed the cave dwelling with a length of Void Spider Silk and a complex mix of emotions.

Though they had been manipulated, the Void Spider Silk was undeniably practical.

Che Zhuzi had been orchestrating these Cloud-Raising Trials for years, boldly pushing the boundaries of others' psychological endurance to promote his products.

Finally, he turned to Ning Zhuo. "Young man, you've shown remarkable talent. Take your time selecting any magic treasure you desire."
