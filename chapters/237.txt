Chapter 237: Cloud Whale  

White clouds surged like ocean waves, as a Cloud Whale slowly appeared on the horizon.

Its body was immensely large, occupying nearly half of the sky.

Under the blue sky, its gigantic form cast a faint shadow over the mountains below.  

As the Cloud Whale continued to approach, the enormous shadow on the ground gradually extended to the foothills of Fire Persimmon Mountain.  

"Look! What is that?" The citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City pointed towards the sky, exclaiming in astonishment at their discovery.  

"Such a colossal demon beast, with the aura of a Nascent Soul level! Run, a Nascent Soul level great demon is attacking the city!" However, before panic could spread, Fei Si's voice echoed throughout the city.  

He assured the citizens that there was no need to worry, as what had arrived was not a demon beast, but a vehicle of the Flying Cloud Kingdom's merchant caravanâ€”a Cloud Whale.  

Upon learning this, the citizens began to chatter excitedly.  

The panic quickly dissipated, replaced by excitement and curiosity.  

Everyone was aware of the Cloud Merchants: the Flying Cloud Kingdom's caravans frequently traveled across the five lakes and four seas, their footprints covering the entire cultivation world, and they were very famous.  

The reputation of the Flying Cloud Kingdom's merchant caravans was also very high, earning the trust of the public.  

"But using a Cloud Whale as a vehicle for the Cloud Merchants, this is the first time I've seen it. Clearly, this is a large-scale caravan." "Is that really a Cloud Whale? It's enormous, truly awe-inspiring."  

Many cultivators cast their spells, looking up to the sky to closely observe the Cloud Whale.  

The Cloud Whale's head was round and wide, its enormous forehead seemingly capable of encompassing the entire firmament.  

It had a pair of massive eyes, blue like sparkling gems, large as small lakes, exuding tranquility and wisdom.  

The fins on its sides resembled giant white feathers, gently gliding and stirring up breezes, swirling the surrounding clouds into spirals.  

Its tail fin was extremely wide and powerful, each gentle swing seemingly capable of propelling the entire sky.  

The Cloud Whale glided across the sky, its speed varying from slow to fast, as if the natural clouds were summoned by it, naturally gathering around it, forming magnificent cloud streams.  

The Cloud Whale's immense body leisurely traversed the cloud streams, as if it were the guardian of this realm, serene and composed.  

Although the Cloud Whale's life aura was at the Nascent Soul level, it did not exert any oppressive feeling.

Instead, it brought a sense of peace to those who beheld it.  

Suddenly, the Cloud Whale emitted a deep and distant call, as if it came from the depths of the sky, penetrating the clouds, carrying a primordial and pure power that reached the deepest part of people's hearts.  

At the moment the whale's call sounded, the entire sea of clouds fell silent, and countless citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City held their breath, listening intently to this celestial sound.  

The Cloud Whale quietly skimmed across the sky, gradually approaching Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  

Sunlight poured down, filtering through its body, transforming into a gentle radiance, as if the blazing sun had softened because of it.  

The citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City almost all looked up at the Cloud Whale.  

Every movement of the Cloud Whale's fins and tail was so graceful and composed, full of natural charm, as if it were one with the sky.  

It was truly a wondrous sight!  

Finally, the Cloud Whale slowly halted, hovering high in the sky, maintaining a safe distance from Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  

Despite the Cloud Merchants' worldwide reputation, the Cloud Whale was, after all, a Nascent Soul level existence, so there was still some caution, and it consciously stopped in the sky.  

After a short while, a group of people emerged from within the Cloud Whale, slowly flying towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  

In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Fei Si ascended into the sky to meet this group.  

Under the watchful eyes of the public, the two sides met in mid-air.  

Fei Si was not surprised.

The Cloud Merchants' invitation had been submitted over ten days ago.  

After receiving approval from Meng Kui, Fei Si had allowed this Cloud Merchant caravan to come to Fire Persimmon Immortal City for trade.  

"Lord Fei Si, I am Song Fuli. It is truly an honor to do business in Fire Persimmon Immortal City!" Fei Si nodded and smiled, carefully observing the Golden Core stage cultivator before him.  

Song Fuli was a middle-aged man with ordinary features, broad nostrils, and a pair of tiger-like eyes that shone brightly, giving the impression of a battle-hardened general rather than a businessman.  

After a brief greeting, Fei Si requested to inspect Song Fuli's Cloud Merchant identity token and the documents issued by the Flying Cloud Kingdom.  

Fei Si carefully examined the identity token, then unfolded the documents to check for the seals of the Flying Cloud Kingdom and the Southern Bean Kingdom.  

Once everything was confirmed to be in order, he returned the token and documents to Song Fuli.  

"Mr. Song, please follow me." Fei Si led Song Fuli back to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  

Song Fuli, accompanied by several others, first followed Fei Si into the city, while the rest of his group began signaling for more people to emerge from the Cloud Whale.  

A large group of cloud beasts, in various forms such as cloud horses and cloud oxen, dragged numerous cargo boxes in a long line, slowly flying towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  

The citizens became excited, with some even raising their hands in cheer.  

They engaged in lively discussions.  

"It seems the area west of the city was cleared early on."  

"It appears the City Lord's Mansion had already made arrangements, designating that area specifically for the Cloud Merchants to set up shop."  

"I've never seen such a large-scale caravan before. I wonder what kind of novel items they've brought, it's truly exciting." Fire Persimmon Immortal City became bustling with activity.  

At Ning Zhuo's residence.  

The sixteen-year-old young cultivator also stood by the window, gazing at a corner of the sky through the window.  

"The Flying Cloud Kingdom's caravan, huh?"  

Ning Zhuo showed a hint of anticipation.  

In fact, he had always had a favorable impression of the Cloud Kingdom, as his mother hailed from the Flying Cloud Kingdom.  

Song Fuli and Fei Si traveled together.  

During the descent, Song Fuli looked down at the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City, noticing a scar in the middle, a ruin left from a previous Golden Core battle.  

Song Fuli showed a trace of concern: "I wonder how your City Lord views the recent Golden Core battle?"  

Fei Si quickly reassured him: "It was merely because Lord Meng Kui did not intervene. The previous battle was far from reaching the level where he needed to act! Your caravan can rest assured, everything is under the control of our City Lord's Mansion."  

Song Fuli sighed lightly: "Fire Persimmon Immortal City is a newly established city, a genuine new city, and because of the presence of the Lava Immortal Palace, the protective formation is not yet fully laid out."  

"The emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace might be a good thing. Perhaps it's an opportunity for the Immortal City Grand Formation to be reestablished." "However, before that, I hope the caravans entering the city have the ability to protect themselves."  

Fei Si nodded slightly, glancing at the cultivators behind Song Fuli.  

These cultivators had a fierce demeanor, some with scars on their faces, others with cold, piercing gazes, clearly all skilled fighters.  

The Cloud Merchants, capable of traveling the world and doing business everywhere, naturally had strong martial support.  

The Nascent Soul level Cloud Whale was one layer of protection, and the caravan's guards and cultivators were evidently the second layer.  

Fei Si pondered: "As long as your caravan adheres to the standards we previously agreed upon, carrying equipment that meets or is below the standard, we will approve."  

Song Fuli smiled: "That's good."  

He needed to conduct business and make money here, while Fei Si, representing the City Lord's Mansion, needed to meet the demands of a large number of visiting cultivators.  

The resources Fire Persimmon Immortal City could provide were insufficient to meet the massive demand from the visiting cultivators.  

Ultimately, Fire Persimmon Immortal City was still a new city, never having accommodated so many visiting cultivators before.  

Previously, Fire Persimmon Immortal City could be self-sufficient, but now, the demand was so great that businesses in all sectors of Fire Persimmon Immortal City were booming, yet still unable to satisfy buyers.  

This situation led to a series of public security issues, increasingly affecting the City Lord's Mansion's stable governance of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  

The Cloud Merchants made money, the vast number of cultivators received a substantial supply of resources, and the City Lord's Mansion could maintain public order and collect a significant amount of taxes.  

This was a win-win situation for everyone.  

As a result, the Cloud Merchants were warmly welcomed upon their arrival.  

They quickly set up numerous shops, tents, and even erected tall buildings on the vacant land in the west of the city.  

From the first day of business, the Cloud Merchants' goods sold out!  

On the second day, Ning Zhuo donned a simple mask magical artifact, slightly altering his appearance, and left his residence to visit the Cloud Merchants' shops in the west of the city.  

In just one day, the west side had undergone a dramatic transformation.  

Various shops stood tall, all bearing the characteristics of the Flying Cloud Kingdom.

These pure white, gray-white, and mottled white buildings were generally tall and slender, as if reaching for the clouds.  

In contrast, the buildings on the Fire Persimmon Immortal City side were built very wide and thick, giving a sense of solidity.  

The thicker the building, the better it could insulate against temperature.  

The temperature around Fire Persimmon Mountain was still generally high.  

In contrast, the Flying Cloud Kingdom had a suitable climate, but with frequent rain and thunderstorms.  

The taller the buildings, the better they could collect rainwater and utilize lightning and strong winds.  

Ning Zhuo walked among these shops, experiencing the exotic atmosphere of the Flying Cloud Kingdom.  

The area was bustling with people, and his ears were filled with a constant hum of voices, from haggling to playful banter.  

The entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City had entered a festive atmosphere due to the arrival of the Cloud Merchants.  

Ning Zhuo chose a material shop to enter.  

He needed to purchase some clouds as materials to refine into his Floating Cloud Cloak.  

The clouds produced by the Floating Cloud Cloak were not just a result of magical power; each use also consumed the cloud threads stored within the cloak.  

The material shop was bustling, with many people purchasing these basic materials.  

After inquiring about the price, Ning Zhuo bought some clouds and also purchased some cloud threads.  

Clouds were considered raw materials, while the cloud threads had undergone a processing step, making them more expensive than the clouds.
