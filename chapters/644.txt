Chapter 644: Si Yuan Ghost General!

Forgetful River Era 973

Luo Si was framed by his own kin and met a gruesome death, his body completely destroyed. Denied entry to the ancestral hall, his resentment transformed him into a vengeful ghost, banished to the underworld.

Forgetful River Era 974

Corrupted by resentment, his soul drifted listlessly along the banks of the Forgetful River, teetering on the brink of dissolution. Guided by the Ash Bone Elder, he was taught the Oblivion's Guidance technique, using the waters of the Forgetful River to purify his obsessions. He vowed to repay this kindness.

Forgetful River Era 980

Enlisted as a squad leader.

Leading five ragged soldiers, he set a whirlpool trap at Stranded Beach, ambushing the leader of a band of raiders. His early display of talent in river warfare earned him promotion to platoon leader.

Forgetful River Era 982

During the Yellow Turban River escort battle, he lured enemies into an ambush with a decrepit boat, using hidden currents to turn the tide against the Nine Hells pirates and capture their vessel. Honored with the title "Forgetful River Water Warrior," he was promoted to centurion in the Blackwater Army. After the battle, he personally authored the Ten Rules of Boat Handling to train new recruits, with notable success.

Forgetful River Era 986

Deploying a hundred light skiffs in a deceptive formation, he lured the Drowned Army into a shallow bay. Over three days, he secretly amassed water pressure before unleashing a devastating whirlpool that annihilated three thousand enemies. He was promoted to deputy general.

Forgetful River Era 990

Defended Dragon-Severing Gorge against the White Bone Fleet.

After being besieged by the White Bone Fleet for over three months and nearing exhaustion of supplies, Luo Si calmed the troops through fishing. During this time, he gained insight into the military strategy "Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation."

He then abandoned the large ships, leading thousands of small boats in a night raid that, like an ant swarm, overwhelmed and destroyed several enemy vessels.

The White Bone Fleet withdrew, and Luo Si successfully defended himself, though severely wounded. He was bestowed the title of "Abyssal Contemplation Ghost General."

Forgetful River Era 993

He was transferred to North Deer Immortal City for recuperation, where he also served as City Guard Commander.

He quelled the Smiling Face Gambling House uprising and purged Resentful Infant Alley.

Forgetful River Era 995

When foreign enemies invaded and the City Lord of Solid Ice Immortal City fell, Luo Si was specially appointed as City Guard Commander and temporary City Lord.

After seven days of surveying the treacherous shoals, he adjusted the river's flow, diverting the Ice Rush River tide and ensuring the grain supply route remained open.

He detected Soul-Devouring Yin Earthworms, using soul waves to repel them and protect over ninety percent of the medicinal fields, thwarting the enemy's plot.

Forgetful River Era 996

He suppressed a violent uprising of malevolent spirits in the Ice Cavern without damaging the seals.

Forgetful River Era 997

After successful special training at Bone-Corroding Beach, he created a new military unit: the Frost Hell Contemplation Guard.

Forgetful River Era 998

He was promoted to Commander of the Northwest Frost Halberd Army.

Guarding the border, he slew thousands of enemies, keeping the Ghost Wolf Pack in check and maintaining peace along the frontier.

Forgetful River Era 999

He was appointed temporary commander to lead an expedition against White Paper Immortal City in the Living Realm.

After reviewing Luo Si's service record, Sun Lingtong sighed, "I never expected that Ghost General Luo Si, who's been dead in the Underworld for only twenty or thirty years, would already have risen to the position of Prefectural Commander."

Beside him, Zeng Jide withdrew his divine sense. "He received guidance from the Ash Bone Elder. I suspect the elder's involvement. Luo Si's rise through the ranks has been too smooth and deliberate."

Sun Lingtong frowned. "Why would a Nascent Soul cultivator rush here to retrieve Luo Si's service record? Could it be..."

Zeng Jide replied, "An official's service record in the Underworld Prefecture serves a similar purpose to a life token or soul lamp in a Super Sect - a powerful means of control."

"What else could it be?"

"Nothing more than using this record to deal with Luo Si. It seems he's been disobedient and needs a proper lesson."

Sun Lingtong nodded, his suspicions confirmed. A wave of worry washed over him. "The Forgetful River Prefecture's attitude toward Luo Si has changed drastically. Could it be that he held back at the last moment, deliberately letting his opponents escape, and raised suspicions?"

Altar Battlefield.

The torrent of military strategy ravaged the Imperial Guard's positions, crippling the entire defending force in an instant.

Both sides were too stunned to react, leaving only the screams of the gravely wounded and the deafening roar of the strategic bombardment.

Countless gazes, sharp as arrows, converged on Luo Si.

If looks could kill, Luo Si would have been pierced by ten thousand arrows, dead beyond death.

Yet under the weight of all those eyes, Luo Si remained calm, as if the one who had turned the tide, the one who had overturned the entire war, wasn't him at all.

His gaze was slightly unfocused as he stared at the Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation military strategy before him, recalling the moment of his epiphany...

Dragon-Severing Gorge lived up to its name.

The jagged black rocks on either side, like the interlocked fangs of colossal beasts, clamped down on the most treacherous stretch of the river.

The muddy waves crashed against the gorge walls, shattering into a sky-darkening mist of foul-smelling Yin Qi, only to merge back into the relentless torrent.

Luo Si, then still a subordinate general, had been ordered to defend this strategic chokepoint and halt the main advance of the White Bone Fleet.

After over three months of bitter fighting, more than half of Luo Si's warships had been destroyed, his supplies of arrows, talismans, and other resources were exhausted, and his formations grew increasingly difficult to repair.

Deep within the gorge, the hastily constructed Water Fortress swayed like a decaying log adrift in the raging currents, completely surrounded by the White Bone Fleet. The pervasive yin wind that swept across the river carried despairing whispers as it passed through the fortress.

Luo Si had exhausted every means of securing reinforcements and was certain none would come. Trapped in this hopeless situation, with his great vengeance yet unfulfilled, he refused to surrender.

The soldiers' morale, stretched taut as a bowstring on the verge of snapping, hung by a thread.

Luo Si knew he had to steady the Military Heart. Otherwise, defeat and annihilation would follow in the next breath.

Though he could see no hope, he refused to give up until the very end.

Provisions and armaments were depleted. To maintain morale, he needed another way.

Fortunately, his passion for fishing provided a solution.

Each dusk, when the White Bone Fleet's assaults temporarily subsided, he would climb alone to a precarious ledge jutting from the gorge's edge. Below, the main channel of the Forgetful River collided with the turbulent waters of the Underworld Flood Dragon River, creating a maelstrom of swirling currents and roiling yin winds.

Unarmored, clad only in a black robe, he held a fishing rod and let the line drift into the abyss.

With each cast of his rod and every gaze at the subtle ripples on the water's surface, Luo Si exuded a martyr-like focus and tranquility. A silence enveloped him, strangely settling over the entire Water Fortress.

The soldiers hid behind the battered hulls of their ships, watching their general with weary, almost numb eyes.

The suffocating despair and agitation, it seemed, were gradually suppressed and settled by a deeper, colder force within this silent ritual.

Luo Si sat motionless as iron, his composure unshaken on the surface, but inwardly he burned with anxiety, desperately racking his brain for a way to break through this desperate situation.

Only three capital ships remained, none capable of standing against any of the White Bone Fleet's vessels. The numerous small boats, each barely able to carry five men, seemed utterly useless.

As his thoughts grew stale, his gaze pierced the river surface, catching sight of a faint blue light drifting silently beneath the water.

It was a school of small fish, gliding in like fine dust.

Then more tiny blue specks lit up one by one, gathering like motes of dust, their shadows gradually coalescing into distinct outlines - a boundless school of fish, layer upon layer!

They stirred silently beneath the water, their bodies trembling imperceptibly, emitting a mysterious blue light.

Suddenly, billions of these faint glimmers converged, coalescing into a surging, silver-blue river that swept through the water with a silent roar.

The luminous stream illuminated the long-submerged wreckage of weapons, armor, and ships, illuminating the silent underwater battlefield.

A single fish was as insignificant as a speck of dust, but now, as the school converged and swirled, they altered the current beneath the river, creating a massive, whirlpool-like undercurrent - a fleeting, colossal presence like a submarine tornado.

Luo Si's heart pounded with awe, as if struck by a hammer.

A flash of enlightenment pierced the divine sea, shattering the murky depths of his heart and illuminating the murky waters within.

"Our military strength is waning, and we're trapped in a desperate situation. This accumulated water in the Abyss, like a beast's maw, threatens to devour all living things."

"Yet, the deeper we sink into the Abyss, the more we must conceal our scales beneath the water."

"We are as weak as these tiny fish, gathering silently at the Abyss's depths... waiting for that fleeting moment when light flashes, when specks unite, when we can be coordinated and, if necessary, sacrifice ourselves without fear. Then, we too can become a torrential flood."

"The deeper the Abyss gathers, the more unstoppable its wave-shattering power becomes."

"Once unleashed, it will transform into the most formidable Abyssal Current, devouring everything in its path!"

Amidst the countless wreckage and broken weapons on the riverbed, in its deepest, silent recesses, it seemed as if their past cries were erupting anew, now echoing rumblingly within Luo Si's divine sea.

Luo Si lowered his rod.

A single droplet fell from the empty hook tip, returning to the Abyss.

His resolve was firm.

Turning, he faced the countless eyes in the Water Fortress - some bewildered, some weary, some hiding a glimmer of hope.

Back in the camp, he issued his command, his voice calm to the point of indifference: "Scuttle the ships."

The crowd was stunned.

Scuttle the ships? In this watery no-man's-land, abandoning the ships was no different from cutting their own throats!

Luo Si's gaze swept across the three battered flagship warships, their Formation Spirit Stones nearly depleted, without a hint of reluctance. "The large ships are useless - they'll only serve as targets. Destroy them, salvage the refined iron Dragon Bones, and forge spears and arrows. Prepare the remaining small boats and rafts with oil and Yin Fire Talismans."

The orders were concise, each word carrying the weight of a thousand catties.

That night, aided by the thick river mist and the White Bone Fleet's complacency born of their perceived superiority, countless small boats surged forth.

Under the influence of the military strategy Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation, each small boat moved like a fish in a school, working in perfect coordination. Drifting with the current, they attacked en masse, disregarding casualties as they pressed forward in waves.

This was the overwhelming force of ants!

Each boat's attack was as weak as an ant's bite. But when dozens, then hundreds of these weak attacks erupted simultaneously, they churned the water like a school of fish, creating a dark, turbulent abyss.

Deadly chaos spread through the massive white bone giant ships! The grating groan of snapping Dragon Bones, the crackling explosion of Yin Fire lapping at the hulls, and the panicked screams of the crew...

One, two... several of these colossal vessels tilted and disintegrated in the darkness!

Luo Si led the charge, his soldiers swarming up the towering ships like ants crawling a dam. The brutal sounds of combat tore through the thick mist, firelight illuminating the gorge walls like infernal flames.

The enemy commander was both enraged and terrified. He had never witnessed such a bizarre and cunning tactic, one that clung like a festering wound! Seeing his giant ships falling one after another, panic spreading through his ranks, he had no choice but to order a retreat. For the first time, the massive and fearsome White Bone Fleet turned in disarray before the Dragon-Severing Gorge.

Victory achieved - a desperate counterattack!

Having secured victory, Luo Si, gravely wounded and near death, was carried back to the Water Fortress.

The Prefect personally issued a decree praising his valor. Recalling how Luo Si had gained enlightenment through fishing at Dragon-Severing Gorge, where he had defended like an abyssal abyss, the Prefect bestowed upon him a new title more fitting to his current temperament and military strategy: Abyssal Contemplation Ghost General!

This title signified a heart as deep as the abyssal sea, unfathomable and impenetrable, and praised his restrained yet unyielding nature, his ability to accumulate strength before unleashing it in a single, decisive strike!

The past's harrowing drama, once vivid and intense, had ultimately been condensed into a terse entry in his official record.

Luo Si's scattered gaze sharpened as he focused on assessing the outcome of his attack.

This strike had been meticulously prepared and plotted over a long period.

Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation had mobilized the vast majority of Luo Si's military might, unleashing terrifying power that instantly slaughtered countless Imperial Guard soldiers.

Luo Si's control was even more precise and ruthless, with a particular focus on the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts.

Panicked, she hastily activated her defenses, but after holding out for only three breaths, she was overwhelmed by the surging waves of Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation and perished!

Over ten thousand Imperial Guard soldiers were devastated. The center of their formation had been completely cleared, leaving only remnants in the four corners, all fleeing in terror.

Chaos reigned. Everything had descended into chaos.

Immortal Hanyan trembled violently, roaring in fury, "Luo Si, you traitor!"

Luo Si's subordinates, both shocked and enraged, surrounded him, weapons and magic treasures at the ready. "Luo Si, what's going on? Are you being controlled?"

Luo Si's betrayal was devastating. His single strike shattered the battlefield, overturning the entire war situation.

Despite his earth-shattering actions, his expression remained calm, his deep eyes reflecting the Qing-Jiao Army's charging advance.

His gaze settled silently on Ning Zhuo as he replied coolly, "I had hoped for a good gathering and a good parting, but circumstances have forced my hand."

"Everyone, my apologies."

"I am a good person."

"What the hell?!" His subordinates were dumbfounded.

Luo Si suddenly raised his voice, his proclamation echoing across the entire battlefield:

"The Heavenly Dao shines brightly, and the Ghost Laws blaze gloriously!"

"I wield the heavens' authority to punish the disobedient, brandishing heavenly punishment to slay the traitorous!"

"The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, originally entrusted with the Netherworld's sustenance and charged with balancing the Forgetful River, has instead greedily devoured the heavens, his demonic heart obscuring the sun, his sins piling high into the Netherworld - "

"First: Defying the Order of Heaven and Earth! The Heavenly Ghost perished in the primordial age, its remains destined for eternal rest. Yet the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord molded its bones from tainted earth, forged its veins with turbid qi, and refined it on the Sacrificial Altar, brazenly stealing its innate talent!"

"Second: Usurping the Royal Mandate! Holding the exalted position of Prefecture Lord, yet still craving more power, you dared to covet the Heavenly Ghost's remains. A king committing the acts of a bandit - such corruption is abhorred by ghosts and deities alike!"

"Third: Slaughtering Cities for Sacrifice! You claimed to 'face calamity,' yet your true intent was blood sacrifice! The million souls of White Paper Immortal City became fuel for your furnace. Mortal blood dyes pure scrolls crimson - such demonic deeds cannot be tolerated even in the Nine Hells!"

"Fourth: Imprisoning the Way and Betraying Righteousness! The Valley Master of Water Burial guards Heavenly Secrets in stillness. His grace to me rivals rebirth, his virtue permeating the Netherworld. Yet the Prefecture Lord, wielding his power, forced him into concealment, imprisoning his benefactor in a frigid pool and shackling the Stellar Tracks within the valley! Today, I repay this debt. How can I allow wolves to cage the phoenix and qilin?"

"Now I raise my spear against you, not to betray my lord, but to follow the will of Heaven! You have made the Forgetful River your personal tool, treating countless ghosts as mere straw dogs."

"Where the Dark Lord reigns unjust, a wise sovereign awaits. Drawing our swords to follow the dragon, we shall reestablish the cosmic order!"

"Heaven's Punishment is clear, illuminating my resolve! With a wise sovereign by my side, my blade grows ever sharper!"

Luo Si understood perfectly well that to wage war, one must first claim the moral high ground.

Both sides stood frozen...

Immortal Hanyan trembled with cold, his voice shaking as he spat, "Traitor! Shameless wretch! Your silver tongue deserves ten thousand deaths!"

Ning Zhuo, however, seemed lost in thought.

Sun Lingtong had encountered Luo Si alone while exploring the Underworld, by the banks of the Forgetful River, and received his assistance. As a result, Ning Zhuo knew many of the details, including Luo Si's guidance from the Ash Bone Elder.

Among those present, Ning Zhuo was the first to accept this reality.

Qing Chi: "What's he saying?"

Ning Zhuo, using his divine sense to communicate telepathically: "Ignore him. Focus on the attack!"

Qing Chi: "Got it!"

Under the young girl's command, the Qing-Jiao Army seized this critical opportunity, charging forward like a sharp dagger piercing the heart of Luo Si's forces.

Luo Si's army had been severely weakened by recent deployments, leaving them shaken and demoralized. Exhausted and suffering heavy casualties, they were barely capable of resistance.
