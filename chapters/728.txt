Chapter 728: A Fine Young Man! A Promising Seed for Our Righteous Path

"Hold!" A sharp shout drew all eyes to the speaker.

Meng Wuyan, Vice Peak Master of Purple Thunder Peak, stepped forward with his Cloud Body Clone. A fleeting spark of lightning flashed in his narrow, violet eyes.

A smile played on his lips as he said, "Your esteemed discussions have been meticulously reasoned, each point building upon the last. Yet, there is one among us who far surpasses Wen Ruanyu, Duanmu Zhang, Qin De, and Zhong Dao combined."

"She is the true key to the entire White Paper Immortal City affair."

Tuoba Huang snorted, his brow furrowed. "Stop playing coy and just tell us who it is!" His patience was wearing thin.

The crowd's gazes, sharp as needles, pinned Meng Wuyan to the spot.

Though pressed for an answer, Meng Wuyan maintained his deliberate pace. He slowly opened his palm, and swirling clouds coalesced into several illusory objects:

* An ancient Jade Slip bound with a strand of azure silk, its surface crisscrossed with cracks yet radiating a faint, timeless glow.

* A delicate infant's rattle woven from Blood-Dan Vine, its clapper a teardrop-shaped stone imbued with primordial clear Qi.

* A scorched fragment of a yellowed local gazette, its faded characters barely legible. The words "Meng Clan's infant daughter, entrusted to the clouds" stood out, the ink stains resembling dried blood.

Tuoba Huang's impatience growing thin. He was about to bark an order when Meng Wuyan finally spoke, each word measured and deliberate: "The person I speak of is Meng. Yao. Yin."

A hush fell over the entire hall.

Tuoba Huang recoiled slightly, then retorted, "Are you saying Meng Yaoyin isn't dead? That she's still alive?"

Meng Wuyan's expression turned sorrowful as he slowly shook his head. His voice dropped to a low rumble. "Her Life Cloud Tablet has already shattered. She passed away long ago."

"However, during my investigation, I made a surprising discovery: Meng Yaoyin wasn't just a simple rogue cultivator."

"She may not even have known it herself, but she was actually a descendant of our Meng Clan, a branch that had been separated from the main family."

"And these are ironclad proofs!"

Meng Wuyan extended his palm, displaying the material evidence he had just presented to the crowd.

Silence descended once more, but this time it was heavy with suppressed tension.

Tuoba Huang reacted violently, waving his hand to unleash a powerful gust of wind and roaring, "Lies! This is impossible!"

Ling Juejian crossed his arms and sneered coldly. "Meng Wuyan, do you take us for fools? Since Wen Ruanyu's report, all Eight Peaks have been investigating this matter with full force. We've already turned Meng Yaoyin's background inside out."

"She was a pure rogue cultivator with no connection whatsoever to the Meng Clan of Purple Thunder Peak."

"As for your so-called ironclad proofs, ha! I have a question for you."

"Why is it that none of the other seven peaks uncovered even a shred of evidence? Why is it only your Purple Thunder Peak that has managed to gather so much?"

"Hahahaha!" Tuoba Huang roared with laughter, the sound shaking the air in waves. "Purple Thunder Peak is truly regressing! Not only did they appoint a Demon Cultivator as Vice Peak Master, but they've also concocted this absurd scheme to monopolize White Paper Immortal City!"

"You damn liar! Come up with a decent excuse! Do you think we're fools, trying to fool us with this garbage?"

Before his words could fade, Tuoba Huang swung his massive hand, transforming it into a colossal claw of spiritual energy. He lunged at the evidence, intending to crush it in a fit of rage.

Meng Wuyan immediately retreated, a sharp glint flashing in his narrow, violet eyes. His retreat deliberately exposed the evidence to Tuoba Huang's attack.

But in the next instant, golden patterns swirled at Wang Wu's fingertips. With a gentle flick of his hand, he deflected Tuoba Huang's spiritual energy claw.

"Let me see."

Wang Wu beckoned lightly, drawing all the evidence before him.

He scanned each item with his divine sense, finally settling on the Jade Slip.

After a moment, a playful, almost mocking admiration surfaced on his face. "Ah... every word drips with blood, every phrase overflows with sentiment. The meticulous detail and painstaking research in this 'Meng Clan Genealogy' are truly remarkable. Deputy Peak Lord Meng, you've truly outdone yourself."

The purple Qi flashed across Meng Wuyan's face as he straightened his posture, his voice rising with righteous indignation: "Do you, Fellow Daoists, truly believe these are fabrications?"

"These are undeniable truths!"

"Consider this: Meng Yaoyin was our Sect's Golden Core True Disciple, a status that cannot be forged."

"It was her tireless efforts that saved White Paper Immortal City many years ago. Without her, the city would have been destroyed long ago!"

"This woman not only carries the Meng Clan's legitimate bloodline but is also the savior who rebuilt White Paper Immortal City! What greater righteousness could there be?"

"Without her life-risking protection, White Paper City would have become a ghastly den of ghosts and thieves! Where would Wen Ruanyu's current educational achievements be without her?"

"If we acknowledge her true identity, White Paper City rightfully belongs to our Sect! This is the most just and proper course!"

"Wen Ruanyu himself deeply admires Meng Yaoyin. Otherwise, he wouldn't have remained in White Paper Immortal City for so many years. If our Sect seeks to reclaim the city and preserve Meng Yaoyin's hard-won achievements, how could Wen Ruanyu possibly defy her dying wish and refuse to cooperate fully?"

"With this, why would we need to resort to your elaborate schemes, threats, and false promises?!"

Silence fell over the assembly once more.

The fury on Tuoba Huang's face seemed to churn like molten lava, while Ling Juejian's sword aura radiated chilling intensity. Wang Wu's smiling lips concealed an icy coldness beneath their apparent warmth. Xi Zifang lowered her head, her expression unreadable, while Lu Zhenshu remained immersed in his book.

From his seat of honor, Wei Ji's pitch-black pupils reflected Meng Wuyan's impassioned, illusory figure, as well as the expressions of everyone present.

The Meng Clan of Purple Thunder Peak was wise to recruit a Demon Cultivator like Meng Wuyan as their Vice Peak Master, Wei Ji mused inwardly.

Meng Wuyan's method was far more precise and ingenious than any of the strategies discussed earlier.

By establishing Meng Yaoyin's true identity, Wen Ruanyu would have no grounds to resist, and the entire White Paper Immortal City would be brought under the righteous banner of "repaying kindness" and "inheriting her dying wish," leaving them in an utterly vulnerable position.

Duanmu Zhang, Zhong Dao, Qin De... none of these troublesome figures would need to be confronted directly.

But this plan will never be approved, Wei Ji thought with crystal clarity.

For if this were acknowledged, the Meng Clan would seize the ultimate moral high ground. Under the guise of "kinsmen of the benefactor," the Meng Clan could not only gain a foothold in White Paper Immortal City but also dominate the distribution of its resources.

And the deceased Meng Yaoyin would become a sharp banner planted by the Meng Clan into the heart of White Paper City.

The method was sound, easier to execute than previous plans, and beneficial to the Myriad Manifestations Sect - especially advantageous for the Meng Clan of Purple Thunder Peak!

But what about the other peaks?

Would Tuoba Huang, Ling Juejian, and the others willingly play the second fiddle?

Meng Wuyan turned to Wei Ji. "Deputy Peak Lord Wei Ji, as the master of Heavy Formation Peak, you discern the truth behind all matters. What is your judgment on the authenticity of this matter, guided by righteousness? Please..."

Wei Ji's pitch-black eyes met Meng Wuyan's violet pupils, his gaze remained as if separated by invisible glass, calm and detached.

He spoke slowly, his voice low: "Heavy Formation Peak has no intention of interfering in the White Paper Immortal City's conflict over interests."

"However, after this calamity, less than one percent of the city's Grand Formation remains. Once the dust settles, its reconstruction, defense, and maintenance - fundamental to protecting the Dao and safeguarding the people - must be undertaken solely by Heavy Formation Peak."

As his words faded, the Cloud Void fell silent.

This silence, though similar to the one Meng Wuyan had previously created, carried a completely different weight.

Tuoba Huang's fury subsided, Ling Juejian's icy demeanor softened, and Wang Wu nodded with a smile...

No one objected.

Wei Ji was merely the Vice Peak Master of Heavy Formation Peak, but in convening this Eight Peaks council, he represented Peak Master Dong Chen, who also served as the current Sect Leader of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

The assembled cultivators were well-acquainted with the Sect Leader's methods.

Peak Master Dong Chen disliked direct involvement in the scramble for profits, preferring to maintain a detached neutrality while securing his core interests.

Wei Ji's words conveyed Dong Chen's intentions: You can fight over the White Paper Immortal City's profits all you want. But the entire city will ultimately belong to me.

By replacing the city's defensive Formation, he aimed to seize true control of the White Paper Immortal City.

Meng Wuyan's violet eyes flickered briefly before he took a step back, falling silent.

Seeing the situation resolved, Wei Ji withdrew his gaze and spoke again, his voice echoing through the vast Cloud Void: "Summon Zhong Dao, Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall! Summon him to the formation for discussion!"

Zhong Dao's divine sense locked onto the formation, causing the boundary wall to glow. Cloud Qi condensed rapidly, forming a Cloud Body Clone.

The Zhong Dao Clone slowly materialized before the assembled group.

He appeared middle-aged, with deep vertical lines etched between his brows from years of furrowing. His eyes were sharp as blades, radiating undisguised scrutiny and judgment, making it difficult for others to meet his gaze directly.

His nose was high and straight as a mountain peak, its lines taut and unyielding. His jawline was sharply defined.

Tall and imposing, with broad shoulders and a sturdy frame, he stood as straight as a pine tree. After landing, he strode forward with steady, powerful steps, each carrying an undeniable air of authority and unwavering resolve.

His very presence exuded an aura of unyielding authority, conveying an impression of absolute reliability and uncompromising rigidity, yet also stubbornness and inflexibility.

"For what matter have you summoned me?" Zhong Dao asked, his gaze sweeping across the seven figures before him.

His combat prowess, cultivation level, and age surpassed those of the seven present, his only disadvantage being his status as Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall, which ranked slightly lower in the hierarchy.

The group remained silent.

Ling Juejian nodded slightly at Zhong Dao, his expression neutral. Tuoba Huang frowned, his eyes fixed on Zhong Dao with wary intensity.

Wei Ji cleared his throat and briefly summarized the earlier discussion.

"White Paper City? The Yin Mountain Black Marsh?"

After hearing Wei Ji's explanation, Zhong Dao understood the situation.

"Ha," he chuckled softly. "You summoned me here for this?"

"As Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall, my duty is to cleanse the palace and purge demonic influences, not to engage in petty scheming or weigh personal gain."

His face hardened, his sharp gaze sweeping across the room. "Wen Ruanyu and Duanmu Zhang? Fellow Sect Members should interact with integrity and sincerity, not be used as pawns!"

"As for Qin De, he was originally a Demon Subduing Official imprisoned for execution. How dare you make him a key piece in your game?"

"What were you thinking? This is utter nonsense!"

His anger flared as he took a step forward, his voice rising sharply. "The Myriad Manifestations Sect's prestige rests upon righteous methods and boundless Qi! It stands on the shoulders of generations of virtuous predecessors who bore the weight of righteousness, and on the blood and devotion of countless loyal disciples! It cannot be stolen through deceitful means or tarnished by personal gain!"

"You expect me to cooperate with this?!"

The Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall, his eyes blazing like stars, turned the question back on the assembled group, his fury threatening to erupt into violence at the slightest provocation.

Wei Ji sighed bitterly. "Lord Zhong Dao, please temper your anger. The White Paper Immortal City's location is highly sensitive and its strategic value immense. The slightest misstep could jeopardize the entire sect."

"Our disciples, Meng Yaoyin, Wen Ruanyu, and others, followed the Righteous Path on this mission, and didn't disgrace our sect's prestige and righteous aura. Yet precisely because of this, our sect involved in this affair, requiring careful handling."

Zhong Dao snorted coldly, his sharp gaze piercing through the crowd's hypocrisy.

He clasped his fists in a formal salute. "To restore White Paper's reputation, we must act with righteous grandeur. I propose we dispatch the Demon Subjugation Hall to clear the path, supported by the elite forces from the Three Peaks. As Hall Master, I will personally lead the charge, shattering Yin Mountain and plowing through Black Marsh. Every Great Demon whose crimes are undeniable, every Demon Leader whose wickedness is notorious, shall be bound before the gates of White Paper Immortal City, publicly executed, and their heads displayed as a warning!"

"This is the true path to righteous grandeur, and it yields immense benefits!"

"First, it declares to heaven and earth that we stand irreconcilably opposed to evil!"

"Second, it terrifies demons, reminding them that their karmic debts must be repaid!"

"Third, it assures the city's populace that the Immortal Path is not mere empty talk, but possesses the iron will to crush demons and defend righteousness, thereby upholding the people's trust!"

"Fourth, by purging the Demonic Aura and cleansing the Jade Firmament, we bestow unparalleled grace upon the world! By executing heavenly justice and upholding the righteous Method, we demonstrate unparalleled might! With such grace and might combined, we shall secure White Paper Immortal City and banish all future worries!"

The others stared in stunned silence.

Seeing Zhong Dao's palpable killing intent and his uncompromising hatred for demons, they finally remembered the sect's formidable elder - his past experiences and unwavering principles.

Wei Ji and the others regretted their decision. "How could we have been so foolish as to summon Zhong Dao for this discussion? Given his unwavering hatred of evil, he's bound to act according to his own strong will."

They exchanged glances and communicated through divine sense.

"Zhong Dao and Duanmu Zhang are the most stubborn and politically astute figures in the entire sect. Alas, how did the White Paper Immortal City affair drag both of them into this mess?"

A collective headache descended upon them. Meng Wuyan, however, wore a faint smile, as if anticipating a good show.

Meanwhile, in a branch of the Demon Subjugation Hall, the Rising Cloud Trial was underway within a spatial formation.

On a stone platform, Ning Zhuo's hand rested on the official seal, it's inscribed with "Bright Mirror Hanging High." He faced an elderly cultivator who posed a series of questions:

"Suppose you capture a demon or subdue a fiend. If they beg for mercy, offer substantial rewards, or pledge to serve as your slave, how would you handle the situation?"

The elderly cultivator's methods could detect genuine sincerity, but he inadvertently triggered the Buddha Heart Demon Seal within Ning Zhuo's Upper Dantian in his divine sea.

The Precious Seal radiated demonic light, granting Ning Zhuo vast room to maneuver.

His thoughts raced like lightning as he recalled all the information he had gathered about Zhong Dao.

In the next instant, his posture straightened like a pine tree, his eyes remained utterly calm, and his voice rang out like the clash of metal, cold and clear:

"Root out evil completely, show no mercy!"

"To let it linger is to invite future calamity, to defile the righteous Qi of heaven and earth. When the blade must fall, let it fall! When execution is due, let it be done! The only use for a demon's head is to hang it high for public display! Let all the world's fiendish demons tremble at the sight!"

As he spoke, an invisible aura of chilling, murderous intent spread through the air, as if the clang of swords echoed in the void.

On the stone platform, the high-ranking cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall listened, their eyes gleaming with fervor.

The elder cultivator's admiration for Ning Zhuo deepened. He praised inwardly, "Excellent! 'Root out evil completely' - truly a promising seedling of the Righteous Path!"

Unbeknownst to the assembled cultivators, coiled around Ning Zhuo's waist within the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon, Lady Spiderweb - who should have been "rooted out completely" - hummed contentedly as she constructed a Formation for him.
