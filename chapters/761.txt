Chapter 761: Azure Flow Lake

The Bronze Fan unleashed a tempestuous offensive.

A gentle flick of the fan sent wind blades whistling through the air, while a vigorous wave conjured fiery waves that swept across the battlefield.

Its movements were fluid and elusive, like a butterfly, and its attack range was vast.

Ning Zhuo huddled behind his shield, pinned down and forced into a purely defensive stance.

The scorching flames singed the ends of his hair, while wind blades skimmed the ground, slashing at his lower body and injuring his legs.

Gritting his teeth, Ning Zhuo endured the relentless pressure. "Even with my shield blocking most of the attacks, the pressure is overwhelming," he thought. "How are the others faring?"

As he had predicted, the sixth Profound Armament Armor marked a qualitative leap in combat power.

Previous iterations, even with the Renowned Artisan realm's "no technique surpassing technique", it remained limited to conventional martial arts. Their primary threats stemmed from the Bronze Artifacts' inherent sharpness or blunt force.

But the sixth armor incorporated the use of spiritual energy into its Martial Dao, allowing it to unleash blade light and sword Qi.

This newfound ranged capability rendered Ning Zhuo's ability to sense "kinetic force" almost useless.

The Bronze Fan's assault was like a torrential storm!

Caught in the eye of the storm, Ning Zhuo retreated step by step.

In a mere moment, the surface of his bronze shield was already riddled with deep gashes from wind blades, and the shield itself was scorched red-hot from the fiery waves.

Veins bulged on Ning Zhuo's arms as he braced his shield against the relentless onslaught, repeatedly deflecting the most lethal attacks.

If he had relied solely on the shield for passive defense, Ning Zhuo's defeat would have been inevitable. But he still had four other Bronze Artifacts at his disposal.

Guarding Simplicity Wheel-Slaying Formation, activate!

The four Bronze Artifacts began to orbit Ning Zhuo, spinning continuously around him.

Guided by his divine sense, the artifacts launched alternating strikes, constantly disrupting the Bronze Fan's attacks.

Initially, the Bronze Fan's assault remained relentless. But as Ning Zhuo grew more accustomed to the battle and his control over the formation deepened, the artifacts' disruptive effect steadily increased.

The Bronze Fan, being a single entity facing a coordinated assault, was forced to defend.

This weakened its offensive, granting Ning Zhuo a crucial opportunity to catch his breath and regroup.

Ning Zhuo seized this chance, gradually regaining his footing. Activating the formation, he unleashed wave after wave of counterattacks, slowly leveling the playing field.

A fiery torrent, laced with wind blades, surged toward him once more.

Raising his shield, Ning Zhuo abandoned brute force. Instead, he angled it precisely, skillfully redirecting the momentum, dispersing the force, and rotating the shield to maintain his defense.

The shield channeled the violent fire and wind energy, diverting most of it into the surroundings, while the remaining force pressed against the shield's surface without causing Ning Zhuo any harm.

His battle gradually drew the attention of more and more Cultivators from Profound Armor Cave, who gathered to watch the spectacle.

"When did Ning Zhuo become so formidable?"

"To fight the sixth Profound Armament Armor to a standstill in the Rising Cloud Trial... there are only a handful who could achieve such a feat!"

"That's an understatement. Even Golden Core-level cultivators like Ao Pan couldn't handle it with such ease."

The cultivators were momentarily stunned, the image of Ning Zhuo's initial encounter with the first Bronze Artifact flashing before their eyes.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The bronze spear served as the primary offensive weapon, while gauntlets and blades provided support. With a series of strikes, they shattered the Bronze Fan, sending it crashing to the ground.

Ning Zhuo pounced like a bear, pinning the Bronze Fan with his shield. Employing both Divine Refinement and spiritual Refinement, he began to refine the artifact.

"The sixth one... defeated!" Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed with triumph, his heart soaring with elation.

The cultivators from Profound Armor Cave who witnessed this scene fell into stunned silence once more.

"Overall, Ning Zhuo sustained the least damage in the sixth battle."

"His battle formation is remarkably well-designed, perfectly tailored to the Profound Armament Armor at his disposal. This formation allows him to combine his forces, achieving a synergy where one plus one equals more than two. In contrast, other cultivators rotate their armor, essentially fighting a series of one-on-one battles. Ning Zhuo, however, has achieved true group combat."

"But... this feels like a dream. I still remember how clumsy he was against the Bronze Blade, his combat skills utterly pathetic and deeply disappointing."

How had Ning Zhuo suddenly become so strong?!

The crowd was stunned, struggling to process what they were witnessing.

They quickly reviewed Ning Zhuo's trial journey, and the reason became clear.

"Ah! I understand now. Ning Zhuo's learning ability is truly extraordinary. He seized every opportunity to learn, training methodically and without panic."

"Though he stumbled and even crawled through the early stages, each setback yielded immense growth, propelling him forward."

"He's a completely different person now! That's why he's handling the sixth Profound Armament Armor with such ease."

The crowd reached a consensus, their admiration for Ning Zhuo renewed.

In the projection, Ning Zhuo, despite his victory, remained pensive, his brow slightly furrowed.

Cultivator Hao, arms crossed, spoke up, "I have reason to suspect that Ning Zhuo has been acting with purpose and planning since the start of the trials."

"He's acutely aware of his learning capabilities. Even if his Martial Dao strength fell short, he possessed unwavering confidence in his ability to defeat Ban Ji."

He sighed deeply, his expression bleak. "Ning Zhuo shows no hint of arrogance, as if this were commonplace for him. This is the hallmark of a first-rate genius - a level of mastery in a particular domain that we can only dream of achieving in our lifetimes."

The cultivators who had secretly harbored jealousy toward Ning Zhuo now found their resentment dissolving.

When the gap between them became too vast, and the laggards realized they were fundamentally different beings from Ning Zhuo, their envy naturally dissipated.

However, some cultivators remained unwilling to concede. One of them asked, "Does this mean Ning Zhuo is currently the strongest?"

The Cultivator Hao immediately shook his head. "No, he merely possesses exceptional strength, placing him among the elite of this cohort. In the third trial, he'll face other cultivators. Human intelligence and strategic acumen far surpass anything a Profound Armament Armor can offer."

"Ning Zhuo's hastily devised battle formation is superficial and could easily be countered."

"Moreover, the third trial will be a chaotic free-for-all. The situation will be unpredictable, and anything could happen."

While the cultivators debated Ning Zhuo's merits, the man himself remained immersed in thought, occasionally discussing matters with Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong, currently in the Jade Cleansing Hall, had already activated two techniques: "Head Hanging from the Rafters" and "Thigh Pricked by the Awl." With the Luoshu's enhancement, he was fully focused on collaborating with Ning Zhuo to refine the Guarding Simplicity Formation.

Practical combat served as the best teacher.

The recent battle had exposed numerous flaws in their hastily devised formation, while simultaneously sparking countless inspirations in Sun Lingtong's mind.

After reviewing the battle, the pair agreed that instead of rushing to the next stage, they should consolidate their position and focus on enhancing the formation's power.

The latter option would fully leverage Sun Ning's strengths, making it the more reliable choice.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the cultivators' vision suddenly expanded. The formation shifted, transporting them into the true Profound Armor Cave.

The cavern's vast dome stretched high above, devoid of natural light. Here, time had carved a breathtaking spectacle, using water as its blade and stone as its anvil.

Crystalline stalagmites rose from the ground like a forest of spears, while stalactites hung from the ceiling like an array of lances.

The cave walls were layered with countless ridges and valleys, their sedimentary patterns resembling frozen tidal waves or the hammer marks left by a blacksmith forging armor plates.

The constant drip-drip-drip of liquid echoed through the cavern.

Bronze droplets seeped from the stalactites, falling into a small lake at the center of the cave.

The Profound Armor Cave, the Azure Flow Lake.

The lake's waters were still and dense, like a massive piece of jade. Its deep bronze hue was so intense it seemed to absorb all light.

This bronze liquid was the primary material for the Profound Armament Armor.

The cultivators' gazes were drawn to the lake. They all knew the rules: before the third trial officially began, each cultivator would have the opportunity to come to the lake, refine some of its waters, and obtain a blank Profound Armament Armor!

The Profound Armament Armor the cultivators had seized earlier was not theirs to keep. After the Rising Cloud Trial, all of it would have to be returned to the Profound Armor Cave.

However, the Azure Flow Copper they had obtained from the Bronze Lake was a gift from the Profound Armor Cave, theirs to keep. After the Rising Cloud Trial, they could take it with them.

A voice echoed from the Grand Formation, reverberating through the cavern, announcing the rules of the third stage.

Ning Zhuo listened carefully and found that the rules remained unchanged.

He quickly scanned the other cultivators: Ao Pan, Tie Zheng, Lu Zeng, Rust Disaster Craftsman, Ban Ji... and a pool of mangled flesh pierced with swords and blades.

The flesh slowly reformed into Zhang Wangxing.

He knelt on the ground, coughing up blood, but his heart surged with elation. "Finally... finally, I've made it through!"

Having relied on tricks and cheating throughout the trial, he had been utterly helpless against the sixth Profound Armament Armor, forced to flee desperately to buy himself time.

Having already secured five Profound Armament Armor, he had qualified for the next round and was now waiting for the Formation to activate.

Ning Zhuo didn't spot Zhang Dadan and sighed inwardly. "The cultivators who advanced to the third stage are exactly as I predicted."

Instead of confronting Ban Ji, Ning Zhuo immediately headed toward the lake's edge.

The others followed suit.

The immediate priority was to refine some Azure Flow Copper Lake water and obtain an Empty Profound Armament Armor. Each additional Profound Armament Armor a cultivator possessed significantly increased their chances of victory.

Zhang Zheng was the first to approach the lake.

His face was as stern as iron, his feet sinking deep into the ground. He slowly raised his arms, palms facing downward, and pressed down on the lake surface from a distance.

Spiritual energy surged forth, plunging into the lake, then swirling up a massive plume of Azure Flow Copper that slowly levitated into the air.

Zhang Zheng continuously channeled spiritual energy, rapidly refining the copper.

Before everyone's eyes, the Azure Flow Copper gradually transformed into a shield.

He already possessed swords, blades, and various Profound Armament Armor pieces, but lacked a shield. His previous battles had made him keenly aware of the immense value of a defensive weapon.

Ao Pan leisurely approached the lake.

He drew forth his spiritual energy, condensing it into a long whip, and lashed it against the water's surface, drawing up a massive plume of Azure Flow Copper.

The copper was absorbed by his spiritual energy, solidifying into a long whip mid-air.

Lu Zeng was the last of the three Golden Core cultivators to arrive.

He retrieved his Lifebound Treasure, the Heavenly Mechanism Seal, and surprisingly tossed it directly into the lake.

Ban Ji and the Rust Disaster Craftsman moved closer together.

Ban Ji immediately asked, his voice urgent, "Do you have a sword?"

Ban Ji already possessed the Bronze Blade and had finally encountered the Bronze Sword, but he couldn't defeat it. As the battle dragged on, they entered the third trial.

Without hesitation, the Rust Disaster Craftsman handed his Bronze Sword to Ban Ji. These weapons could be transferred.

Moreover, during the refinement of Azure Flow Copper, cultivators were permitted to use healing techniques.

For Ban Ji, this was the perfect opportunity to reclaim his blades and restore their combined attack.

However...

Ban Ji stared at the Bronze Sword in disbelief. "This is your Bronze Sword?!" he emphasized the word "sword," conveying his astonishment.

The Bronze Sword in the Rust Disaster Craftsman's hand had shrunk into a dagger.

The Rust Disaster Craftsman shrugged. "You know about my Heavenly Gold Fiend energy. These Profound Armament Armor aren't suitable for me. Every time I use them, they're corroded by my Fiend energy."

Ban Ji snorted coldly. "Keep it then."

Still unwilling to give up, he pressed, "The Ban Clan entrusted you with assisting me. Ban Jie wouldn't have sent you with just this. What other support did she provide?"

The Rust Disaster Craftsman's eyes flickered before he slowly shook his head. "She might have sent others. I'm just one of them."

Ban Ji snorted again and fell silent.

He needed to focus on healing his injuries and reattaching his severed fingers.

Ban Ji carefully gathered his severed fingers and stored them securely, which would greatly reduce his healing time.

Time was of the essence for Ban Ji. He needed to heal his injuries and refine his Profound Armament Armor.

After a moment, he clenched his fist. Though still weak, he could at least wield a sword again.

Ban Ji surveyed the area and noticed that nearly everyone was gathered around the small lake, refining Azure Flow Copper.

During his long period of healing, no one had offered to help him, leaving Ban Ji deeply disappointed.

"Now that I have a Bronze Blade, the Empty Profound Armament Armor I refine can only be structured as a sword."

"Ah, if only I had a shield, it would give me a significant advantage in the melee."

Ban Ji's gaze lingered briefly on Ning Zhuo before shifting away.

Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged by the lake. His Profound Armament Armor had been disassembled into individual pieces, which he kept close to his body. To outward appearances, Ning Zhuo seemed unarmed, and no one knew how much Profound Armament Armor he possessed.

Using a combination of his divine sense and spiritual energy, Ning Zhuo extracted ordinary Azure Flow Copper from the lake and drew it toward himself.

He refined the copper and incorporated it into all his Profound Armament Armor, thoroughly repairing and reinforcing each piece.

Profound Armament Armor wasn't particularly durable and wore down easily. However, due to the special materials used in its construction, it was also remarkably easy to repair.

Even those who chose to repair their equipment only fixed one or two items at most. Ao Pan, for example, preferred to let his bronze whip break rather than repair it.

The bronze whip had been the first bronze weapon he'd encountered, and it was far too weak.

For him, forging a new bronze whip that perfectly matched his Cultivation Art and whip techniques was the optimal choice.

Ning Zhuo's impartial approach, benefiting everyone equally, was also his optimal choice.

Because he had a battle formation!

Soon, a steady stream of Azure Flow Copper had completely repaired all of Ning Zhuo's Profound Armament Armor.

Only then did Ning Zhuo begin forging new pieces of Profound Armament Armor.

The cultivators from Profound Armor Cave stared at Ning Zhuo's Profound Armament Armor with strange expressions.

None of Ning Zhuo's Profound Armament Armor resembled any conventional weapon. Instead, it looked like a human calf!

The crowd could only sigh: A genius's thinking truly differs from that of ordinary people.

The brief respite passed in the blink of an eye.

The Grand Formation's power surged again, suppressing Golden Core cultivators to Foundation Establishment and elevating Qi Refining cultivators to Foundation Establishment. With cultivation disparities eliminated, the competition now centered entirely around the Profound Armament Armor.

Tie Zheng moved first, slowly approaching Ao Pan. "Care for a spar?"

With this gesture, the chaotic battle of the third trial began.
