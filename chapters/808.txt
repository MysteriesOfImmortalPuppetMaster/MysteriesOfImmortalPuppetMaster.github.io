Chapter 808: Mu Lan Misses Her Husband

"Eh?" Ning Zhuo suddenly felt his whole body relax.

A look of pleasant surprise appeared on his face as a thought abruptly surfaced in his mind: "Could it be that Mother has awakened?"

Li Guanyu, who had been observing him the entire time, could not help but show a look of peculiarity. This was the first time he had seen Ning Zhuo so visibly moved.

Ning Zhuo hurriedly mobilized his divine sense to probe into his own Storage Belt.

The result disappointed him greatly.

The mechanical puppet Buddhist Doctor, where his mother's spirituality resided, showed no movement. The Great Serpent Scythe was also motionless. However, a red flower was emitting a faint glimmer, devouring the principles of the Strange Path from the outside world.

"It's the red flower imprisoning Wu Hen!" Ning Zhuo immediately identified it.

Back during the battle in the Thousand Peaks Forest of the Two Note Kingdom, Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan had coordinated to capture Wu Hen and Lin You. Mu Lan had used her Red Flower Dharma Aspect to seal both captives inside red flowers, eventually handing them over to Ning Zhuo.

These were sub-bodies of the Red Flower Dharma Aspect. As time passed, the power of the seal was constantly weakening.

Ning Zhuo had been waiting for these two red flowers to dissipate naturally. That way, he could carry out a righteous judgment on the two captives.

But the durability of the red flower seal exceeded Ning Zhuo's expectations; it had persisted, albeit faintly, until now.

The once thick petals were now reduced to a thin layer, through which the blurred faces of the captives could even be seen.

Ning Zhuo had been busy participating in various Rising Clouds Minor Trials and hadn't paid attention to this. He hadn't expected that while making the Heart Fire Element, because his body was suffering from erosion by the Strange Path, it would accidentally trigger a mutation in Wu Hen's red flower.

Ning Zhuo observed carefully and saw that after this red flower devoured the Strange Path energy, its size expanded rapidly.

At the same time, the crimson red color was eroded by a purple hue, turning the color turbid and deep.

Wu Hen's physical body had visibly bloated and was slowly deforming, gradually losing its human shape.

"This is bad!"

Ning Zhuo's heart sank upon seeing this. "Wu Hen cultivates the Strange Path; he is a rare cultivator who successfully cultivates it."

"Looking at him now, I fear he has been infringed upon by the Strange Path and has already entered Qi Deviation?"

Qi Deviation was a relatively broad concept in cultivation.

Ning Zhuo analyzed silently: Wu Hen had been imprisoned and sealed for too long, leaving his physical and mental state extremely weak. It was difficult for him to control his own Strange Path cultivation.

With the red flower seal weakening, the Strange Path energy throughout Wu Hen's body naturally attracted the nearby compatible principles.

This was the reason why the Strange Path energy on Ning Zhuo's body had been sucked dry.

The Strange Path energy on Ning Zhuo was merely residue from processing Strange Path exotic materials; it was not cultivated from Wu Hen's cultivation method. After Wu Hen absorbed this, his already dying body found it even harder to bear. His original Strange Path foundation was disrupted, like a basin of clear water tainted by a few drops of residual ink. This caused a chain reaction in the cornerstones of his cultivation - initially, just a corner collapsed, but then it collapsed more and more, faster and faster.

"If not for the red flower sealing and suppressing him, I'm afraid Wu Hen would have undergone Dao Transformation on the spot!" Ning Zhuo felt considerable pressure.

Dao Transformation meant the host body could no longer bear the principles of the Dao.

Previously, when Zhu Fenxiang performed the Divine Summoning Art, the statue could not bear the powerful Divine Art of the Earth Prison Suppressing True Lord, resulting in Dao Transformation. This implicated a branch hall of the Martial Hall, causing it to seal itself off, unusable for a short period.

Now, Wu Hen was in a similar situation and had begun to undergo Dao Transformation, which was effectively Qi Deviation.

"What should I do?" Ning Zhuo was almost helpless against the Strange Path.

He could only closely monitor the red flower seal while continuing to make paper to handle the situation at hand.

Because Wu Hen was constantly absorbing the nearby Strange Path energy, Ning Zhuo could process various Strange Path exotic materials with almost no burden.

Ning Zhuo's paper-making speed skyrocketed!

Li Guanyu was astonished and wondered inwardly, "What method did Ning Zhuo use? Handling these Strange Path exotic materials without suffering any burden from the Strange Path?"

"How did he do it?"

"I must find a good opportunity to ask him for advice."

Li Guanyu excelled at refining Heart Fire Element spirit paper. He had his own method, which was using spirit wine to dissolve the strangeness through drunkenness.

Ning Zhuo's method appeared even more efficient than his spirit wine method, instantly sparking a desire in this Confucian cultivator to learn.

"Damn it... he really still had a trump card!" Gu Qing soon noticed Ning Zhuo's astonishing performance.

After the Vast Peace Paper competition, Gu Qing already regarded Ning Zhuo as a formidable enemy and no longer underestimated him. At this moment, seeing Ning Zhuo start to pull ahead, Gu Qing quickly accepted this cruel reality.

He put away his medicine bottle and stopped taking pills with all his might.

"Save my remaining strength to win in the fifth round!"

Taking pills so frantically would bring a severe burden to Gu Qing's body and mind. Medicinal pills were not Spirit Food; Gu Qing's medication usage would inevitably accumulate heavy side effects.

After realizing that he could hardly catch up to Ning Zhuo even if he gave it his all, Gu Qing decisively held back.

In the end, Li Guanyu publicly announced that Ning Zhuo had won this round.

The cultivators discussed animatedly.

"Ning Zhuo actually managed to refine so much of such difficult spirit paper?"

"I'm ashamed. My cultivation is at the Golden Core level, much higher than Ning Zhuo's, yet my final spirit paper count wasn't even half of his."

"With this, Ning Zhuo and Gu Qing have each taken first place twice, making it a tie for now."

"In that case, the final fifth round will be the deciding match between the two. Haha, wonderful. I am very much looking forward to this duel!"

Everyone clearly favored Ning Zhuo more, or rather, Ning Zhuo was significantly more popular than Gu Qing.

Just like the previous rounds, many people crowded around Ning Zhuo, expressing their goodwill, wanting to befriend the big-headed youth whose future was bright.

But this time, Ning Zhuo was preoccupied. after hastily responding to the circle of people, he left straight away.

Most of the cultivators, however, remained at the scene.

It wasn't that they didn't want to leave, but because they were afflicted by the Strange Path principles. They were all using Li Guanyu's spirit wine to enter a drunken state to release these temporary principles.

-----
Scarlet Ray Valley.

The glowing rays inside the valley were even more dazzling than the setting sun.

Inside the grand formation, the stalemated battle had lasted for over ten days.

"Loose arrows!"

Mu Lan shouted sternly. The Red Flower Camp fired their Blood Tide Repeating Crossbows in unison. Countless arrows flew into the air, converging together to transform into a blood-colored long rainbow.

The long rainbow charged ferociously with the momentum to pierce the sun.

But when it smashed against the light wall of the formation, the majority of it was immediately swallowed up. The remaining power was scant, merely shaking the grand formation slightly.

A cultivator wearing a hideous ghost mask sneered, "This Blood Rust Cage Formation is specifically designed to counter your Red Flower Military Seed. General Mu Lan, you have absolutely no chance of winning."

"Obediently surrender and be captured."

"If we were within the borders of the Two Note Kingdom, perhaps someone would come to support you. But this is outside the Two Note Kingdom!"

Mu Lan's face was calm, her eyes flashing with sharp light.

She had accepted the royal decree to depart from the Two Note Kingdom and head straight for the Flying Cloud Kingdom. On one hand, it was the monarch's order; on the other, she was taking the opportunity to meet up with Ning Zhuo to conduct a transaction involving the Ghost Path Golden Core.

She had traveled in secrecy, strictly guarding the secret of her marching route, but unexpectedly, she still fell into an enemy ambush in Scarlet Ray Valley.

On this diplomatic mission, Mu Lan naturally did not bring the entire Red Flower Camp, selecting only some elites to protect the delegation.

As a result, they were trapped here. After several clashes, they had failed to succeed and could not shake this Blood Rust Cage Formation.

The formation launched a frenzy of attacks. Mu Lan stood at the very front, bearing the greatest pressure.

Her movements gradually showed signs of sluggishness, her spear technique no longer as sharp as before.

The ghost-masked cultivator saw an opportunity, flicked his sleeve, and shot out a pale bone arrow.

This arrow grazed Mu Lan's left arm, instantly shattering her arm armor and soaking her sleeve in fresh blood.

"General!" Zhang Chongyi's eyes nearly split with rage. Although he was Mu Lan's elder, in the army, he considered himself only a subordinate.

"Retreat to the valley center, form the Turtle Shell Formation!" Mu Lan's voice was hoarse, her aura declining.

The soldiers of the Red Flower Camp contracted their formation upon order, using the ballistae as the core and layering shields upon shields. However, the Blood Rust Cage Formation constantly drained everyone's blood qi. The entire army's faces were pale, and after a long time, there were signs that they could no longer hold on.

The ghost-masked cultivator laughed loudly and waved his hand. Immediately, two detachments of troops entered the formation, charging from the left and right.

"Mu Lan, today is the day your Mu Supreme General Manor's lineage ends!"

The situation was as precarious as a stack of eggs, but the entire army did not waver in the slightest, all revealing a will to fight to the death.

Mu Lan sat cross-legged in the formation, closing her eyes to regulate her breathing.

The sounds of killing gradually approached - first a hundred steps away, then fifty steps, and finally thirty steps.

Mu Lan suddenly opened her eyes. At this moment, her gaze was as sharp as a knife.

Mu Lan slowly stood up, simply discarding her broken arm armor, wearing only her red inner lining. Her jet-black long hair danced wildly in the bloody wind, a few strands sticking to her forehead, accentuating her face which was as pale as paper.

But her back was straight as a ramrod.

She raised her hand, and the Crimson Phoenix Bow opened like a full moon.

The ghost-masked Daoist's expression changed drastically. "Impossible, she can shoot a third arrow?! Quickly, stop her!"

Divine Ability - Scarlet Heart Target Arrow!

There was no arrow on the bowstring.

Mu Lan's Essence Blood condensed, transforming into a blood arrow between the strings.

In the next moment, Mu Lan exhaled and shouted, the bowstring vibrating like the strumming of a phoenix!

Using almost all her heart's blood as a guide, an arrow that would hit without fail, fired with reckless abandon!

A beam of crimson divine light pierced through the formation wall, then spread rapidly. Over three hundred cultivators manning the formation eyes screamed in unison; most bled from their seven orifices and died on the spot!

The arrow's momentum did not diminish, shooting straight for the ghost-masked Daoist.

The ghost-masked Daoist vomited blood and flew backward, a bowl-sized bloody hole exploding in his chest. Dignified as a Nascent Soul cultivator, his full-strength defense was as fragile as paper before the Scarlet Heart Target Arrow.

But the shock and terror in his heart did not stem entirely from this Divine Ability, but rather-

"You... you had already seen through the formation's weakness?!"

Mu Lan shouted ruthlessly, "Red Flower Camp, kill with me!"

The formation was broken, and the enemy army suffered severe backlash; it was a perfect opportunity for battle.

The morale of the Red Flower Camp soared like a rainbow as they launched a full-strength counterattack.

The entire army erupted!

The Blood Tide Repeating Crossbows opened fire fully, and the enemy troops, having lost the formation's protection, fell in swathes.

Mu Lan charged forward with her spear.

The Blood Tassel Spear turned into crimson lightning. Every time the spear tip thrust out, an enemy cultivator's throat would spray blood. Her spear technique was unadorned, yet terrifyingly precise.

With her as the arrowhead, they attacked straight into the enemy's weak points, tearing apart the enemy's key nodes.

"Stop her!" The ghost-masked Daoist struggled to get up, blood spilling from his mouth and nose. Disregarding everything else, he poured surging spiritual energy into the formation plate in his hand, attempting to reorganize the formation.

Mu Lan had already rushed over!

The spear glow was like a rainbow, piercing through three Golden Core cultivators, its remaining momentum shattering the formation plate in the ghost-masked Daoist's hand.

The enemy formation was completely broken!

"Re... Retreat!" The ghost-masked Daoist gritted his teeth and ordered, transforming into a bloody light to escape.

"Where do you think you're going?!" A Red Flower Dharma Aspect appeared above Mu Lan's head.

The Dharma Aspect seemed slow but was actually fast. It landed on the ghost-masked Daoist, capturing and sealing him on the spot!

The surrounding sounds of killing gradually subsided.

The outcome was decided.

Mu Lan stood still, taking no further action.

"This ambush definitely involved an internal traitor."

"Although Prince Qiming gifted me the Military Seed, I fear there are still people in the court who will not let my Mu Supreme General Manor rest."

The red flower sealing the enemy leader swirled in mid-air before slowly landing in Mu Lan's hand.

She immediately sensed something - not just this flower before her eyes, but also two distant ones.

"Flying Cloud Kingdom, Husband, seeing you is not easy..." The image of a big-headed youth appeared in Mu Lan's divine sea, half-smiling, half-sighing.

-----
Myriad Manifestations Sect, Main Gate.

Green Stone Cave Abode.

"Sigh." Ning Zhuo frowned deeply, also holding a red flower in his hand, sighing softly.

The formerly red flower had turned a purple-black color. Wu Hen inside no longer had a human shape, looking more like a tumor.

The petals were getting thinner and thinner, while the tumor inside was growing stubbornly.

"Why does it feel like the principles of the Strange Path are breeding rapidly?"

This could not be disposed of casually.

Ning Zhuo knew well: This was an obvious clue. If handled poorly and discovered by outsiders, they could certainly follow the vine to find the melon, tracing it back to his roots quickly.

Currently, he was frequently in the limelight, but because his intelligence was unknown to others, he held many advantages.

Once his background, origin, and history were investigated thoroughly, Ning Zhuo would fall into a passive position.

Therefore, Old Chef came to the Myriad Manifestations Sect incognito. Qing Chi stayed by Ning Zhuo's side, almost never stepping out, only occasionally showing her face to lay the groundwork for when Ning Zhuo's identity in White Paper Immortal City would be exposed in the future.

Everything was arranged.

"The red flower is like a thunder bead; who knows when it might self-destruct."

"It's a pity about Wu Hen."

Originally, Ning Zhuo's plan was to judge him and interrogate him on how he cultivated the Strange Path.

But given the current situation, Wu Hen was clearly finished, and this precious lead was also ruined.

Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment and decided to place it in the cave abode first, having Old Chef, Gongsun Yan, and Qing Chi guard it strictly together.

"The urgent matter at hand is still the fifth round of the Confucian Minor Trial."

"Because Zhong Dao lent me the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone, my current situation is much better than anticipated."

"Strive to master the manufacturing method of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page in the fifth round; that is my main objective!"

Ning Zhuo never forgot his original intention.

In his view, Gu Qing was merely an obstacle and a trouble, not the true target.

"The end of the fifth round also signifies the end of the third Confucian Rising Clouds Minor Trial."

"Whether I win or lose in the end is harmless. Gu Qing is a Confucian cultivator, and the cultivator guarding the pass is his mentor; it is normal for him to win. Conversely, losing to an outsider like me would be embarrassing."

"In fact, after going through the first four rounds, his reputation and public opinion have already been knocked down significantly by me."

What Ning Zhuo valued now was not just the creation method of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, but also the upcoming second Rising Clouds Minor Trial of the Demon Subjugation Hall.

He had been greatly uplifted by Zhong Dao, and this was not without a price.

When he publicly returned the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone, Ning Zhuo had reached a tacit political understanding with Zhong Dao.

For the Demon Subjugation Hall's second Rising Clouds Minor Trial, he needed to participate most actively to show his stance and support.

Victory or defeat regarding the Dao-Bearing Jade Page didn't matter. But for the Demon Subjugation Hall's second round, Ning Zhuo knew he had better take first place!
