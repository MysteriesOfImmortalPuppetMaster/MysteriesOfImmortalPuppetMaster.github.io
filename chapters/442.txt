Chapter 442: The Military Advisor Shows His Might!

"This is the logic of the Strange Dao. Controlling shadow threads to bind the entire army, and then attacking my people —who is it?" At this moment, Ning Zhuo's eyes sparkled brilliantly; he was both surprised and delighted.

Without Sun Lingtong by his side, Ning Zhuo's own reconnaissance methods were not very effective; he couldn't observe the anomalies around him.

He didn't yet know that Wu Hen had already sneaked into the carriage and had seen him.

But because Ning Zhuo was naturally cautious, when the Mechanized Dragon wasn't around, he had released Heavy Armor Blood Ape —Da Sheng and Buddhist Physician —Meng Yaoyin in advance to guard himself, thus avoiding the crisis of being secretly assassinated.

Of course, relying solely on these two Golden Core-level mechanical constructs couldn't completely eliminate Wu Hen's intent to launch a sneak attack.

What truly played a role was the Great Serpent Scythe.

If Wu Hen's insight wasn't sharp enough to see the power of the Great Serpent Scythe, he might have made a move against Ning Zhuo.

At that time, Ning Zhuo's safety would have been uncertain.

Ning Zhuo still didn't know that he had almost been sneak attacked by Wu Hen.

This was the battlefield.

War was perilous and soldiers face danger!

As long as one set foot on the battlefield, the risks multiplied; even Nascent Soul cultivators could be beaten until they vomited blood and fled, let alone a small Foundation Establishment cultivator like Ning Zhuo.

However, Ning Zhuo had long been mentally prepared; he would rather bear such risks to plot for the mechanized carriage.

"Ever since Zhang Zhongyi healed Boss Sun, I knew that to heal my mother's Dao injuries, I must have attainments in two fields."

"Who is the person attacking me? It should be Wu Hen from the Dragon King Temple side, right?"

"One field of attainment is in medical arts; the other is in the realm of the Strange Dao."

Ning Zhuo had temporarily joined the Liangzhu Kingdom and was also the military advisor and sacrificial wine of the Three Generals Camp, his position high enough to obtain much intelligence.

Therefore, he knew many famous Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators in the Thousand Peaks Forest.

Chen Lingfeng and Wu Hen were both outstanding among the Golden Cores and were naturally remembered by Ning Zhuo.

"What secret manual does this Wu Hen cultivate?"

"On ordinary days, I have little chance. But now, with the two armies confronting each other, he is also on the battlefield; the probability of seizing his cultivation method has greatly increased!"

As for cultivation manuals of the Strange Dao, the Complete Book Tower also has them.

But if Ning Zhuo wanted to buy them, wouldn't he have to spend spirit stones or tower gold?

On the battlefield, if he could seize them, he would be paying another kind of cost.

"Moreover, if I can capture Wu Hen alive, I can force him to divulge his cultivation experiences. It would be as if I not only obtained the secret manual but also brought back a teacher."

Ordinary cultivators don't have such means, but Ning Zhuo, mastering the Life-Hanging Thread and the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal, has the possibility of making Wu Hen speak.

Back then in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, when Ning Zhuo faced Han Ming, didn't he use the staff head and the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal to control her to perform the Soul Devouring Art, assisting Ning Zhuo's cultivation for quite some time?

Ning Zhuo has now cultivated the upper methods of the Three Sects and cannot switch to cultivating the Strange Dao's methods.

He also finds it difficult to find Strange Dao methods that are as excellent as the Three Sects' upper methods.

Even if he brought his own skills to find a master, it would be hard to find a good teacher in this aspect; so he can only do it himself and be self-sufficient.

"Find Wu Hen, get rid of him! Better yet, capture him alive, interrogate and force him to talk... No, I mean, persuade him, guide him towards good, turn him from evil to righteousness."

Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo laughed aloud: "Good, which cultivator has attacked me?"

"Your methods are quite elegant; you have talent."

"What a pity, such talent serving the Thousand Peaks Forest is like casting pearls before swine."

"Comrades, if there's a chance later, strive to spare this person's life. Let me persuade him to turn from evil to righteousness!"

Ning Zhuo used his methods to spread these words throughout the battlefield; both enemies and allies heard them clearly.

Wu Hen immediately felt that many inexplicable gazes from his comrades were focused on him.

The noise of the entire battlefield diminished considerably.

What? What?!

What did Ning Zhuo say?

His deathly pale face flushed red with anger: "Ning Zhuo, you brat, a mere Foundation Establishment, how dare you humiliate me like this?! I will make him pay the price."

He gnashed his teeth, almost roaring out loud, expressing his clear attitude.

Zhang Hei widened his eyes and looked at Ning Zhuo. He hadn't misread; Ning Zhuo was indeed proclaiming this.

But the problem is, the one who made the move is obviously a Golden Core; you're just a Foundation Establishment, Ning Zhuo!

Guan Hong subconsciously stroked his beard, feeling that Ning Zhuo's words were really to his liking!

"As a Foundation Establishment, speaking to a Golden Core like this, as if defeating him is as easy as taking something from a bag. Such loftiness, confidence in victory—uplifting! Really uplifting."

"I've learned something, I've learned!"

Guan Hong was an ambitious person, well-versed in the 'Spring and Autumn Art of War,' and was good at learning from practice.

Liu Er sighed in his heart: "Truly worthy of being a military advisor, worthy of being a scion of a great family—the confidence is just different!"

He didn't think that Ning Zhuo was boasting shamelessly.

Although Ning Zhuo's true cultivation was only early Foundation Establishment, it was obvious that he was displaying solid Golden Core-level combat power, and even surpassed Liu Er himself!

There's nothing to say about that.

Wu Hen was angry, anxious, and shocked, and had even suffered a backlash.

He relied on the Strange Dao cultivation methods, often invincible. Such an encounter was quite rare.

Wu Hen was severely injured and lost control over many shadow threads.

In the Three Generals Camp, many soldiers had freed themselves from the shadow threads and were pulling their legs, feet, and arms out of the soil one by one.

Although the ground had become solid again, it wasn't like rock. The cultivators used their own methods, and don't forget the battle formation's support; they quickly broke free and regained their freedom.

In the blink of an eye, the formation of the Three Generals Camp had recovered more than half.

Wu Hen, while struggling to maintain the remaining shadow threads, actively circulated his energy to heal.

The Strange Dao, when facing conventional opponents, could occupy a great advantage. This was because conventional methods were hard to restrain the Strange Dao.

But such an advantage could also be seen as a disadvantage —in that the commonly available pills, magic weapons, talismans, etc., were incompatible with Strange Dao cultivators.

Moreover, in the cultivation methods Wu Hen practiced, there were no pill recipes.

Therefore, after battles, Wu Hen couldn't heal himself or enhance his cultivation through pills.

The Strange Dao was vastly different from other paths. Even the Ghost Dao could draw on other principles, but the Strange Dao was vastly divergent from others; many people found it difficult to understand.

Wu Hen's injury allowed the Three Generals Camp to catch their most crucial breath.

As soon as Ning Zhuo made a move, he consecutively resolved two kinds of constraints; his achievements were astonishing.

The entire army was invigorated; some even shouted: "The military advisor is mighty!"

Ning Zhuo raised his big head, instantly adapting to the key points of making moves within the battle formation.

In short, it was about showing off and displaying strength.

The more glamorous and powerful one appeared, the more confidence it brought to comrades, boosting morale and unity, thereby influencing the overall power of the battle formation!

So he lightly leaped onto the carriage, under everyone's gaze, clapped his hands fiercely: "Gentlemen, watch me kill the enemy!"

Wood Element —Tree World Advent.

Saplings broke through the ground and in a few breaths grew into towering trees!

Countless vines, like swarms of pythons, traversed the forest, spreading out in all directions.

This was mountainous terrain.

The environment here was already suitable for tree growth; the Wood Element spirit energy was abundant.

Moreover, Ning Zhuo had the support of the battle formation and national defense, so after he cast the spell with all his might, his heart skipped a beat, surprised at the power of this Tree World Advent.

In no time, giant trees sprang up densely, leaves lush, blocking the fierce wind. Vines attacked, using offense as defense, expanding the basic field.

Chen Lingfeng hovered in the air; seeing his gale blocked by the forest, he couldn't help but snort coldly.

Wind Element —Hundred Blade Storm.

Spirit energy surged wildly, transforming into over a hundred wind blades, swirling and dancing, covering downward.

These wind blades appeared semi-transparent emerald green, each as large as a carriage, extremely sharp.

After falling into the Tree World, the wind blades spiraled forward, cutting the giant trees along the way in half.

Boom, boom...

In an instant, a large number of giant trees fell, stirring up dust all over the sky.

Amid the dust, the group of wind blades was reduced to about fifty, charging towards the Three Generals Camp.

Chen Lingfeng saw the opportunity was ripe and transformed into his original form, which was a crimson-crowned feathered crane.

The feathered crane was even larger than an elephant, with a wingspan of 4.8 zhang.

The crane demon raised its neck and let out a long cry, emitting a piercing, mournful sound.

Demonic Art —Crane's Lament Sorrowing the Sky!

The sound waves echoed throughout the battlefield, drilling into the ears of the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp, triggering feelings of sadness in their hearts.

Many soldiers shed tears on the spot, dropped their weapons, knelt on both knees, and wept bitterly.

"I might as well die!"

"Woo woo woo, what's the point of me living?"

"My beard is so long, yet I still have achieved nothing; my life is worthless."

Morale plummeted, and the army's unity scattered again.

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and cast a spell.

Fire Element —Rage Makes Hair Stand.

Earth Element —As Solid as a Rock!

Flames emerged from the top of his head, forming a huge crown, covering a large area of the sky.

Then, the flames rolled like clouds, causing the soldiers below to become furious, dispelling the sorrowful wails.

At the same time, around the battle formation, walls of rock and earth rose, hard and solid, intercepting all the wind blades.

Ning Zhuo, facing two enemies alone, did not fall behind.

"Eh?" Chen Lingfeng and others once again showed strange expressions.

Ning Zhuo, a mere early Foundation Establishment, but through multiple blessings of the battle formation and national defense, the power of his spells surged, allowing him to leap over a major realm and contend against two Golden Core cultivators!

"The military advisor is mighty!" The whole army cheered excitedly.

Ning Zhuo laughed aloud, but his face turned much paler.

After casting spells several times in succession, his magical power was almost exhausted! At this moment, in secret, he desperately circulated the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique to refine magical power.

He was being held back by his cultivation base.

Just early Foundation Establishment, not even reaching the first stage of 'Opening Fields Without Obstruction.'

"Three generals, I have exhausted my magical power and cannot continue," Ning Zhuo secretly transmitted with his divine sense.

Liu Er immediately responded: "Military advisor, quickly rest; you have performed well enough and helped the entire army greatly! It's time for us three Golden Core cultivators to play our role."

Guan Hong and Zhang Hei echoed in unison.

"All troops, follow me to charge!" Liu Er waved the Xuanhuang Sword in his hand, officially switching from defense to offense.

A cultivator army of nearly three hundred people, forming a triangular arrowhead formation, after slowly starting, the marching speed increased sharply, charging towards the nearest Golden Core cultivator.

The Golden Core cultivator hurriedly retreated.

But at this moment, Zhang Hei charged out, his speed extremely fast, like a pitch-black whirlwind.

"Where are you going? Look at my spear!"

The Golden Core cultivator saw that he couldn't dodge and hurriedly raised all his defenses.

As a result, his defenses were like paper; his whole body was pierced through by the Black Snake Spear, losing his life immediately.

Zhang Hei was originally a Golden Core; with the support of the battle formation and national power, his offensive was extremely fierce.

However, after instantly killing a Golden Core cultivator, he did not pursue the victory but immediately returned to the tip of the triangle, rejoining the formation.

The three generals held extraordinary positions; Liu Er was the heart of the formation, and Generals Guan and Zhang were the formation's eyes; they could not leave the formation for too long.
