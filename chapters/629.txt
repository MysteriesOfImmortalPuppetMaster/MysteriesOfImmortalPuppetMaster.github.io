Chapter 629: Forgetful River Prefecture Lord vs. Soundless Ghost Monk

Tie Guzheng was sent flying backward.

He crashed onto the city wall, his tiger's mouth already split open. Blood stained the fan handle as tearing pain radiated through both arms. His spiritual energy and blood still surged violently, difficult to calm.

Yet Tie Guzheng had no mind to soothe his spiritual energy. He whipped his head around to focus on the battle behind the city gates.

He'd repelled the Giant Bone Crocodile, resolving one crisis for White Paper Immortal City.

But the previous crisis remained unresolved: Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer who'd breached the city walls, along with six Golden Core Ghost Generals enhanced by Military Power Amplification.

Even if Tie Guzheng desperately wanted to reinforce his comrades, turning and rushing back would take precious time.

"Whoever you are, hold the line!"

"We must buy critical time for reinforcements!"

"I'm coming now!"

Tie Guzheng's eyes nearly burst from their sockets as he roared inwardly.

Wen Ruanyu and Zhou Wenyan fought side by side, their divine senses intertwining in silent communication. They reached a shared resolution: "Hold them off with everything we've got. The reinforcements will come!"

Wen Ruanyu unrolled a scroll. The parchment unfurled to reveal his self-portrait.

His painted likeness stepped out of the scroll, a grave expression etched on his face as he took the vanguard position.

Zhou Wenyan produced a book bearing the words "Spring and Autumn" on its cover. The tome emitted a dual-hued glow of yellow and green, enveloping the surroundings to create a favorable battlefield environment.

Six Golden Core Ghost Generals rode skeletal steeds, their presence radiating an utterly cold pressure that extinguished all vitality as they completely surrounded Wen and Zhou.

Without hesitation, the Yin Poison Ghost General drew the Hundred Ghosts Poison Pouch from his waist and hurled it forth.

The pouch served as a magical artifact.

Ghost Technique: Yin Poison Ghost Domain!

Whoosh.

Viscous dark green poison splattered across the area, emitting a foul stench before rapidly evaporating into a pervasive haze of Yin Qi.

This toxic Yin Qi, laced with lethal venom, caused the very air to hiss with corruption.

Zhou Wenyan's Spring and Autumn radiance was immediately suppressed.

Wen Ruanyu, wielding a brush, employed Confucian techniques to inscribe a massive character for "Rites" in the battlefield's airspace.

The character emitted golden light that decomposed the poison, but it quickly began to fade. First, the edges of the character dissolved into tendrils of black smoke, then the entire character rapidly disintegrated until it vanished completely.

Wen Ruanyu's body jolted as the broken spell's backlash surged through him. His qi sea churned violently, requiring immediate stabilization.

In the next instant, a piercing wail of lamentation tore through the air.

The wail was so shrill it threatened to rend the very soul.

Even with Wen and Zhou having activated their protective measures, they still felt agonizing pain in their souls.

Their divine sense spread across the battlefield, revealing the Wailing Ghost General wildly shaking a bone flute. As he thrashed about, wind poured into the instrument's holes, unleashing a naturally harmonized sonic assault.

"Suppress!" Zhou Wenyan roared like thunder, spitting out a character that formed the massive word "Suppress" in mid-air.

The character hovered above the battlefield, resisting the sonic assault. It swayed violently, holding on for three breaths before showing signs of collapse.

Though Wen Ruanyu and Zhou Wenyan were powerful Golden Core True Inheritors from their respective sects, fighting these six Ghost Generals proved extremely challenging!

The reason lay in these six Ghost Generals having been enhanced by Military Power Amplification, their combat strength rivaling Nascent Soul cultivators.

A venomous light flashed in the scarlet Ghost General's eyes. His fingers extended like a butterfly weaving through flowers, shooting out crimson threads that entangled the floating Spring and Autumn Tome.

He abruptly merged his fingers inward, the crimson threads tightening with steel-like force.

The Spring and Autumn Tome, unable to withstand the strain, twisted violently. The sound of paper tearing filled the air as its yellow-green glow dimmed.

Simultaneously, Zhou Wenyan's Suppress character disintegrated.

This left Wen and Zhou's defenses in tatters, exposing gaping vulnerabilities.

"Die!" The Long Axe Ghost General had been priming his attack. Seizing the opening created by his comrades' maneuvers, he erupted with terrifying force from his Ghost Cavalry mount, soaring through the air.

He raised his Mountain-Cleaving Long Axe high, channeling ghost techniques that wreathed his body in eerie blue Ghostfire. The weapon descended with enough force to shatter mountains and obliterate all life.

With Wen Ruanyu's self-portrait doppelganger complicating identification, the Long Axe Ghost General's strike targeted Zhou Wenyan first.

Looking up, Zhou Wenyan saw the axe bearing down on him. The air screamed with the force of the blow, as if it could split the earth itself.

The Ghost General's strike was impossibly swift, vicious, and precise.

Zhou Wenyan's pupils contracted to pinpoints. Every hair on his body stood erect as the shadow of death engulfed him.

In that fleeting moment, he could only hurl another book.

Before he could fully activate its power, the Long Axe split the book in two mid-flight.

Now fueled by Ghostfire, the axe's momentum surged as it closed in on Zhou Wenyan's forehead.

At the critical moment, Wen Ruanyu bit his tongue, spraying vital essence blood as he channeled Golden Core spiritual energy into his magic treasure - the brush.

He hurled the brush directly forward.

Confucian technique - Cast Aside the Brush for the Sword!

The brush blazed with crimson-gold radiance, forcing the six ghost generals to squint against the glare.

Boom!

The brush collided with the long axe in a deafening explosion.

Crimson-gold light and sapphire ghostfire clashed, merging into a chaotic conflagration that spread outward.

Zhou Wenyan, Wen Ruanyu, and several ghost generals were sent flying, all gravely wounded.

The Shadow Ghost General employed a ghost technique, transforming into a shadow that clung to the ground as it pursued Wen and Zhou.

Wen Ruanyu's Lifebound Treasure had been destroyed, leaving him unconscious on the battlefield.

Zhou Wenyan, however, retained a shred of clarity. Sensing imminent doom, he bellowed, "Spring and Autumn as sacrifice! Let the Literary Path perish for righteousness!"

In the next instant, the Spring and Autumn tomes floating across the battlefield ignited spontaneously, unleashing pure, blazing white Holy Flame.

The Holy Flame expanded rapidly, coalescing into a pillar of blinding light that enveloped Wen and Zhou.

The Shadow Ghost General let out a pained grunt, unable to withstand the radiance, and retreated immediately.

Though the pillar of light was immensely powerful, it burned out quickly, dissipating completely.

The six ghost generals closed in for the kill, while Wen and Zhou lay drained like lamps without oil, their consciousness fading.

On the distant city walls, Tie Guzheng witnessed this scene, his eyes blazing with fury.

He urgently activated the Commander's Seal in his possession, attempting to mobilize the Immortal City Formation to protect Wen Zhou and the others.

But at that moment, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer - who had been neglected until now - had already produced a white candle.

The Return to Silence Path Candle!

This was a square-shaped candle, resembling a miniature Spirit Coffin, about nine inches long with the lid and body fitting together perfectly. The four surfaces of the candle were engraved with scenes of hundreds of ghosts carrying coffins - twisted figures wailing as they staggered toward nothingness.

The wick of the candle was made from yellowish burial cloth, intertwined with the woman's black hair in a spiral pattern.

This was a Nascent Soul-level magic treasure, usable only once!

"The lost treasure has fallen into our enemy's hands!" Tie Guzheng, sensing Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer's movements, paled with shock. He knew she possessed this trump card, but never imagined she would use it now against the White Paper Immortal City.

With no choice, Tie Guzheng abandoned Wen Zhou and the others, diverting all his efforts to mobilize the White Paper Immortal City's defensive forces against Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.

Sensing the mountain-like pressure bearing down on her, every movement of Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer became sluggish.

Her expression remained impassive as she mustered her spiritual energy, barely managing to blow on the candle.

In the next instant, the Return to Silence Path Candle was ignited.

The frost-white flames danced continuously, producing countless intricate blue talismans at their core.

A scent reminiscent of incense mixed with decay immediately spread outward.

The blue talismans drifted through the fragrant air, dispersing into the surrounding space and forming a blanket of white frost.

Within the white frost, a pitch-black winding path materialized. Along both sides of the path, countless overlapping ghost figures appeared, as if carrying coffins.

"Damn it!" Tie Guzheng growled, his eyes blazing with fury at the sight.

He could have easily suppressed any other opponent. But Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was different - this entity also knew the secrets of the White Paper Immortal City's Formation.

Though Tie Guzheng's suppression wasn't entirely ineffective - what should have been seven winding paths had been reduced to just one - even a single path could drastically alter the course of battle!

Luo Si's eyes flashed with calculation. He immediately issued orders, using Military Might to extend the winding path directly into his own battle formation.

A Dead Bone Giant took a step forward, entering the path.

In the next instant, its footfall carried it directly into the White Paper Immortal City!

If the city gates remained closed, such teleportation would have been impossible. But now, with the gates wide open and unable to close in time, and with Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer using the precious Return to Silence Path Candle, teleportation became feasible.

The Dead Bone Giant, a formidable siege weapon, had now bypassed the greatest obstacle - the city walls - and arrived directly within the city.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The giant roared, smashing buildings left and right. In moments, it caused massive destruction and numerous casualties.

Countless citizens fled in all directions, panic spreading through the city.

At this critical moment, Yang Sanyan - the Golden Core True Disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect - and Bone Tomb Daoist - the Golden Core True Disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect - rushed to the scene.

After a single glance at the Dead Bone Giant, both immediately abandoned any attempt to engage it.

"Save the civilians first!" they communicated through divine sense, reaching instant agreement.

They sprang into action, rescuing Wen Ruanyu and Zhou Wenyan just as disaster struck.

The six Ghost Generals' combined attack wasn't entirely fruitless - they managed to reduce Wen Ruanyu's self-portrait duplicate to splinters.

The backlash hit Wen Ruanyu's True Form, blood spraying from his nose and mouth as he slipped into a deeper unconscious state.

Yang Sanyan opened the eye slit between his brows, fixing an intense gaze on Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.

High-grade Innate Talent - All Under my Gaze is Emptiness!!

Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer remained numb, standing frozen in place like a walking corpse.

Yet at this critical moment, the Return to Silence Path Candle in her hand flared to life. Its flame intensified, blazing several times brighter than before, its consumption rate doubling.

White frost spread as black pathways regenerated, blocking Yang Sanyan's gaze.

More precisely, they diverted his line of sight elsewhere.

Of the six Ghost Generals, two detached to confront Yang Sanyan and the Bone Tomb Daoist.

The remaining four veered away, converging on the rear flank.

They tore through the Cultivators blocking their path, reducing them to shredded flesh - perfect sacrificial offerings for the sacrificial ritual.

Their strategy became clear - the four Ghost Generals' assault routes all pointed toward the Paper Giant Colossus ahead.

In the Underworld,

the Offering of Tribulation Altar's crimson glow intensified by three degrees.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's face split into a triumphant grin as he glared at the Soundless Ghost Monk. "Wuyin, do you see? The sacrificial ritual proceeds flawlessly. My victory is assured - your efforts will all be in vain!"

The Soundless Ghost Monk wore a yellow robe, his face resembling a dried orange peel devoid of vitality. His lips were pressed into a gray line, as if they hadn't opened in millennia. Only his eyes remained - muddy, vacant, reflecting nothing, like two wells leading to absolute emptiness.

He raised his right hand, a withered index finger with crumbling nails pointing toward the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

Silence reigned.

Yet, with the monk's fingertip as the center, the space within a hundred zhang collapsed inward!

From the first move, the Soundless Ghost Monk had unleashed his trump card - the Void Return Finger technique from the Nirvana Zen Sutra!

The collapsing space left only darkness, erasing everything in its path.

The darkness spread rapidly, targeting not just the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, but the entire sacrificial altar.

The Prefecture Lord's robes whipped wildly without wind. He raised his arms high and roared, "Forgetful River's Call! Ten Thousand Souls Flow!"

Immeasurable spiritual energy surged forth, converging on the Forgetful River Water he had summoned.

The phantoms of billions of Wailing Souls shrieked within the river, merging into a viscous gray stream that churned with countless tormented souls.

The turbid stream surged upward, defying the heavens!

The raging floodwaters of the turbid stream collided violently with the Void Return Black Sphere.

Hiss... Hiss... Hiss...

There was no earth-shaking explosion, only the corrosive sound of two supreme forces mutually annihilating each other, a noise that made teeth ache and hearts tremble.

The dark yellow turbid stream was continuously dissolved into nothingness by the power of Void Return, but the Forgetful River Water flowed endlessly, its power from the Wailing Souls inexhaustible.

Though the Void Return Black Sphere continued to stubbornly rotate and devour, its expansion was completely halted by the overwhelming power of the Forgetful River. The two forces formed a breath-holding stalemate in mid-air!

The Soundless Ghost Monk's hollow eyes twitched imperceptibly.

Even this slight movement was detected by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, who immediately thought, "Not good."

This place wasn't on the Forgetful River. The ability to summon Forgetful River Water from thin air was entirely due to the power of the large array here.

And controlling this array wasn't just him, but also the five Nascent Souls operating outside the rotating yin wind, along with the 30,000 Imperial Guards.

The Soundless Ghost Monk was a formidable opponent, recognized as the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's greatest enemy. With a single move, he immediately grasped the critical point.

He withdrew his index finger, allowing the Void Return Black Sphere to be consumed by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's torrent of ten thousand souls.

He pressed his palms together, then slowly separated them by a hair's breadth.

Under the Heart Seal, he unleashed another technique: the Silent Nirvana Zen Sound!

This sound was formless and intangible, impossible to capture or block. Like ripples spreading across water, it silently permeated the yin wind and dispersed outward.

In that moment, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord fell into hesitation.

He could save his subordinates, but doing so would inevitably put him at a disadvantage.

If he didn't intervene, his forces would suffer heavy losses, but it would also grant him an opportunity to strike at the Soundless Ghost Monk.

This chance was exceedingly rare.

In a duel between experts, the advantage often lay in seizing that critical first move.

Securing this initial advantage could rapidly expand into overwhelming superiority, transforming into overwhelming momentum.

This wasn't just true in duels between experts - even in the most intense battles, the struggle for that crucial first strike remained paramount!

When Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer opened the city gates, it represented that critical first strike.

When Tie Guzheng mustered all his strength to repel the Giant Bone Crocodile, he too was fighting for that decisive moment.

Now, as four Ghost Generals charged toward the Paper Giant, they were seizing another such opportunity.

"Disaster! The Paper Giant hasn't been activated yet, and Wen Ruanyu has fallen unconscious - he's at his weakest!"

"If the enemy exploits this moment, we'll lose a Nascent Soul-level combatant!" Tie Guzheng's anxiety surged, but he was too far away to help.

The Ghost Generals roared with laughter, closing in even more.

Among them, the Long Axe Ghost General leaped forward once again, his entire body engulfed in eerie blue Ghostfire, aiming to sever the Colossus's leg.

Thud!

The Paper Giant suddenly thrust out its leg, sending the Long Axe Ghost General flying with a single kick.

"Ugh!" The remaining three Ghost Generals were utterly astonished.

Within the Paper Giant, Ning Zhuo had arrived just in time. His eyes blazed with the flames of combat as he snarled, "Don't you dare touch what belongs to my mother!"
