Chapter 595: Jade Chime True Formation

The ghost army advanced silently, moving like shadows in the gloom.

Within one of the chariots, Sun Lingtong was filled with confusion. “When did I act arrogantly?” he wondered.

The mocking voice beside him sneered, “You dared confront Lord Silent right away! You’re lucky he’s generous and broad-minded, choosing not to squabble with a mere Foundation Establishment ghost cultivator like yourself.”

Sun Lingtong immediately understood his situation. “I see. I deliberately chose this chariot to spy for Little Zhuo, so I purposely provoked them, leaning on Elder Luo Si’s authority. Now I’ve ended up alienating everyone.”

Yet his earlier amnesia had undone everything. After intentionally antagonizing Lord Silent and his subordinates, he embarrassingly had to ask them directly about his own provocations. It was absurd - like a clown putting on an unintended performance.

But having grown up surviving in rough streets and alleys, Sun Lingtong felt no shame over such trivial humiliation.

Being mocked was always better than losing one’s life.

Yet, sacrificing his life meant nothing to Sun Lingtong, provided it was for the right person.

“Little Zhuo, Little Zhuo…” Sun Lingtong secretly called through the Life Hanging by a Thread, but there was no response.

His heart sank immediately. Thinking carefully, he realized, “The water from the Forgetful River couldn’t wipe my memories, yet Luo Si did so effortlessly. His methods are strong enough to suppress even my Void Seal. He’s far more formidable than I expected!”

“Now I can’t contact Little Zhuo. This ghost army’s march is probably cloaked by powerful concealment techniques, which have also disrupted my communication with Little Zhuo.”

This was perfectly reasonable.

In today’s cultivation world, methods and doctrines blossomed abundantly, and military strategies had reached remarkable sophistication. Concealed marches were the norm, while overtly powerful maneuvers like Iron Torrent Sweeping the Plains were rare.

The Underworld’s domain, analogous to powerful cultivation kingdoms in the mortal realm, naturally had elite formations and tactics. If Sun and Ning could so easily breach their secrecy, that would be utterly ridiculous.

After all, both of them were merely Foundation Establishment cultivators, far from capable of miraculous feats.

In mere breaths, Sun Lingtong’s mind flashed through countless deductions and reached complete clarity.

Chuckling coldly, he provoked again, “You’re laughing so nicely now. I hope you’ll still laugh like this later. This raid into the city - can you all really make it back?”

“You’re all walking dead, so I won’t hold grudges!”

Even if he’d gathered some intelligence before, he’d forgotten it now.

Likely, he’d gleaned nothing anyway. He’d scanned his body carefully with divine sense but found no jade slips or similar recording devices.

To gather intelligence once again, Sun Lingtong boldly antagonized six Golden Core cultivators simultaneously, despite being only at Foundation Establishment!

Of course, it wasn’t reckless bravado.

Observing outside the chariot, Sun Lingtong noted the impeccable discipline and rigid order of the ghost troops - undoubtedly elite soldiers from the Underworld Domain of Forgetfulness.

Just as one should exploit a gentleman’s righteousness, Sun Lingtong inferred that internal conflict would be harshly penalized, especially with battle imminent.

As expected, three Golden Core ghost generals reacted instantly.

Among them, one ghost general with a bone club roared, “Insolent dog! Just a puny Foundation Establishment cultivator, yet so arrogant!”

He brandished the bone club towards Sun Lingtong.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three muted impacts echoed, forcing Sun Lingtong onto his knees inside the chariot.

He tried to struggle but couldn’t move, every joint blazing with pain!

The bone-club ghost general sneered cruelly, “My bone club specializes in striking joints. Little Foundation Establishment cultivator, does it hurt?”

“If it hurts…” He pointed the club again.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three more strikes hit him. Sun Lingtong gasped in agony, his breathing labored, the pain drilling down to his bones, nearly knocking him unconscious.

Yet Sun Lingtong stubbornly refused to groan in pain. Instead, he glared defiantly, shouting, “Come on! Beat me to death if you dare!”

The bone-club ghost general lifted his club high in rage, only to be stopped by the Crimson-haired Ghost General beside him.

Laughing loudly, the Crimson-haired Ghost General teased, “Old Bones, I know you intended good for this junior, loosening his joints a bit. But look, your kindness backfired - he doesn’t appreciate it at all!”

“Take a good look at my technique!”

As he spoke, the Crimson-haired Ghost General blew out a stream of fiery breath, engulfing Sun Lingtong entirely.

The ghostly flames penetrated straight into Sun Lingtong’s very soul, scorching him from within. Agony seized every fiber of his being, causing him to tremble violently, yet he gritted his teeth and endured without uttering a sound.

The Crimson-haired Ghost General squinted, a cruel smile spreading across his lips. “Does it feel good? My Netherworld Ghost Flames can directly burn the soul, bringing you some warmth, eh?”

Following him, the Green-faced Ghost General unleashed another sinister move. Patches of corpse moss began sprouting across Sun Lingtong’s tortured body.

A third wave of pain crashed over Sun Lingtong, breaking through his threshold.

Unable to withstand any longer, Sun Lingtong desperately activated the Void Seal hidden deep within his soul, channeling all the overwhelming pain into the seal, where it gradually dissipated.

Although the torment remained immense and overwhelming, having an outlet significantly reduced the agony, allowing Sun Lingtong to hold on.

Witnessing him endure silently without even a whimper, the attacking Ghost Generals exchanged embarrassed glances, their faces darkening with displeasure.

Just as a fourth Ghost General was about to step forward, the Silent Ghost General slowly raised his palm.

The Silent Ghost General was the undisputed leader of this mission. Although all present were Golden Core-level, his strength and prestige far surpassed the rest.

With just one gesture, the other Ghost Generals immediately ceased their torture.

Relieved from the torment, Sun Lingtong took in a shuddering breath, nearly collapsing unconscious from the sudden release of intense pressure.

Completely drained and battered, Sun Lingtong lay motionless on the floor.

The Silent Ghost General stared down at him silently.

Nearby, the Flower Life Ghost General, wearing a white paper flower atop his head, spoke for the Silent Ghost General, “Little Foundation Establishment cultivator, my lord wishes to know, how do you feel now?”

“You should realize that despite all we’ve done, not a single sound escaped outside this carriage.”

“This is precisely my lord’s power.”

“With such methods, even if we assaulted White Paper City for half an hour, none might even notice.”

“Do you still believe we’re marching to our deaths?”

Sun Lingtong wished to retort, yet he lacked even the strength to roll his eyes.

Those mere dozen breaths felt like years to him; the torment was intense, the price for his insolence exacted fully.

Yet, he had gambled correctly.

These Golden Core Ghost Generals clearly had the strength to crush him instantly but restrained themselves, unwilling to breach military discipline over a trivial Foundation Establishment cultivator.

The ghostly army soon crossed the boundary between yin and yang, finally reaching the Ghostly Black Marshlands.

Six Golden Core Ghost Generals silently departed.

Weak and weary, Sun Lingtong staggered off the carriage to regroup with the main army, awaiting orders to assault the city walls.

During this period, he repeatedly tried contacting Ning Zhuo, growing anxious from failed attempts.

Fortunately, the order soon came, and the ghost army charged toward the North Gate of White Paper City. With concealment unnecessary during battle maneuvers, Sun Lingtong finally reached Ning Zhuo, quickly relaying all gathered intelligence.

Ning Zhuo, having grown equally anxious at the silence, responded with relief and determination, “Don’t worry, brother. I’ve already requested reinforcements, and everything is prepared.”

Sun Lingtong chuckled bitterly, “Give them a good fight - make sure those six Ghost Generals suffer!”

Understanding his brother’s anger well, Ning Zhuo’s gaze sharpened. He clenched his teeth, replying resolutely, “Understood.”

Meanwhile, in an alley near White Paper City’s southern gate,

The Flower Life Ghost General, whose ears had bloomed into flowers, listened intently. “Battle at the North Gate is fierce. Our forces immediately deployed war chariots upon engagement.”

The Silent Ghost General nodded, raised his hand, and took the lead.

The other five swiftly followed.

Amplifying his natural talent to the maximum, the Silent Ghost General encompassed everyone around him, enabling them to run at full speed, breaking through walls without causing any noise.

They made a beeline toward the paper statue near the southern gate, prepared to destroy the giant paper construct.

Just as they were about to strike, a youthful voice suddenly rang out, “Activate the formation!”

Instantly, twenty-eight luminous musical script arrays surfaced on the ground, revealing twelve gleaming Blue Nether Jade Marrow Nails hidden deep underground.

Four robust bronze pillars emerged, topped by statues of Azure Phoenixes with golden strings clutched in their beaks, each dangling seven exquisite bells. Tiny runes densely covered the bells - astonishingly, each bell bore the entire “Profound Cave Spirit Tone Ghoul-Exterminating Spell” meticulously engraved upon it!

Six Golden Core ghost generals charged straight into the towering paper giant, willingly plunging into the heart of the formation. In the blink of an eye, they found themselves trapped within its mystical space.

As they glanced around anxiously, they saw a crystal-blue sky stretched over a lustrous jade landscape. Four imposing bronze pillars rose from the ground, marking the cardinal directions, around which countless azure birds circled gracefully.

On the horizon stood an enormous, upright humanoid mountain, its peak shrouded in dense clouds that replaced its head.

“Damn it!”

“This is a trap!”

Panic rippled among the ghost generals.

Silent Ghost General raised one hand calmly, prompting Flower Life Ghost General to quickly interpret his gesture: “Leader Silent says to remain calm. Didn’t we anticipate their deployment of formations here after our previous setback?”

The reassurance quickly calmed the generals.

“Leader Silent is right.”

“Every formation has a weakness. What’s there to panic about?”

“Let’s probe first and see exactly what kind of formation this is!”

The ghost generals cautiously tested the formation. Instead of immediately attacking the prominent bronze pillars, they aimed for the mountainous giant directly ahead. Yet, no matter how far they ran, the giant remained distant, unmoving.

One general even tried retreating, hoping to exploit the space, only to find upon turning around that the colossal mountain now loomed behind him!

Realization dawned swiftly. “This formation distorts space! We can’t break through by mere running!”

Several desperate attempts followed, utilizing powerful artifacts and techniques. However, the sky remained impenetrable, and the jade ground unyielding, showing no signs of weakening.

With no alternatives left, they reluctantly directed their attacks against the four bronze pillars.

Fierce battles erupted around the pillars, as azure birds launched themselves ferociously against the attackers. Under enormous pressure to finish quickly, the generals unleashed relentless, heavy blows.

Soon, most of the bronze birds fell, and the pillars trembled under the onslaught.

Flower Life Ghost General shouted excitedly, “I’ve figured it out! These pillars are the formation cores. Destroy them, and the heart of the formation will appear!”

At the heart of the formation, Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged, carefully controlling its operations.

Suddenly, two Golden Core ghost generals appeared behind him - Silent Ghost General leading the ambush.

They struck with full force, instantly reducing Ning Zhuo to countless fragments of paper.

“It’s fake!” Both ghost generals felt their hearts sink.

“They’re illusions!” Hidden in shadows, Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu realized simultaneously. They saw through the enemy’s clever ruse - Silent Ghost General and his companion in the center were merely decoys.

This squad of Golden Core ghost generals exhibited impressive tactical discipline. They had identified the true core - the mountainous giant - and the pillars as mere nodes. Their earlier actions were all deceptive maneuvers.

Yet Ning Zhuo had anticipated this. The “Ning Zhuo” at the formation’s core was merely Wen Ruanyu’s painted decoy.

“Truly impressive, this Silent Talent,” Ning Zhuo praised internally. He understood clearly that another ghost general executed the actual attack, but it was Silent Ghost General’s innate ability that enabled the successful deception.

“Senior Wen, it’s time,” Ning Zhuo prompted softly.

The true master of the formation was Wen Ruanyu. He immediately infused spiritual energy into the formation, activating the jade chime protecting the core.

The jade chime resonated deeply, releasing waves of pale green sonic ripples that swiftly enveloped the entire formation space.

Every ghost general’s energy instantly churned like boiling water, glowing faintly green, forcing them into semi-transparency. Though their spiritual energies remained functional, Silent Ghost General’s heart sank as dread filled him.

To his horror, his innate silent talent had been thoroughly countered. It might function outside, but inside the formation, his stealth was utterly neutralized.

Now, their only choice was brute force.

Wen Ruanyu smiled coldly and activated the formation’s second stage.

The tiny golden bells hanging from the azure birds began ringing incessantly, creating a cascade of sharp, intense notes, reminiscent of a torrential downpour.

Empowered by resonant bell tones, the four bronze pillars emanated radiant bronze light, rapidly repairing themselves.

Caught in the deafening sounds, the ghost generals felt their senses utterly disrupted. They heard the thunder of countless warhorses, saw countless overlapping azure bird illusions, and struggled heavily to command their energy, which now flowed sluggishly like mud.

“This is the Jade Chime True Sound Formation!” They finally grasped the true identity of the array from its dual capabilities.

“Watch your feet!” one general urgently shouted.

But the warning was too late.

Wen Ruanyu triggered the formation’s third stage. Twelve jade marrow nails embedded in the formation’s foundation unleashed the Jade Fault Thunder Technique, striking directly through the ghost generals’ soles.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Several ghost generals were instantly maimed, their legs shattered and bodies collapsing.

“Retreat, retreat now!” a ghost general shrieked in desperation.

But isolated within the formation space, escape was nothing more than an impossible dream.
