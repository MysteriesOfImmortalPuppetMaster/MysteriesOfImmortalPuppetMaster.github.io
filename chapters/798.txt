Chapter 798: New Snow-Colored Maiden-Hui

Ning Zhuo was in the middle of refining an artifact.

As his assistant, Gongsun Yan stood by his side, meticulously performing the smelting process.

Ning Zhuo took out a piece of Purple Night Ice Crystal.

Though it was only the size of a palm, it seemed to condense the magnificence of the night sky and the essence of the stars. It was semi-transparent, with purple starlight flickering within, while its exterior was shrouded in a faint purple misty haze.

Harvested from the depths of a ten-thousand-zhang ice plain, it required thousands of years to absorb the astral brilliance of the heavens just to form a piece the size of a fingernail.

The piece in Ning Zhuo’s hand, however, was the size of a baby’s fist.

This was a Nascent Soul-level precious material!

To ask where it came from would be pointless, since the answer was simply be that Ning Zhuo did not lack money.

The reason for using Purple Night Ice Crystal as the primary material was its extreme cold nature, which contained an inner starlight vitality. This perfectly matched the profound artistic conception of the Ice Grease Jade Hand - where the extreme end of one state transforms into its opposite.

Ning Zhuo then produced a second material: Warm-Cold Jade Essence.

It appeared warm and moist to the eye, but to the touch, it was bone-chillingly cold. Yet, at the very peak of that cold, a sliver of warmth was born. This, too, was chosen to harmonize with the Ice Grease Jade Hand.

He cast both the Purple Night Ice Crystal and the Warm-Cold Jade Essence into the Fire Flood Dragon Furnace.

This precious furnace was one Ning Zhuo had specifically rented from the Artifact Refining Hall. Given his current reputation, renting a Magic Treasure of this level was not difficult.

Inside the Fire Flood Dragon Furnace flickered a Taiyi Pure Spirit Flame, which was most suited for processing top-tier ice-attribute spiritual materials.

It also came from the Artifact Refining Hall. The rental fee for this precious flame was twenty times higher than that of the Fire Flood Dragon Furnace itself!

The Purple Night Ice Crystal was harder than refined steel and possessed an incredibly strong resistance to ordinary heat. However, under the searing heat of the Taiyi Pure Spirit Flame, it rapidly softened.

Ning Zhuo pressed his hands against the walls of the furnace, continuously pouring in spiritual energy. His divine sense acted like threads, probing into the depths of the ice crystal.

Under his guidance, the Taiyi Pure Spirit Flame precisely stripped away the impurities within the Purple Night Ice Crystal, sliver by sliver.

Processing this kind of material could never be done through crude melting. Once the delicate balance between coldness and vitality was broken, it would no longer be compatible with the Ice Grease Jade Hand.

Under the flame's refinement, the ice crystal seemed to stretch out slowly as if in a hot spring. The internal purple haze grew denser, and the purple starlight radiated through its body, becoming increasingly crowded. It looked as if a small section of a galaxy was flowing within the furnace - a breathtaking sight.

Maintaining the heat, Ning Zhuo communicated with Snow-Colored Maiden Hui through his divine sense.

After her brief repairs, Ning Zhuo had informed her that she would be participating in this refining process.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui was extremely proactive.

She was proud. Her previous encounters with the Lightning Mother and the God of the Soil had left her at a disadvantage, which she found quite distressing. Knowing she could become stronger, she was naturally prepared to give her all.

Ning Zhuo was also happy to have her participate.

First, it was training for her. Improving her artifact-refining abilities was highly beneficial.

Second, it helped her master her new body. Although the mechanical structure remained unchanged, the materials were receiving a massive upgrade. By participating personally, she would gain the most direct and profound understanding of those materials.

Third, many parts of this refinement required extreme precision. This was taxing on Ning Zhuo’s mind, but it was exactly where Snow-Colored Maiden Hui excelled. Ning Zhuo had tested her beforehand and confirmed she could handle it.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui began her work.

Each of her six hands held several jade needles as thin as ox hair.

When Ning Zhuo opened the furnace and withdrew the Purple Night Ice Crystal, she immediately went to work, piercing the needles into the softened crystal.

This was delicate work, requiring immense patience and stability.

With her fingertips trembling slightly, the jade needles moved nimbly through the ice crystal, leaving behind tiny but precise conduits. The inner and outer walls of these conduits quickly attracted the starlight within the crystal, which began to adhere to them.

After observing for a few breaths, Ning Zhuo confirmed that Snow-Colored Maiden Hui was fully capable of the task. He then turned his attention to shaping the Warm-Cold Jade Essence.

His fingers flew as he cast one incantation after another.

The jade essence writhed and stretched accordingly, gradually forming an internal skeletal frame that was tougher and more capable of bearing power. This new skeleton not only retained its original graceful curves but also featured a large number of pre-set interfaces at key nodes.

He finished with a few minor refining spells to solidify the jade essence skeleton.

Ning Zhuo felt quite satisfied.

"My level in artifact refining and mechanical arts has soared; my understanding of these refining spells is much deeper now."

"Most of these involve the Five Elements. By using the Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art, I can cast spells with exquisite detail."

"My strength in artifact refining is already a hundred times greater than it was before the Profound Armor Cave!"

He continued.

Ning Zhuo took out new precious materials.

A clump of silk moved like a living thing, shimmering with seven-colored glazed light. This was silk spun by the Seven-Rainbow Ice Silkworm; it possessed peerless toughness and could naturally gather water-element and ice-element spiritual energy.

Next was an object resembling a withered branch, upon which tiny crystals like ice tears had formed, emitting an aura that calmed the mind. This was the Immaculate Frost-Condensing Branch, which possessed the dual properties of purification and protection.

Using his divine sense as a guide, Ning Zhuo led the silk, weaving it into a net that covered the skeleton.

After several rounds of refining spells, the ice silk net became dense and thick, completely enveloping the skeleton from top to bottom without a single gap.

Had this been before the Profound Armor Cave, Ning Zhuo would have likely exhausted his mind and time to complete this. Now, he did it with ease, his divine sense divided to weave and cover multiple areas simultaneously without any stagnation.

"Next is the Three-Colored Enamel Armor."

Ning Zhuo cast the Immaculate Frost-Condensing Branch into the Fire Flood Dragon Furnace.

Under the refinement of the Taiyi Pure Spirit Flame, the branch melted, precipitating "ice tear" essences that merged with a pre-prepared three-colored spiritual liquid.

A short while later, Ning Zhuo withdrew the liquid. Guided by his divine sense and assisted by his spiritual energy, he led the cold liquid to evenly coat the ice silk net.

-----
Half an hour later.

The surface of the new body had already "grown" an armor base.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui had finished her previous task, so Ning Zhuo had her act as his assistant.

Ning Zhuo took up his carving tools and began to engrave the armor base.

The tip of the blade flickered with light as he etched one talisman after another onto the surface.

His ice-carving skills were also improving by leaps and bounds.

The carving knife was as steady as a rock in his hand. The talismans he etched onto the crystalline base looked like natural patterns formed by the ice itself.

The more he carved, the faster Ning Zhuo became. His movements grew increasingly fluid and precise. The depth and curvature of every line were nearing perfection.

The rise in his refining level continued to benefit him throughout this practical application.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui followed closely behind him, also wielding a carving knife to assist with the peripheral parts of the talismans. Although her cultivation level was low, she utilized the advantages of a mechanical puppet to the fullest - once she learned a pattern, she could produce it in bulk. While the quality wasn't "perfect," it was far from low.

Once all the talismans were finished, Ning Zhuo engraved a series of formation lines.

The lines formed a Grand Formation, which finally activated.

In an instant, the entire armor base lit up. Three-colored radiance flowed through the patterns like liquid silver before turning inward and solidifying into a suit of Enamel Armor.

The brand-new Enamel Armor was deeper and possessed more internal brilliance than the old version Snow-Colored Maiden Hui had worn.

At this point, the main structure of the new body was essentially complete.

"In the future, if the Enamel Armor is broken, simply activating the formation will allow a new one to grow quickly."

"If Snow-Colored Maiden Hui uses her Ice Grease Jade Hand talent, the production of new armor will be even faster."

This design philosophy was a continuation of Snow Pivot Guard Xie - timely repairs on the battlefield provide massive support for a puppet’s endurance in prolonged combat.

After his battle with Zhu Guizhi, Ning Zhuo had discovered that repairing Snow Pivot Guard Xie in actual combat was extremely taxing on his mind. The spiritual energy cost was secondary; the primary issue was the complex structure of the Demonic Ice Tendons.

During the refining process, it wasn't an issue. But in the heat of battle with a harsh environment, Ning Zhuo would likely be controlling other puppets. Spending his mental energy on such precise repairs was too luxurious.

Therefore, for the repair of Hui’s ice body, he adopted a different design.

Ning Zhuo used formations and talismans as a foundation to shape the Enamel Armor. In the future, on the battlefield, he would only need to trigger the formation and talismans again to manifest a second set of armor.

Both repair methods had their pros and cons.

While the plan for Snow-Colored Maiden Hui was convenient and fast, if the formations or talismans were damaged, the speed of armor creation would slow down, and the resulting armor might be flawed.

There was no such thing as a perfect design.

Ning Zhuo intentionally used both methods to gain more experience across different aspects of combat, thereby accumulating his own expertise.

So, despite the mental drain of shaping Demonic Ice Tendons in battle, he kept that design for Xie. What if his repair skills in that area improved rapidly through combat? What if he triggered some related inspiration during the repair process?

The jade essence skeleton, the ice silk net, the talismans and formations, and the enamel armor were all ready. Finally, the six mechanical ice arms - crafted primarily from Purple Night Ice Crystal - were joined one by one, fitting together seamlessly.

The Five Elements Golden Core Wheel was already inside the body.

Gongsun Yan’s eyes shone. "Young Master, we’ve succeeded again. This is practically a work of art!"

He had also contributed his own strength to this massive material upgrade. His Heart Fire had played a huge role, reaching levels that neither Ning Zhuo nor Snow-Colored Maiden Hui could match in certain areas.

This was already their second round of refining cooperation.

Gongsun Yan had gained a deeper understanding of Ning Zhuo. "Young Master, your talent is truly exceptional. Are you sure you won't consider majoring in artifact refining? You are even better at this than I am; you would surely achieve greatness in the future."

Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly. After sending Gongsun Yan away, he faced Snow-Colored Maiden Hui alone.

Divine Ability - Life Hanging by a Thread! 

Using his divine ability, Ning Zhuo gave a gentle tug, extracting the spirituality of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and transferring it into the new body.

The spirituality, like a sphere, went straight into the central hub in the chest.

"Buzz - " A clear, melodious chime, like ice crystals clashing, echoed through the room.

The brand-new Snow-Colored Maiden Hui hovered in the air, slowly opening her eyes.

As her spiritual energy began to circulate, her six arms unfurled gracefully.

The talismans and formations activated, and the ice silk grew and spread, forming a waterfall of black hair behind her head.

Her appearance was no different than before - still a graceful figure of six feet three inches, clad in three-colored Enamel Armor and wearing a snow-porcelain face mask.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui moved her legs and arms, whispering, "I... have become stronger."

Her sensation was deeper than anyone else's; the new body contained an unprecedented, surging power!

The six mechanical arms shaped from Purple Night Ice Crystal were the most expensive and exquisite parts of the new body, and they were the most compatible with her Ice Grease Jade Hand talent.

The Nascent Soul-level primary material allowed the Ice Grease Jade Hand talent to explode with nearly ten times its previous power!

The bones and tendons constructed from Warm-Cold Jade Essence connected everything. The six arms, in particular, shared the same artistic conception, allowing every movement of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui to combine hardness with softness.

The Seven-Rainbow Ice Silk lining increased the flow speed of spiritual energy eightfold and provided a degree of defensive power.

The use of the Immaculate Frost-Condensing Branch added depth to the Three-Colored Enamel Armor. Because of the upgraded materials, the scale of the formations and talismans was ten times larger than before; thus, the defensive performance of the resulting armor had soared, incomparable to its previous state.

"The current Snow-Colored Maiden Hui has immediately leaped to a Golden Core-level combatant, much like Snow Pivot Guard Xie."

"If we were back in that fight against Zhu Guizhi, she and Xie together would definitely have been able to firmly suppress those two gods."

"Come, activate your talent and let me see," he thought. With a flicker of his mind, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui’s three pairs of jade arms suddenly unfurled in a graceful posture, carrying an invisible sense of pressure.

As she used her talent, a shimmering white light flowed at the tips of her six jade fingers. Within that white light, there was a faint, vibrant hint of green.

A refreshing chill wafted through the air. Within this cold, there was not a hint of death; it was like the melting snow of early spring, containing the omen of all things returning to life.

Ning Zhuo’s heart was filled with joy and delight.

To be able to turn his concepts into reality, to combine different precious materials into ingenious combinations and achieve such excellent results...

This sense of accomplishment was something Ning Zhuo found truly intoxicating.

"This is the Way of Mechanical Arts!"

"Simply upgrading the materials has caused Snow-Colored Maiden Hui’s strength to skyrocket several times over!"

"It’s just too convenient."

"Now... the next step is to carefully select ice-attribute spells."

The materials had been significantly upgraded, but space was still limited. Because Ning Zhuo had chosen the formation/talisman path to repair the Enamel Armor, it meant there was very little room left for ice-attribute spells.

This was a sharp contrast to Snow Pivot Guard Xie. On Xie’s mechanical body, a vast number of talismans and formations were dedicated to triggering frost spells.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui was different. Ning Zhuo had positioned her for melee combat and healing.

The Ice Grease Jade Hand talent possessed powerful healing capabilities, while her fine control allowed her to execute many exquisite martial arts.

The core of a puppet's positioning was the talent contained within its spirituality!

Therefore, while the spells Snow-Colored Maiden Hui could use were few, they needed to be selected with great care.

"Sigh, if only the spirituality itself could cast spells."

This was entirely possible.

Ning Zhuo had read The Theory of Spiritual Beings. He knew that spirituality was divided into four major stages: the Dead Spirit stage, the Living Spirit stage, the Wise Spirit stage, and the Divine Spirit stage.

By the mid-to-late stages of the Wise Spirit stage, once the spirituality had grown enough, it would be able to learn spells and cast them on its own.

But for now, the spirituality of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Snow Pivot Guard Xie had not yet grown to that level.

Mechanical arts were a collection of a hundred crafts; thus, while the threshold was extremely high, the room for growth was also immense. The improvement of any single craft could drive the advancement of the mechanical arts as a whole.

His two rounds of material upgrades were proof of that.
