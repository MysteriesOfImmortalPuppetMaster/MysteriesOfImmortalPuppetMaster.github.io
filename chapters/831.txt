Chapter 831: Too Outstanding

Bluestone Cave Dwelling.

Ning Zhuo sat alone in the cultivation chamber, his eyes slightly closed, legs crossed.

The processes of the trials - the Nine Twists Corridor Formation, the Earth Fire Bountiful Field Formation, the Ten Thousand Li Icebound Formation, and the Map of Mountains and Rivers - flashed rapidly through the depths of his mind.

"The Nine Twists Corridor Formation was the most complex and had the highest difficulty. It required identifying and dismantling layer by layer. My Master-level attainment in the Dao of Formations was the biggest contributor to my success."

"In the trial of the Earth Fire Bountiful Field Formation, I laid out four layers of formations to solve the problem. My attainment in the Fire Element provided crucial assistance."

"For the Ten Thousand Li Icebound Formation, my Ice Dao attainment dragged me down, but I still managed to reach the level of third place."

"The Map of Mountains and Rivers falls under the domain of Realm Formations. Although I passed with good results, it was actually because the assessment standards for this trial were too low. I am still very, very far from truly understanding this Realm Formation."

The process of dismantling the Nine Twists Corridor Formation had given Ning Zhuo his first taste of practical experience in personally breaking a formation. It was far more vivid than the memories of the Demonic Soul, leaving a deeper impression on him.

The layers of the Nine Twists Corridor Formation were distinct. The accumulated experience allowed Ning Zhuo to choose a multi-layered formation approach during the Earth Fire Bountiful Field Formation trial, succeeding in one stroke.

By the time he reached the Ten Thousand Li Icebound Formation, Ning Zhuo’s ability to locate the formation core had been greatly exercised.

And within the Map of Mountains and Rivers, his ability to search for formation eyes was further tempered.

In the Rising Clouds Minor Trials, there were many formation trials. Ning Zhuo did not participate at random; he had selected them carefully beforehand.

After several rounds of trials, Ning Zhuo not only achieved excellent results but also engaged in genuine practice. He accumulated experience unique to himself, increased his confidence in formations, and learned to more fully utilize his attainments in the Dao of Formations.

"But it’s not enough."

The Water Formation of the Luo Shu was flexible and ever-changing. More importantly, Ning Zhuo had to succeed on his first attempt. Otherwise, if the Water Formation wasn't broken and caused a huge commotion like an explosion, it would inevitably attract attention.

Strictly speaking, Ning Zhuo spying into the Shuyu Zhai beforehand was a violation of sect rules. Of course, if the matter really came to light, he had his identity as Meng Yaoyin’s son to defend himself.

But ultimately, it would be a huge trouble.

Even if Ning Zhuo wasn't punished by sect rules, a Daoist Artifact like the Luo Shu would likely be coveted by others and confiscated.

If such a thing really happened, while Ning Zhuo wouldn't be completely helpless, he would certainly have to pay a greater price.

Therefore, the best outcome for Ning Zhuo was to succeed in one go, silently breaking the Water Formation and retrieving the Luo Shu page.

"I need more practical combat drills."

Ning Zhuo did not stop his pace of sweeping through the formations.

-----

The next day.

Deep Abyss Pond.

The thousand-year-old ancient pond was bottomless. The water was still as a mirror, reflecting the skylight and clouds. A simple thatched cottage stood by the pond, and in front of it sat a gray-robed elder. It was the Nascent Soul cultivator, Zheng Yue.

Ning Zhuo walked slowly to stand before Zheng Yue and bowed: "Junior Ning Zhuo pays respects to Lord Zheng Yue."

Zheng Yue’s expression was calm. He looked Ning Zhuo up and down before saying, "Go ahead."

He had issued this trial, but he was strictly selective about the participants. Often, days would pass without a single person truly qualifying to take the trial.

As a top-tier genius of the current generation, showing even a trace of the aura of a Heaven's Chosen, Ning Zhuo naturally was not among the ordinary.

Receiving Zheng Yue’s permission, Ning Zhuo strolled to the edge of the pond and began his comprehension.

Ning Zhuo planted his feet by the pond, spread out his divine sense, regulated his breathing, and calmed his state of mind.

Zheng Yue had returned inside the thatched cottage, nowhere to be seen.

By the Deep Abyss Pond, only the big-headed youth in white clothes remained, quietly gazing at the water.

Sunlight spilled from overhead, casting a halo around him. His breathing became slower and lighter, until finally, it was almost imperceptible.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Ning Zhuo finally took action.

Thoughts constantly emerged in his divine sea, interweaving to form the embryonic form of a formation.

He used his own state of mind as the formation core.

Controlling movement with stillness; responding to ten thousand changes with constancy.

The formation began to slowly take shape.

During this process, invisible formation patterns rippled out from around him like water waves, merging into the surrounding heaven and earth spiritual qi.

One breath, ten breaths, one hundred breaths...

Ning Zhuo remained motionless; not even his eyelashes trembled. His breathing had stopped, and his heartbeat had slowed to the point of being nearly undetectable. His mind was completely submerged in the water mirror, becoming one with the pond water, one with heaven and earth.

Time seemed to stand still.

After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes.

His eyes were like an ancient well without ripples, utterly serene.

The Still Mountain Deep Abyss Formation - complete.

"Not bad." Zheng Yue walked out of the thatched cottage and offered a lukewarm comment.

Subsequently, he took out a jade slip from his bosom and handed it to him: "This is the Essentials of Still Mountain. It contains all my insights regarding the Still Mountain Deep Abyss Formation. You have passed."

Ning Zhuo accepted it and bowed with cupped fists: "Many thanks, Senior."

Zheng Yue nodded slightly and waved his hand, his voice dropping lower: "Go on."

Ning Zhuo bowed once more, turned, and left.

The Essentials of Still Mountain was the reward for passing the trial. Zheng Yue had set up this trial not only to carry forward his unique skills but also to select a suitable successor.

But although Ning Zhuo performed excellently, he had not raised such an idea from beginning to end.

"This child is in the limelight, constantly entangled in affairs. Even if he can achieve inner stillness, his external environment will be full of changing winds and clouds, turbulent and ceaseless. No matter how outstanding his talent and aptitude, he does not fit my cultivation path." Zheng Yue sighed in his heart.

He had only truly met Ning Zhuo for the first time, but he had long since glimpsed Ning Zhuo's predicament.

Ning Zhuo was not the excellent successor he had in mind.

-----

Two days later.

The peak.

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, took a step forward at the edge of the cliff, and stepped into the void.

But in the next moment, raging gales swept him into the air.

More accurately, he was swept into the Wind and Thunder Formation!

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

The wind howled, surging from all directions, tearing at his robes and stinging his skin.

Overhead, thunderclouds churned incessantly. Bolts of lightning struck down, exploding around him and making his scalp numb.

Ning Zhuo stabilized his figure and spread his spiritual sense with full force.

However, as soon as his spiritual sense extended outside his body, it was shredded by the gales and scorched by the lightning, consumed rapidly.

Ning Zhuo immediately changed tactics, once again scattering a large number of mechanical mirrors.

The mirrors were similarly ravaged by the wind and thunder, constantly being damaged.

Ning Zhuo’s divine sense refracted continuously between the treasure mirrors, rapidly expanding his detection range.

Ning Zhuo’s fingers fluttered like layers of butterfly shadows.

His profound attainments in mechanical arts allowed him to control countless treasure mirrors, weaving through the gales and roaming amidst the lightning.

Ning Zhuo did not resist head-on.

When the wind was strong, he retreated; when the wind was weak, he advanced. When lightning came, he evaded; when lightning left, he probed.

His Master-level formation attainment gave him a powerful intuition.

Previously, Ning Zhuo wouldn't have been able to clearly grasp this formation intuition in such a crisis-ridden, intense environment. But having undergone the previous formation trials, his practical combat ability had been tempered!

Relying on intuition, he kept moving constantly, preventing himself and the majority of the treasure mirrors from being struck by the thunderbolts.

The Wind and Thunder Formation was a dynamic formation. The formation eye moved with the wind and clouds, seemingly untraceable. But Ning Zhuo had already detected a pattern: It was like breathing - wind rises and falls, thunder is born and dies, a cycle every thirty breaths.

Having captured this crucial cycle, Ning Zhuo was only a few steps away from finding the formation eye.

Just as the third cycle began, a brilliant light exploded in Ning Zhuo’s eyes!

He caught it.

In the place where the wind and thunder were most violent, there was a minute anomaly. The wind there was more chaotic than elsewhere, and the lightning there was denser than elsewhere. But behind the chaos was method, and behind the density was a pattern.

The formation eye was hiding right there!

Formation-Gap Traversing Shuttle!

The shuttle body trembled, shooting out a beam of azure-white light toward that direction. The light penetrated the gale, penetrated the lightning, and landed on a flickering point of light.

Now!

Ning Zhuo took out the Soul-Severing Axe and slashed.

The axe light tore through the air, hitting that point of light squarely.

Boom- 

The wind and thunder stopped abruptly.

Even though Ning Zhuo’s attainments in the Wind and Thunder elements were superficial, he had forcefully passed the Wind and Thunder Formation trial relying on his robust strength in the Dao of Formations.

-----

Five Elements Peak - Rotation Hall!

Cultivators participating in the trial needed to enter the Rotation Hall and comprehend the "Five Elements Rotation Grand Formation" within for two hours (one shichen). Afterward, they had to answer questions in the examination area beside the hall. Answering ten questions correctly would pass the trial.

After the time it takes for half a cup of tea, Ning Zhuo walked out of the Five Elements Rotation Grand Formation.

"Hmm?" The cultivators on duty paid great attention to the big-headed youth.

Immediately, someone went up to greet him: "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, has something urgent happened? I can make the decision to let you continue next time. However, regarding the time used, we must deduct the time you spent today."

Ning Zhuo smiled and waved his hand: "Many thanks, Fellow Daoist, but I just feel that it’s about enough. There's no need to linger; I might as well go directly to the side hall to answer the questions."

The cultivators on duty looked at each other in shock.

Someone asked, "Are you sure?"

Ning Zhuo nodded.

Entering the side hall, he saw over a hundred jade steles. Each jade stele was engraved with a question. Cultivators needed to probe the jade stele with their divine sense to write down the answer.

Ning Zhuo walked to the first jade stele and probed with his divine sense.

He took only a glance, and the answer emerged in his heart.

He wrote the answer. Time taken: three breaths.

The second question, the third question, the fourth question...

For every question, he finished answering within ten breaths.

After completing ten questions, he turned around, preparing to leave the venue.

Among the cultivators on duty, someone kindly reminded him again, telling Ning Zhuo that the question bank was vast. To avoid errors, he might as well answer a few more. The standard for passing was answering ten questions correctly.

Ning Zhuo slowly shook his head, smiling again, full of confidence: "I will absolutely not make a mistake. If I am judged wrong, it must be your fault."

At this moment, the cultivators on duty facing him couldn't help but narrow their eyes.

Ning Zhuo was so confident; it was like looking directly at the sunlight - blinding.

The cultivators hurriedly reviewed the questions, wanting to quickly determine the results.

However, very quickly, the reviewing cultivators frowned one by one. Some calculated rapidly on their fingers, while others sweated anxiously on their foreheads.

This was all because Ning Zhuo, on a whim, had given some unusual answers to a few of the questions.

Ning Zhuo laughed aloud: "How about I explain them?"

A small-scale lecture not only proved his correctness but also won over all the duty cultivators present.

Moments later.

The main gates of the Rotation Hall opened wide, and a large number of duty cultivators respectfully escorted Ning Zhuo out.

-----

The Five Layer Door Formation.

The Ten Thousand Swords Return to Origin Formation.

The Illusion Sea Formation.

The Tiangang Big Dipper Formation.

The Heaven and Earth Shift Formation...

Ning Zhuo rested almost not at all, taking on one trial a day, sweeping through them all and passing every single one.

Such an exaggerated performance made him stand out once again, causing endless discussion among the masses, who marveled that Ning Zhuo possessed such attainments in the Dao of Formations as well.

It even caused the high-level officials of Heavy Formation Peak to hold a small discussion specifically revolving around Ning Zhuo.

-----

Heavy Formation Peak.

Five high-level cultivators gathered around a massive bluestone round table; their discussion of affairs had reached its end.

Sitting at the head was Yin Changgang.

His pale and chubby face wore its customary smile, his eyes narrowed into two slits. He was one of the Vice Peak Masters of Heavy Formation Peak.

"I believe you have all noticed a newcomer recently." Yin Changgang spoke with a smile. "To be precise, we've heard of him before, but definitely not with the level of attention we have now. Let's hear everyone's views regarding that kid named Ning Zhuo."

Shan Guhong sat straight as a pine. In his early forties, his face was cold and severe, like it was carved with a knife. He wore black warrior attire with tight sleeves.

He spoke coldly: "This child breaks formations like splitting bamboo; his attainment in the Dao of Formations is profound. When I was young, I did not have his ability."

Wenren Yan leaned back in her chair. She wore a light gauze dress embroidered with layers of cloud patterns, shimmering under the lamplight. Her pupils were a pale purple, and she always looked at people with a somewhat dreamy, hazy gaze.

She suddenly spoke, her voice languid like a whisper in a dream: "It's not just attainments in the Dao of Formations. inside the Illusion Sea Formation, he used less than two hours (one shichen)."

Her purple eyes narrowed slightly: "My Illusion Sea Formation is most adept at confusing the mind. Nine out of ten who enter get lost in the illusions, and the remaining one would take three or four hours to find the way out. He only used two hours - this indicates his state of mind is extraordinarily stable."

"Worthy of a figure who can borrow the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] to emit such a scale of Noble Spirit!"

Ouyang Lin, dressed entirely in white, had delicate features, but his brows carried a chill: "In the Ten Thousand Li Icebound Formation, he only took third place."

Everyone looked at him.

Ouyang Lin remained expressionless: "His Ice Element attainment is too low; it dragged him back. If his Ice Element were slightly higher, first place would surely be his."

Chunyu Gui was burly, with a back like a tiger and waist like a bear. His full beard was trimmed neatly. He sighed deeply: "The most exaggerated instance was at the Rotation Hall of Five Elements Peak. It is said that after the Hall Master returned and learned of the scene of Ning Zhuo's trial, he immediately tried to recruit Ning Zhuo, not hesitating to offer the position of Vice Hall Master."

"Tell me, how old is he?"

"How can such a junior be so outstanding?"

Shan Guhong: "Dao of Formations, Five Elements, Mechanical Arts, Confucianism, Sound Techniques, Martial Combat... it is indeed excessively abnormal."

Under normal circumstances, first-rate geniuses were the likes of Shen Xi, Situ Xing, and Gu Qing. They were already considered national-level talents.

It wouldn't be strange if Ning Zhuo was slightly better than them.

But now, Ning Zhuo had successively defeated Ban Ji, Gu Qing, Shen Xi, and others - and not through combat, but in the form of various minor trials.

This was outstanding in a way that defied convention.

Wenren Yan speculated: "He claims to major in Mechanical Arts, but this may not be true. Based on his performance, his main cultivation direction is more likely Formations."

Cultivators registering their information sometimes released smoke screens to create disguises and cover-ups.

Of course, in later stages, information scrutiny became strict, and cultivators often clarified proactively.

Wenren Yan’s suspicion wasn't unreasonable, and Yin Changgang agreed considerably: "Indeed. Reviewing all of Ning Zhuo's performances since coming to the main sect gate, his victories over Ban Ji and Gu Qing were relatively difficult. But in the contest with Shen Xi, his advantage was obvious; it was a lead that left others in the dust."

"But what truly concerns me is his nature."

Yin Changgang’s eyes flashed with a sharp light: "Is this the mental nature of a young man? He is stable to a terrifying degree. It makes me think of other possibilities."

Shan Guhong: "Soul possession, or even the reincarnation of a mighty figure?"

Yin Changgang nodded, his expression grave.
