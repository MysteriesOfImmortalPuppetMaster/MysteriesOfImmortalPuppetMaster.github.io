Chapter 649: Earth Fiend Collapsing Rock

The heart and final destination of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long plan—the sacrificial altar for the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual—now stood before Ning Zhuo.

He had already met all three conditions required to ascend the altar.

However, the Branch of the Forgetful River encircling the altar remained the final obstacle.

"One step away," Ning Zhuo thought. "If I can breach this last barrier, my grand plan will be complete!"

The presence of a Forgetful River branch here initially startled Ning Zhuo, but he quickly accepted it.

After all, the Forgetful River Prefecture was named after the Forgetful River. It was only natural for them to have various methods of utilizing its waters.

Moreover, the capital city of the Forgetful River Prefecture, Immortal City, was built upon the Forgetful River itself.

"But how am I to cross this river?"

"Mother and the leader took another route, aiming straight for Immortal City. They'll face the true Forgetful River, not this branch before me."

"Mother must have a way to cross the river. Why hasn't she told me?"

"Furthermore, where is Lord Wangchuan's true form?"

This was Ning Zhuo's first time entering this core battlefield. He knew nothing of the previous clashes between Lord Wangchuan and the other major powers.

"This Earth Aspect Incarnation must belong to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord."

"His True Form hasn't appeared yet. He might be severely injured, or he could be trapped within the Sacrificial Altar, held back by its final mechanism."

At that moment, the blood-red glow above the altar began to gradually fade.

Ning Zhuo speculated inwardly: Could the complete disappearance of this blood light signify the end of the Sacrificial Rite?

"But the crucial question remains—how can I breach this Branch of the Forgetful River?"

Ning Zhuo immediately recalled the prophetic poem:

"Ghost tides surge, White Paper in peril,
A lone goose carries a candle, piercing heaven’s veil.
The guest star appears in the north of the literary pivot,
Myriad Manifestations Lamp ignites, shattering calamity."

"This poem offers no clues to help me cross the Forgetful River!"

"What should I do?"

Ning Zhuo fell into a daze, his thoughts drifting aimlessly.

"I am the Yang Realm's destined hero, the White Paper Immortal City's savior, and the Human Tribulation of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord! There must be a way to pass; this can't be a dead end!"

"Perhaps the answer to crossing the river lies within my grasp?"

Having just used the Return to Silence Path Candle from his Storage Belt to overcome the Turbid Qi Barrier, Ning Zhuo began scanning his belongings again with his divine sense.

Soon, his divine sense settled on the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.

"Can this boat carry me across the river?" Ning Zhuo instinctively stroked his Mechanism Ring, but it remained as silent as the grave.

His thoughts shifted. "What if I don't use any devices and simply swim across the Branch of Time?"

Even with this new idea, the Mechanism Ring remained deathly still.

A flicker of worry deep in Ning Zhuo's eyes made him stop stroking the ring. His gaze and thoughts both wandered, various notions rising and falling in his divine sea.

His gaze swept past the Ice Coffin floating in mid-air, and a thought arose: "This Ice Coffin bears some resemblance to the Return to Silence Path Candle."

"It seals a Scissors Magic Treasure. Before I arrived, the Earth Aspect Incarnation was still attacking the Ice Coffin."

"Clearly, this Ice Coffin must be a relic left behind by some powerful being. During the conflict, it sealed away one of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's trump cards!"

"This Scissors Magic Treasure must be very important to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. Otherwise, his opponent wouldn't have treated it with such caution, and the Earth Aspect Incarnation wouldn't be relentlessly eroding the Ice Coffin to retrieve it."

Ning Zhuo was unaware that the ice coffin was also a transformed candle, specifically the Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle belonging to the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord.

The young man's gaze fixed on the ice coffin, and he suddenly shivered slightly.

"The Return to Silence Path Candle has an ice coffin shape, and this one does too."

"Could these similar appearances be a sign of Heaven's Will, a deliberate clue meant for me?"

Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes, extending his divine sense to scrutinize the object. His thoughts naturally turned to the next level: "This ice coffin radiates a frigid aura, being both yin and ice elemental. Could it freeze a branch of the Forgetful River?"

"Verifying this is actually quite simple."

Ning Zhuo reached into his Storage Belt.

With a flick of his wrist, he unleashed a swarm of Mechanical Golden Swallows.

The golden swallows soared in formation, swiftly ascending toward the ice coffin suspended high above.

Just as Ning Zhuo was pondering how to maneuver the ice coffin closer to the Forgetful River branch, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God struck.

Whoosh!

A whip-like torrent of turbid qi, like a python's strike, viciously lashed out, annihilating nearly the entire swarm. Only two or three swallows managed to reach the ice coffin.

Witnessing this, Ning Zhuo was both surprised and delighted.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's reaction inadvertently confirmed his earlier conjecture.

Of course, this could also be a deliberate trap set by the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, or perhaps he's overly preoccupied with the Scissors Magic Treasure.

Regardless, Ning Zhuo had at least discovered a potential weak point.

He immediately produced more mechanical constructs, manipulating them to scatter like stars across the sky as they sporadically charged toward the airborne Ice Coffin.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's attention was once again diverted.

In no time, the Bronze War Chariot was riddled with wounds.

Though Luo Si was doing his utmost to protect it, the overwhelming pressure from the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God often left him no time to tend to the chariot.

Massive cracks spiderwebbed across its surface, a horrifying sight.

"Hold on, old friend!" Luo Si cried out to the chariot, his voice thick with emotion. Though he knew it would be destroyed in this battle, a surge of unwavering resolve burned within him alongside his sorrow.

If the chariot fell, it would be even harder for him to contain the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God alone.

Their only hope now was for Ning Zhuo to find a way to breach the enemy's defenses.

"Hmm?" Luo Si, standing atop the Bronze War Chariot, watched as the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God struck again, but this time not at him, but at the Mechanical Golden Swallows.

"That Ice Coffin is the key!" A realization struck Luo Si's heart, sudden and undeniable.

His gaze immediately turned to Ning Zhuo, and he inwardly marveled, "As expected of my wise lord—he's already identified the key to breaking this deadlock!"

Seizing the opportunity, Luo Si quickly cast a healing spell on himself.

Having single-handedly held off the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, he'd had no chance to rest. Now that he had the chance, he made every second count!

"Damn brat!" the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God roared, furious.

Ning Zhuo, positioned behind Luo Si, continuously launched Mechanical Golden Swallows.

For the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, the cost of these swallows was negligible. Ning Zhuo's Foundation Establishment cultivation was to him like an ant underfoot.

Yet this very ant, using these cheap Mechanical Golden Swallows, was now restraining his Earth Fiend Turbid Corruption Avatar!

No wonder the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God was so enraged.

Luo Si felt a great sense of relief!

Not only had he fully healed himself, but he also had the leisure to stabilize the Bronze War Chariot's condition.

Otherwise, given its precarious state, it could have collapsed completely at any moment, and Luo Si wouldn't have been surprised.

Earth Element - Earth Fiend Collapsing Rock.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God extended his arms, palms facing upward.

Spiritual energy erupted around him, releasing wave after wave of power.

These waves rapidly expanded, scattering against the Turbid Qi Barrier that enveloped the Altar Battlefield.

The Earth Lung Turbid Qi churned like boiling water, violently roiling and rapidly coalescing into massive boulders.

The boulders rained down, each imbued with Earthly Fiend energy, hurtling toward the Altar Battlefield with terrifying force!

The flying stones, swirling with fiendish energy, unleashed a ferocious onslaught. They varied in size, some as colossal as dragons or mammoths, others at least as large as Luo Si's Bronze War Chariot.

The deluge of boulders pummeled the Golden Swallow Automaton Swarm, causing catastrophic damage.

Luo Si frantically maneuvered his Bronze War Chariot, dodging the hail of stones with desperate skill.

"If one of these hits me squarely," Ning Zhuo thought, cold sweat beading on his forehead, "I'm a dead man!" In desperation, he hurled his Automaton Token.

Sky Iron Heroic Armor!

The token twisted and morphed into a Mechanical Battle Armor.

Golden Swallow Tailoring Clouds! Han Armor Covers the Body!

The Sky Iron Heroic Armor disassembled, and the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel spun out, adhering to Ning Zhuo's chest. The spine piece attached to his back.

Twelve Divided Spirit Mirrors simultaneously emitted silver beams. Guided by the silver light, the arm and leg armor precisely locked into place.

The storage belt, resembling a jade serpent coiled twice around Ning Zhuo's waist, emitted a spiritual glow that formed a protective membrane, enveloping his entire body.

Clack, clack, clack.

The helmet, breastplate, vambraces, greaves, and the mechanical golden wings on his back snapped into place, adjusting to fit his form perfectly.

Assisted by the mechanical battle armor, Ning Zhuo shot forward like lightning, dodging a collapsing rock barrage and formally initiating the mobile phase of the battle.

Witnessing this, Luo Si decisively ordered, "Qing Jiao Army, retreat immediately beyond the Turbid Qi Barrier!"

Qing Chi gritted her teeth, hesitating. She watched Ning Zhuo charge into the falling debris, consumed by worry and longing to fight by her lover's side.

Qing Yan gripped her shoulder and pulled her back. "You're no good at flying. You'd only be a burden there. Retreat now."

"I won't!" Qing Chi protested stubbornly. "Even if I die, I'll die with Little Ma!"

Qing Yan sighed. "You foolish girl! We're going to win this! Heaven's Will is with us!"

"Luo Si's orders are correct!"

"We need to preserve our forces to support them. That's our most crucial role. Our contribution is vital!"

Knowing her father was right, Qing Chi allowed herself to be led away.

Just as she was about to be completely pulled out of the Curved Path, Qing Chi struggled to speak: "I'll stay in the passage and watch Little Ma fight. If necessary, I'll join the battle!"

Qing Yan hesitated, then finally gritted his teeth. "You stubborn girl, remember this well—you are the commander of our army. Staying alive and maintaining control of the Qing-Jiao Army, providing military might to support them, will be far more helpful!"

"Dad, take this!" Qing Chi pulled something from her robes and tossed it to Qing Yan.

Qing Yan caught it and saw it was the Military Artifact Sacrificial Barracks.

Qing Yan, along with Jiao Ma's biological father, led the Qing-Jiao Army back to their previous position on the Black Cloud Battlefield.

Qing Yan activated the Ceremonial Barracks, providing a place for the Qing-Jiao Army to encamp and rest.

With the protection of the barracks, the soldiers of the Qing-Jiao Army felt considerably better.

Jiao Ma's biological father then led a group out of the barracks, dispersing to scour the battlefield.

Previously, they hadn't had the time, but now they needed to thoroughly loot the battlefield, gathering spoils to replenish the Military Seed and convert into military logistics.

The Qing-Jiao Army's logistics were already critically low.

With abundant military logistics, their options expanded significantly. They could employ military strategies like "Money-Communicating Ghost" and "Life-Buying Coin," or use the supplies as sacrificial offerings on an altar to attract the assistance of ghosts and deities.

Ning Zhuo also noticed the Qing-Jiao Army's retreat.

He sighed in relief and cast an admiring glance at Luo Si.

Luo Si's position was even more precarious, with himself and his chariot constantly under the intense scrutiny of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God. Yet he continued to command the battle with remarkably clear insight into the situation.

"But now I can't monitor the Qing-Jiao Army's status anymore."

"If we get a chance later, prioritize planting the 'Life Hanging by a Thread' condition on Qing Chi and the others!"

The Military Seed was no longer on Ning Zhuo's person, stripping him of control over the Qing-Jiao Army.

"I need to redeploy military forces!" Ning Zhuo transmitted his command to Luo Si through his divine sense.

Luo Si's response was terse: "Roger."

Just as Qing Yan had said, the Qing-Jiao Army's military might was crucial. Without this leverage, Ning Zhuo couldn't unlock Nascent Soul-level combat power.

And only by possessing such formidable strength could he meet the minimum requirements to participate in this perilous grand battle.

Luo Si also needed military assistance.

Without the military power amplification of the Qing-Jiao Army, he would likely have been severely injured by now.

The sky was pitch black, and countless yellowish-brown boulders hurtled through the air in all directions.

Ning Zhuo, clad in Sky Iron Heroic Armor, moved like a streak of refracted gold light through the darkness.

From the moment he activated the armor, he had disabled its safety limits, pushing it to its maximum speed.

The flames erupted by the Li Fire Tongue Array were ferocious, and each emergency maneuver made the Sky Iron Heroic Armor groan.

A boulder the size of an elephant roared toward him from the side.

Ning Zhuo activated his divine sense, hurling over a dozen Mechanical Golden Swallows directly at the massive rock.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A series of explosions echoed as the Mechanical Golden Swallows and the boulder mutually annihilated each other.

Countless rock fragments scattered in all directions, some still striking Ning Zhuo.

The Sky Iron Heroic Armor seemed to have been repeatedly struck by a hammer, its Earth Shield Formation patterns developing fine cracks.

Ning Zhuo strained every ounce of his strength just to barely maintain control of his flight direction. The armor's speed was too great, and the lateral impact from the fragments easily caused him to veer off course.

Amidst this storm of flying rocks, a single misjudgment of direction could send Ning Zhuo crashing into a boulder, resulting in a fate no different from the self-destruction of the Mechanical Golden Swallow.

"Faster! Faster!" Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth.

The Sky Iron Heroic Armor weaved frantically between the giant rocks, dancing on the precipice between life and death.

The wind resistance was terrifyingly intense!

Despite the White Tiger Shattering Army Formation on the Golden Wings, which should have sliced through the air, Ning Zhuo felt moments where the entire Mechanical Battle Armor seemed to suddenly become trapped in viscous mud.

"No, it's these giant rocks that are messing with us!"

Ning Zhuo quickly realized that some of the rocks repelled objects, while others drew them in. The potent Earthly Fiend emanating from the rocks was also negatively affecting the armor.

The Mystic Iron Breastplate turned crimson-hot, emitting a burning smell.

Under the influence of the Earthly Fiend, the Earth Shield Formation gradually failed. The temperature inside the armor rapidly climbed, turning it into a steaming cauldron. Ning Zhuo broke into a violent sweat, his clothes soaking through.

The Dual Polarity Convergence Formation also began to malfunction. The protective qi membrane it created was now as thin as paper. Where his body pressed against the armor, every emergency turn sent sharp, dull pains radiating through his body.
