Chapter 521: Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake

In a valley.

“All soldiers, listen to orders, form the Iron Bucket Formation!” Xu Dali stood under the general’s banner, urging the use of military tactics.

Military tactics —speed is of the essence!

Under the bolstering of this tactic, the speed throughout the Barbarian Demon Camp immediately increased by more than double.

However, the time required to form the battle formation was not significantly reduced; many even, unaccustomed to the sudden acceleration, ran to the wrong positions, causing errors in their coordination.

“Just as the intelligence said, the Barbarian Demon Camp’s level of training is the worst. Hahaha!”

“Brothers, hit them hard for me.”

“If we do not eliminate these isolated troops today, when they merge in the future, we will be reduced to a chopping board.”

Cultivators, with barbarian cultivators as the main and demon cultivators as the supplement, frequently appeared in the mountains and forests, casting various spells and concentrating their fire on the Barbarian Demon Camp.

Rolling stones, each the shaoe of a wheel, tumbled down the mountain’s slope, smashing into the soldiers of the Barbarian Demon Camp and leaving their heads bloodied.

One poisonous needle after another, as fine as an ox’s hair and impossible to defend against, caused soldiers of the Barbarian Demon Camp to occasionally fall to the ground, foaming at the mouth and convulsing to death.

Also, vines suddenly burst out from beneath the ground, immediately strangling the unsuspecting soldiers on the spot.

The Barbarian Demon Camp paid with the lives of hundreds before finally forming the Iron Bucket Formation.

At the instant the formation succeeded, the entire army’s defenses were greatly enhanced, and their situation changed from dangerous to secure.

A carriage concealed itself invisibly, speeding through the high sky.

The coachman, seeing below the battle between the Barbarian Demon Camp and the native cultivators of the Thousand Peaks Forest, immediately transmitted his divine sense to the people inside the carriage: “Sir, our army below is at a disadvantage; shall we come to assist?”

Based on the strength of the several cultivators in the carriage, once they took action, they would undoubtedly subvert the entire battle.

But as the backbone of the force, Zhao Xi snorted coldly, “Xu Dali is a useless fellow; the Barbarian Demon Camp’s poor training might have been forgivable, but the key is that he directly formed the Iron Bucket Formation and became nothing but a meat target.”

“Simply ridiculous!”

“If he had formed an attacking formation, the opponents being merely scattered soldiers and vagabonds with no proper army, how could they be resisted?”

“Xu Dali has forced himself into such a predicament; what is there for us to save?”

“At this moment, the most important thing is for me to hurry to the frontline main camp to take command of the situation.”

“General Du, severely injured and in seclusion, and I, as the overseer personally appointed by the Sovereign, must quickly go to take charge of the overall situation.”

“There is a reason why these troops have been eliminated.”

“Once I get to the main camp, the main forces will naturally pay attention and dispatch troops to support. That is the decision a general should make. Let’s go!”

The coachman, inwardly disdainful but outwardly respectful, said, “As you command, sir!”

Twin Rivers Nation Frontline Main Camp.

Ning Zhuo returned to his own residence, entered the Mechanical Dragon, and tinkered with various materials around the three mechanism pedestals.

On the Xuanyuan Nine Work Platform, chunk after chunk of blue electric current silver was swiftly processed, transforming into strands of flexible metallic silver wires. Each silver wire intermittently swirled with sparks.

Ning Zhuo gathered up the electric silver wires and took out the Dragon Scale Gold.

With his palm pressed against the Xuanyuan Nine Work Platform, he operated it continuously. Piece by piece, the Dragon Scale Gold was carved into extremely sharp hook shapes; with each cut, the curvature and sharpness of the hook had to be just right.

After producing hundreds of pieces, Ning Zhuo inspected them while nodding, feeling very satisfied: “If I were to process them one by one, it would take at least three days and three nights, and the final products would have many defects —how could they compare to these perfect ones?”

Ning Zhuo then took out a large heap of half-alive, half-dead beads.

“Chen Cha…”

Ning Zhuo’s gaze flickered for a moment as he recalled the old good man in his memory.

The half-alive, half-dead beads were the original creation of Chen Cha. He had used the formation collection of Bai Lin Jushi as a foundation, combining his own experience with a momentary flash of inspiration, to design this mechanical component.

They were mainly used in the joints.

Each spherical bead was divided into two sides —one pitch black and one pure white. On the pitch black side was the character for “death,” and on the white side was the character for “life.”

When the bead flipped to its white, “life” side, the joint moved freely; when it flipped to its black, “death” side, the joint was accordingly locked.

There was also a hidden connection between the beads. If a cultivator carved formation patterns onto the main mechanism, it could constitute one or more living formations.

Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the wooden beads that Chen Cha provided to Ning Zhuo were of too low a grade. The beads Ning Zhuo was now using had all been specially hastened into production —of Golden Core level.

Ning Zhuo worked diligently, using these half-alive, half-dead beads as a foundation. He wrapped and drawn with the electric silver wires to construct a snake body woven from a metallic network. Afterwards, he used the Dragon Scale Gold to forge scales, which he laid over the metal grid.

In this way, a prototype of a mechanical creation was formed.

Next, Ning Zhuo employed his divine sense, magical power, and mechanical tools to further process it —adding talismans, constructing formations, and so on.

After more than two hours, a mechanical creation resembling a golden snake lay quietly on the surface of the mechanism pedestal.

Mechanical Beast —Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake!

This mechanical snake gleamed with golden light and was exquisitely crafted. Its body was covered with sharp, saw-toothed scales. With its mouth open, it could extend a pair of hook-shaped fangs.

When Ning Zhuo attempted to activate it, he saw the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake slithering on the surface of the mechanism pedestal, its movements agile, uncoiled, and quite natural.

Ning Zhuo then took out an iron tree stump.

The Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake suddenly lunged, so fast that it left a golden shadow in Ning Zhuo’s field of vision.

Its body extended and coiled around the iron tree stump.

Mechanism Technique —Golden Scale Winding Saw Kill!

Ning Zhuo activated this self-created mechanical technique. The scales of the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake stood upright, embedding into the iron tree stump.

Each scale rotated rapidly, as if slicing tofu, directly cutting into the interior of the iron tree.

As the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake wound tighter and tighter, the iron tree stump —thick as a washbasin —was effortlessly cut into two segments, with no capacity to resist.

“Very good, very good.”

Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up. “Next, it’s time for real combat, to gather experience for manufacturing the staff head.”

“Once the subsequent work on the staff head is completed, this Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake will be fully finished.”

Ning Zhuo did not halt his progress.

Next, he still had to design two more mechanical creations.

Because relying solely on the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake, it obviously would not be a match for the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and would be difficult to achieve results in real combat.

Ning Zhuo worked through the entire night, and by the next morning, three brand-new mechanical creations lay before him.

In addition to the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake, there was also a set of seven rolling electric ball cages and a root-drilling, ground-piercing hammer.

When Liu Er and Guan Hong found Ning Zhuo, he showed them his results and gave them a brief introduction.

Guan Hong did not understand mechanical arts, but he knew well that Ning Zhuo was not an ordinary person, and he immediately expressed his anticipation.

Liu Er sincerely exclaimed, “Before having met the military advisor, I could hardly have imagined that there would be such a genius youth in the world.”

“Military Advisor, you primarily cultivate mechanical arts, while those Five Elements spells are only secondary studies.”

“Ah, once this secret is revealed, the number of people who will be amazed is countless.”

Liu Er looked earnestly at Ning Zhuo, “Military Advisor, your future is truly limitless; in time, you could very well ascend to the Young Master List!”

Ning Zhuo immediately waved his hand, humbly dismissing Liu Er’s praise, “The Young Master encompasses the entire cultivation world —what virtue or merit do I have to be selected among them?”

Guan Hong then said, “Based on all I have seen in my life, you, Military Advisor, are the most likely to ascend to the Young Master.”

Deep underground, there was a Dragon King Temple.

The entrance to the temple was a stone door. The stone door was covered with the marks of time, thick and ancient.

Pushing open the stone door, one found the temple hall.

More than twenty giant pillars supported the dome. The pillars were made of millennia-old ancient wood, and each was inlaid with golden dragon scale patterns, with dragon heads held high and dragon tails winding, vividly lifelike.

Inside the temple, the light was dim, and the surrounding stone walls emitted a faint yellow glow.

The air was filled with a damp scent, mixed with water vapor and the mysterious fragrance of medicinal herbs.

At the very center of the temple hall was the main altar, about three zhang tall, surrounded by a rich dragon aura.

On the altar was enshrined a special Dragon King statue.

It had no claws or scales, with its dragon head held high and its dragon whiskers spread out —exactly in the appearance of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.

At this moment, the statue of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King had dull eyes and was gasping for breath, revealing that its true form was in a very bad state.

Beneath the altar, there was a huge incense table on which burned three large incense sticks. Each incense stick was as thick as a washbasin and as tall as one zhang, and the smoke that emanated from them rose gracefully around the Dragon King statue, slowly being absorbed by it.

In addition to the large incense sticks, there were also a large number of sacrificial offerings.

Long Ye, as one of the temple priests, was organizing the sacrificial rites together with four other temple priests.

As the sacrificial rites progressed, the offerings were quickly consumed, transforming into streams of nourishment and power that were channeled to the true form of the Dragon King hidden in an unknown location.

When the sacrifice paused, the temple priests sat cross-legged on the floor tiles, all competing against time to recover as much as possible.

The heavy, labored breathing gradually subsided, and the originally pale faces gradually regained a trace of color.

Conducting a sacrifice was not such a simple, easy matter.

Even Long Ye felt the hardship, more exhausted than he had been during the fierce fight in the ambush.

At that moment, a flying message drifted over, bringing the latest military intelligence.

The temple priests quickly projected their divine sense; after reading it, one of the old temple priests looked at Long Ye and said, “Ah Long, you should go back and take charge of the battle.”

“Without you, the people in the frontline camp will all run away.”

“A few of us old fellows here will suffice.”

Long Ye’s face showed difficulty as he looked toward the Dragon King statue and said with utmost worry, “Those outsiders are not worth dying over; my heart belongs only to the deity.”

The old temple priest immediately replied, “Precisely for that reason, you should go back and take charge of the overall situation. You need to lead the allied forces to intercept and encircle the armies of the Twin Rivers Nation —kill as many as possible!”

“Only in this way can we win more time for our master to recuperate and recover!”

Long Ye gritted his teeth, hesitated for a moment, and finally slowly nodded, “Understood, I will go back and take charge of the overall situation.”

He knelt in obeisance, turning his head every three steps, reluctantly leaving the Dragon King Temple.

Once he used the Earth Escape, his speed increased greatly.

“Lu Hongtu, that guy, was very slippery. He was always wooing people’s hearts and never obstructed those who went out, to the extent that many of our high cultivators were killed by military weapons while picking up spoils.”

“Those Ghost Cultivators were also not of good will, inciting our high-level cultivators to probe the enemy’s firepower for the two of them.”

“The most critical is still the Old Stone Monster!”

“Even until now, he still has not appeared. What patience…”

Like Lu Hongtu, Long Ye also deeply understood that the Old Stone Monster was the most crucial factor. As long as he did not appear, the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and Du Tiechuan would never risk everything to fight.

Long Ye secretly returned to the military camp, but did not immediately appear in the main discussion tent; instead, he found Sheng Xu Gongzi.

“Your previous quote, our side has agreed to it,” Long Ye said with a solemn expression.

But Sheng Xu Gongzi shook his head, “That was then; this is now, Long Ye.”

“Now, my quote needs to double.”

“Huh?!” Long Ye glared, fury rising in his heart, “You’re taking advantage of the situation to rob us!”

Sheng Xu Gongzi smiled slightly, “My name appears on the Young Master List, and now your side and the Twin Rivers Nation’s Soul Formation cultivators are all severely injured. My action this time will very likely change the final outcome of this great war. Therefore, I am completely worth this price!”

Long Ye shook his head, “What you say makes sense. But even if I wanted to pay, I don’t have the ability. You must understand, you require cash on the spot. The Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance is, after all, an alliance; relying on my Dragon King Temple lineage, even if I emptied our treasury, I could not produce your remuneration. After all, there are too many places that need money.”

Sheng Xu Gongzi, having foreseen this outcome, said, “Rest assured, ahem ahem, I accept treasure as deduction.”

A glint flashed in Long Ye’s eyes, “What is it that you want?”

Sheng Xu Gongzi straightened his back slightly and slowly uttered four characters, “Sheng Hai Dragon Spring.”

Long Ye, so angry that he almost had to strike, resolutely rejected, “That is absolutely impossible!”

Twin Rivers Nation Frontline Main Camp.

A carriage descended from the sky; after quietly landing, it then dispelled its spells and gradually became visible.

The generals had long been waiting; when they saw the overseer Zhao Xi dismount from the carriage, they all saluted.

Zhao Xi, holding the identity-representing baton, with his head held high and chest out, scanned the surroundings and only gave a slight nod, his demeanor very dignified.

“I have already reported the previous battle; the Monarch is very concerned. How is General Du now?”

Immediately, a general reported that Du Tiechuan had entered deep seclusion, and the specific military affairs had been handed over to others for joint handling.

Zhao Xi was pleased in his heart, “Very well, serving the nation and toiling is the duty of a subject; let me take on this heavy responsibility.”

The generals looked at each other; constrained by their positions, they had no choice but to comply.

Zhao Xi immediately rushed to the Commander's Mansion, inquiring about the situation in the main camp all along the way.

The generals reported: almost all of the army had removed their iron-plated flesh armor and were currently actively resting and recuperating; their condition was quickly recovering, and in another three or four days there would be troops available for mobilization and deployment.

And during this period, it was mainly the generals of the Golden Core and Nascent Soul levels who were roaming around the battlefield, carrying out cleanup tasks.

They further reported that on the Thousand Peaks Forest side, many petty criminals also wanted to pick up spoils and were taught a lesson by the heavy military weapons —many were killed or injured, and the loot was considerable.

Hearing this, Zhao Xi’s heart pounded, and he immediately inquired about the matter of the spoils.

Then someone took out a jade slip and handed it to Zhao Xi, “Sir, this is the complete record of the spoils captured so far.”

Zhao Xi’s divine sense swept through it and discovered that there was also a battle merit ranking list.

At the top of the ranking was none other than Liu Er.

He was evidently displeased, “That mere mixed-blood, occupying the top spot? What about the others?”

One of the generals explained, “Overseer, this Liu Er just squeezed into the ranking last night. Perhaps by noon today, when the ranking is rearranged, he will drop out.”

The other generals concurred, saying it was an accident —previously, Liu Er had been ranked outside of the top five.

Zhao Xi slowly nodded, but inside his heart he grew anxious, “This Liu Er is an outsider, with no power or influence, yet he occupies the top spot. This indicates that he has indeed scooped up a lot.”

“These spoils are all battle merits, after all.”

“I have come here with great difficulty; if I can’t get battle merits, how can I justify this very adventure of mine?”
