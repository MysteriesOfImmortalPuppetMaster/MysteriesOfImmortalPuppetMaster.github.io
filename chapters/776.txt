Chapter 776: True Fragrance

Where there are people, there are rivers and lakes.

If Ning Zhuo were to go to Zhu Fenxiang for help, he would very likely offend Situ Xing, which would interfere with a previously arranged plan.

This plan involved leveraging the power of the group consisting of Shen Xi, Lin Jinglong, and Situ Xing to help him successfully complete more tasks during the Rising Cloud Assembly.

The Rising Cloud Minor Trial was merely for showing promise; the subsequent Rising Cloud Assembly was the true stage.

When that time came, although one could succeed relying solely on oneself, leveraging the strength of others through mutual assistance would undoubtedly raise the ceiling of success much higher.

"This decision requires caution." Ning Zhuo’s expression was serious.

Although Meng Yehu's spirituality was on the verge of collapse and required an urgent solution, Ning Zhuo remained calm. He did not let panic distort his actions.

He immediately sent a Flying Letter to Chen San, instructing him to collect relevant intelligence.

With ample funding and Chen San going all out, Ning Zhuo quickly gained a relatively clear understanding of the cultivators and forces within and outside the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s main mountain gate that were related to the Divine Summoning Art.

After understanding the situation, Ning Zhuo discovered that Zhu Fenxiang’s value was even greater than he thought.

"In that case, there is no need to cling to the Situ Xing line."

Ning Zhuo rubbed the space between his eyebrows.

He hadn’t intended to offend Situ Xing, but previously, because of Shen Xi, he had kept his distance from Situ Xing. Now, because of Meng Yehu, seeking out Zhu Fenxiang would make his relationship with Situ Xing even more tense.

"I might even be kicked out of that group."

Even so, Ning Zhuo had to make contact with Zhu Fenxiang.

"I am an outsider."

"Once in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, I am naturally neutral and can establish connections with any outsider or faction."

"Although Situ Xing and the Situ Clan are powerful, they aren't enough to make me overly apprehensive."

If he were truly apprehensive, Ning Zhuo wouldn't have adopted such an attitude toward Pi Fujie and Ban Ji.

The line of Situ Xing and Shen Xi was merely one of Ning Zhuo’s entry points. There were several similar entry points.

For example, the Demon Subjugation Hall, the Confucian cultivator community, or the reliable friends explicitly mentioned by Meng Yaoyin in her letter.

Ning Zhuo had not deeply engaged with any of these yet.

"There’s no need!"

"Now is not the time."

"I should remain flexible and adaptable, going with the flow of the situation before finally making a decision."

"Before that, I need to wait patiently for the time to mature."

It was far from the time for Ning Zhuo to truly place his bets.

He maintained a flexible mindset, doing his utmost to increase his own value so that it would be easier to place his bets in the future.

When Ning Zhuo sought out Zhu Fenxiang, she was in the midst of healing.

The quiet room was filled with a heavy scent of medicine and the smoke of offering incense.

Zhu Fenxiang sat cross-legged on a prayer mat, her body steaming with a fog of spiritual energy that resembled incense smoke.

Within the meridians of her body, specks of starlight remained. Each speck of starlight was like a miniature, icy sword edge, bringing a stinging pain and chill deep into Zhu Fenxiang's bone marrow.

From her right chest to her shoulder, she was wrapped in thick white bandages. Bloodstains seeped intermittently through the surface of the bandages.

"Ning Zhuo?" She opened her eyes, a trace of confusion flashing through them.

A maidservant respectfully handed over Ning Zhuo’s visiting card.

She naturally knew of Ning Zhuo.

Zhu Fenxiang had actively challenged Situ Xing this time, so she had investigated intelligence on him quite clearly.

Therefore, she was also aware that Ning Zhuo and Shen Xi had a significant relationship, and that both were within Situ Xing’s small circle.

"What is his intention in visiting at this moment?"

Zhu Fenxiang’s fingertips unconsciously rubbed the edge of the visiting card as she made a decision: "Invite him in."

Moments later, the door to the quiet room opened, and Ning Zhuo stepped inside.

Zhu Fenxiang’s probing gaze fell upon Ning Zhuo. Although she had long known Ning Zhuo’s appearance from intelligence reports, this was her first time meeting him in person.

She saw Ning Zhuo dressed in spotless plain white clothes, his gaze calm, his steps steady. His head was slightly large, and his entire being radiated confidence and youthful vigor.

Ning Zhuo also sized up Zhu Fenxiang.

Zhu Fenxiang sat quietly cross-legged. Due to blood loss and other factors, her face was pale and her eyes dim. However, the lingering fighting spirit constantly demonstrated this person’s tenacity and composure.

"Young Master Ning Zhuo." Zhu Fenxiang spoke first, her voice carrying a hint of raspiness due to her injuries.

"You and Situ Xing are in the same group. Seeking me out at this moment - did he issue you an order, or do you have some advice of your own?"

Ning Zhuo immediately felt Zhu Fenxiang’s sharpness. She categorized Ning Zhuo as an enemy right from the start, revealing the domineering side of her nature.

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly.

He was not in a hurry to disassociate himself from Situ Xing; doing so would only make him look guilty and be detrimental to the upcoming negotiation.

"Miss Zhu Fenxiang, I have already heard of your heroic bearing in battle from Brother Shen Xi."

"Your thunderous methods this time, suppressing Situ Xing and breaking his Cycle of Heaven Starry Grand Formation - such a battle record is truly admirable."

He cupped his hands slightly, his posture composed: "I have come to offer congratulations to Senior Sister."

"However, while victory is victory, the price Senior Sister paid is, like Situ Xing's, extremely heavy. It can be called a pyrrhic victory."

Speaking to this point, his gaze swept over Zhu Fenxiang’s bloodstained bandages and pale face.

Ning Zhuo’s voice suddenly rose a bit: "I have come because I wish to lend Miss Zhu Fenxiang a hand, to expand the fruits of this victory and turn a pyrrhic victory into a great victory!"

"Oh?" Zhu Fenxiang immediately became more interested. "Please elaborate, Young Master Ning."

Ning Zhuo nodded and pointed a finger at himself: "Miss Zhu Fenxiang, try to imagine this. If, at this moment, I publicly announce that I am leaving Situ Xing’s group to join forces with you, what would outsiders think?"

Zhu Fenxiang raised her brows slightly.

She certainly knew the impact would be massive!

On one hand, she had defeated Situ Xing and gained the momentum of victory. But she was also heavily injured, so the blow to the prestige of Situ Xing and the Situ Clan was not as huge as originally planned.

On the other hand, if Ning Zhuo broke away from Situ Xing to ally with Zhu Fenxiang... Given Ning Zhuo’s current reputation, where the outside world recognized him as a genius on the same level as Situ Xing, the public would undoubtedly look doubly favorably upon Zhu Fenxiang. They would also believe that Situ Xing’s defeat had caused him to lose the hearts of his people.

Thirdly, Zhu Fenxiang had also secretly had a headache - Situ Xing’s group was too powerful. Just on paper, the top-tier geniuses included Situ Xing and Ning Zhuo, while Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong had also long been famous throughout the country, second only to the tier of Ning Zhuo and Situ Xing.

Now, if Ning Zhuo joined her side, the enemy would painfully lose a strong ally. One out, one in - she would gain double.

Zhu Fenxiang fell silent for a moment, then looked at Ning Zhuo: "What does Young Master Ning want me to do for you?"

By now, Ning Zhuo’s value was worlds apart from when he had first entered the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s mountain gate.

He smiled faintly: "I wouldn't visit without a reason. I would like to ask Miss Zhu to examine a mechanical construct. If you can resolve its predicament, I will certainly honor the agreement and form a united front with Miss Zhu."

After speaking, Ning Zhuo slapped his storage belt and directly released a mechanical puppet - it was precisely the Shadow Blade Night Tiger.

Zhu Fenxiang’s pupils constricted slightly as she looked Meng Yehu up and down, secretly surprised by its design and aura.

Although she did not practice mechanics, she could assess the value of the Shadow Blade Night Tiger from its appearance.

She also saw that Meng Yehu's body was constantly shrouded in a mass of mist-like yellow sand, which was constantly eroding and infiltrating this mechanism. Furthermore, it was self-contained and radiated the majesty of a god.

Ning Zhuo asked with concern: "Miss Zhu, can it be solved?"

Zhu Fenxiang: "I need to cast a spell to understand more. I will not make casual promises at this moment."

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly: "Since that is the case, let us first establish a Divine Contract."

To use magic to investigate Meng Yehu, the internal situation of the mechanism would naturally be revealed. This represented both a loss and a risk, so means were naturally needed to enforce restraint.

Zhu Fenxiang understood this naturally and immediately signed a Divine Contract with Ning Zhuo.

Upon activating her Dharma Body to investigate, Zhu Fenxiang’s eyes suddenly widened, her expression changing instantly to one filled with shock.

In that moment, she forgot to breathe as she looked at Ning Zhuo: "This rank... it is actually a Soul Formation method!"

Ning Zhuo’s face remained calm: "I am ashamed. I have not been cultivating for long, and my methods are weak. I found it difficult to resolve this Divine Power seal. I also know very little about its intricacies."

"Miss Zhu, can it be solved?"

Zhu Fenxiang continued to stare intently at Ning Zhuo.

She had not expected Ning Zhuo’s difficulty to involve something at the Soul Formation level. This was something she absolutely had not anticipated.

"A Soul Formation-level existence made a move against him? No, he is like me, only at the Foundation Establishment stage. More accurately, he is only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, whereas I am at the peak."

"With such a cultivation base, could he provoke a Soul Formation cultivator?"

"Even if he can leverage battle strength to fight a Golden Core cultivator, Soul Formation is..."

Thoughts surged within Zhu Fenxiang’s divine sea.

"So, did he obtain some kind of opportunity?"

Zhu Fenxiang thought of herself. Top-tier geniuses like her naturally had high Qi Luck and had encountered quite a few opportunities.

Zhu Fenxiang shook her head slightly and answered Ning Zhuo’s question first: "Since it concerns the Soul Formation level, I still need to investigate deeper. Please wait a moment, Young Master Ning."

After a full ten minutes, during which Zhu Fenxiang cast spells continuously and switched between more than a dozen investigation methods...

Zhu Fenxiang made a judgment: "It can be solved."

Ning Zhuo secretly breathed a sigh of relief. With the Divine Contract binding her, he didn't worry about Zhu Fenxiang lying to him.

Before coming here, he had examined a lot of relevant intelligence. He discovered that although the Myriad Manifestations Sect was large and full of elites, under the current circumstances, Zhu Fenxiang really was the most suitable choice.

Within the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, there were naturally people with higher attainments in the Divine Summoning Art. There were also other cultivators with rich past battle records proving they could solve problems related to Divine Arts.

But Ning Zhuo could not expose himself right now, nor could he rashly contact those people.

Those capable of solving Meng Yehu's problem were definitely strong experts. Who knew what relationship these experts had with the higher-ups of the Myriad Manifestations Sect?

Because the higher-ups of the Myriad Manifestations Sect were currently engaging in a fierce contest and intense gambling surrounding the benefits of White Paper Immortal City.

Under these circumstances, the Meng Yehu that Ning Zhuo took out carried the Divine Power of the Lord of Forgetful River. This would too easily cause people to make connections!

A super sect like the Myriad Manifestations Sect could easily obtain information regarding the aura of the Lord of Forgetful River's Divine Power. This level of intelligence was too low-grade for them.

Ning Zhuo did not want to expose himself prematurely.

He had long understood that his true crisis would be the exposure of the secret of White Paper Immortal City. When that happened, he would be completely placed in the center of a massive vortex.

His current showing off and garnering of reputation was all to do his best to display himself and establish connections everywhere, making it easier for him to cope with that crisis.

He needed to suppress the danger to the minimum and firmly grasp the opportunities!

Zhu Fenxiang said: "Relying on myself alone, it is absolutely impossible. But I can perform a summoning to invite True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard. He is a Great God! There will be absolutely no problem."

"It's just that holding the ritual and asking the God to take action comes at a price..."

Ning Zhuo revealed a confident smile that said "I don't lack money": "That is easy to discuss."

To prove his financial power, Ning Zhuo grabbed a handful of Ghost Path Golden Cores and stuffed them directly into Zhu Fenxiang’s hands.

Zhu Fenxiang stared at the Golden Cores in her hand, completely dumbfounded!

"Young Master Ning, you! This, this, this..."

In this moment, Ning Zhuo was no longer just mysterious in her impression, but became unfathomable.

Handsome, wealthy, and strong!

Even though Zhu Fenxiang came from a prestigious family, she felt small in front of Ning Zhuo at this moment.

This only increased her determination to win Ning Zhuo over from Situ Xing’s side to her own!

With heavy gold clearing the way, the power was naturally extraordinary.

To show her sincerity in cooperation, Zhu Fenxiang disregarded her injuries and took the initiative to make preparations.

In just over two hours, she had prepared enough offerings and built a small sacrificial altar.

Zhu Fenxiang led Ning Zhuo out of the quiet room and into the depths of the cave dwelling.

A divine altar was arranged here.

Zhu Fenxiang stepped forward and placed a flawless god statue in the center of the divine altar. The statue was lifelike, depicting precisely the appearance of True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard.

Earth Vein Dragon Marrow Incense!

Zhu Fenxiang lit nine sticks in a row and inserted them into the dark gold incense burner.

This offering incense was as thick as a child's arm and the color of dark gold ore. Once lit, it produced no smoke but emitted light. The earth-yellow radiance condensed into a tangible substance, spiraling upward. Within the halo, the phantom of a dragon-shaped earth vein appeared faintly, emitting an aura that stabilized mountains and returned earth energy to its source.

Zhu Fenxiang, dressed in plain white ritual robes, stepped barefoot onto the edge of the divine altar, her face solemn.

The divine markings on her brow lit up, emitting a scorching orange-yellow brilliance.

She began to dance the sacrificial dance.

With every step her feet landed, dark gold ripples of light burst from her soles. Her waist twisted, her arms moved as if embracing the earth's core, her ten fingers formed hand seals, and the wide sleeves of her ritual robes fluttered, creating trails of golden light like flowing sand.

The runes engraved on the divine altar lit up one after another, and the halos of the nine sticks of Dragon Marrow Incense surged.

Zhu Fenxiang chanted a prayer softly: "Dark and Yellow heavens as armor, suppressing and locking the great chiliocosm! The Nine Hells bow their heads, sins become the abyss! Believer Fenxiang uses her heart as a torch, her blood as stairs, respectfully inviting the True Lord, respectfully inviting the True Lord..."

An indifferent divine thought sensed the call from this place and swept over lightly.

It was precisely True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard!

The God's gaze fell upon the dancing Zhu Fenxiang, and He thought: "Rebellious servant, how dare you call my name again?"

During the previous battle with Situ Xing, Zhu Fenxiang had summoned a clone of True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard to descend. However, during the combat, the two sides had disagreed, creating a flaw that Situ Xing seized upon, nearly dragging Zhu Fenxiang down to defeat.

Now, True Lord Shutu was very dissatisfied with Zhu Fenxiang. At a critical moment, she had committed an act of defiance against the God.

"Why would this True Lord easily agree to your call?"

True Lord Shutu watched coldly from the sidelines.

He saw the offerings.

A handful of Nine Nether Soil, held in a Black Jade Box. The soil was a mix of black and gray, appearing as if the wailing of ten thousand ghosts was sealed within, yet with specks of starlight-like true meaning of reincarnation constantly flickering.

White Hua Warm Jade Marrow, shaped like droplets of molten gold. Each drop contained a giant earth vein, symbolizing the origin accumulated over ten years.

A section of a thick, giant spine, entirely like black jade, its surface covered with divine locking patterns. This was a Legacy Treasure from a Molted God!

True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard: ...

In the next moment, His Divine Power descended upon the god statue, forming a clone.

Instantly, dark yellow divine light shot into the sky. The statue turned into a living entity, its divine might suppressing the prison and enveloping the surroundings of the divine altar.

Amidst the divine light, True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard took a deep breath. The scent of this Earth Vein Dragon Marrow Incense - it was true fragrance!
