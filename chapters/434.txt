Chapter 434: Horse Hooves Trample Falling Flowers

"Quickly, give it a try," Sun Lingtong was also very excited.

Ning Zhuo closed his eyes and silently sensed his new spleen.

In a trance, he seemed to enter a temple.

He sat upright on a platform, becoming the earth god statue worshipped in the temple!

From outside the temple, a large amount of blood, essence, and qi continuously drifted in. After entering the temple, they were illuminated by the earth god statue and underwent round after round of purification.

The purification continued incessantly, absorbing impurities that settled down, enriching the foundational soil beneath the temple.

The spleen's original function was to digest food, regulate qi and blood, and resist diseases. Now, using Ning Zhuo's own spleen as the foundation to refine the earth-element spleen temple, it has become even more efficient in this aspect!

"It can also absorb impurities and precipitate them, just like the earth, accepting everything, bearing everything, nurturing everything. After deep accumulation and the washing of time, it ultimately turns waste into treasure."

This immediately reminded Ning Zhuo of the divine ability Stone Casting Earth Treasure!

He began to infuse spiritual energy, urging the earth-element spleen temple.

Instantly, a surging power rose from the depths of his spleen and poured into all directions, actively participating in the life operations of his entire body.

Ning Zhuo felt as if he was heavily pushed, and an indescribable sense of comfort gradually emerged throughout his body.

He sat cross-legged and tried to absorb the natural spiritual qi around him. In an instant, a large amount of earth-element spiritual qi was absorbed and poured into the earth-element spleen temple within his body.

Such an effect of absorbing spiritual qi made Ning Zhuo's heart tremble fiercely.

Even though he was the one who improved this spell, he was pleasantly surprised by the actual cultivation effect!

"The degree of spiritual qi absorption is far superior to when I use the Tornado Windmill artifact."

"No wonder the Five Elements Divine Lord cultivated all five elements back then, yet his cultivation speed was still so rapid."

Ning Zhuo rapidly absorbed most of the earth-element spiritual qi and converted it into the other four elements, maintaining the balance of the five elements within his sea of qi.

"In the future, if I can possess the complete five elements five-viscera divine temples, my cultivation speed will definitely make a huge leap."

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel excited.

"The five-viscera temple spiritual god technique I currently designed requires the essence of the five elements, and it's best if they have spirituality."

Without spirituality, Ning Zhuo couldn't create external gods.

He performed blood sacrifice on his viscera, mostly using his own spirituality to create the temple and control the external god.

He had just refined it, and he was almost the god statue himself, with the deepest level of control. But in the future, if his own spirituality couldn't be replenished constantly, the spirituality originating from the stone old monster would inevitably rise, and even gradually take the lead, eventually controlling the earth-element spleen temple.

This was the drawback of the five-viscera temple spiritual god technique! "So, the earth-element spleen temple cannot leave the body for too long; it must often return to replenish spirituality and suppress the external god."

Ning Zhuo silently reminded himself.

"Next is the key!"

Ning Zhuo moved his mind, and immediately his own spleen shook, broke free from its original position, and turned into a mass of earthy yellow light.

Ning Zhuo opened his mouth and spat out the light mass.

While controlling the light mass to drill into the stone sphere, he activated the Demonic Blood Tendon Technique, allowing the missing part of the spleen to form a piece of blood tendon as a temporary replacement.

The light mass followed the fine hole previously drilled in the stone sphere, all the way deep into the stone core.

There, the light mass expanded, filling the hollow of the stone core, vaguely forming an earth-element temple. The temple doors were wide open, and inside sat a god statue, whose appearance resembled Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's connection with his own earth-element spleen temple was extremely close. He immediately manipulated the earth-element spleen temple to quickly permeate the stone sphere itself.

After a moment, it was as if he had grown another organ.

He mobilized the earth-element spiritual energy within the top-grade spiritual crystals inside the stone sphere. The spiritual energy spurted out, causing the stone sphere to flip and roll everywhere, extremely agile.

With a thought, Ning Zhuo caused the earth-element spleen temple to burst out with strong suction, immediately reabsorbing the earth-element mana that had been sprayed out, storing it back into the spiritual stone.

Sun Lingtong had been watching all along. Seeing this scene, he clapped vigorously: "Little Zhuo, you succeeded!"

Ning Zhuo also showed a bright smile: "Elder Brother, with the earth-element spleen temple, I can control the stone sphere itself as if it were my own arm."

"But I still need to modify the interior into becoming a mechanism, so I can use it better!"

The core layer of the stone sphere was a large number of top-grade earth-element crystals, containing surging Nascent Soul-level spiritual energy; it was a natural spiritual energy pool.

Ning Zhuo also planned to create multiple stone mirrors.

The stone mirrors originated from the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Art, providing an alternative amplification for divine sense. Combined with the stone sphere, they complemented each other perfectly.

Time was very tight. Ning Zhuo worked tirelessly for two days and nights before achieving his expected goal.

His face was pale, with two quite obvious dark circles under his eyes, as he returned to the Three Generals Camp.

While training new recruits, the three generals were also very concerned about Ning Zhuo. After all, Ning Zhuo had taken a considerable amount of military funds and had disappeared without a trace.

Learning that Ning Zhuo had returned, Liu Er laughed heartily and personally went out of the camp to greet him.

When he saw Ning Zhuo, he was stunned.

Previously, Ning Zhuo was dressed in white, with bright eyes and fair skin, his divine light shining brightly. Now, the young man was haggard, with a pale complexion, swollen eyes, and heavy dark circles, as if most of his yang energy had been sucked out by a female ghost.

Liu Er took a deep breath and reached out to hold Ning Zhuo's arms: "Military Advisor has done too much for our army, to the point of such exhaustion!"

"Come into the camp and rest for a few days, take good care, and don't work so hard anymore."

He only cared about Ning Zhuo and didn't even mention the divination.

Such social skills, regardless of sincerity, made Ning Zhuo feel warm at this moment.

Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head and transmitted to Liu Er: "Reporting to the Great General, I have fortunately not disgraced my mission this time. The divination was successful, and I have calculated a prophetic poem."

"The content of the poem is shocking, so I dared not rest for a moment and rushed back to inform the General."

"This prophetic poem is:"

<div style=" padding: 8px; font-style: italic;">"Horse hooves trample falling flowers,"

"Wind rises, shadows sink in the sand."

"Who can keep the bright moon,"

"Who will bury the rosy clouds?"</div>

Liu Er listened and immediately frowned. After pondering for a moment, he looked at Ning Zhuo and transmitted his divine sense: "Military Advisor, how do you interpret this poem?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head with a bitter smile: "I cannot fully interpret it either. Just looking at this poem makes me feel that the future is full of crises."

"The so-called 'horse hooves trample falling flowers' seems to imply that our army is about to set out."

"The word 'falling flowers' makes me feel terrified. As the saying goes, 'falling flowers and flowing water', I fear that the army's advance will be fraught with difficulties."

But Liu Er shook his head: "'Horse hooves trample falling flowers' according to my understanding, can't it mean that our army sets out and tramples the enemy along the way, defeating them utterly?"

Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned: "This prophetic poem cannot be interpreted line by line, Great General."

"Because the next line, 'Wind rises, shadows sink in the sand,' indicates that the situation will take a sharp turn, the enemy will rise like the wind, and the situation will become hazy and dangerous."

"'Who can keep the bright moon' the bright moon represents hope."

"'Who will bury the rosy clouds' the rosy clouds represent the smoke of war."

"These two lines indicate that someone will perish in the upcoming crisis, while someone survives to the next night, seeing the hope of survival. This means that our army has not been completely annihilated and still has a light of hope."

Liu Er listened carefully and shook his head again: "Military Advisor, you are being too pessimistic."

"The way i see it, the last two lines clearly say that both sides will have casualties on the battlefield; some people survive, and some die."

"We need to be cautious of enemies who are adept at using smoke and rosy cloud techniques."

"But in my opinion, our Fire Cloud Camp can stir up fire clouds to cover the battlefield, isn't that 'rosy clouds'?"

"Hahaha."

Ning Zhuo was speechless.

When he came, he was indeed a bit hasty and had only composed this prophetic poem halfway.

As a result, when he tried to persuade Liu Er, the latter was unexpectedly optimistic.

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath: "Great General, I personally performed the divination and experienced it myself, and I have my own feelings and insights."

"My emotions are quite low, and this is the biggest revelation!"

"General must not be complacent!"

Liu Er nodded repeatedly and continued to comfort Ning Zhuo, accompanying him all the way back to the military advisor's tent to rest.

Zhang Hei and Guan Hong, upon learning that Ning Zhuo had returned to camp, took advantage of a break in training to find him together.

Halfway, the three met.

Liu Er waved his hand: "This divination has exhausted the Military Advisor terribly. Go back and don't disturb his rest."

Zhang Hei laughed: "Heh, I knew the Military Advisor was reliable!"

As he spoke, he glanced at Guan Hong.

Guan Hong stroked his beard: "I just said that anything is possible."

He then asked Liu Er about the result of the divination.

Liu Er recited the prophetic poem.

Zhang Hei was dumbfounded, while Guan Hong pondered: "Military Advisor and Eldest Brother's interpretations both make sense. Prophetic poems have this ambiguous nature."

As they were talking, a messenger in the army, carrying a military order and riding a fast horse, came into the camp.

Seeing the three Golden Core generals, the messenger still sat on his horse without any salute, merely raising the military order: "I order the Three Generals Camp to prepare immediately and set out with the main army tomorrow morning!"

Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei all widened their eyes simultaneously. Zhang Hei even took a light breath.

Such a strange reaction instead startled the messenger. "Why aren't you accepting the order? Do you intend to disobey?!"

Liu Er hurriedly took the military order token.

As soon as the messenger left, Zhang Hei couldn't hold back: "Eldest Brother, Second Brother, the Military Advisor truly lives up to his title; he indeed has some real skills."

"He actually predicted that our army would set out."

"Does this... mean that our future is bleak?"

Guan Hong pondered silently.

Liu Er took a deep breath, his face solemn: "Second Brother, Third Brother, in fact, I believe the Military Advisor more."

"After all, the Military Advisor is adept at divination; I'm completely an outsider."

"Then why did I comfort the Military Advisor like that?"

At this point, Liu Er said seriously: "Two virtuous brothers, if the future is full of crises and there is life-and-death danger, will we retreat?"

"I won't!"

Liu Er took a deep breath, his eyes reddening: "Although I am a blood descendant of the Lu royal family, so what?"

"Who will look up to me because of this identity?"

"More people disparage me as a hybrid of humans and demons!"

"I want to make a name for myself."

"I really want to!"

"But in today's cultivation world, it's hard for a cultivator of my background to be recognized."

"I must seize this opportunity!"

"For me, the Twin Rivers Nation's expedition against Thousand Peaks Forest is an opportunity that I must grasp."

"Therefore, no matter how dangerous it is, I must go on."

Liu Er's words were sincere and forceful.

Zhang Hei was moved and immediately said: "Eldest Brother, I understand you!"

"I brought some of my clansmen to move to Green Forest Immortal City, wanting to develop and grow using the resources near Thousand Peaks Forest. But after moving there, I found that the important positions were already occupied."

"Although Green Forest Immortal City is big, the space left for outsiders to develop is too little, too little!"

"Only by participating in the conquest can I make meritorious achievements, avoid being excluded, and truly gain growth and development."

"So Eldest Brother, rest assured, I, Old Hei, will definitely charge at the forefront on the battlefield!"

Guan Hong also said: "I have traveled the world and seen this prosperous age like oil boiling over a raging fire, with countless cultivators like locusts."

"I believe that a great era of contention is coming!"

"As real men, we should follow the trend and ride the waves at the forefront of the times."

"Eldest Brother, Third Brother, Guan will never flee without a fight."

Seeing the two express their intentions, Liu Er was overjoyed. He grabbed their arms with both hands: "Good! Worthy of being my sworn brothers, Liu Er's brothers. From now on, we three will advance and retreat together, watch and help each other, and we will surely make a career in this world!"

"Eldest Brother! Second Brother, Third Brother!"

"Eldest Brother! Second Brother, Third Brother!"

The three generals shared the same heart and will, and their friendship deepened further.

The three generals began to dispatch soldiers, making various preparations for setting out early the next morning.

The next day.

Heavy fog.

Thick fog shrouded the mountains and rivers; grasses and trees were all swallowed by the white mist. The distant peaks loomed indistinctly, the outlines of the mountaintops blurred, seemingly ready to be completely devoured by the fog at any time.

The roadside grasses and trees drooped, wet dewdrops hanging on branches and leaves, gently swaying like silent whispers.

In the mist, even the sunlight of the rising sun appeared pale and powerless, as if everything had fallen into endless silence, vast and confused.

As the commander of the Golden Halberd Army, an important general of Twin Rivers Nation, Sun Gan was responsible for this march.

A messenger came to report: "Sir, General Liu Er of the Three Generals Camp sent someone to inquire whether we should suspend the march today due to the heavy fog."

Sun Gan sat upright in the command seat. Hearing this, he was stunned, then sneered: "A mere fog, how can it hinder the march? Ridiculous!"

After a while, Sun Gan ordered someone to ask: "As the vanguard, why hasn't the Three Generals Camp moved yet?"

Immediately, someone reported that the Three Generals Camp hadn't even finished dismantling their tents.

Sun Gan snorted coldly, extremely dissatisfied: "A bunch of useless people!"

The deputy general beside him said disdainfully: "The Three Generals Camp is a motley crew in the first place. The commander of the Barbarian Demon Camp, Xu Dali, at least is a man of the military, specializing in military tactics. But what are Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei? They dabble in some military tactics and think they can lead troops into battle. Simply ridiculous!"

Sun Gan: "Pass down the order: The Three Generals Camp is too slow in marching, violating military orders. Punish their main general Liu Er with thirty strikes of the large board. Record it first, and execute the military law when we reach Wooden Wheel Town."

"Order the Barbarian Demon Camp to take the lead as the vanguard!"

"The White Jade Camp will follow."

"My Golden Halberd Army will be in the center."

"Behind our army is the Red Flower Camp."

"The Three Generals Camp will bring up the rear."

"The whole army sets out!"

Sun Gan's punishment and questioning were immediately passed to the Three Generals Camp.

Ning Zhuo said guiltily: "According to my plan, I have implicated the Great General to be punished with thirty strikes. It's my fault."

But Liu Er immediately waved his hand: "A mere thirty strikes; I can bear it, it's no big deal."

"The Military Advisor is thinking for our Three Generals Camp; we all understand in our hearts."

"Let's not talk about it. Pass down the order: Let the whole army pack up properly, remain vigilant throughout the journey, do not slack off. Those who violate will be severely punished with sixty strikes of the large board!"
