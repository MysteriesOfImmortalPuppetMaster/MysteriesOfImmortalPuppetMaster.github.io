Chapter 773: Confucian Cultivator Destiny

Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng stood with their hands hanging by their sides in the hall.

Duanmu Zhang sat upright in the main seat, his expression gloomy as he stared at the two: "Nonsense!"

"For the sake of Ning Zhuo, you two actually set up two consecutive 'Rising Clouds Minor Trials'! Such acts of favoritism and cheating - where does this place the pure reputation of our Confucian school? Where does it place the laws and standards of the Myriad Manifestations Sect?"

Chu Xuangui had long anticipated that paper could not contain fire. He took a deep breath and cupped his hands: "Sir, please quell your anger. There are indeed reasons for this matter; it was not entirely out of favoritism."

"Firstly, it was at the request of Fellow Daoist Wen Ruanyu. Fellow Daoist Wen has a deep connection with Ning Zhuo, and his intention was to ensure this child's safety. We also acted out of moral obligation to help."

"Secondly, Ning Zhuo is the son of Meng Yaoyin. Although Meng Yaoyin was not a Confucian cultivator, she was better than most. She harbored benevolence and virtue, her loyalty and righteousness were unparalleled, and she sacrificed herself countless times for the Immortal City and the greater good."

"In Confucian studies, there is the classic saying: 'Treat the elderly of others as we treat our own elderly, and treat the young of others as we treat our own young.' If we meet an innocent person on the road, we would lend a hand. Senior Sister Meng's son has been wandering outside, enduring hardships. Now that he has returned, how can we sit idly by?"

Speaking to this point, Chu Xuangui looked at Song Taosheng.

Song Taosheng had an agreement with him long ago to share the pressure together. At this moment, he spoke up decisively, continuing: "Thirdly, this act is also a plan for our Confucian cultivator lineage!"

"This child, Ning Zhuo, possesses extraordinary potential. Observing his past conduct, one can tell he is not at all ordinary. Establishing good relations with him and protecting his growth will surely yield benefits in the future."

"Moreover, it concerns the immense interests of White Paper Immortal City..."

"Nowadays, within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, our Confucian cultivator group is declining day by day. If we can use this golden opportunity to intervene in such a game, it will be of major help to the spread of our Confucian teachings."

Duanmu Zhang looked at the two with cold eyes: "Your words are plausible, and you speak with confidence. Very good. I imagine you two have prepared for a long time."

He spread his hands: "However, even if there are a thousand reasons and ten thousand benefits, it is not a justification for you to disregard the rules and specially set up a minor trial!"

"If we make an exception for one person today, others will follow suit tomorrow! If this goes on, where is justice? Where is fairness? Would not the clear and upright wind of the Confucian school be reduced to a place of personal favors and exchanges of benefits? Do you know that once this precedent is set, the future troubles will be endless?"

He paused, then continued: "Furthermore, that Ning Zhuo is not a Confucian cultivator. Even if he is Meng Yaoyin's son, the foundation of his Daoist methods is not of the authentic Confucian school. The claim of him being 'one of our own' is forced."

Duanmu Zhang shook his head slowly.

Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng were speechless for a moment.

Duanmu Zhang was right. No matter how sufficient the reasons were, their actions were a violation of regulations; essentially, it was favoritism and cheating.

In the Rising Clouds Minor Trial of the Profound Armor Cave, Ban Jie planted ambushes to bribe others for the sake of Ban Ji - that was cheating. On this point, Ning Zhuo had cheated long ago.

The atmosphere in the hall was heavy. Just then, a stream of light flew in and landed precisely in Chu Xuangui's hand, transforming into a jade talisman.

If it were not an urgent matter, a jade talisman would not fly in at this moment.

Chu Xuangui hurriedly cupped his hands, asking Duanmu Zhang for instructions.

Duanmu Zhang raised his hand, signaling that it was fine and allowing Chu Xuangui to handle it immediately.

Chu Xuangui swept it with his divine sense, and a look of pleasant surprise, as well as the radiance of relief, appeared in his eyes.

"This is the latest intelligence regarding Ning Zhuo."

"He participated in the Rising Clouds Minor Trial of the Profound Armor Cave, eliminated Ban Ji, defeated three Golden Core cultivators, and successfully seized first place!"

"Here is the complete process of his breakthrough. Sir, please take a look."

"Oh? Let me see." Duanmu Zhang frowned slightly, wearing a look of scrutiny as he took the jade talisman and immersed his divine sense into it.

The stern expression on Duanmu Zhang's face gradually disintegrated. His severe gaze softened, and he even revealed a light of slight amazement.

Ning Zhuo's excellent performance - breaking through three stages in a row, winning against the strong while being weak, employing strategies, and bravely taking risks at critical moments - left a deep impression on Duanmu Zhang.

Especially...

In the first few confrontations of the second stage, Ning Zhuo practiced while learning, demonstrating extremely strong learning ability and revealing superb comprehension, which made it hard for Duanmu Zhang to forget.

He suddenly understood and thought to himself: "This child actually has such comprehension? Decisive in the moment, observing the fire clearly. No wonder that old fellow Zhong Dao values him."

Chu Xuangui had been observing his expression. Seeing the obvious change in Duanmu Zhang's demeanor, he instantly breathed a sigh of relief in his heart, thinking that Ning Zhuo's performance was quite timely.

He decisively seized the opportunity and spoke earnestly: "Sir, please see clearly! Although we designed two Rising Clouds Minor Trials out of private motives, throughout the entire trial process, there was absolutely no partiality! Ning Zhuo relied on his own ingenuity, intellect, knowledge, and other abilities to seize first place. He truly deserves it."

Duanmu Zhang remained silent. He watched the recording again, and Ning Zhuo's image became a few degrees deeper and more vivid in his heart.

"This child indeed has talent." Duanmu Zhang felt a love for talent rising within him, but at the same time, he felt a deep regret. "Why is he not a Confucian cultivator?"

Finally, he sighed almost inaudibly.

When he looked up at Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng again, there was no longer rebuke in his eyes, but rather a bit more understanding.

After weighing his words, Duanmu Zhang spoke with profound meaning: 

"Mencius - Teng Wen Gong Part I states: 'Ideally, if the people keep a mutual watch, assist each other in protection, and support each other in illness, the people will live in affection and harmony.'"

"Fellow disciples and fellow Daoists watching over and helping one another - this is the style of a gentleman."

"Since this good karma has been formed, it should indeed be maintained well. Although that Ning Zhuo is not a Confucian cultivator, his talent is promising, and his mother was benevolent and loving; it must be a family tradition. Since you have already acted, you must not give up halfway. Treat him with sincerity and interact with propriety, so that he knows the benevolence of our Confucian school and feels the friendship of fellow Daoists. This is not favoritism, but forming good ties and solidifying the foundation. You must... grasp the measure well and not give others cause for gossip."

Hearing this, the heavy stones in Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng's hearts fell to the ground. Both bowed deeply: "We will strictly follow Sir's teachings!"

Leaving the place, Chu Xuangui transmitted a thought via divine sense : "Our prediction was not wrong. A Righteous Path rising star and excellent junior like Ning Zhuo would inevitably be valued by Sir Duanmu."

Song Taosheng responded via divine sense : "It's good now. Our biggest worry is gone. We can support Ning Zhuo with even greater intensity."

Chu Xuangui said: "No, according to the previous plan, we still have to help him two more times consecutively!"

"With Sir Duanmu's permission, we can easily persuade other fellow Daoists."

Song Taosheng laughed loudly: "Correct! Since we are already helping in secret, let's do it to the extreme! The bigger this favor, the better."

Another Cave Dwelling.

Bai Jiyun and Kong Ran were exchanging what they had learned.

Bai Jiyun spoke slowly: "The Master said, 'Do not do unto others what you do not want done to yourself.' This is the foundation of the Way of Forgiveness (Shu). However, in my opinion, if one meets a tyrannical power, blindly retreating and enduring is perhaps not the way for a gentleman to establish himself. Repaying grievances with uprightness and repaying virtue with virtue - this manifests the essential meaning of combining hardness and softness."

Kong Ran nodded, then shook his head slightly: 

"Book of Rites - Qu Li states: 'Propriety demands reciprocity. It is not propriety to go and not come; nor is it propriety to come and not go.' The Master's Way of Forgiveness is not unprincipled retreat, but uses 'Propriety' (Li) as the measure. When encountering hegemony, one should respond with uprightness that conforms to 'Propriety' to make them know where to stop, rather than answering violence with violence and falling into the lower vehicle."

Bai Jiyun's eyes moved slightly, secretly admiring Kong Ran's family background; his understanding of Propriety was extremely deep, reflecting multiple classics.

Just as he was about to speak, a spiritual light penetrated the window lattice, hovered lightly over the book desk, and turned into a small, exquisite jade talisman.

The two successively probed with their divine sense, revealing looks of interest.

"Ning Zhuo defeated Ban Ji, haha." Kong Ran clapped his hands in praise.

Ning Zhuo had treated him to a meal, and in Kong Ran's eyes, he was already a friend. Conversely, although Ban Ji came from the Ban family, he cultivated the Demonic Path and had a history of notorious evil deeds. Kong Ran, as a Confucian cultivator, disliked him greatly.

He applauded the result of Ning Zhuo eliminating Ban Ji.

Bai Jiyun lowered the jade talisman slightly and carefully read the situation of Ning Zhuo's trial run. His tone carried a trace of complexity as he sighed: "Ning Zhuo is indeed not a Confucian cultivator. His move to eliminate Ban Ji manipulated the human heart and was filled with calculation. His sharpness was fully revealed, lacking the impartiality of 'Harmony is precious' in his conduct."

His temperament was lazy and unconstrained, very different from Ning Zhuo.

Kong Ran preferred the excitement: "Hehe, there's a good show to watch!"

"For genius figures like Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji, in which Flying Cloud Assembly do they not fight to the death?"

Hearing this, Bai Jiyun nodded in agreement: "True. Geniuses contending for supremacy has been so since ancient times. With the conflict between the two of them now, being incompatible like water and fire and having deep-seated grievances... I'm afraid that in the Rising Clouds Minor Trial at the Martial Arts Hall, a true life-and-death struggle will be unavoidable."

Kong Ran's eyes lit up, and he immediately followed up: "Speaking of the Martial Arts Hall, there is a wonderful agreed duel today."

"It's a pity that neither Situ Xing nor Zhu Fenxiang allowed it to be public, only inviting a limited number of people to spectate. We can't see it."

Bai Jiyun looked out the window as if seeing the future, his voice becoming a bit quieter: "The types of Rising Clouds Minor Trials over the years are numerous, and the significance of the top rank in each varies as greatly as heaven and earth."

"The weight of the top rank in the Profound Armor Cave is not light, but the Rising Clouds Minor Trial of the Martial Arts Hall carries even more weight!"

"There will definitely be geniuses dueling publicly, not just to make a name for themselves, but also to justify the names of the forces behind them."

"Just wait a bit longer. There won't be a shortage of such martial duels; we will see them one after another."

Duels in the Martial Arts Hall did not forbid a fight of life and death.

And life-and-death slaughter could better reveal a cultivator's true nature, courage, and most authentic combat power.

The geniuses standing at the storm's edge were the face and future of their respective Sects and families. On one hand, they enjoyed the glory of being watched by the masses; on the other hand, they also shouldered burdens and expectations that allowed no retreat.

They could not retreat.

Kong Ran calculated the time and muttered: "It's already the Hour of the Sheep (1 PM - 3 PM). Is the battle between Situ Xing and Zhu Fenxiang not over yet? I'm looking forward to the result of this duel and have already bought the intelligence from the Trade Hall in advance. Eh?"

As Kong Ran spoke, he used his divine sense to quickly check Ning Zhuo's trial run again, and was slightly stunned.

"Ning Zhuo's learning speed, and his comprehension - isn't it a bit exaggerated?"

"Wait a moment."

Kong Ran naturally thought of the transaction he had almost reached with Ning Zhuo before.

"Ning Zhuo said he had a friend who, like me, possessed the Early Wisdom Innate Talent."

"So, he previously wanted the Understanding Pen to trade with me for methods centered around the Early Wisdom Innate Talent."

"Looking at it now, this learning ability of his is also very likely that exact Innate Talent. Could that 'friend' he mentioned back then be himself?"

Kong Ran hid this guess in his heart and couldn't help but feel tempted.

"Before, I proposed the transaction to Father, but Father ruthlessly rejected it."

"But now, if it concerns Ning Zhuo himself, would Father agree?"

"With a genius like Ning Zhuo, backed by powerful forces, he will definitely be a strong figure in the future. For my clan to maintain a good relationship with such a strong figure is also mutually beneficial."

"This weight should not be light... Yes! I'll find a chance to write a letter to Father!"

Kong Ran was still thinking about the Understanding Pen.

Pivot Cave Dwelling.

From the Nine-Fold Profound Armor, seven-colored brilliance dispersed, splendid like aurora and silky smooth like satin.

This was the external manifestation of true intent and principles.

The seven-colored brilliance crossed mid-air and finally merged into Ning Zhuo's body.

Ning Zhuo frowned tightly. At this moment, his back was drenched in sweat, his body swayed slightly, and his face was like gold paper; he was about to reach some kind of limit.

"The Dao of the Pivot!"

"The control of mechanical constructs should not be limited to the external - restricted to strings, hanging threads, spiritual energy, divine sense, and so on - but should allow them to have their own core of circulation and autonomy of regulation..."

One of the results of this concept was the Profound Soldier Armor.

When Qingwu Langjun instilled the true intent of his own mechanism arts into Ning Zhuo, he inevitably transmitted the mechanism concepts contained within the Profound Soldier Armor to Ning Zhuo as well.

Although there were no explicit blueprints or refining methods, Ning Zhuo's ability had already passed the test. Given time, he would definitely be able to imitate and build it!

However, Qingwu Langjun did not care about this point.

If He achieved the status of Martial God and advanced further, He could employ more efficient measures to gather the martial understandings of his believers. This would be much more efficient than the Profound Soldier Armor.

To Him, the Profound Soldier Armor was no longer a core interest.

If Ning Zhuo were to build the Profound Soldier Armor himself, it would be a mutually beneficial thing. The forces of the Profound Armor Cave would wish for everyone to use the Profound Soldier Armor.

The seven-colored brilliance in the air slowly dissipated.

Ning Zhuo opened his eyes, revealing a state of exhaustion.

Qingwu Langjun was greatly satisfied with him. The three paths were completely cleared, waiting only for Him to make massive progress in the Martial Dao.

Regarding Ning Zhuo, Qingwu Langjun appreciated him more the longer He looked: "Now I am certain that you really are a Mechanism cultivator. Artifact Refining, the Military Path, and Mechanism - among these three true intents and principles, the one you absorbed the fastest was Mechanism."

Ning Zhuo stood up and bowed in thanks: "This young one thanks the Lord, I am grateful to the core!"

Qingwu Langjun shook his head slightly: "It was you who helped Me. Without a unique body like yours, it would have been extremely troublesome for Me to achieve such a result."

"You may leave."

"The Rising Clouds Minor Trial is a major opportunity for you. There is no need to delay any longer here with Me."

"In the future, when you join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, we can have a good talk."

"Take this jade token. From now on, you can hold it to enter and exit the Pivot Cave Dwelling and see Me directly."

Ning Zhuo's heart relaxed, sighing at how reasonable Qingwu Langjun was, and he took the opportunity to bid farewell and retreat.

"Artifact Refining Renowned Artisan level, Military Artisan level, Mechanism Master level!"

"Earned big, earned big!"

These were all unexpected gains.

Ning Zhuo could not help but sigh: "First there was Qing Huangzi, then Qingwu Langjun... These are the two highest returns I've had participating in the Rising Clouds Minor Trials. Looking at it this way, perhaps Ban Ji is my lucky star?"

"Aside from my realm soaring, I also have three principles added to my body. My physical body can actually achieve such a level! The urgent task is to return to my cave dwelling and study this carefully."
