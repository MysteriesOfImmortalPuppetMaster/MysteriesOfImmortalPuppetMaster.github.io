Chapter 771: Realm Begins to Soar

Ning Zhuo, dressed in white, looked clean and refreshed as he stepped into the cave abode.

Before meeting Lord Qingwu, he had already received treatment and had been arranged to take a bath.

The layout deep inside the cave abode was quite simple; it was almost empty, save for a bronze suit of armor enshrined on a profound altar.

The armor plates of this suit were quite heavy, the green copper resembling moss traces, and distributed across it were some scars from sabers and axes.

Its style was clearly not of current fashion, exuding an aura as dignified as a mountain and as ancient as a river.

Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, the bronze armor emitted a faint white light. Within the white light, a figure floated out from the interior of the armor.

His appearance was that of a middle-aged male cultivator, with a majestic eight-foot frame and muscles knotting and bulging. His face seemed carved by wind and frost, with angular features, and his short beard on his lower jaw resembled short bronze halberds.

His eyes revealed a deep azure light as his gaze fell upon Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo immediately felt a cold sharpness, like that of a weapon, from this gaze.

Ning Zhuo bowed in salute: "Junior Ning Zhuo pays respects to the Lord!"

He was well-versed in intelligence and naturally understood that the deity before him was the supreme leader of the Profound Armor Cave, having transformed from an artifact spirit into a god.

Lord Qingwu retracted his gaze and spoke indifferently: "No need for formalities."

He continued: "This god has watched the recording of your trial; your performance can be described as stunning."

"At first, your strength was meager, and no one favored you, but relying on aptitude surpassing ordinary people, you learned while practicing and ultimately achieved first place. It was truly brilliant."

"You were able to create battle formations, plan before acting while surrounded by enemies, and borrow strength to break through situations... Your strategy, character, and comprehension are all top-tier choices. Obtaining the top rank this time is well-deserved."

"I believe that once this result spreads, you will once again make a name for yourself within the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

Ning Zhuo responded: "The God Lord overpraises me. This junior is terrified; it was merely some trivial wit. I moved with the momentum and mostly had good luck. I dare not accept such high praise."

"You can bear it." Lord Qingwu's blue eyes turned slightly. "You are also aware that the purpose of the Profound Armor Cave holding the Rising Cloud Minor Trial is to distribute the Profound Weapon Armors to suitable cultivators as much as possible."

"The reward for the first place in every Rising Cloud Minor Trial at the Profound Armor Cave is based on this, so the rewards are usually similar each time."

"But this time..." Lord Qingwu changed the subject, "The reward is different."

He stared at Ning Zhuo: "I will grant you three True Intents, and furthermore strip the corresponding principles, injecting them all into your body!"

Ning Zhuo: ?!

He widened his eyes in disbelief, looking up at Lord Qingwu, feeling as if he had misheard.

He knew the weight of "True Intent" all too well!

Previously, the Five Elements God Lord had taught him the profundities of the Five Elements, which was to instill his own Five Elements True Intent into him.

Ning Zhuo's Five Elements realm skyrocketed because of this, so much so that when he traveled the world afterward, he benefited countless times from the Five Elements realm, which brought him immense help.

Now, this ancient deity also wanted to instill his True Intent, as well as principles, into him?

Ning Zhuo frowned, unable to figure out this point.

The main reason he participated in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial was to intercept Ban Ji. When the time came, he also strove for first place.

Regarding the first-place reward, he knew the intelligence well and didn't have much expectation in his heart.

He absolutely never expected that the reward for first place this time would be so generous!

After the surprise came doubt.

Ning Zhuo carefully weighed his words and spoke slowly: "The Lord grants a heavy gift, this junior is... overwhelmed by the favor!"

"True Intent is precious; this junior can still do his utmost to carry and comprehend a thing or two. But these 'principles'... this junior is only at the Foundation Establishment cultivation level, with a humble soul and a frail physical body. How can I bear the weight of this heaven and earth?"

Ning Zhuo was confident about the instillation of True Intent.

But having principles added to his body was another matter entirely. This was similar to Artifact Refining; cultivators constantly hammer the artifact embryo, and while shaping it, they also forcefully add various types of principles.

When cultivators set up formations or inscribe talismans on an artifact embryo, they are adding all sorts of principles to it, endowing the final product with various powers and profound uses.

The tempered artifact embryo is forged from various precious materials and is usually an inanimate object that cannot feel pain. But a cultivator's physical body is living. To have principles added to the body is equivalent to treating the cultivator's physical body as an artifact embryo and performing Artifact Refining on it.

This is not only excruciatingly painful, but the more terrifying consequences range from disordered cultivation to the destruction of the physical body and stepping into a realm of doom.

True Intent instillation is comprehended with the heart; it tests one's enlightenment and belongs to the mind's understanding.

Principles added to the body is a somatic experience; the core point is whether the physical body can support it, belonging to the body's understanding.

Examples of principles added to the body can be found everywhere. The vast majority of magic treasures and magical artifacts fall into this category. They are all inanimate objects and cannot comprehend principles, but the principles engraved on them allow them to have various effects.

The same goes for the Profound Weapon Armors.

They are used by cultivators, and during the process of use, they record the principles of many martial arts. Therefore, even if these Profound Weapon Armors leave their original owners, they can still execute past martial arts moves and so on by themselves.

Ning Zhuo had confidence in his own comprehension and leaned more towards True Intent instillation. But as for principles added to the body, he did not want it.

Lord Qingwu shook his head slightly.

Ning Zhuo had two attitudes towards True Intent and principles, but Lord Qingwu needed Ning Zhuo to carry both of them over.

He needed to purify his own Dao Path!

Then he had to discard the other three paths.

Normal cultivators actively choose one path during their cultivation and do not get overly involved in other paths. Lord Qingwu's background was very special; He was an artifact spirit.

The Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor itself originated from the Machine Sect; the main body was forged using the skills of Artifact Refining and Mechanisms, while also containing the principles of the Military Strategist and Martial Sects.

The Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor has survived to this day. The Flying Cloud Assembly and many more Rising Cloud Minor Trials have allowed many cultivators to possess their own Profound Weapon Armors. And after these Profound Weapon Armors fed back into the Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor's main body, it continuously accumulated in these four aspects.

Lord Qingwu had no way to choose; He could only passively accumulate.

Once He possessed the status of a god, the majority of these accumulations became burdens.

And to throw away these burdens, He had to discard both the True Intent and the principles simultaneously.

Lord Qingwu persuaded Ning Zhuo: "There is no need to worry too much, Ning Zhuo. Others cannot do it, but you can."

Ning Zhuo was stunned. Meeting Lord Qingwu's azure eyes, he felt the other party's certainty. It was a confidence far stronger than his own.

"Why? On what basis?" Ning Zhuo's face was written full of such doubts.

Lord Qingwu's gaze flickered slightly, and with a low voice, He recounted a past event to Ning Zhuo.

"Twelve years ago, I was trapped in a bottleneck on the divine path and secretly visited a demon cultivator proficient in divination. That person was known as the 'Mystic Master Dunjia'..."

Ning Zhuo listened carefully, his expression changing indefinitely.

When Lord Qingwu finished his statement, Ning Zhuo frowned even tighter: "So, I am your 'Fated Person', Lord?"

Lord Qingwu nodded: "I myself was somewhat skeptical. However, twelve years have passed, the time for the divination has arrived, the top name has been decided, and you have actively appeared before Me."

"The Mystic Master calculated that you are naturally gifted, with flourishing Qi Luck, far beyond comparable to ordinary people! As for borrowing your body to perform this method of 'True Intent stripping, Dao Principle addition'... The Mystic Master asserted that you can withstand it!"

"As for True Intent, you should know that this is also a huge opportunity for you."

"As for principles added to the body, why don't I try a little first? Just a slight test. If it cannot be done, stopping in time will suffice."

Ning Zhuo frowned in thought and asked Sun Lingtong in his heart.

The Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability allowed Ning Zhuo to communicate secretly even in front of Lord Qingwu.

Inside the Rinse Jade Study, Sun Lingtong shrugged: "The suggestion this Lord made is very good. Even if some principles are added to your body, at worst I'll help you remove them in the future."

"The foundation of the Profound Armor Cave's power lies in the Myriad Manifestations Sect. He also needs to abide by the sect's rules, so if He wants to harm you, He will face severe punishment from the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect."

"He has also been frank about these reasons; his sincerity is obvious."

Sun Lingtong's view was very similar to Ning Zhuo's.

"Mystic Master Dunjia calculated that I am the fated person. If this matter is not false, I should have the ability to bear these principles!" Ning Zhuo had the experience of the White Paper Immortal City, which added a lot of confidence out of thin air.

After resting slightly, Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on the rush cushion, sitting opposite the main body of the Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor.

Before transmitting, Lord Qingwu spoke solemnly: "My comprehension in the three paths of the Military Strategist, Artifact Refining, and Mechanisms are all in here. Receive them well!"

Buzz - !

The mottled and heavy bronze armor suddenly shone brightly, no longer dull, erupting with blinding azure-gold divine light!

Ancient runes on the armor plates revealed themselves, like hundreds of millions of swimming tadpoles, moving rapidly and colliding with each other. Countless collisions sparked thousands of sparks.

A massive True Intent sprayed out because of this, carrying an invisible impact force that caused Ning Zhuo's upper body to sway, almost falling backward.

Ning Zhuo felt like a stone thrown into an incomparably huge grinding pan that was being stirred.

The initial feeling was complexity and chaos, overwhelming to the point of near suffocation.

At the same time, images of tens of thousands of different ores, spirit wood, bone materials, beast hides, demon blood, and other precious materials flew past his eyes, fluttering like snowflakes.

Hammers, tongs, anvils, files, tweezers, carving knives, furnaces... and other Artifact Refining tools were mixed within.

The most basic and shallow Artifact Refining techniques surged like seawater, directly flooding Ning Zhuo's divine sea like viewing flowers from a galloping horse.

Ning Zhuo was dazzled, his spirit highly concentrated, and with a slightly nervous emotion, he rapidly received this stream of True Intent.

He had experience, and his learning and comprehension abilities had already been greatly improved, so much so that he was handling it with ease at this moment.

"Good comprehension!" Lord Qingwu praised in his heart. "Next is the injection of principles."

Thus, in the next moment, Ning Zhuo's body felt a sensation.

His whole body's skin seemed to be experiencing the friction of various materials - the rough coldness of ores, the warmth of spirit wood, the residual heat of scorched metal, the sticky slipperiness of demon blood...

His nasal cavity was filled with the smells of sulfur, charcoal, molten metal, herbal juices, and various other scents; some fragrant, some rich, some bitter, some pungent...

His ears were filled with the roar of furnace fire, the striking of metal, the cracking of materials, the low humming of artifact embryos...

He felt it as if it were happening to himself!

Lord Qingwu slowly stopped, his eyes twinkling with light of joy: "You really are my opportunity!"

This was what both sides had agreed upon: try the cultivation first and see the effect.

The first attempt was a huge success!

"In just a short moment, my Artifact Refining realm has already reached the peak of the apprentice level!" Ning Zhuo rejoiced in his heart; he was not very surprised by his absorption and comprehension of the True Intent.

What surprised him was his physical body.

"The principles added to my body can actually be perfectly withstood, and they even mesh with the relevant True Intent, helping me understand more profoundly from a somatic perspective!"

"This is really amazing!"

Sun Lingtong had been paying close attention to the situation here.

Upon learning this at this moment, he immediately shouted: "Little Zhuo, your body has unique mysteries. Under normal circumstances, having these principles added to the body is like refining a flesh and blood body as a magic treasure. It would be strange not to be injured!"

"I originally estimated that you would suffer some minor injuries."

"But the result is like this. How strange!"

Ning Zhuo pondered: "Could this be related to my second innate talent?"

He carefully checked his body again and found that his muscles were just tight all over, and he had only broken into a thin layer of sweat.

"How does it feel?" Lord Qingwu asked.

Ning Zhuo's eyes shone: "Excellent. Please continue, Lord."

Lord Qingwu smiled slightly and immediately acted again.

True Intent instillation, principles added to the body; Ning Zhuo's foundation was expanding at an inconceivable magnitude, skyrocketing exaggeratedly every minute and second!

In another cave abode.

Ban Ji's expression changed slightly.

Ban Jie was discussing the next plan of action with him, and seeing his expression change, he immediately asked.

Ban Ji shook his head slowly, subconsciously covering his chest with his hand: "Just at that moment, I suddenly felt empty, as if an important treasure had been snatched away by someone."

Speaking of this, Ban Ji couldn't help but laugh: "It's just an illusion, not worth mentioning."

Hearing this, Ban Jie's heart sank, and she couldn't help but think of the Profound Armor Cave: "Although the first place reward of the Profound Armor Cave is generous, it's just so-so. What would truly be helpful to Ban Ji should be something else. But what exactly it is, there is no way to investigate now. Sigh..."

Ban Jie sighed in her heart, but on the surface, she was calm as the clouds and wind: "Even if Ning Zhuo gets the first place reward, it's nothing much."

"Ban Ji, our failure this time does not harm the overall situation."

"The family has increased its efforts even more and is about to send a bottle of Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pills."

Ban Ji immediately raised his eyebrows, revealing a look of surprise: "What? This kind of precious pill can improve my physical foundation and greatly reduce the difficulty when I overcome the outbreak of the Myriad Puppet Demon Monster."

"The family has finally collected this type of medicinal pill; I've mentioned it countless times before."

Speaking of this, Ban Ji took out a set of Profound Weapon Armor.

This Profound Weapon Armor was exactly what he had refined from the copper lake; it was a reward that every cultivator could obtain after clearing the third level.

As for the Profound Weapon Armors they "subdued" in the second level, those were treasures of the Profound Armor Cave and were only temporarily lent to the cultivators attempting the trials.

Ban Ji looked at the Profound Weapon Armor in his hand: "If I had known there was the Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pill, why would I have gone to beg for some Profound Weapon Armor?"

The reason why the Myriad Puppet Demon Monster immortal talent outbreak put Ban Ji in danger was that the principles of Mechanisms and the Strange Path added to his body were difficult for Ban Ji to bear.

After refining the Profound Weapon Armor, it was equivalent to being one entity. This gave Ban Ji more empty space to carry the principles.

The Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pill, on the other hand, was an auxiliary medicinal pill that could harmonize the principles on a cultivator's physical body and arrange them reasonably.

If the help brought to Ban Ji by the Profound Weapon Armor was one, then the help from the Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pill was at least fifty!

With the Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pill, Ban Ji immediately looked down on the Profound Weapon Armor a bit.

Ban Jie knew the truth but sighed again in his heart: "The family had collected this type of pill long ago, but for the grand plan of stimulating the Royal Mandate, they kept it withheld and unused."

"But in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, the Human Tribulation was fierce, and Ban Ji was defeated again. After the family used the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain to calculate, they figured out that they must strengthen Ban Ji, otherwise his prospects would be dim and lightless, let alone stimulating the Royal Mandate."

"Only then did they fetch the pills and send them over."

Ban Jie thought of Ning Zhuo: "I wonder what he will obtain?"

"Some opportunities that are of great benefit to Ban Ji may not necessarily be suitable for others."

"It might even be a disaster rather than a blessing."

Ban Jie comforted herself, but couldn't help her thoughts drifting: "But Ban Ji's loss just now is probably not an illusion."

"And with this failure, Ban Ji's Qi Luck has fallen sharply, and he can only consume precious pills to make up for it."

"Will Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck soar?"
