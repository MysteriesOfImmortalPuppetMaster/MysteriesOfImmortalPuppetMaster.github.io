Chapter 701: Demonic Arts Truly Aren't for Me

Realizing that mastering this technique required gradual refinement, Ning Zhuo decided there was no need to rush. He ended the cultivation session.

Qing Chi, reluctant to part, pressed him about when their next session would be. When she learned they would be held daily, her face lit up with genuine joy.

Ning Zhuo reminded her to practice diligently what she had learned today and to keep the Mechanical Puppet's talisman learning strictly confidential. Qing Chi nodded emphatically and swore an oath.

Ning Zhuo naturally trusted her implicitly.

Among those he trusted, Sun Lingtong held the undisputed top position, his status unshakeable. Qing Chi ranked second, followed by Gongsun Yan and then Old Chef.

Gongsun Yan's reliance on Ning Zhuo created a natural foundation of trust, surpassing that of Old Chef. Old Chef and Wen Ruanyu shared a similar level of trust; the former was driven by gratitude, while the latter held Meng Yao Yin Yue in deep reverence.

Ning Zhuo placed Snow-Colored Maiden Hui in the cultivation chamber, instructing her to continue practicing talisman creation. Each successful attempt, even without competition, filled her with pride.

Ning Zhuo had confirmed that as long as external interference was minimal, Mechanical Puppets like Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, once they mastered a talisman, would achieve a 100% success rate in subsequent attempts!

"But the talismans she produces are all Low-Grade."

"There's still immense room for improvement."

Crafting talismans is similar to alchemy, with distinct grades. Cultivators with profound talisman-making skills have a far greater chance of producing High-Grade talismans compared to ordinary practitioners.

In this regard, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui revealed a weakness inherent to Mechanical Puppets - she could only guarantee the bare minimum, the production of Low-Grade talismans.

Ning Zhuo remained unperturbed. "Crafting talismans is also about understanding spells and other techniques. For instance, if I focus solely on Five Elements talismans and achieve sufficient mastery, I'll likely be able to produce High-Grade ones."

"Of course, this is limited to Foundation Establishment-level talismans."

While Golden Core-level talismans could also be crafted, Ning Zhuo's cultivation level restricted his success rate, resulting in mostly Low-Grade products.

Naturally, this was also due to his current talisman-making skills.

As his proficiency improved, both the quality and success rate of crafting talismans beyond his cultivation level would increase dramatically.

For cultivators who had mastered Grandmaster-level techniques, crafting talismans one level above their cultivation was commonplace!

After settling Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, Ning Zhuo retrieved the Snow Pivot Imperial Art: Repose for inspection.

Divine Art: Life Hanging by a Thread!

Ning Zhuo quickly confirmed that Snow Pivot Imperial Art: Repose had not yet reached the Spirit Resonance Stage. Based on his assessment, it still had some distance to go.

He couldn't help but compare it to Yuan Dasheng, leading him to speculate further: "The progress of spiritual energy seems to be related to one's Innate Talent!"

"Yuan Dasheng possesses Immortal-Grade Righteous Bone, Golden Resilience, which explains why his emotions were so intense during the Spirit Resonance Stage, allowing him to pass through it quickly."

"Ning Xiaohui has Superior-Grade Heavenly Gift: Ice-Jade Hands. Once she entered the Puppet Body, she swiftly reached the Spirit Resonance Stage. Her emotions weren't as intense, requiring more time to express them, but the process was more stable."

"Ning Xie's Innate Talent is only low-grade: Snow Soul Ice Spirit. It will likely take her even longer to reach the Spirit Resonance Stage."

"How can I accelerate her progress?"

"Should I use a Mechanism Body better suited to the Snow Soul Ice Spirit?"

Ning Zhuo's thoughts drifted further.

"This brings us to another critical question: How to cultivate spiritual energy!"

"Could I find relevant scriptures within the Myriad Manifestations Sect?"

"Would directly searching for secrets related to spiritual energy be considered taboo? If noticed by someone with ulterior motives, what would be the specific risks?"

Ning Zhuo had long been aware of the immense danger hidden within his Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra. If exposed, his situation would become extremely precarious.

The Spiritual Discourse incident had already been a risky venture. Delving deeper would only invite powerful enemies, a disastrous outcome.

"We need a more cautious approach."

"It's best if I stay out of this and let the boss handle it."

"His disguise skills are far superior to mine!"

When Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong ventured out, they had agreed on a clear division of labor: Ning Zhuo would operate openly, while Sun Lingtong would work in the shadows.

Given the nature of this task, Sun Lingtong was the more suitable choice. His skills were better suited for this kind of operation.

Ning Zhuo sheathed his Snow Pivot Imperial Art: Repose and used Life Hanging by a Thread to contact Sun Lingtong, informing him of the plan.

Sun Lingtong immediately agreed without hesitation. "Alright, I'm on board. We just need to find the relevant texts first. Perhaps it would be easier to teleport to an Immortal City and purchase them directly from the All-Book Pavilion."

Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered. "Every Immortal City is heavily guarded, making it easy to leave traces. If we're going that route, we might as well stay in White Paper Immortal City. They have an All-Book Pavilion right here."

Sun Lingtong shook his head, disagreeing. "No! We have assets there too. The Qing-Jiao Army is under our control, and the current White Paper City Lord owes us a favor. Though it was a stroke of luck, we risked our lives to establish that foundation."

"Even if things don't work out in the Southern Bean Kingdom, this place will be a major fallback for us."

"Don't take risks in White Paper Immortal City. Even rabbits don't eat the grass near their burrows."

Sun Lingtong, with his deeply ingrained thieving instincts, was highly sensitive to the security arrangements of safe houses.

Ning Zhuo was persuaded. "You're right. We'll look for another opportunity later. Spirit Cultivation isn't an urgent matter right now."

"Boss, how's your research on the Demonic Talisman from the Tiger Demon's corpse going? And what about the Academy Notes Shen Xi gave us?"

Earlier, during their secret exchange, Ning Zhuo had handed over both items to Sun Lingtong for research.

Ning Zhuo had also told Sun Lingtong the full story of his feud with Pi Fujie.

Sun Lingtong: "I've studied the Demonic Talisman. It matches the intelligence we have: the Pi Family uses cultivators' skin as material, employing techniques from Papercraft Art to carve talismans."

"Since these talismans must be inscribed on living bodies, they can't use conventional materials."

"That's why they chose souls as their primary ingredient. The closer the soul's type and attributes are to the talisman's target, the better the talisman will align with its intended purpose."

"The two Demonic Talismans - one for enhanced defense and the other for comprehensive speed enhancement - also align with the intelligence you provided."

"However, they all employ unconventional talisman techniques, forming seamless wholes that make it difficult to find an entry point for comprehension."

"Even with the aid of the Luoshu pages, I'm struggling."

Sun Lingtong paused, then shifted the topic. "On the other hand, I've been making rapid progress with Shen Xi's Academy Notes on the Nine Palaces Formation, thanks to the Luoshu pages."

"I've already grasped over half of the content. Shall I teach you?"

If Shen Xi were here, he would be astonished. Sun Lingtong's aptitude for array formation was truly exceptional.

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "I'd rather study it myself first and absorb some of the Luoshu pages' essence. Once I have some results, I'll discuss it with you, Elder Brother."

Given enough time, Ning Zhuo preferred to delve into things independently, honing his comprehension skills. Sun Lingtong had reminded him of this back on Hidden Mist Mountain.

Ning Zhuo was an obedient and diligent student, always keeping Sun Lingtong's guidance firmly in mind and actively putting it into practice.

Hearing Ning Zhuo's choice, Sun Lingtong nodded approvingly in the Jade Rinse Pavilion.

After ending the communication, Ning Zhuo began his daily cultivation.

He first activated the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat to temper his physical body. The oppressive force exerted by the million souls on his flesh had already been reduced by more than half.

The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat remained his primary focus, with Old Chef's Spirit Food serving only as a supplementary aid.

Ning Zhuo then resumed contemplating the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.

He remained dissatisfied with his progress in comprehending this cultivation art, though each session yielded some insights.

Currently, he was stuck at the Lower Dantian of the Essence Sea stage of the Phenomenal Seed Talisman phase.

"By nature, I am kind-hearted and a true practitioner of the Righteous Path. I possess a natural aptitude for Buddhist Dharma and have always found joy in helping others."

"For the sake of the innocent citizens of White Paper Immortal City, I risked my life to fight the Soul Formation-level Forgetful River Prefecture Lord."

"With such a disposition, this Demonic Art truly doesn't suit me!"

"Alas, the Red Flower Seal persists. If Lin You could provide another Demonic Art, it might offer some reference points."

"Perhaps I should acquire some Demonic Arts outside the Myriad Manifestations Sect. I'll have Elder Brother handle that..."

Ning Zhuo held high expectations for Lin You. Having witnessed the Lord of the Demonic Heart Cave's methods firsthand, he felt strongly that this art could prove helpful.

However, he had no particular feelings about other Demonic Arts.

Surely some Demonic Arts must contain principles similar to the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.

But here lay the problem.

On one hand, Ning Zhuo had no idea how to select these Demonic Arts. This would inevitably require a tremendous amount of time and effort.

He couldn't delegate this task to anyone else, as it concerned his core cultivation art.

On the other hand, the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art was a top-tier cultivation art. Any comparable cultivation art would also be of extremely high quality and correspondingly expensive.

Even without checking the prices, Ning Zhuo knew that acquiring these cultivation arts would cost a fortune.

With his current low status, he certainly wouldn't qualify to purchase them from the All-Book Pavilion.

This presented another layer of difficulty.

The situation would be the same within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

Ning Zhuo estimated that he would need to become at least a Golden Core True Disciple before he might have a chance to obtain cultivation arts of this caliber.

This also indirectly highlighted the immense value of the Lava Immortal Palace.

Meng Yaoyin's dying words to the two-year-old Ning Zhuo, urging him to seize this opportunity, were not without reason.

After cultivating for two days, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong secretly met again.

Ning Zhuo retrieved the Tiger Demon's corpse and Shen Xi's Academy Notes Jade Slip.

Sun Lingtong had already processed the Tiger Demon's corpse, skinning it, removing its tendons, and disassembling its organs, flesh, and bones. These could be sold or used as ingredients for future alchemy and crafting.

The soul of the Material Tiger Demon, skilled in crafting artifacts, arranging formations, creating talismans, and building mechanisms, was securely sealed within a talisman.

This talisman, known as the Soul-Dwelling Talisman, was a talisman-making technique developed by the Soul Devouring Sect. After Ning Zhuo acquired nearly all of Tian Shuang's wealth, he discovered a vast collection of Soul Cultivator manuals among his possessions.

Sun Lingtong, who typically concealed himself within the Mechanical Dragon, used his spare time to study these texts while honing his cultivation. The Soul-Dwelling Talisman was relatively simple, so he learned it with ease.

"This talisman can only temporarily store souls," Sun Lingtong cautioned. "If kept too long, the soul may dissipate, become fragmented, and degrade in quality."

Tian Shuang's original possessions included jade bottles for storing souls, but Ning Zhuo had already used them as resources to build his army. Neither Ning Zhuo nor Sun Lingtong regretted this decision.

Such Magic Artifacts and magic treasures were merely auxiliary tools, and they belonged to Tian Shuang. Re-sacrificing them would have been time-consuming. The Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts were no ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators!

Moreover, the grand plan for the Qingjiao Military Pass concerned life and death, making full commitment essential.

Ning Zhuo nodded. "The upcoming military exercises will likely yield more souls. We should prepare some soul-storing jade bottles in advance."

"But as a member of the Righteous Path, it's not convenient for me to purchase them openly."

Sun Lingtong chuckled, eagerly chiming in, "It's just a small matter. I'll handle the purchase."

Ning Zhuo nodded enthusiastically. "Mm-hmm!"

The Tiger Demon's corpse had been properly disposed of, leaving the tiger skin as its most valuable remnant.

The skin bore both the Burning Blood Surge Talisman and the Thousand-Layer Scale Skin Talisman, and remained remarkably intact. With a simple infusion of spiritual energy, it could still be activated.

This was largely thanks to Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's freezing kill, which had preserved the Tiger Demon's corpse in perfect condition.

"So, this counts as a Magic Artifact," Ning Zhuo mused, channeling spiritual energy into the skin. The tiger skin rapidly expanded, coalescing into a lifelike form that dropped to the ground, stood upright, and transformed into the shape of a Tiger Demon.

The skin was so lifelike, it seemed as if the Tiger Demon had been resurrected.

"Papercraft Art..." Ning Zhuo realized, sensing the profound techniques of Papercraft Art within it.

After all, he had encountered the Profound Primordial Scholar's secret army of Paper People hidden in the Underworld.

In stark contrast to the Paper People's plain, unadorned appearance, this tiger skin radiated intense blood Qi and demonic Qi, its aura far more pronounced and its power fully unleashed.

"My mother was also skilled in Papercraft Art, but she left me no related texts."

"If the Paper Giant from White Paper Immortal City hadn't been burned down, I'd have a new Nascent Soul-level combatant at my disposal. What a pity!"

"If I ever get the chance, I'd like to learn Papercraft Art myself."

In truth, Ning Zhuo wanted to learn everything.

With sufficient spiritual energy, a Tiger Demon Zha Pi could wield the combat power of a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator. This served as a supplementary, albeit somewhat dispensable, addition to Ning Zhuo's combat capabilities.

Ning Zhuo stored them all in his Storage Belt, then retrieved Shen Xi's Academy Jade Slip and began studying it intently.

According to Sun Lingtong, he had already deciphered most of the Jade Slip's contents. The Shen Family of Nine Palaces Immortal City indeed possessed considerable unique knowledge. However, the truly valuable insights remained untouched within the Jade Slip.

Sun Lingtong had warned Ning Zhuo, "This is likely the bait Shen Xi left for you."

Ning Zhuo had already anticipated this, responding with a faint smile.

As he delved into his studies, he quickly lost track of time.

Only when his mind grew hazy did he realize that half a day had already passed.

Ning Zhuo gazed at the Jade Slip in his hand, a wry smile spreading across his face. "Even with the Academy Notes' extensive annotations and explanations, I can only grasp about thirty percent of the content."

"And that's with the aid of the Luoshu pages."

"Senior Brother's mastery of formation arts is far greater than I previously imagined."

First, Ning Zhuo had been humbled by Qing Chi's innate talent for talisman crafting, then he had marveled at Sun Lingtong's comprehension of formation arts, leaving him feeling inadequate.

If Shen Xi were to learn of this, he would undoubtedly feel both astonishment and shame. Even with the Luoshu pages' assistance, Ning Zhuo's demonstrated comprehension had already left him far behind.
