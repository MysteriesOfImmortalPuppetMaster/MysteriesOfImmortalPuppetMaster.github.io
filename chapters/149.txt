Chapter 149: All Are Resources

Sun Lingtong did not intercept in advance but left the preparation room, heading straight into the depths.

Ning Zhuo was not by his side now, so Sun Lingtong was like an unregistered resident, unable to claim any rewards or open the door

Thus, Sun Lingtong waited for Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng to push open the door first, then squeezed in afterward.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit saw this and ground its teeth in anger!

Meng Chong led the charge, breaking through the second and third barriers, bringing sixteen similar puppets into the preparation room.

In an instant, the speedrun, progress, and Qi Refining rankings were filled with names.

The rankings only recorded the top ten, leaving many others in the teens, unqualified to be listed.

Ning Zhuo exhaled a breath of turbid air, feeling a slight joy in his heart.

This way, when he entered the preparation room in the future, it would be perfectly reasonable for his name not to be on the list.

If the rankings had been empty before, his absence would have been a huge flaw!

Using the enemy, Ning Zhuo resolved this hidden danger.

"Charge, charge, charge!" Meng Chong advanced fiercely.

With him leading the way, the sixteen puppets behind him remained unscathed, lying flat all the way to Room Nine.

"Finally here." Sun Lingtong hid in a corner, camouflaged with multiple layers, showcasing the Void Sect's disguise skills.

Sun Lingtong peered through two small holes, observing the outside world.

Boom, boom, boom...

Meng Chong laughed heartily, engaging in a fierce battle with Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng.

He had fought his way through, finally discovering his target, his fighting spirit soaring, electric light swirling around him, fighting with great enthusiasm.

As for the other members, they were engaged in chaotic battles with numerous martial and magical puppets, with no formation, the battlefield in disarray.

Sun Lingtong waited for a moment, seeing the timing was right, then secretly chuckled and commanded Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai to act.

Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai lay flat in a makeshift coffin, buried under the floor tiles.

Cheng Bai did not show himself, lying flat while casting spells.

Immediately, ghostly wails and howls filled the air!

Various beast souls emerged from the ground, pouncing on the Reformation Team.

Where did these beast souls come from?

This was thanks to Ning Zhuo's brilliant idea.

After understanding Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, he thought of the first trial of the Buddhist Gate.

There were many coffins inside, sealed with numerous heads, including demonic beasts and spirit plants.

Did these have souls?

Most likely, yes!

Because when constructing spiritual mechanisms, it was essential to preserve them intact.

The more complete the body, soul, magical power, essence blood, and divine sense, the better.

Thus, Ning Zhuo brought Sun Lingtong and Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai to the first trial of the Buddhist Gate.

With the help of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, the souls in these coffins were summoned.

Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai took the opportunity to replenish a significant amount of combat power!

The Reformation Team had just defeated all the martial and magical puppets and were watching the battle between Meng Chong and Yuan Dasheng, tired and relaxed.

Caught off guard, many reacted slowly, getting hit by ghosts, their souls collided, even bitten, screaming in pain.

The scene was chaotic.

The air temperature plummeted, ghosts rose, flying in the air.

The Reformation Team from the City Lord's Mansion was in disarray, scattered.

"An ambush?!" Meng Chong glanced over, only to be counterattacked by Yuan Dasheng, sent flying, crashing into the wall.

"Roar!" Yuan Dasheng roared, beating his chest, exuding a heroic aura.

Then, he beckoned provocatively at Meng Chong.

Meng Chong's eyes widened, feeling underestimated by a mechanical construct!

He growled, charging again, engaging Yuan Dasheng in battle.

After several exchanges, Yuan Dasheng suddenly abandoned defense, extending his arms to embrace Meng Chong.

Meng Chong's eyes flashed with brilliance: "A flaw!" WildSprint Thunderclap!

He shot out like lightning.

Yuan Dasheng's arms crossed, embracing nothing.

Almost simultaneously, Meng Chong appeared behind him.

Meng Chong struck heavily at Yuan Dasheng's back.

As he succeeded, a black shadow appeared, attacking him.

Meng Chong, caught off guard, was hit in the back by the shadow.

It was the lurking Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai!

With this strike, Meng Chong lost his mobility, his soul forcibly extracted from his puppet body!

Meng Chong: ?!

The Reformation Team, chased by numerous beast souls, saw this and finally woke up.

"Young Master Meng Chong!" "Save the young master!"

"Another special mechanical puppet appeared!!"

They disregarded their safety, rushing towards Cheng Bai.

Cheng Bai retreated silently.

Roar!

Yuan Dasheng jumped in front of them, becoming an insurmountable obstacle.

"Ah..." Meng Chong screamed.

His soul fell into Cheng Bai's hands, shrinking rapidly like a balloon with a hole.

Nine Turns Soul Devouring Technique!

Though Cheng Bai was dead, his Golden Core remained, and so did the Nine Turns Soul Devouring Technique.

In life, he easily extracted Sun Lingtong's soul.

This time, he succeeded in extracting Meng Chong's soul.

He operated the Nine Turns Soul Devouring Technique, devouring Meng Chong's soul!

Meng Chong's hands gripped Cheng Bai's arms, legs kicking, instinctively trying to use WildSprint Thunderclap.

But Sun Lingtong was prepared, precisely commanding: "Use the Soul Shaking Throat Drum!" Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai's Adam's apple moved slightly, emitting a drum sound.

The drum sound hit Meng Chong, making him feel dizzy, his limbs going limp, no longer struggling.

Cheng Bai took the opportunity to fiercely extract his soul.

Meng Chong's soul shrank to the limit, on the verge of collapse, triggering the Life-Hanging Thread on his head, gently pulling him out of the Immortal Palace, sending him back to his body.

Without Meng Chong, the numerous Reformation Team members were no threat.

Under the joint efforts of Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng and Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, they were quickly extracted, all devoured.

Before their souls dissipated, they were sent back to their bodies by the Life-Hanging Thread.

"We won!"

"Too easy."

Sun Lingtong emerged from the corner, clapping his hands, very excited.

He jogged to Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, giving an order.

Cheng Bai squatted down, extending his palm, pressing it against Sun Lingtong's puppet body.

The next moment, pure soul essence was infused into Sun Lingtong's soul.

Sun Lingtong tilted his head back, taking a deep breath, shouting in comfort.

His soul had been injured, though treated with the Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pill, it was still a long way from full recovery.

But now, with the soul essence, his soul injury healed rapidly, reaching peak condition, continuously surpassing limits, growing swiftly!

"Wonderful, truly wonderful!" Sun Lingtong was overjoyed.

"Stop, stop." He called out in time.

He absorbed half of the soul essence, leaving the other half for Ning Zhuo.

"My soul injury is completely healed."

"All future soul essence will be for Ning Zhuo. The more his soul power grows, the more Illusory True Lotus Seeds he can receive!"

He called out to Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng: "Ning Zhuo, come quickly, there's something good to eat!" Ning Zhuo, through Yuan Dasheng, witnessed the entire process, swallowing unconsciously.

It had been a long time since he absorbed soul essence.

Han Ming had lost it, Cheng Bai was made into a mechanical puppet, allowing him to regain the channel for obtaining soul essence.

"The City Lord's Mansion has vast resources, treating Meng Chong and others' soul injuries is easy." "This is great!"

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but imagine the future.

With Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, Ning Zhuo suddenly realized that all the cultivators participating in the trial were resources for his cultivation!

"By the way, when will the three families' Reformation Team collectively enter the palace?"

........

Forest of Ten Thousand Ghosts

Netherworld Valley.

The main sect of the Soul Devouring Sect was located here.

Soul Lamp Tower.

Countless soul lamps burned quietly, most emitting green flames, but some burned in other colors.

Among the myriad soul lamps, a gray-white flame suddenly extinguished.

The guarding disciple initially thought he was too sleepy, hallucinating, but after rubbing his eyes and looking again, he stood up in horror.

"Not good, true disciple Cheng Bai's soul lamp has extinguished!" The guarding disciple ran, kneeling before the elder to report.

"What?!" The elder couldn't sit still, standing up immediately.

"Is it Cheng Bai? The soul lamp of Judge Cheng Bai?" The elder confirmed.

The disciple nodded repeatedly.

The elder's face turned grave, rushing to the Soul Lamp Tower.

Seeing the extinguished soul lamp, he had no more illusions.

"Our sect's true disciple has fallen!" The elder's face was extremely dark, sighing deeply, terrifying killing intent spreading.

The guarding disciple felt like he was in the depths of winter, his teeth chattering.

The elder didn't linger, immediately leaving the tower to report to the main hall.

In the main hall of the Soul Devouring Sect, the current sect master and several elders were discussing important matters.

"Next year is our sect's once-a-decade disciple competition. The specific content of the competition should be finalized this time."

"A powerful soul beast has appeared in the Soul Crystal Mine of the Ghost Shadow Mountains, with combat power comparable to the Nascent Soul stage. It greatly interferes with our sect's soul crystal mining, requiring the sect to send elders to eliminate it."

"The Ghost Mother White Bone Lotus in the Sub-Ghost Valley has accumulated for over twenty years and will bloom in three years. Recently, it is heard that true disciples of righteous sects are secretly plotting to destroy the Sub-Ghost Valley branch and the Ghost Mother White Bone Lotus."

"Recently, the Blood Fiend Sect has repeatedly caused trouble in the middle section of the Ghost Cry River. According to intelligence, it is led by the new elder of the Blood Fiend Sect, Xue Shouren, who seems to have big plans. This person is a traitor of our sect, knowing much about us. Now he has joined the Blood Fiend Sect and become an elder. If not eliminated, he will become a great threat in the future."

The Soul Devouring Sect, a major demonic sect, had vast influence, not only dominating one area but also establishing numerous branch sects, extending its reach to multiple cultivation countries.

The position of sect master was not easy, dealing with countless affairs daily.

"Urgent report!"

"Our sect's true disciple Cheng Bai's soul lamp has extinguished, confirmed dead." The sect master and elders stopped their discussion, looking at the reporting disciple.

The sect master's face darkened: "Can the soul be summoned?"

The disciple hurriedly said: "The Soul Summoning Banner was used seven times, but Cheng Bai's soul did not return. The elders at the Soul Summoning Platform judged that Cheng Bai's soul has scattered."

The sect master angrily slapped the armrest: "Good, good, good. Our sect has lost a true disciple. Who did it? Find out the culprit, there will be retribution!"
