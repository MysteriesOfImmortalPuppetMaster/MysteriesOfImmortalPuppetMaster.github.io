Chapter 535: Triggering the Treasure Seal

Boom!!!

The white ice meteorite descended with overwhelming force, piercing through the green resilient light, destroying clusters of giant trees, then smashing onto the mountainside and suddenly self-exploed.

Countless hailstones shot out wildly, and an ice mist soared, swiftly enveloping the entire battlefield.

Ning Zhuo’s figure was completely hidden, while the Three Generals’ Battalion, situated in a sea of fire, remained united and held their formation.

Earth Movement - Earth Escape Technique!

Ning Zhuo continually crept deeper underground.

A layer of white frost covered his body, and the ice frost kept intensifying, launching a fierce erosion upon him.

“Even if I cast three spells in succession, I could not block one spell of Tian Shuang, the ghost cultivator!”

Ning Zhuo’s heart was filled with a stern resolve.

This direct confrontation completely exposed the disparity between the two sides.

“This should be the strongest enemy I have faced head-on, right?”

Speaking of which, Lord Long was undoubtedly stronger than Tian Shuang, but in the previous ambush, the White Jade Battalion was the main force directly resisting Lord Long. Although Ning Zhuo participated in the battle, he and Sun Lingtong only played the role of the “old stone monster,” scavenging for gains on the battlefield.

At that moment, he not only directly confronted Tian Shuang but also served as the main force resisting him, immediately feeling an unprecedented enormous pressure.

“Cough, cough.”

Ning Zhuo suddenly coughed, and in the blood he spat out, tiny ice pellets appeared.

He was secretly shocked, all because he had already initiated a healing spell, but its effect was unsatisfactory.

“Little Zhuo, use the Warm Fire Pill to heal your wounds,” Sun Lingtong reminded him in time.

Ning Zhuo complied immediately, swallowing a Warm Fire Pill. He activated his magical power, rapidly converting the medicinal energy, and indeed it took effect swiftly. Not only did a warm current surge within his body, dispelling the chill, but even the white frost on his skin gradually melted away.

“My Five Elements spells lean towards attack; I had not practiced healing much in daily life.”

Facing an unprecedentedly strong enemy, Ning Zhuo immediately recognized his own shortcomings.

“The combat power of the Three Generals’ Battalion would even be strained against one Ghost Cultivator; I cannot join with them, but must instead try to entangle Tian Shuang and Tian Shuang, and strive to have the Three Generals’ Battalion retreat first!”

Ning Zhuo possessed the mechanical Dragon "technique", as though he had mastered the Nascent Soul’s power of Escaping into the Void. Therefore, even though the enemy situation was extremely fierce, putting him under considerable pressure, he did not panic.

He had been continuously throwing his support behind the Three Generals’ Battalion; if in this battle the Three Generals’ Battalion were to be completely wiped out, it would be an extremely heavy loss for him.

“Next, cast spells underground to remotely attack Tian Shuang!”

Earth Movement - Flying Rock, Erecting a Taper.

Ning Zhuo was just about to target Tian Shuang when suddenly his divine perception sensed something, and in an instant he reversed his attack direction, shooting the needle-like rocks towards various locations below.

One ghost after another emitted painful roars or hisses.

Their sneak attack was detected by Ning Zhuo, and he severely repelled one wave, yet still over a dozen ghost souls continued to pounce on him from below.

These ghosts were entirely pitch-black, with bands of orange-red lava cracks covering their bodies, emitting a strong fiery aura.

They all were well-versed in the Earth Escape Technique, weaving through the underground as if they were like fish in water.

“Earth-Molten Ghost!”

Ning Zhuo silently exclaimed and cast a spell, launching a second wave of assault.

Although he again killed a number of Earth-Molten Ghosts, at the same time, more and more ghost souls surged forward one after another.

Sun Lingtong, utilizing the mechanical Dragon, had a scouting range far deeper than Ning Zhuo’s. He immediately signaled, “Little Zhuo, do not linger in the same spot.”

“Understood!” Little Zhuo immediately fought while advancing, killing a large number of the Molten Ghosts along the way.

Suddenly, he felt a strong chill spontaneously arise, launching a fierce erosion upon him from within to without.

In just a few breaths’ time, his movements slowed, his limbs grew stiff, and frost began to form on his eyebrows.

Sun Lingtong hurriedly reminded, “It’s Tian Shuang attacking you! But how he is doing it, who knows.”

Ning Zhuo used his divine sense to look inward: “It’s my soul! His offensive started from my soul, endangering my body.”

Divine Technique - Frost Soul Gaze!

The white-robed ghost cultivator Tian Shuang hovered in the high air, with his right hand forming a sword finger gesture, held upright in front of his chest, silently invoking his divine technique.

His eyes were entirely a ghostly white, and in his unique vision, only the soul forms of living beings appeared.

At that moment, he focused his attention on Ning Zhuo’s soul.

He executed this divine technique in a very mystical manner. As long as one was gazed upon by Tian Shuang for more than three breaths, the target’s three souls and seven spirits would be shrouded in cold. However, this cold did not first assault the soul but instead expanded outward, injuring the flesh.

After the flesh was frozen to death and decayed, the accumulated horrifying cold would then roll back, delivering a devastating blow to the cultivator’s soul.

Ning Zhuo, having been targeted by Tian Shuang, saw the situation rapidly deteriorate, becoming increasingly dire.

He quickly took out various pills, frantically consuming them. The medicinal power was rapidly converted into streams of medicinal energy that flowed throughout his body, either dispelling the chill, bringing vitality, or restoring his flesh.

Ning Zhuo’s battle preparations were quite thorough. Mainly, his abundant resources allowed him to purchase many pills before the major battle. These pills were categorized by type; though their quality was somewhat lacking, they made up for it in quantity.

Fire Path - Flame Cloak!

At the critical moment, the profound level of the Five Elements realm once again manifested its might, causing Ning Zhuo, in his moment of crisis, to suddenly change his thinking, frantically consuming thousands of mirror thoughts in his divine sea to formulate a Fire Path defensive spell.

Flames emanated from the Fire Path Heart Temple, quickly burning over his entire flesh. Ning Zhuo’s body, from the inside out, was enveloped in a warm fire.

Sizzle sizzle sizzle sizzle……

Ning Zhuo was subjected to the scorching flames, his flesh being eroded like roasted meat skewers, and immediately a scent of burning char emerged.

Tian Shuang’s vision was quite unique, and he immediately detected the changes on Ning Zhuo’s body. He sneered coldly, abruptly retracting his divine technique’s power.

In an instant, the cold dramatically lessened, causing Ning Zhuo’s body to burst into fire, with tongues of flame reaching three feet above his head.

Ning Zhuo, having been easily outmaneuvered by Tian Shuang, let out a pained grunt, instinctively attempting to immediately halt the Flame Cloak spell. But at that moment, a flash of spiritual light suddenly flashed within his divine sea.

The flash of spiritual light was like a bolt of lightning, cleaving through the sky of his divine sea, cutting through nearly a thousand mirror thoughts along its path.

Ning Zhuo devoted a portion of his divine sense, infusing it into his heart.

The divine statue in the Fire Path Heart Temple immediately became vivid and lifelike, its features entirely reflecting Ning Zhuo’s appearance.

After this transformation, Ning Zhuo immediately felt that his mastery over the Fire Path spells had suddenly surged to another level.

He promptly reduced the flame’s power, so that it matched the current cold erosion.

“Eh?” Sun Lingtong was both surprised and pleased.

He was very clear about Ning Zhuo’s situation, knowing that although the latter’s level in the Five Elements realm was quite high, many of his spells had been neglected in practice, with their real combat effectiveness being another matter.

Especially spells created on the fly in battle, which were highly targeted yet often one-sided and not very nimble.

Tian Shuang’s combat experience was exceedingly rich, and his discerning eyes quickly noticed that Ning Zhuo’s spellcasting was rather clumsy. Thus, by retreating as a tactic, he abruptly retracted his divine power, effortlessly pushing Ning Zhuo back into a precarious position.

Yet he did not expect that Ning Zhuo, at the critical moment, would master the timing of his spell, actively adapting to the drastic change in cold.

In fact, even Ning Zhuo himself had not expected it.

“In my haste, by utilizing the Fire Path Heart Temple, I managed to swiftly devise this Fire Path spell.”

“Because the primordial fire was issued from the Fire Path Heart Temple, with high involvement, so by controlling the Fire Path Heart Temple, I could indirectly regulate the strength of the spell’s power. Ingenious!”

This impromptu breakthrough in battle was as if it had opened a new window for Ning Zhuo.

Tian Shuang rapidly regulated his divine power, making it alternate between strong and weak, and Ning Zhuo immediately responded by adjusting his Flame Cloak on his body to alternately enlarge and shrink.

After testing once, Tian Shuang confirmed that Ning Zhuo could withstand this onslaught, and a strange expression appeared on his face: “This kid is odd, as if he has mastered some secrets, and his combat potential is considerable.”

“However, if you think you can so easily resist my divine technique, then you are too naive!”

Even while pushing Ning Zhuo to this point, Tian Shuang had never unleashed this divine technique at full power.

When fully unleashed, the Frost Soul Gaze could emanate a bone-chilling icy aura, directly penetrating the cultivator’s upper dantian and divine sea, spreading to freeze all thoughts!

Tian Shuang took a deep breath, and immediately without restraint, fully activated his divine technique.

For a moment, the terrifying chill, like a heavenly cascade, poured down into Ning Zhuo’s upper dantian, bringing boundless cold that froze all mirror thoughts along its path.

These mirror-like thoughts shattered one after another, with countless fragments being overwhelmed by the cold and turning into nothingness.

After all, Ning Zhuo had cultivated for only a mere dozen years. In everyday divine sea cultivation, he had never encountered any bottleneck, and had always felt that his situation was fine.

Now, facing a formidable enemy like Tian Shuang, his huge shortcomings in protecting his divine sea were immediately exposed.

The terrifying cold, without any hindrance, directly poured in, catching Ning Zhuo off guard.

He was proficient in using the Five Elements realm to design spells, but when it came to his own divine sea, it fell under the domain of divine techniques. Most spells were ineffective.

Ning Zhuo did not devise a solution; he merely delayed for a few breaths, during which more than half of the mirror thoughts in his divine sea were frozen, causing his thinking to slow several times over.

This situation completely sent him sliding into the abyss of defeat!

At this moment, all his thoughts and cognitive processes were on the verge of being frozen stiff, frozen to death, completely losing the ability to think.

No matter how powerful the Five Elements realm might be, without thought, no spell could be devised.

“Little Zhuo!” Sun Lingtong, unable to hold back, was about to act -to pull Ning Zhuo into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and flee -when, at that very moment, a magical treasure in Ning Zhuo’s mind suddenly burst forth with boundless Buddha light.

The Buddha light shone like a blazing sun, illuminating everywhere, dispelling all traces of icy cold.

It was none other than my Buddha Heart Demon Seal!

This precious treasure was passively triggered, emitting infinite Buddha light that protected Ning Zhuo’s divine sea.

Within the Buddha light, countless Buddha thoughts were generated in an instant.

Within a few breaths, tens of thousands of Buddha thoughts spread throughout Ning Zhuo’s divine sea.

Ning Zhuo’s cognitive ability quickly recovered!

“That was close!”

“I was just a hair’s breadth away from utter defeat.”

Within the Buddha light, tens of thousands of Buddha thoughts shone brilliantly, and at the same time, the Buddha light ascended, counterattacking Tian Shuang.

“Ah!” Tian Shuang cried out in agony, and hurriedly covered his eyes.

From the slits of his tightly closed eyes, torrents of fresh blood oozed out.

Within the blood, Buddha light even overflowed!

Tian Shuang, being a ghost cultivator, was being suppressed by Buddhist martial arts. In this instance, his use of divine technique had formed an extremely intimate connection with Ning Zhuo, and he was counterattacked by the Buddha light, his eyes suffering severe damage.

In the short term, he would absolutely be unable to use the Frost Soul Gaze divine technique again.

Sun Lingtong shouted, “Little Zhuo, now’s the chance, strike him while he’s weakened! Let’s attack with full force!”

But Ning Zhuo shook his head: “All this fighting and killing, all these disputes of right and wrong, are but illusions. What meaning does it have?”

Sun Lingtong:?!

Although Tian Shuang had his eyes tightly shut, his field of vision was filled with vast patches of Buddha light.

These rays of Buddha light also shone upon his divine sea, dispelling his other thoughts and replacing them with numerous Buddha thoughts.

“Damn these… damn me!”

Tian Shuang inwardly lamented, “I truly deserve to die.”

“Why persecute others, persecute such a vibrant and youthful, beautiful life?”

“I’m not human; what I did is utterly against heaven and harmony! Why not be kind to others?”

“May all sentient beings be at peace… what nonsense!”

At the end of his rumination, Tian Shuang forcibly turned his thoughts around, fiercely cursing in his heart.

“These damned Buddha thoughts, get out of my divine sea!”

Tian Shuang did not initiate a new attack, and Ning Zhuo did not take the opportunity to attack; instead, he released the Floating Ice White Jade Hand to urgently treat his wounds.

The two sides fell into a bizarre, calm standoff.

“We take turns to attack!” Liu Er shouted.

The confrontation between the Three Generals’ Battalion and Di Hui shifted into a fierce state.

Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei burst out of the Iron Bucket Formation, taking turns to attack against Di Hui.

This Ghost Cultivator, one of the twin ghosts of heaven and earth, immediately activated a spell to reposition himself.

He did not employ the common Earth Escape Technique, but rather a more advanced, more effective Earth Movement Technique!

Everyone in the Three Generals’ Battalion who had taken part in the ambush had witnessed the old stone monster relying on the Earth Movement Technique, and were well aware of its marvelous power.

So, when they saw the Ghost Cultivator employing such a technique, they immediately shifted their target.

“Wah, Heavenly Ghost, take my spear!” Zhang Hei charged into the air, extending his spear towards Tian Shuang, murderous intent clearly evident.

Tian Shuang kept his eyes tightly shut, his divine sense remaining active.

Just as the Black Snake Spear was about to touch the head of the Heavenly Ghost, the latter suddenly reached out his hand.

Clang!

Tian Shuang’s hands directly grasped the powerfully descending Black Snake Spear, emitting a crisp metallic clang.

Spell - Nine Nether Cold Soul Claw!

Tian Shuang’s five fingers condensed into profound ice, forming heavy claw gauntlets like cold ice.

Within the claw gauntlets were sealed countless Ice Souls, each swing releasing an icy wind.

Within the icy wind, countless pained faces of the Ice Souls appeared, emitting wailing laments that greatly disturbed one’s divine sense.

In the next moment, Tian Shuang swung his claw.

Woo woo woo……

Zhang Hei, hit by the intense icy aura and the wailing of the Ice Souls, immediately plummeted from the air.

But immediately after, Guan Hong, bolstered by a large amount of troop strength, stepped in to replace Zhang Hei, challenging Tian Shuang.

After Guan Hong, it was Liu Er.

Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei, having experienced multiple battles, had developed a tacit understanding. Relying on that synergy, they formed a relentless offensive.

Tian Shuang was in a rather wretched state.

The main issue was that whenever he tried to counterattack, Buddha thoughts in his divine sea would emerge, participating in his thought process and causing disruption.

This meant that every time he intended to kill, he was held back.

Even his thoughts were restricted, let alone his ability to cast spells.

Tian Shuang was forcefully repelled by the Three Generals.

Di Hui, witnessing this scene, burst into laughter.

It was the first time he had seen his best partner so disheveled.

Hearing Di Hui’s laughter, Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei all felt their hearts tighten, simultaneously realizing that the opponent had not yet fought at full strength!
