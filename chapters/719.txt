Chapter 719: The Utter Failure of Seduction (Bonus Update +3)

Rounding the corner, a Mystic Iron Puppet materialized before Ning Zhuo.

Without hesitation, he charged forward, unleashing a relentless assault that quickly reduced the puppet to a useless heap.

This was the fifth time he had done this.

Now that the competition was truly underway, he had no intention of sharing Jade Slips as he had before.

Strange, why have I only encountered Mystic Iron Puppets? Where are the other cultivators? Ning Zhuo wondered inwardly.

Che Zhuzi grew increasingly silent as he watched.

Ning Zhuo's initial lead widened with each step, leaving the second-place cultivator far behind.

The unlucky cultivators trailing behind Ning Zhuo fared even worse. After struggling through the maze, they found only disabled Mystic Iron Puppets.

"Damn it! Another broken one!"

"Which heartless bastard is doing this?!"

"If I find him, I'll kill him!"

The situation was infuriating.

The maze was incredibly complex, requiring cultivators to constantly expend their divine sense and spiritual energy to maneuver through it with Suspended Silk - an already exhausting task.

After hours of grueling effort, just when hope seemed within reach, it turned to bitter disappointment.

"Damn it, damn it! You useless fools!" Lady Spiderweb instinctively clenched her fists, wishing she could step onto the field herself and block Ning Zhuo's path.

At this rate, Ning Zhuo would reach the maze's center, the final battleground, completely unscathed.

In stark contrast to his effortless progress, the other cultivators would frequently clash midway, engaging in fierce battles that would drain their resources, with some even ending in mutual destruction.

By conserving his strength and waiting for the opportune moment, Ning Zhuo would undoubtedly gain a significant advantage in the final showdown.

This was precisely what Lady Spiderweb wanted to prevent.

She gritted her teeth, thinking, "I can't let Ning Zhuo have it too easy. The more he struggles, the greater my chances of success."

With this thought, she swayed her hips and glided gracefully to Che Zhuzi's side, wrapping her arms around his muscular arm and pressing it against her chest.

"Brother Chariot," she purred.

"This isn't fun at all."

"He's practically guaranteed first place. There's no excitement."

"I want to see him fight with all his might, to see him in a desperate state. Otherwise, how will your Rising Cloud Trial seem challenging?"

"If that big-headed brat actually clears the trial and starts bragging about how easy it was, where will you put your face, Brother?"

Lady Spiderweb's eyes shimmered with seductive allure as she coaxed in a soft, coquettish voice.

Che Zhuzi immediately adopted a submissive posture, patting the back of Lady Spiderweb's hand. "Alright, alright, if you want to enjoy the show more, Brother will grant your wish."

With a sweeping gesture, he dramatically altered the maze. Countless walls began shifting, forcing Ning Zhuo to frantically maneuver his Mystic Iron Puppet to avoid collisions. For a moment, he was in complete disarray.

The other participants fared even worse.

Some were locked in combat, their Mystic Iron Puppets severely disrupted, completely overturning the battle dynamics.

The maze's transformation quickly ceased.

The new layout differed drastically from the previous one. Ning Zhuo, who had been closest to the center, now found the maze's central point had shifted entirely.

As a result, over a dozen cultivators now stood roughly the same distance from the center as Ning Zhuo.

Moreover, numerous cultivators piloting Mystic Iron Puppets were groping their way through the paths near Ning Zhuo, searching for openings.

Thus, Ning Zhuo encountered his first, second, and third opponents...

"Finally, some living targets!" he thought, his focus sharpening as he threw himself into battle.

Relying solely on a single Void Suspension Silk severely limited his control capabilities, preventing him from fully utilizing his combat skills.

This resulted in both sides having nearly equal control, turning skirmishes into drawn-out battles of attrition.

After defeating his third opponent, the surface of Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Puppet was already riddled with dents and scratches.

"This won't do!"

"The Mystic Iron Puppet is practically a single piece. Since I'm not inside the maze, I can't disassemble other puppets using just the Suspended Silk and my own puppet. That means I can't add, remove, or replace any parts."

"Wait a minute..."

A flash of insight sparked in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he finally understood Che Zhuzi's true objective.

During his confrontation with his fourth opponent, Ning Zhuo initially engaged in straightforward combat, his movements rigid and predictable, leaving clear openings.

"Now's my chance!" Ning Zhuo mentally roared, seizing the opportunity he had been patiently waiting for. He commanded the Mystic Iron Puppet to execute a sliding tackle, positioning it behind the enemy.

The puppet's hand shot out, grabbing the opponent's Suspended Silk at its back and snapping it clean off.

Without control, the enemy puppet immediately exposed a massive vulnerability. It was pummeled with several brutal punches, leaving its entire back riddled with fist-shaped dents.

But almost immediately, the opponent's Suspended Silk snaked around Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Puppet and reconnected.

Ning Zhuo immediately attacked the Suspended Silk again.

This time, however, his opponent was prepared. As the attack approached, they abruptly shifted the corresponding strand of spider silk into the Void, causing it to vanish from reality.

Ning Zhuo's strike landed on empty air, but he showed no sign of discouragement.

He continued his assault.

After changing his tactical focus, his path seemed to clear before him.

His opponent, now forced to strictly protect their spider silk, gradually found themselves stretched thin, focusing more on defense than offense.

Che Zhuzi, who had been observing Ning Zhuo closely, mused, "Both of them are novices with Void Spider Silk, but it's clear that the younger one possesses superior comprehension. His application of Void Spider Silk demonstrates greater spiritual energy."

Lady Spiderweb, who had been watching Ning Zhuo intently, grew increasingly pleased.

"At his current rate, he won't last long."

"Unless he manages to acquire a fully intact Mystic Iron Puppet."

"Hahaha, excellent! The last undamaged puppet has already been claimed."

"Ning Zhuo, you're destined for a grueling battle. You'll never make it into the top ten!"

The worse Ning Zhuo's situation became, the more delighted Lady Spiderweb grew. This meant her chances of success were increasing.

Suddenly, Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Puppet crouched low and unleashed a powerful kick.

Caught completely off guard, the Mystic Iron Puppet's right knee joint buckled outward from the force of the kick, sending the entire puppet crashing to the ground.

"It's over!" The controlling cultivator felt his heart sink into despair.

Yet Ning Zhuo didn't deliver the finishing blow.

The cultivator hastily braced himself on his left leg, struggling to his feet, only to see Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Puppet retreating several steps.

Is this guy an idiot? Is he letting me go? The absurd thought flashed through the cultivator's mind.

But the next moment, Ning Zhuo attacked again.

After several rounds of offense and defense, the cultivator was once more knocked to the ground.

"It's over!" He gritted his teeth, bracing himself for the bitter taste of defeat, but Ning Zhuo's attack never came.

The cultivator maneuvered his Mystic Iron Puppet back to its feet, only to see his opponent retreating again, calmly watching him rise.

Could he be trying to break my spirit and make me join forces with him? The thought struck the cultivator. He frantically waved his hands, gesturing to show he understood.

"I'll join you! I'll join forces with you!" he declared wildly, only to be met with another relentless assault from Ning Zhuo.

Crash...

Down, struggle up, fight again, down, struggle up, fight again...

"What do you want?!" The cultivator was driven to the brink of madness by the torment.

He felt utterly humiliated and wanted to retreat, but he couldn't bear to abandon the resources he had already invested.

Buying Void Spider Silk had been an enormous expense.

"This guy..." Che Zhuzi and Lady Spiderweb, observing the entire battlefield, understood Ning Zhuo's motives.

Their gazes at Ning Zhuo were filled with astonishment.

Ning Zhuo's hair was tied with hemp rope, constantly being pulled upward.

The wooden awl in his hand repeatedly pierced his own thigh.

Head suspended from the rafters, awl piercing the thigh!

Real combat was excellent material for learning!

Ning Zhuo had deliberately spared his opponent, using him as a practice dummy to continuously hone his control over the Void Spider Silk and his mastery of the Mystic Iron Puppet.

His progress was visible to the naked eye.

"This junior has a method," Che Zhuzi sighed in admiration.

Lady Spiderweb, her expression grave, echoed the sentiment: "No wonder Ban Ji wants to eliminate him. With such resolve and such a clear understanding of the situation... if he's allowed to develop further, the consequences will be unpredictable."

"Fortunately, you have no future left."

The thought of Ning Zhuo soon falling into her hands, trapped between life and death, sent Lady Spiderweb's face flushing with excitement.

The more impressive Ning Zhuo's performance, the greater her sense of accomplishment would be upon capturing him.

"I surrender! Isn't that enough?!" Ning Zhuo's opponent finally broke, abandoning the Mystic Iron Puppet and retreating rapidly.

Having gained valuable experience, Ning Zhuo moved on to find his next opponent.

After repeating this method several times, Ning Zhuo finally withdrew.

His brow furrowed, his expression grave as he focused all his energy on controlling the Void Suspension Silk. Anyone who saw his face could tell he was in a precarious situation.

"Using this for practice and learning has advanced my mastery of the Void Spider Silk by at least two levels. But..."

"The Mystic Iron Puppet's condition has deteriorated significantly."

Ning Zhuo realized he couldn't continue like this.

The further one progresses in learning, the less noticeable the gains become. This is easily understood: improving from zero to sixty points is relatively easy, but advancing from eighty to ninety points requires far greater effort.

Moreover, Ning Zhuo's understanding came entirely from practical combat, limiting his potential.

With no need for rest, Ning Zhuo pressed deeper into the maze.

In the end, only six Mystic Iron Puppets reached the central area - not even enough to count to ten.

The maze's drastic transformation affected not only Ning Zhuo but also many others.

The results of Ning Zhuo's deliberate practice and study finally manifested in the final stages!

During the probing phase, his agile footwork, precise grasp of distance, and effective defenses against the Void Spider Silk were only briefly demonstrated, yet they immediately made it clear to everyone that Ning Zhuo was not to be trifled with.

As a result, during the chaotic battles, everyone instinctively avoided him.

This sound strategy allowed Ning Zhuo to conserve his strength.

By the time only three combatants remained, the other two finally realized they needed to join forces and launch a coordinated attack against him.

"Bring it on!" Ning Zhuo faced the two opponents alone, inevitably plunging into a fierce struggle.

His two opponents were equally skilled in controlling their Mystic Iron Puppets, and their puppets were in a similar state of repair to Ning Zhuo's.

Ning Zhuo couldn't use words or divine sense to provoke them.

Just as he was struggling to defend himself, Lady Spiderweb suddenly struck.

"Now!" she shrieked inwardly, unleashing her spell with ruthless force.

In an instant, both Ning Zhuo's divine sea and Essence Sea convulsed.

The hidden poison erupted, flushing his face crimson, swelling his head, and coarsening his breath. Bloodshot veins webbed his eyes. Simultaneously, countless thoughts surged within his divine sea.

These thoughts connected like silken threads, intertwining and spreading rapidly, seeking to engulf the entire space of Ning Zhuo's divine sea.

"Adore me! Submit to me!"

"I am your master now!"

"Ning Zhuo, you are no longer yourself. Your heart belongs to me, filled with me. You are my dog!"

The silken thoughts pulsed with overwhelming commands.

Ning Zhuo: ?!

Utter bewilderment flooded Lady Spiderweb's face. "H-how is this possible? Why isn't he succumbing to my enchantment?!"

"How is this possible?!"

Lady Spiderweb stared in disbelief, feeling like she was trapped in a nightmare. Her most cherished technique, the one she had honed to perfection, had utterly failed against Ning Zhuo.

How could this be happening?!

"I was ambushed! But why didn't the Mechanism Ring warn me? Oh, right - it posed no actual threat to me," Ning Zhuo realized, his understanding dawning.

He understood why the ambush had failed.

The essence of this enchantment lay in influencing the divine sea, altering a normal person's perception of him. But Ning Zhuo was immune.

Because - Innate Self!

This Innate Talent granted him immunity to nearly all such techniques. Of course, the contest between offense and defense still hinged on sheer force.

Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art!

"Suppress it!"

With his divine sea unaffected, Ning Zhuo immediately activated his demonic art, directly suppressing all abnormal reactions in his physical body.

Lady Spiderweb sensed the shift in Ning Zhuo, her eyes widening as she roared inwardly, "He recovered just like that?! How did he do it?!"

What was the greatest common characteristic of the Three Sects' Supreme Methods?

That was control!

The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual excelled at communicating with and controlling sentient beings and objects. The Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art meticulously arranged the Five Elements. But the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art was the most profound, using blood and meridians to dominate every corner of the body.

Moreover, Ning Zhuo's internal organs had been transformed, granting him an innate immunity to many techniques.

Other demonic arts might not have yielded such immediate results. But Lady Spiderweb had the misfortune of encountering the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art!

Ning Zhuo resolved the crisis effortlessly. His gaze unconsciously shifted, as if piercing through space, to Lady Spiderweb hiding at the heart of the formation.

"You can't escape," Lady Spiderweb vowed inwardly. "If you won't be my dog, then die!"

She looked up at Che Zhuzi, her seductive smile returning. "Brother Chariot..."

She shook Che Zhuzi's shoulder, about to manipulate him again.

Che Zhuzi's enthralled expression returned. He patted the back of Lady Spiderweb's hand and said gently, "You've already lost. Accept your defeat gracefully."

Lady Spiderweb: "Wait - ?!"

The next moment, her face paled with horror.

She found herself completely immobilized, unable to move a muscle.

Her assailant was none other than Che Zhuzi!

"Y-you... weren't you seduced by me?" Lady Spiderweb stammered, desperately clinging to her ability to speak.

Che Zhuzi smiled. "You're at the Foundation Establishment stage, so you can indeed influence Golden Core-level cultivators. But no one knows I've already castrated myself. Heh heh heh."

As he said this, Che Zhuzi's face filled with pride.

"You're not a Void Spider. You wouldn't understand that castration allows us to conserve our vital energy, increasing Void Spider Silk production by a full seventeen times!"

Lady Spiderweb opened her mouth, but no words came out.
