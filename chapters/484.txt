Chapter 484: Liu Er Borrowed a Treasure

Divine Ability— Spiritual Resonance Pulse Detection

From the moment Ning Zhuo said he wanted to find Mulan, and left the camp in front of Liu Er, Liu Er had already used this natural talent of his.

His innate talent worked as it always did and did not disappoint, allowing him to eavesdrop on the detailed conversation among Ning Zhuo, Mulan, and Zhang Chongyi.

“A family-inherited ‘Profound Gold Armor-Breaking Art’? Didn’t the strategist say he wasn’t interested in this cultivation method?”

“It’s because I didn’t agree to give him troop allotments, so he went off to the Red Flower Camp to seek help. It’s just a trade of benefits!”

When he heard that Ning Zhuo had only glanced at the ‘Profound Gold Armor-Breaking Art’ before gleaning numerous insights from it, and had immediately discussed with Zhang Chongyi on-site to design a treatment plan, Liu Er sank into a brief silence.

“As expected of someone born to a major clan.”

“No, even for someone from a major clan, the talent and comprehension of Strategist Ning Zhuo are extraordinary.”

Although the loathing in Liu Er’s heart grew day by day, he had no choice but to admit Ning Zhuo’s excellence.

Right after that, Zhang Chongyi’s misplaced needle caused Mulan to spit out a mouthful of fresh blood, and Liu Er’s expression instantly showed a hint of joy.

“Good. There’s an error in the treatment, and Ning Zhuo also bears responsibility!”

But in the next moment, he heard Zhang Chongyi shout, “Quick, quickly perform a ‘Blood Exchange’ on the General!”

“Blood Exchange?!” Liu Er’s ears perked up, and his expression changed drastically.

Then he heard Zhang Chongyi sigh and leave the tent.

Liu Er’s expression changed again, and his heart clenched tight. “That old geezer, that old geezer!”

He could tell that Zhang Chongyi was trying to matchmake Ning Zhuo and Mulan.

Liu Er was so furious that he gnashed his teeth.

He could no longer sit still. He stood up, paced back and forth in the tent, appearing agitated, and simultaneously pushed his innate talent to the limit to listen closely.

“No, it can’t be.”

“Ning Zhuo is from a major clan, an upright and honorable man, very trustworthy. He said he wouldn’t do dual cultivation with Mulan, so he’ll definitely keep his word!”

Liu Er tried to console himself, repeatedly telling himself to stay calm.

Then, in the next moment, he heard Ning Zhuo speak— “There’s one final area of stagnation. I’m going to break through with all my strength, so just bear with it for a bit.”

Liu Er felt as if he had been struck by lightning and froze on the spot.

“Stagnation? Where is there stagnation in your body?!”

“Break through with all your strength? Where do you plan to break through?!”

“Bear with it?!”

It no longer mattered whether Mulan could bear it; Liu Er himself could no longer bear it.

“No, absolutely not!”

“A single man and a single woman, all alone in one room —this is dangerous, too dangerous!”

“Ning Zhuo is a young man, with blood and energy at its peak. And Mulan, according to my investigation, although already in the Golden Core stage, has cultivated in hardship for years and has never been close to any man. Up to this day, she’s still a virgin!”

“Far too dangerous. I can’t let them stay together any longer.”

Liu Er walked with hurried steps to the tent’s doorway.

Just as he lifted the curtain, he heard Mulan let out a soft moan.

In that instant, Liu Er’s eyes widened, and his pupils shrank hard.

“What the hell? What are you two trying to do?!”

“No, definitely not!”

Liu Er could no longer remain calm. He leapt up, soared into the sky, and rushed straight toward the Red Flower Camp.

Red Flower Camp.

When Ning Zhuo heard Mulan’s voice, he abruptly raised his head. “What’s wrong?”

Instantly, the intimate mood was completely destroyed.

Mulan felt annoyed. She had the urge to reach out and beat Ning Zhuo on his big head.

But met with Ning Zhuo’s clear and innocent gaze, for a moment, she couldn’t bring herself to do it.

In the end, she snorted coldly, suppressing her shame, and forcibly changed the subject. “Your treatment methods still need improvement.”

She assumed that Ning Zhuo would argue back and say something like “I’m not a physician,” and so on.

However, Ning Zhuo immediately accepted her criticism. He nodded repeatedly, looking earnest. “Yes, yes.”

“The medical arts are vast and profound. I’m only dabbling partway, and my own healing ability is weak.”

“Compared to Lord Zhang Chongyi, there’s really no comparison. Even any other ordinary healer would have far more experience than I do and more skillful healing techniques. If they treated you, General Mulan, you surely wouldn’t have felt pain.”

Mulan: ……

She fell silent for a moment before continuing, “Young Master Ning Zhuo, you and I doing dual cultivation is a win-win for both of us.”

“From your large-scale purchase of puppet constructs and formation of an army, it’s clear that not only do you intend to participate in the war, you also want to show off your prowess in the upcoming battles and gain military achievements.”

“War is perilous. You’ve experienced an ambush before; you should understand the weight of this word.”

“In such a situation, if you and I do dual cultivation, your cultivation will surely increase, helping you survive on the battlefield. Why wouldn’t you want that?”

Ning Zhuo remained silent.

Up in midair, Liu Er heard these words and grew even more anxious.

A fierce wind struck his face, and he shouted inwardly, “No, don’t do dual cultivation, don’t do it!”

Red Flower Camp.

Mulan fixed her gaze on the white-robed youth nearby, continuing her persuasion. “I know your concerns— it’s merely about your Yang Energy.”

“But is Pure Yang really that important?”

“The cultivation method you practice doesn’t actually care whether you have your Pure Yang or not.”

“And regarding a future alliance with the Southern Bean royal family… to be honest, Pure Yang isn’t that important, either. It’s just a show of respect.”

“If you become strong, with a bright future ahead, and considering your Ning Family’s massive wealth, would the Southern Bean royal family cause a conflict over something as minor as ‘Pure Yang’?”

“If you do dual cultivation with me now, we’ll both gain considerable strength. By the time you earn even more merits on the battlefield, you’ll have grown even stronger. Once you reach a certain level of power, the Southern Bean royal family will beg to form an alliance with you, won’t they?”

“You’re from a major clan and well-read. Do you really not understand these principles?”

Ning Zhuo lowered his head, remaining silent, as his magic power flowed through his palm, pressing against Mulan’s lower abdomen and continually pouring into her body.

Mulan couldn’t see Ning Zhuo’s expression, so she kept pressing the issue. Feigning a casual tone, she said, “Oh, right.”

“My father once seized a piece of loot on the battlefield, a mechanical battle armor from Tang Jifeng known as the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor.”

“I’ve already written home so that the servants at the mansion will send this piece of mechanical armor here.”

Ning Zhuo lifted his head, his eyes lighting up. “Oh?”

He was quite delighted. “Tang Jifeng? Is he that ‘Hundred-Armed General’ who crushed bandits in Cangqing Mountain, saw through Tian Guan’s mechanical traps, destroyed the enemy army entirely in the Chiyan Desert War, and set up an ambush in the Cloud Sea to kill a Nascent Soul–level enemy general?”

Ning Zhuo listed them as though counting his own treasures.

He had read many books and knew quite a bit about renowned mechanical cultivators.

Tang Jifeng was one of them.

He excelled at using his own strength to control numerous puppets all at once, forming an army to fight.

Currently, Ning Zhuo’s act of building an army of puppet constructs was essentially doing the same thing Tang Jifeng had done!

Since mechanical cultivation had developed over so many years, there were already cultivators who used beast hordes to form an army, and also those who used mechanical constructs to form an army. This wasn’t anything new.

So Mulan was not at all surprised to see Ning Zhuo using puppet constructs to form an army, nor did she doubt their combat prowess.

However, at that moment, seeing the spark in Ning Zhuo’s eyes, Mulan was faintly annoyed.

“In Ning Zhuo’s mind, these mechanical creations are more appealing than I am!”

Mulan suppressed her complicated emotions and continued enticing him: “In fact, it’s not just this mechanical battle armor at the mansion, there’s also Tang Jifeng’s personal notes on controlling mechanical constructs and commanding them in battle.”

“Back in the day, I read through those notes in order to prepare for potential enemies and gained quite a bit of knowledge about mechanical cultivators.”

“Oh?” Ning Zhuo’s eyes glinted again.

Inwardly, Mulan snorted coldly. “Young Master Ning Zhuo, you should spend the night here tonight. I can pass on the knowledge from those notes to you —I remember it all.”

“Well…” Ning Zhuo hesitated.

Meanwhile, high in the air, Liu Er was already seething with impatience. “Spend the night? Spend the night doing what?! That can’t happen!”

“What do you mean ‘pass on mechanical notes’?”

“Mulan, so you’re actually like this, fooling and enticing my strategist!”

Liu Er was both exasperated and helpless.

He suddenly realized that it was Ning Zhuo whom he trusted more. Mulan was behaving more and more proactively, and he feared that Ning Zhuo might fail to hold his ground, that things might go too far and actual dual cultivation might occur!

Mulan fixed her eyes on Ning Zhuo.

She was the valiant daughter of a Grand Marshal, and everything she did followed that style—swift and decisive!

In her opinion, although Ning Zhuo’s treatment plan was effective, it was still treating the symptoms rather than the root cause. To truly get at the root, the path of dual cultivation was the only solution.

“Ning Zhuo is out traveling, and after this war, he’ll continue roaming, leaving Twin Rivers Kingdom.”

“By then, our relationship will be dissolved, and Grand Marshal Mu’s Mansion will become a prey in the eyes of others once again. They’ll come for us.”

“But if Ning Zhuo remains in this position, my Mu Family’s Grand Marshal’s mansion will still be safe.”

Mulan had very little genuine affection for Ning Zhuo.

She mostly approached this from the perspective of the Mu Family general’s mansion, weighing the pros and cons.

“Tang Jifeng…” Ning Zhuo furrowed his brow slightly.

Under Mulan’s expectant gaze, he was just about to speak when sudden footfalls echoed from outside the tent.

They were very hurried.

“General Liu, General Liu! Please wait, please wait. Allow me to first report to my lord,” Mulan’s female deputy called out anxiously.

Liu Er was in a state of desperate urgency, his ears perked as he constantly used his innate talent to eavesdrop.

“Wait?! If I wait any longer, those two inside the tent will start doing dual cultivation!”

With a flick of his sleeve, Liu Er shook off the female deputy, using the excuse, “I’m not here to see your General.”

In the next second, he headed straight for the tent, calling out urgently, “Strategist, Strategist! Come out, quick. There’s an urgent matter, an urgent matter!”

Zhang Chongyi also heard the commotion and came over, glaring at Liu Er for ruining his plans. In his eyes, nothing was as important as getting Ning Zhuo and Mulan together.

“That many-eared scoundrel is despicable. Always spoiling other people’s business!” Zhang Chongyi cursed inwardly as he walked over to tug Liu Er away.

Yet Ning Zhuo had already lifted the tent flap and come outside. “General, is something urgent happening?”

Liu Er glanced into the tent but didn’t see Mulan. Now that the tent flap blocked his view, all he could do was look at Ning Zhuo.

Clearly, Mulan didn’t want to see him.

“Strategist, Strategist, it’s enough that you’ve come out.” Liu Er grabbed Ning Zhuo’s arm and dragged him out of the army camp. “I have urgent business to discuss with you. Let’s leave the camp first.”

After exiting Red Flower Camp, Liu Er didn’t take Ning Zhuo back to the Three Generals Camp; instead, he led him to a hidden corner.

Using his magic, Liu Er created a space suitable for secret conversation.

“Strategist, my master entrusted someone to deliver a treasure to me. I just received it, and immediately discovered that it could be immensely useful to both you and General Mulan.”

“Take a look.”

The next moment, Ning Zhuo saw the YinYang One Qi Kettle.

“What’s this?” Ning Zhuo asked in surprise.

Liu Er placed the treasure directly into Ning Zhuo’s hands, letting him examine it thoroughly.

Ning Zhuo turned it over and over, using his spiritual sense to check it. He exclaimed repeatedly, “What a fine treasure, truly a fine treasure.”

Liu Er forced himself to suppress the pain in his heart, forced a smile, and explained to Ning Zhuo the artifact’s powers and functions.

Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up. He immediately thought, “This seems to be exactly what General Mulan’s injury needs.”

“Is that so? Then that’s even better!” Liu Er slapped his thigh, his face filled with apparent joy, but he was actually hurting inside.

Ning Zhuo caressed the Yin-Yang One Qi Jug and expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Liu Er.

Liu Er affectionately patted Ning Zhuo on the shoulder, beaming with warmth. “Once I obtained this treasure, I immediately thought of how, among the Three Generals Camp, you’re the youngest, Strategist, and you have the most need to improve your cultivation. That’s why I’ve brought it to you.”

Ning Zhuo’s eyes grew slightly moist. “General Liu treats me so generously. I, Zhuo, shall remember this with all my heart!”

Inwardly, Liu Er thought, “If you’re truly grateful, don’t do dual cultivation with Mulan!”

He very much wanted to say it out loud but ultimately didn’t.

If he said it, his intention would be too obvious!

“With this treasure, maybe I can do dual cultivation with myself!” Ning Zhuo said excitedly.

He had considered this idea for a long time.

At the moment, he wanted nothing more than to test it out.

As for dual cultivation with Mulan?

Dual cultivation my ass!

It wasn’t nearly as convenient as dual cultivation with himself!

Elsewhere.

A certain elderly demon cultivator was left dumbfounded.

Just now, he had sensed a sudden surge in Ning Zhuo’s destiny.

At present, in Ning Zhuo’s destiny —represented by an arm —another treasure jug appeared.

Ning Zhuo’s fate-arm held the treasure jug, and the jug gradually shrank in his hand until it vanished.

“The Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle!”

“How did that treasure Kettle end up in Ning Zhuo’s hands?”

“What is Little Six doing?!”

“You damned disciple!”

The old demon cultivator was utterly infuriated. He had worked hard to accumulate many treasures, yet now Ning Zhuo’s destiny had soared yet again, leaving him no choice but to keep pouring in more resources.

Gritting his teeth, the old demon cultivator tore off the fox fur on his back and threw it into the air.

He continued taking out treasured materials from his storage pouch.

“These are all my valuable collections from over the years.” The old demon cultivator’s heart throbbed with immense pain, crying out with grief!

But he had to keep adding more.

Of course, he didn’t forget to send out a message, demanding answers from Liu Er’s side.

Before long, he received a reply.

Once the old demon cultivator learned the situation, he fell into silence.

He forgave Liu Er and felt the latter had done the right thing. After all, if Ning Zhuo and Mulan did dual cultivation —merging Pure Yang and Pure Yin —their intertwined destinies would both skyrocket.

And based on the old demon cultivator’s calculations, such a surge would surpass even the increase brought by obtaining the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle!

“Ning Zhuo is too big a threat!”

“He must be removed!”

“This time, I’ve used the last reserves in my vault. I refuse to believe Ning Zhuo’s fortune can still rise again!”

“I’ve paid such a huge price. The one who seizes his fate and returns it to life can only be Liu Er!!”

Almost at the same moment, near Fire Persimmon Mountain—

A message had just been delivered to Ning Jiufan’s hands.
