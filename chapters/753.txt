Chapter 753: Triple Wave-Breaking Blade

Ban Ji's expression was grim, his anxiety barely concealed.

The Ban Clan's Celestial Mechanism Chain had long foretold this event, prompting Ban Ji to begin preparations years ago.

He had devoted countless hours and immense effort to mastering both the saber and sword, honing his skills in these close-combat weapons while also developing formidable hand-to-hand combat abilities.

All this was for the Rising Cloud Minor Trial of the Ninefold Profound Armor.

For Ban Ji, the Profound Armor held far greater significance than for ordinary cultivators. It would be crucial in helping him weather each eruption of his Immortal Talent.

This much was obvious.

"The more Bronze Artifacts I defeat now, the greater my rewards will be."

"If I can secure nine artifacts in the second stage, I'll claim first place outright."

"But that's too difficult. Based on my calculations, my limit is seven artifacts. I'll need to reach the third stage, seize Profound Armor from others, and gather nine in total to secure first place."

First place was Ban Ji's sole ambition.

Even with Golden Core-level Body Cultivators and Martial Cultivators as rivals, Ban Ji remained confident.

The three stages of the competition within the Profound Armor Cave largely suppressed cultivation levels, drastically narrowing the gap between Golden Core and Foundation Establishment cultivators and allowing for direct confrontation. Qi Refining Stage cultivators participating in the Minor Trial would receive enhancements from the formation, ensuring that the competition emphasized martial techniques and divine sense over cultivation level.

Ning Zhuo's arrival weighed heavily on Ban Ji.

Ban Ji had carefully considered his strategy: "I handled the first two rounds alone, so I definitely have an advantage. I'll only face Ning Zhuo in the third round."

"By then, I'll teach Ning Zhuo a lesson he'll never forget. I'll seize all his Profound Armor, pushing me closer to collecting nine pieces and claiming first place!"

"Until then, I need to gather as much Profound Armor as possible."

It was clear that the more Profound Armor a cultivator refined and mastered, the greater their advantage in the third round, and the higher their chances of securing first place.

Ban Ji's initial plan was to acquire a Bronze Sword and Bronze Saber in the early clashes. These were his favored weapons, allowing him to unleash combined sword-and-saber techniques that fully showcased his personal combat prowess.

But now, he had already obtained his third Bronze Artifact, yet he hadn't even glimpsed a single sword or saber.

"Well, throwing knives are technically blades... bullshit!"

Ban Ji was deeply frustrated and utterly perplexed.

"This shouldn't be happening."

"According to common sense, swords and sabers are the most common weapons. Even if they appear randomly, their numbers should be the highest and their appearance the most frequent."

It was precisely for this reason that Ban Ji had chosen the saber and sword as his primary weapons.

He glared at the throwing knives and chain mace in his hands, his anger burning like a physical ache. Both were considered unorthodox weapons. Glancing at the wolf-toothed mace before him, eager to be wielded, he found himself speechless.

"I hope the fourth and fifth Bronze Artifacts contain a saber and sword."

"But the Bronze Artifacts in the second trial become increasingly difficult to obtain."

"If I can't fully unleash my combat potential, I'll never reach the later stages. My absolute limit is seven weapons, and I definitely won't reach that this time."

This meant Ban Ji had only three chances left: the fourth, fifth, and sixth Bronze Artifacts.

Ning Zhuo faced the Bronze Saber.

Hmm!

In the next instant, the saber sliced through the air, thrusting straight at Ning Zhuo.

The saber tip moved with ruler-straight precision, a textbook thrust.

Ning Zhuo flicked his wrist, and the Bronze Sword in his hand met the attack head-on.

Clang! A crisp, metallic ring echoed as sparks flew.

The Bronze Sword's tip struck the saber's point with flawless accuracy.

Ning Zhuo himself lacked such pinpoint precision, but the fundamental sword techniques embedded within the Bronze Sword corrected his movements, ensuring each strike was executed with perfect form.

Although Ning Zhuo possessed a vast repertoire of sword techniques from various cultivators, these skills were not truly his own.

Significant discrepancies existed between these inherited experiences and his personal capabilities.

For instance, physical attributes varied greatly. Some cultivators had longer arms, others were taller, some possessed greater stamina, while others wielded superior strength.

Furthermore, temperament played a crucial role. Faced with the same technique, some favored defense, others prioritized evasion, while still others preferred to use offense as their best defense.

Therefore, experience remained just that - experience. For Ning Zhuo, its applicability varied greatly.

Moreover, these inherited experiences often clashed with one another.

This was why Ning Zhuo needed time to transform and assimilate these techniques, to digest this treasure trove of knowledge.

Such practical combat proved particularly transformative.

In close-quarters combat, the transitions between offense and defense were lightning-fast. A moment's lapse in focus could expose a fatal weakness, leading to bitter defeat. Ning Zhuo had to maintain absolute concentration, leaving no time for conscious deliberation. His choices - whether to evade, parry, or prepare a counterattack - arose instinctively, rooted in his very nature.

This forced him to rapidly filter through the myriad options offered by his inherited experiences.

The rebounding force traveled along the Bronze Sword's blade, surging through Ning Zhuo's arm and into his shoulder.

Ning Zhuo retreated swiftly.

The Bronze Sword moved a step ahead of Ning Zhuo, guiding his wrist to twist and redirect the rebounding force along its blade, channeling the energy outward.

Simultaneously, it blocked the Bronze Saber's second attack.

Once again, the Bronze Sword provided Ning Zhuo with crucial assistance.

Had he relied solely on his own skills, Ning Zhuo would have been unable to evade the saber's follow-up strikes and would inevitably have been wounded.

The Bronze Sword reacted autonomously in combat, responding with lightning speed and executing the correct countermeasure before Ning Zhuo could even process the situation.

This precise response etched itself into Ning Zhuo's mind, his eyes gleaming with understanding. "I've learned something!"

It was as if a master swordsman were guiding his hand, teaching him practical combat techniques with every breath.

The Bronze Sword deflected the Bronze Saber's subsequent attack.

The saber's blade smoothly transitioned from a thrust to a sweeping motion, arcing toward Ning Zhuo's ankle. The transition between techniques was seamless, executed with fluid precision.

Ning Zhuo's pupils constricted slightly as he hastily retreated, leaping backward.

His hurried jump left him hunched mid-air, his upper body leaning forward. This movement caused the Bronze Sword to create a fleeting curtain of blades for defense.

The Bronze Sword assisted in refining his technique, helping Ning Zhuo better deflect the treacherous saber strike.

Still, a thin slit was torn in his pant leg, and the hairs on Ning Zhuo's calf stood on end as a chilling draft swept across his skin.

Before Ning Zhuo could regain his footing, the Bronze Saber struck again, clinging to him like a shadow.

The saber unleashed a series of rapid strikes, forming a seamless combo:

Wave-Breaking Triple Blade!

The first strike was overwhelmingly heavy. Ning Zhuo braced his sword horizontally, his arm trembling and numb as he retreated.

The second strike shifted from a downward slash to a diagonal thrust, the saber's edge darting like a viper's tongue, angling low to sweep toward Ning Zhuo's flank. Forced to raise his guard after the initial block, Ning Zhuo exposed his left ribs.

Just as the blade threatened to pierce him, Ning Zhuo twisted his body in a desperate maneuver, the saber's spine narrowly scraping past his waist.

Shriek! The hem of his robe tore, and a thin line of blood appeared on his side where the blade had grazed him.

The third strike transitioned into a rolling thrust, leveraging the momentum of his twisting motion to stab toward Ning Zhuo's right shoulder with lightning speed.

The evasive maneuver had thrown Ning Zhuo off balance, making this final strike impossible to dodge.

In the next instant, blood sprayed as the saber carved a deep gash into his shoulder, exposing bone.

Ning Zhuo swiftly transferred the Bronze Sword to his left hand, unleashing a flurry of defensive strikes with all his might.

Guided by the Bronze Sword, his parries, deflections, and counter-thrusts flowed seamlessly, blocking the Bronze Saber's follow-up attacks with textbook precision.

Yet searing pain radiated from his right shoulder, and blood rapidly stained Ning Zhuo's robe crimson.

Ning Zhuo's realization was profound: "The Bronze Sword only taught basic sword techniques, but the Bronze Saber takes it to another level. It's not just about basic saber techniques; the strikes are faster, the transitions between moves are smoother, and there are even combos!"

The three basic saber techniques he had just faced formed a small combo.

The chop, collision, and thrust flowed seamlessly together, each strike building upon the previous one, the rhythm shifting abruptly to anticipate Ning Zhuo's reactions and inflict maximum damage.

The sensation was akin to being struck by three consecutive waves, leaving him no room to breathe.

The wound on his right shoulder had already stopped bleeding on its own.

The searing pain from the saber cut was also rapidly subsiding.

Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with sharp focus. The vividness of his recent experience had brought his past memories surging to life.

Images of countless Demonic Cultivators wielding saber techniques and facing saber attacks flooded his mind, merging into an indescribable, overwhelming insight.

Time continued to flow. Having weathered the initial onslaught, Ning Zhuo found his footing.

His close-quarters sword skills rapidly adapted to the higher-level opponent, allowing him to trade blows evenly.

A familiar pattern began to unfold before the watching Cultivators.

"He's learning in real-time again!"

"His progress is truly visible to the naked eye."

"I get it now!" A cultivator suddenly clapped his palm against his fist. "That's why he took first place in the Confucian cultivator's Minor Trials twice! It must be his incredible learning ability!"

This remark immediately resonated with many others.

"Exactly. Chu Xuangui's Minor Trial was about calligraphy imitation. The more skilled a Confucian scholar was in calligraphy, the greater their disadvantage."

"Meanwhile, Song Taosheng directly taught the 'Head Hanging' and 'Thigh Pricking' spells in the Temple of Literature - both learning methods. This perfectly suited Ning Zhuo's strengths!"

Some cultivators also noticed his physical body.

"His physical foundation is remarkably strong. I've rarely seen such a powerful physique in the Foundation Establishment Stage."

"I suspect that in addition to cultivating the Five Elements Technique, he's also cultivating the Lower Dantian Essence Sea. In fact, he might be feinting with the Five Elements Technique while primarily cultivating the Essence Sea and only secondarily cultivating the Qi Sea!"

Some cultivators nodded in agreement, while others shook their heads.

"That possibility can't be ruled out."

"Ning Zhuo has powerful backing. A genius like him, even if he doesn't primarily cultivate the Essence Sea, would certainly have ample methods and secret techniques to enhance his physical foundation."

"Just imagine Situ Xing and Ban Ji - these individuals are the public faces of major powers in the Foundation Establishment Stage. Any aspects their primary cultivation arts neglect are supplemented with various secret techniques, though at a steep price."

As the cultivators discussed, Ning Zhuo suddenly thrust forward, his sword tip striking the Bronze Saber and knocking it to the ground.

This was an excellent opportunity to subdue the saber, but Ning Zhuo didn't seize the advantage. Instead, he retreated a step, maintaining his stance with his sword at the ready, fully alert.

Seeing this, some cultivators sighed. "Here he goes again! Ning Zhuo isn't even nervous; he's still trying to learn on the fly. At this rate, he'll definitely end up in last place."

Others recognized Ning Zhuo's strategy. "I think he's made the right choice. Imagine if he had rushed to refine the Bronze Sword earlier. Would his close combat skills have improved? He probably would have been defeated by the Bronze Saber's simple combo just now."

"True," someone interjected. "This is a steady, methodical approach. Ning Zhuo, as a top-tier genius, clearly has his own plan."

"But if he keeps this up, he'll never catch up to the others. He might even be eliminated in the second stage due to lack of time."

"Sigh, let's just hope he knows what he's doing."

Though the cultivators had only just met Ning Zhuo, they naturally favored such a righteous figure. More importantly, they eagerly anticipated a clash between Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji - missing such a spectacle would be a true pity.

While Ning Zhuo remained immersed in practical combat learning, the other Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators were widening the gap between them.

Facing the Bronze Saber, Zhang Wangxing burst into wild laughter, utterly fearless.

He pounded his chest. "Come on, strike me!"

The Bronze Saber struck his body, but his flesh, as soft as mud and seemingly boneless, collapsed inward, instantly engulfing the blade.

As the saber's momentum waned, it tried to withdraw.

Zhang Wangxing seized the hilt with both hands, gripping it with a death grip. Simultaneously, his arms melted into flowing flesh, enveloping the blade.

The Bronze Saber struggled violently, convulsing within Zhang Wangxing's body.

Heh heh, heh heh, heh heh...

Zhang Wangxing's face paled as he endured wave after wave of excruciating pain, yet his grin widened, his laughter growing more maniacal.

The Bronze Saber's attacks rapidly weakened, and soon, Zhang Wangxing had refined it completely.

Zhang Wangxing cultivated the Flesh Transformation Sutra, granting him profound mastery over his own flesh. He could manipulate it into bizarre and violent transformations, simultaneously shifting his bones and internal organs.

"The Rising Cloud Minor Trial of the Ninefold Profound Armor is nothing more than this! Hahaha!"

Having claimed three Bronze Artifacts, Zhang Wangxing surpassed Ban Ji's pace, surging to the top of the Foundation Establishment cultivators in the arena.

Wave-Breaking Triple Blade!

The Bronze Saber's momentum surged anew, unleashing a rapid series of strikes.

Ning Zhuo's gaze sharpened. Instead of retreating, he advanced, his Bronze Sword trembling slightly as he met the first heavy downward slash with an upward diagonal cut.

Clang!

Amidst the ear-splitting clash, Ning Zhuo refused to yield. The Bronze Sword in his hand grazed the saber's blade at a precise angle.

The force of the impact surged through Ning Zhuo's arm and shoulder. Fully absorbing the momentum, he channeled it into a counter-strike, neutralizing the saber's power.

The first strike of the Wave-Breaking Triple Blade exhausted its force. Ning Zhuo seized the brief pause between the first and second strikes, disrupting the saber's momentum entirely.

His eyes blazed with intensity as the Bronze Sword moved with lightning speed, forcing the Bronze Saber into a series of retreats. Each time the saber attempted to retaliate, Ning Zhuo redirected its force, twisting the blade into a series of contortions until it was as weak as a paper wall, utterly devoid of its earlier ferocity.

Clang!

The Bronze Saber clattered to the ground for the thirty-second time.

Unlike before, Ning Zhuo stepped on the saber's blade, channeling massive amounts of divine sense and spiritual energy into it, directly refining the artifact.

He bent down and lifted the Bronze Saber.

Left saber, right sword!

His breathing gradually slowed from rapid gasps to measured breaths.

Sweat trickled down his cheek, dripping onto the blades of both weapons.

He couldn't help but think of Ban Ji. Could I emulate Ban Ji's dual-wielding techniques, combining the saber and sword into a single, devastating strike? If so, I'd have another means to counter him in the future.

Meanwhile, elsewhere...

Ban Ji dragged his Bronze Mace forward, his face dark with frustration. "Swords and sabers! Swords and sabers!"

Before him lay a pair of nunchaku.

"I..." Ban Ji's eye twitched uncontrollably, his face flushing crimson with rage.
