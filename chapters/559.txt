Chapter 559: Capturing Two Generals Alive, Finally Reaching the Carriage

The two armies deliberately avoided the Golden Swallow River, encountering the Red Flower Battalion halfway.

"General Mu Lan!" Liu Er's eyes lit up as he transmitted via divine sense.

Mu Lan nodded subtly at him, then turned to Ning Zhuo with joy, "Husband, let's fight side by side this time!"

Ning Zhuo wanted to remind Mu Lan not to call him 'husband,' but with battle raging, it clearly wasn't the best moment to correct her. He simply nodded and gestured for Mu Lan to follow.

They continued charging forward!

Military Tactic - Speed is Vital!

Spotting the perfect moment, Liu Er depleted some military strength, causing the Three Generals Battalion's speed to surge.

Wood Element - Root Vine Entanglement!

Ning Zhuo extended his divine sense to the left, casting his spell, and dozens of enemy cultivators were instantly entangled by vines.

"Good opportunity, fire arrows!" Mu Lan's eyes sparkled as she immediately issued orders.

The Red Flower Battalion unleashed a wave of arrows.

Military Tactic - Falling Flower Arrows!

Petals drifted from the Red Flower Dharma Avatar, breaking into countless fragments that rained down heavily.

"Aaargh..." The enemy cultivators, trapped by vines and unable to evade, were struck, screaming as they lost their lives.

The three battalions skillfully coordinated their attacks. Trusting each other allowed them to achieve remarkable results.

"Little Zhuo, Lin You is over there!" Sun Lingtong, hidden within the Mechanical Dragon, continually updated Ning Zhuo on the target's position.

"Charge in this direction!" Now serving as the central figure, Ning Zhuo's command immediately guided the three battalions' movement.

Indeed, Ning Zhuo was now the core connecting the three armies.

Together, the joint armies carved out a bloody path.

"This is the advantage of having numbers," Ning Zhuo sighed genuinely.

This was far easier than when he had led the troops alone.

Of course, there were other factors. At this moment, morale among the Two Note Kingdom soldiers surged, naturally favoring aggressive advances. Additionally, higher-ups like Elder Long and Lu Hongtu were locked in deadly battles, unable to adjust formations and positions, thus failing to counter the combined assault of Liu, Guan, Zhang, Ning, and Mu Lan.

The distance between Ning Zhuo and Lin You continuously shrank.

Lin You, busy with battles inside the mechanical carriage, hadn't yet noticed Ning Zhuo.

"Look over there!"

"We can't let these enemies run rampant any longer!"

"Intercept them!"

A force from Thousand Peaks Forest recognized Ning Zhuo’s strength and swiftly acted.

Multiple spells rained down fiercely, momentarily halting Ning Zhuo's charge.

It was the Profound Witch Army!

From afar, Ning Zhuo's eyes glinted sharply.

This battalion, led by Nascent Soul cultivators, ranked among Thousand Peaks Forest's top three elite units.

Thousand Peaks Forest hadn't established a kingdom, so this army relied solely on military strength, unable to mobilize national resources. Since the battle began, the Profound Witch Army had remained entrenched, launching spells from a distance with devastating effect, causing heavy casualties among Two Note Kingdom's soldiers.

Strategically, the Profound Witch Army closely resembled Two Note Kingdom's Fire Cloud Battalion, both excelling in powerful long-range magical attacks.

However, while the Fire Cloud Battalion specialized in explosive fire-element spells capable of igniting vast infernos, the Profound Witch Army's techniques were rooted in witchcraft, characterized by eerie and unpredictable attacks, less spectacular but harder to guard against.

"How should we deal with this?" While Ning Zhuo pondered strategy, Mu Lan acted first.

Military Tactic - Flower Scroll Enclosure!

The Red Flower Dharma Avatar divided into two shadows, hovering above the Three Generals and the Mechanical Army.

Then, it released a powerful suction, absorbing incoming spells.

With each absorbed spell, layers of flower petals retracted inward, forming a protective flower bud shape.

The petals curled inward continuously, absorbing wave after wave of spells, firmly shielding the three battalions below.

The Red Flower Battalion single-handedly protected all three battalions, showcasing astounding prowess.

However, their military strength plummeted rapidly and couldn't hold out much longer.

Mu Lan didn't need to say it; Ning Zhuo, Liu, Guan, and Zhang all understood clearly.

"Let me handle it!" Zhang Hei roared, his shout thunderous.

Military Tactic -  Overwhelming Army!

He thrust forward with both palms, instantly depleting nearly half of the Three Generals Battalion's military power and his personal technique.

Blackwater soldiers materialized from thin air, surging forth like a black river, fiercely attacking the Profound Witch Army.

"Oh?" Ning Zhuo hadn't interacted closely with Liu, Guan, and Zhang recently; this was the first he'd seen of Zhang Hei's considerable progress.

Previously, Zhang Hei could only execute this military technique by relying on his Black Serpent Spear.

But now, with his spear snapped in half, he was still able to perform it by himself - a significant improvement!

Seeing the Blackwater soldiers charging, the Black Tortoise Army was forced to divert their firepower to suppress this group.

Though the Black Tortoise Army commander was from a barbarian tribe, his command remained calm, precise, and orderly.

Under his leadership, the Black Tortoise Army formed a tight defensive circle, firmly controlling the surrounding battlefield area.

They quickly intercepted and eliminated all of the Blackwater soldiers and were about to redirect their main offensive back to Ning Zhuo's group.

Just then, a figure abruptly broke into the Black Tortoise Army’s formation.

Surrounded by violent, stormy winds with wind blades flying everywhere, this person indiscriminately attacked anyone nearby.

It was the berserk Chen Lingfeng!

Chen Lingfeng was already at the peak of the Golden Core level. Now, having gone completely insane, he fully unleashed his innate potential, elevating his strength to the Nascent Soul level.

He attacked randomly without distinguishing friend from foe, causing headaches for both sides.

Several people tried joining forces to subdue Chen Lingfeng, but the chaotic battlefield significantly increased the difficulty. Moreover, Chen Lingfeng was incredibly swift and unpredictable, making him impossible to pin down for the moment.

Helplessly sighing, the Black Tortoise commander could only fully focus on guarding against Chen Lingfeng, temporarily abandoning their blockade against Ning Zhuo's group.

“Lucky!” Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up.

A direct confrontation with the Black Tortoise Army would have been highly risky.

After all, this was one of the top three armies within the Thousand Peaks Forest. Ning Zhuo’s Mechanical Army mainly served as disposable materials for the Heroic Return Technique, while his Three-Generals Battalion had only recently been established. Even though the Red Flower Battalion was renowned, it had always been undermanned and thus weaker overall compared to the Black Tortoise Army.

They could fight, but victory would be uncertain and losses heavy - even if they won, it would only be a pyrrhic victory.

“Who would’ve thought Chen Lingfeng would inadvertently help us?” Ning Zhuo remarked, gazing towards the battlefield where the Black Tortoise Army fought.

Sun Lingtong responded, “If we hadn’t driven Chen Lingfeng insane first, we wouldn’t have gotten this chance. Technically, we helped ourselves.”

Ning Zhuo's group pressed forward once more!

Soon, they opened distance between themselves and the Black Tortoise Army.

Inside the mechanical carriage, Lin You took advantage of a pause in his fierce battle to glance toward Ning Zhuo’s party.

The distance between the two groups had significantly decreased, making Lin You notice these incoming enemies. However, he remained in place, continuing his intense fight with his current opponent.

Boom!

Xu Dali took a heavy blow and shot across half the battlefield like a falling meteor, crashing down near Ning Zhuo’s group.

Dust and debris filled the air.

In the crater, Xu Dali panted heavily, covered in blood, struggling to stand up.

But the next moment, an intense dizziness overwhelmed him, forcing him down onto one knee.

He was badly injured!

Suddenly - a Shadowless Silhouette emerged!

Xu Dali's shadow abruptly expanded, and from it leaped out a Golden Core cultivator.

This enemy cultivator had a pale, haggard face, disheveled black hair, and wore a tattered black robe. It was none other than Wu Hen - Elder Long’s trusted right-hand man, a figure of equal renown to Chen Lingfeng!

Wu Hen spat out magical power, forming a massive pair of scissors in his hands.

He aimed directly at Xu Dali’s shadow, cutting down viciously.

At this critical juncture, Xu Dali instinctively rolled forward, narrowly avoiding decapitation.

With a grunt, blood splashed onto the ground.

A sharp pain struck him; glancing back, he saw his right arm severed cleanly from his shoulder, left behind on the bloody path.

Xu Dali quickly mobilized his muscular control, attempting to stop the bleeding.

As a Body Cultivator, his physical mastery was extraordinary.

Yet, his usual dependable techniques completely failed at this moment.

Xu Dali retreated rapidly, applying healing techniques, but with minimal effect.

“Shadow Path!” His heart sank - he knew he was in deep trouble. Injuries from Shadow Path techniques couldn't easily be treated by ordinary means.

Normally, he could rely on his higher-level Nascent Soul cultivation to suppress such wounds.

But now, his condition was terrible. Most of his strength was drained, and the fierce fight in the camp had added over a dozen new wounds to his body.

His current combat power had fallen to the Golden Core level.

“Hehehe,” Wu Hen took advantage and pressed his attack.

Shadow Path - Shadow Silk Entanglement!

Strange Path - Mystic Threads Seeking Life.

A dark shadow surged forth, splitting into thousands of fine threads, enveloping Xu Dali completely. The extremely sharp threads tightened swiftly, embedding deeply into his flesh.

"My life ends here!" Immobilized, Xu Dali fell into despair.

In the next instant, a scythe flew with precise force, severing all threads.

Xu Dali narrowly escaped death, momentarily dazed and slow to react.

As a veteran at the Nascent Soul stage, his dazed appearance on the battlefield was proof enough of his severely deteriorated condition.

When he finally regained his composure, he saw a mechanical puppet wielding a mechanical scythe chasing Wu Hen, forcing him to leap frantically about.

The Buddhist Healer - Meng Yaoyin!

Immediately after, Ning Zhuo and his group rushed in aggressively, formidable in numbers and aura.

"Wu Hen!" Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed.

"Damn it!" Having fought Ning Zhuo before, Wu Hen immediately sought an opportunity to flee upon seeing Ning Zhuo and his companions.

"Capture him alive!" Ning Zhuo roared.

Mu Lan glanced at him, took a deep breath, and activated a costly military tactic.

Military Technique - Capture Alive!

The net reappeared, ensnaring Wu Hen.

Du Tiechuan had previously used this method to temporarily imprison Xiang Yue, yet Mu Lan's attempt proved ineffective.

Ordinarily, Mu Lan’s profound mastery of this military technique could completely suppress most Golden Core cultivators.

However, Wu Hen was extraordinary, on par with Chen Lingfeng, practicing a strange cultivation path and holding uncommon advantages!

"Hmph, capturing me alive is wishful thinking!" Wu Hen transformed into a shadowy stream, beginning to slip through the net's gaps.

Suddenly, Buddha Doctor Meng Yaoyin moved abruptly, the scythe flashing brilliantly, creating dazzling arcs of Purple blade light.

The blade strikes hit Wu Hen, knocking him out of shadow form back into his true body.

"Puh."

He spat a mouthful of blood. Already injured from earlier blade wounds and suffering backlash from a failed technique, his injuries became severe, causing him to fall unconscious.

Mu Lan promptly tightened the net, successfully restraining and capturing Wu Hen alive.

The ease of the capture stunned and delighted Ning Zhuo's group.

"Mother!" Ning Zhuo silently exclaimed, sensing Meng Yaoyin’s sudden burst of spirituality.

Yet, Buddha Doctor Meng Yaoyin showed no further response, as if the perfect strike had merely been an illusion.

Ning Zhuo hurriedly put Meng Yaoyin away.

"Young Master Ning Zhuo, I owe you life-saving gratitude!" Xu Dali struggled to stand and thanked Ning Zhuo sincerely.

Ning Zhuo nodded, casually tossing him a healing pill, "General Xu may follow behind our forces."

He wouldn't integrate Xu Dali directly into his army, as incompatible coordination would disrupt battle formations.

Similarly, the Three Generals Camp and Red Flower Camp couldn't accept Xu Dali either.

"Many thanks, Young Master!" Though straightforward, Xu Dali was grateful and respectful toward Ning Zhuo, his savior.

Obediently following Ning Zhuo's group, Xu Dali utilized their military presence to catch his breath and swiftly employ other techniques to restore his combat strength.

Lin You felt tense, noticing Ning Zhuo’s group approaching.

Taking this threat seriously, Lin You coldly snorted, sparing his nearly defeated opponent and decisively controlling his mechanical carriage, initiating a withdrawal with his subordinates.

"Little Zhuo, careful, he's escaping!" Sun Lingtong promptly warned.

Ning Zhuo nodded, affirming briefly, and commanded his troops to intercept Lin You's movement.

Lin You quickly perceived Ning Zhuo's group's intentions.

Suspicion flashed through his mind, "What's going on? Did I coincidentally cross paths with them?"

Ning Zhuo's previous restrained strategy proved crucial at this moment; Lin You could never have anticipated being Ning Zhuo’s prime target.

Lin You swiftly scanned his surroundings, locking onto Ju Bing.

He repositioned once more, using Ju Bing's military formation as cover to block Ning Zhuo's pursuit, buying time to increase their separation.

Gu Ya and Ju Bing were renowned beast-controlling cultivators of Thousand Peaks Forest.

Gu Ya controlled wolf packs, Ju Bing managed pig herds.

Since the start of the great battle, Ju Bing hadn’t entered the central fray.

Though out of character, there was no choice. Earlier fights had resulted in many of Ju Bing’s pig descendants dying at the hands of Ding Pi and Jia Wan, the master and disciple pair.

Ju Bing's pig herd wasn't large to begin with, so he had always been careful about how he used them.

"Hmm?!" Ju Bing furrowed his brows, quickly noticing Ning Zhuo's group charging toward him.

"Since the battle began, my pig herd has dwindled to only forty percent - I can't afford more losses!" Ju Bing began to consider retreat.

The declining morale of the Thousand Peaks Forest Side also affected him, prompting a more cautious strategy.

Thus, his pig herd retreated like a receding tide, clearing a broad path for Ning Zhuo’s group.

Ning Zhuo: "Huh?"

Lin You: "What's going on?!"

Before Ju Bing fully realized his mistake, Ning Zhuo’s party had already rushed forward, drastically shortening the critical distance.

"General Mu Lan, General Liu Er! Whoever captures that person will earn my personal favor!" Ning Zhuo shouted.

Initially, Mu Lan wasn't particularly moved, but Ning Zhuo’s promise immediately sparked excitement in her eyes.

However, Liu Er reacted faster, instantly breaking away from the main force and charging forward alone with enthusiasm.

Guan Hong and Zhang Hei exchanged astonished glances, having never seen their leader act so recklessly brave before.

Mu Lan snorted coldly: "My husband's favor belongs to me!"

She mobilized her battle formation and activated her Dharma Avatar. The crimson flower's true form soared forward rapidly, swiftly enveloping Lin You along with his mechanical carriage.

Combat Technique - Flower Bud Captures the Heart!

Her Crimson Flower Dharma Avatar possessed combat strength on par with a Nascent Soul cultivator, previously trapping the powerful Nascent Soul-level demon Ma Feitui. How could Lin You, a mere Golden Core-level cultivator, possibly resist? He was immediately captured alive.

Another one captured!

"We got him!" Sun Lingtong cheered triumphantly from within the Dragon Head compartment.

Ning Zhuo let out a sigh of relief, finally feeling reassured, and soon after, profound happiness welled up within him.

They had finally succeeded!

Even up to the last moment, Ning Zhuo had concealed his true goal - retrieving the mechanical carriage.
