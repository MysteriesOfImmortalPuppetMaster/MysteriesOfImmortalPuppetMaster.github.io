Chapter 355: Please Teach Me, Miss

At the Little Contention Peak, Martial Arts Arena.

Disciples of the Myriad Medicine Sect were guarding the entrance to the martial arts arena. They carefully checked the identities of those entering and collected entrance spirit stones before allowing cultivators inside.

Due to the fierce competition at Little Contention Peak, the martial arts arenas were always in high demand throughout the year.

A cultivator approached the disciple at the entrance with a smile, asking, “Are there any vacancies in the martial arts arena?”

The disciple glanced at him indifferently, “You again? Last time, I clearly told you that the martial arts arena is fully booked until the end of next month.”

The cultivator nodded and lowered his voice, “I know, but I’ve heard it’s possible to jump the queue if…”

“Stop!” the disciple immediately interrupted him. “What you're talking about did exist, but that was during the previous management. Ever since I took over here, no one has been able to cut the line.”

“You want to bribe me?”

The disciple shook his head, firmly refusing, “That won’t work!”

“Hm?”

Just as they were speaking, the disciple's expression suddenly changed.

He hurried forward, respectfully bowing, “Sister Lin, what brings you here?”

The disciple was a bit puzzled.

After all, someone like Lin Shanshan usually only used the martial arts arenas on the main mountain of the Myriad Medicine Sect, where the facilities were much more advanced. It was rare to see her at this smaller venue.

Lin Shanshan looked slightly flustered but quickly composed herself. “Give me a martial arts arena. Are there any available?”

“Of course!” The disciple immediately patted his chest. “You’re in luck, Sister Lin. There just happens to be a vacancy in one of the arenas.”

Lin Shanshan nodded, trusting him.

“Who is this young man who dares to spar with Sister Lin?” The disciple glanced at Ning Zhuo, unable to gauge the young man's background.

Noticing the look, Ning Zhuo slightly nodded at the disciple, who smiled in return.

“Right this way, Sister Lin,” the disciple led them inside.

As they passed the earlier cultivator, the man stepped aside with envy in his eyes, watching them enter the martial arts arena.

“The fact that I’m seen with Lin Shanshan will certainly spread,” Ning Zhuo thought, pleased with the outcome.

In fact, one of his goals in inviting Lin Shanshan to the arena was to generate this kind of buzz. Being new to the area, he naturally wanted to align himself with someone influential. Lin Shanshan was undoubtedly a good choice.

Everything was going according to Ning Zhuo’s plan.

Along the way, the disciples they passed all greeted Lin Shanshan and cast curious glances at Ning Zhuo. Even many of the visiting cultivators noticed them.

“This is the first time I’ve seen Lin Shanshan bring someone else to use the arena.”

“Who’s the young man with her? I’ve never seen him before.”

“Judging by his bearing, he’s not simple. He must be a high-ranking disciple from another major sect, probably on par with Sister Lin.”

These comments reached Lin Shanshan’s ears, making her ears burn.

Once they entered the martial arts arena, Lin Shanshan said to the disciple, “You can leave now. I’ll manage things from here.”

The disciple hesitated briefly, sensing Lin Shanshan was eager to be alone with the young man. The disciple, much older than Lin Shanshan, had never seen her behave this way with a stranger before.

“Could it be…” The disciple considered a certain possibility but quickly shook his head, dismissing the thought.

Lin Shanshan, the beloved daughter of the Myriad Medicine Sect's leader, was adored by everyone in the sect. Many cultivators secretly admired her, though the disciple harbored no such feelings, viewing her more as a younger relative.

Lin Shanshan activated the martial arts arena’s formation, instantly isolating the interior from the outside world.

She exhaled softly, her tension easing slightly.

“Strange, I’ve entered martial arts arenas many times with my Senior Brother, but why do I feel so nervous and flustered this time?”

Ning Zhuo remained silent, observing the arena and giving Lin Shanshan time to compose herself.

Once Lin Shanshan calmed down, she said, “Young Master Ning Zhuo, please show me your combat techniques so I can understand your capabilities. It’s like diagnosing a patient - you must know the symptoms before prescribing the right treatment.”

Ning Zhuo nodded and immediately demonstrated several Five Elements techniques.

Currently, his main combat strength relied on his mechanical constructs.

The Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Meng Yaoyin, the Night Rain Demon Weapon, the Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, the Floating Ice Jade Hands, and the Ice Snow Weather Sphere - these constructs were powerful enough for Ning Zhuo to challenge even Golden Core cultivators.

Relying on these constructs, Ning Zhuo’s combat strength far exceeded his Foundation Establishment stage, reaching the level of a Golden Core combatant. However, he wasn’t going to use his constructs or reveal his true strength to Lin Shanshan just yet.

On one hand, he wanted to use the Little Contention Peak to hone his skills. If he used his constructs to crush Foundation Establishment cultivators, the training value would be minimal. On the other hand, he needed an excuse to keep interacting with Lin Shanshan. Displaying too much power might make her wary.

By showing relative “weakness,” it would be easier for him to execute his plans.

Ning Zhuo demonstrated several Five Elements spells, all of which were highly proficient.

Lin Shanshan’s eyes lit up in admiration, “I didn’t expect Young Master Ning Zhuo to have such mastery of spells! You’ve even surpassed me. With your abilities, you stand a good chance against Han Zhou.”

Ning Zhuo's skillful use of Five Elements spells impressed Lin Shanshan.

What amazed her most was how naturally and seamlessly Ning Zhuo transitioned between the different elements, an uncommon feat for someone of his age.

“You’re really only sixteen?” Lin Shanshan couldn’t help but ask.

Ning Zhuo smiled and confirmed.

Lin Shanshan sighed, “It’s not that I don’t believe you, but such spell mastery at sixteen is truly extraordinary!”

“I’ve only heard of two or three people like you.”

“To see one in person today is truly remarkable!”

Ning Zhuo's modest display of power piqued Lin Shanshan’s curiosity further.
 
She asked, “Are you a battle cultivator?”

“Since childhood, apart from accumulating mana, how much time have you spent practicing these spells?”

Ning Zhuo thought for a moment before replying, “I haven’t invested too much time in these spells. I’m actually more interested in mechanical techniques than spellcasting.”

“Besides casting spells, I can also use mechanical hands to assist me in battle. Allow me to demonstrate.”

Ning Zhuo retrieved six mechanical arms from his storage belt.

The arms floated in mid-air, circling around Ning Zhuo.

He commanded them to cast various elemental spells - metal, wood, water, fire, and earth - all at once, creating a dazzling display of power and danger.

Lin Shanshan instinctively stepped back, shocked by the ferocity of his attack.

Ning Zhuo quickly retracted the mechanical arms.

“I’m more skilled at long-range spellcasting,” Ning Zhuo explained. “But I’m worried about being caught off guard in close combat. If I get entangled in close quarters, I’ll be at a disadvantage.”

Lin Shanshan nodded, “Let’s try a sparring session, then.”

Ning Zhuo and Lin Shanshan engaged in a close-combat bout, with Ning Zhuo fully utilizing his martial skills. However, he was suppressed throughout the entire match by Lin Shanshan.

“Alright,” Lin Shanshan said, stepping back to create distance between them.

Ning Zhuo, out of breath and pale-faced, nodded.

“Do you know how to use weapons?” Lin Shanshan asked.

Ning Zhuo shook his head, “I’m not proficient with any.”

Lin Shanshan smiled, “Compared to your spells, your close-combat skills are indeed lacking.”

Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly, “Miss Lin, you’re being too polite. I’m well aware of my shortcomings in this area. Please don’t hesitate to criticize.”

Lin Shanshan, five years older than Ning Zhuo, had been trained rigorously by her father, Lin Bufan, since childhood. As his only child, she had received the best guidance.

Lin Shanshan’s spellcasting skills were close to Ning Zhuo’s, but in martial combat, she was far superior.

Ning Zhuo, on the other hand, was mostly self-taught. Even though he attended academies, he received standard education rather than specialized training like Lin Shanshan, who had been nurtured by a Nascent Soul expert from birth.

As a result, while Ning Zhuo’s foundation was solid, it was still average compared to a sect prodigy like Lin Shanshan.

Of course, if Ning Zhuo unleashed his constructs, even ten Lin Shanshans wouldn’t be enough to defeat him.

“Please teach me martial combat!” Ning Zhuo asked directly, without reservation.

He had long recognized his weakness in this area.

It wasn’t that he had been wasting time in the past sixteen years - he had been training diligently every day. However, his focus had been on mechanical techniques rather than close-combat skills.

During the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace, when he encountered combat puppets, he realized the need to improve this weakness but hadn’t had the time to do so.

“Hmm…” Lin Shanshan hesitated.

The Buddha Heart Demon Seal’s lingering influence made her feel that this request was a bit too forward. After all, teaching martial skills often required close physical contact, something inappropriate between men and women.

When Lin Shanshan reached a certain age, both Senior Brother Linghu Jiu and her father, Lin Bufan, stopped personally instructing her and instead arranged for female teachers to take over her martial training.
