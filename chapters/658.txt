Chapter 658: Nirvana Buddha Shadow

As the Fire Element Spells were unleashed, the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere fell silent for several breaths. Then, the Nether Dragon let out a agonized roar.

The sphere's surface began to ripple violently, bulging outward before bursting with a series of explosions, leaving numerous gaping holes.

From these breaches erupted beams of Nirvana Buddhist Light.

"It worked!" Seizing the opportunity, Ning Zhuo shook the Spirit Communication Mirror, recalling Meng Yehu.

As for the Fire Within Wood, it had been completely exhausted, sacrificed as a disposable resource.

Ning Zhuo's improvised Fire Element Spell served only as the correct key. What he lacked was power.

Even with the combined might of the Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art and Military Might, his strength fell short. Only by recklessly detonating the Fire Within Wood as a fire seed could he succeed.

At a tremendous cost, Ning Zhuo achieved his goal, shattering the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere.

Forgetful River Prefecture Lord: ...

"How could he possibly possess a Fire Element Spell that perfectly counters a Water Element seal?!"

"How can a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator like him wield a fire seed?!"

"Qi Luck... Qi Luck..."

At that moment, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord abandoned all hope of luck, feeling a profound chill.

His grand scheme, set in motion from the very beginning, defied the Yang Heaven while aligning with the Nether Heavens. This provoked the backlash of the Living Realm's Destiny, leaving even his position in the Underworld meticulously orchestrated against him.

Yet, what choice did he have?

He was defying the life and death of Heavenly Ghosts, and he sought to cultivate an Acquired Talent!

Even this alone required Heavenly Power, something he couldn't achieve alone.

Thus, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had only two paths: the Nether Heavens or the Yang Heaven.

As the Prefecture Lord of the Underworld Prefecture, overseeing the entire Forgetful River Prefecture, his natural choice was the Nether Heavens.

However, despite the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's broad vision and extensive cultivation experience, he never anticipated that the Yang Heaven's backlash would be so subtle and lethal.

Once unleashed, even a Soul Formation-level powerhouse would find their strength utterly exhausted, powerless to resist Heaven's Will!

Defying Heaven in cultivation was proving far more difficult than he'd imagined.

Ning Zhuo, merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator, had already made the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord realize the true depth of this challenge.

His heart sank to the lowest depths.

At this critical moment, when his power was at its lowest, a Soul Formation-level expert's Lifebound Treasure had broken free!

This would inevitably lead to a catastrophic shift in the battle's momentum!

The Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, once pristine, now resembled a tattered, patched garment. Countless fissures radiated outward from the gaping holes, intertwining and spreading across its surface in chaotic patterns.

The Profound Nether Water Dragons no longer emitted agonized roars of pain, but rather mournful cries. Their bodies writhed violently, struggling to maintain the seal, only to reveal their futile efforts even more clearly.

Boom!

The sphere could no longer maintain its form and explosively shattered!

Billions of Wangchuan Water Droplets, fragments of departed souls, and Yin Fiend Qi erupted like a breached floodgate. At the heart of the explosion, the colossal Nirvana Buddha Phantom finally broke free from all its shackles, reappearing in the world!

The phantom resembled dried, withered wood. Its massive body glowed with a deathly dark gold, etched with deep grooves like cracked earth. Instead of the solemn compassion of ordinary Buddhas, it radiated absolute stillness, finality, and the intent of all methods returning to nothingness!

Roar!

The remnants of the Profound Nether Water Dragons let out a roar woven from terror and fury, driven by the will of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, as they lunged toward the Nirvana Buddha Phantom.

The Evil Flood Dragon bared its fangs and brandished its claws, still radiating brutal power.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom slowly raised its right hand, fingers splayed, palm facing the charging dragon.

There was no ten-thousand-zhang Buddhist light, no resonant Sanskrit chants. Only an absolute, suffocating silence.

In the next instant, the Profound Nether Water Dragons seemed to have their throats crushed. Their roars ceased abruptly, and they froze mid-air.

The Evil Flood Dragons rapidly turned gray, losing all vitality and spiritual energy in an instant, as if frozen into bas-relief murals suspended in mid-air.

Within moments, they began to fade, dissolving into countless gray-white specks of light that scattered into the void, returning to nothingness.

With this obstacle eliminated, the Nirvana Buddha Phantom slowly raised its head, its gaze locking onto the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal.

The National Treasure still hovered above its head, emitting a faint Netherworld glow.

In truth, the moment the Nirvana Buddha Phantom broke free from its confinement, the True Form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had already exerted its full power to recall the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal.

But it failed.

Instead, the National Treasure was firmly seized by the Nirvana Buddha Phantom, preventing its return.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom extended another hand, reaching for the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal.

In response, the seal erupted with majestic national power, forming a protective layer of black light. But the Buddha's colossal hand clenched down, directly reducing the black light to ash, dispersing it into nothingness.

All light within the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal was extinguished, reducing it to a lifeless sculpture. The entire seal was enveloped in a deathly dark golden glow, as if frozen in amber, utterly incapable of emitting even the slightest fluctuation of power.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom swept its gaze across the scene with detached indifference.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom first focused on the Formless Pivot, the critical point of the Heavenly Aspect Formation.

Ning Zhuo stood at its center, maintaining the Confucian technique "Scholar Meets Soldier." Despite being a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, insignificant as an ant, he was the key to disrupting the grand scheme.

"The Living Realm's Qi Luck, the Forgetful River's Human Tribulation..." The Nirvana Buddha Phantom understood instantly.

His gaze, piercing through all illusions, saw through Ning Zhuo's facade in a single glance. Ning Zhuo felt utterly exposed, as naked as if standing in an ice cavern. Overwhelmed by the Silent Extinction Zen, his heart turned to ashes, and he involuntarily ceased the Confucian technique "Scholar Meets Soldier."

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom's gaze swept across the Ceremonial Barracks and the Qing-Jiao Army. To him, this cultivation army was nothing more than a swarm of ants.

Next, he penetrated the Formation's concealment and detected the Void Return Black Sphere.

Finally, his gaze settled on the massive Turbid Qi Barrier formed by the Earth Lung Turbid Qi.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom thought, "A sunken boat sinks deeper, a withered tree greens only in death. Defeat lies hidden in the Heavenly Chess, a faint light becomes a star of battle."

"So this is the meaning of the first half of the inscription."

At its core, this was the Soundless Ghost Monk's Lifebound Buddha Wheel, driven by his divine sense and empowered by the Silent Extinction Buddha's divine power.

This was the Divine Summoning Art!

Just as the Qing-Jiao Army activated the Ceremonial Barracks and summoned the Night Wanderer before the war, the Soundless Ghost Monk was employing a similar strategy in this battle.

For the Soundless Ghost Monk, this conflict was of paramount importance.

He and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord were sworn enemies. If the Prefecture Lord achieved enlightenment, the balance of power would shift, potentially sealing the monk's doom.

Therefore, he would spare no effort in this battle to obstruct the Prefecture Lord's path to enlightenment!

Like Yin Jiuzhu and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, the Soundless Ghost Monk also had means of divination.

However, while the former two relied on others for divination, the monk prayed to the Buddha, receiving an enigmatic revelation.

The Soundless Ghost Monk unleashed his Lifebound Buddha Wheel. When the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord sealed it with the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal, he immediately sensed something amiss, smelling the stench of conspiracy.

His intuition was correct!

Though his True Form had been wounded and retreated, the Lifebound Buddha Wheel retained a reserve of tremendous power, saved for this final, desperate gambit!

Now, the Nirvana Buddha Phantom had become the decisive force in this final confrontation.

With a wave of its phantom hand, the Nirvana Buddha Phantom snatched the Void Return Black Sphere!

The Void Return Finger had originally been unleashed by the Soundless Ghost Monk. Though its power had been greatly depleted through mutual attrition, it still held potential for exploitation.

Wherever the Void Return Black Sphere passed, everything was devoured and obliterated.

It acted like a terrifying eraser, wiping clean everything in its path.

Ning Zhuo watched as the Void Return Black Sphere hurtled toward him. A fierce will to survive broke through his deathly stillness, compelling him to risk flight.

The surrounding environment was hostile, but fortunately, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had rigorously trained their flight techniques in the past.

Just as Ning Zhuo took flight, the Void Return Black Sphere swept past, directly devouring the Formless Pivot.

Ning Zhuo's Confucian techniques had greatly disrupted the Formless Pivot, but they couldn't destroy it. The Void Return Black Sphere, however, was different - it completely annihilated the Formless Pivot with immediate effect!

Without the Formless Pivot's support and control, the entire Formation Space began to collapse completely.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom cared nothing for Ning Zhuo's life, regarding him as a trivial insect.

After absorbing the Void Return Black Sphere, the phantom infused it with fresh Netherworld Finger Force, causing its size to swell by thirty percent.

With a gentle push, the Nirvana Buddha Phantom propelled the Void Return Black Sphere against the formidable Turbid Qi Barrier of the Earth Lung.

Sizzle... Sizzle-sizzle-sizzle...

A faint, rapid, and chilling sound of dissolution filled the air, sending shivers down the spine.

The Turbid Qi Barrier instantly collapsed, greedily devoured by the Void Return Black Sphere, relentlessly torn into that profound, lightless void of extinction.

However, the Void Return Black Sphere's power rapidly diminished in the process, its volume continuously shrinking.

After devouring a passage through the entire Turbid Qi Barrier, the Void Return Black Sphere vanished completely at the endpoint.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom charged through this massive breach, boldly plunging into the heart of the battlefield.

Luo Si was astonished.

He had been teetering on the brink of defeat, enduring immense hardship just to hold on, only to be rescued not by Ning Zhuo, but by a Buddha.

Regardless, he was now saved.

Luo Si swiftly retreated.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord sighed, and the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God abandoned Luo Si to confront the Nirvana Buddha Phantom directly.

"Soundless Ghost Monk," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord called out, "you claim to follow Buddhist teachings, yet you remain so deluded? Your True Form has already retreated, grievously wounded. How much power do you truly possess now?"

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom's power was indeed waning, primarily because it needed to constantly suppress the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal, draining its strength.

Earlier, when it used the Void Return Black Sphere and Netherworld Finger Force to pierce the Earth Qi Barrier, it had applied the force with pinpoint precision - just enough to breach the barrier, no more, no less. This extreme conservation of power had already revealed its true state.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom scoffed. "Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, how much better off are you? Your True Form can only spectate while your Divided Spirit... has likely even lost its undergarments, hasn't it?"

As the words hung in the air, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God deflated again, his form shrinking by another tenth.

Forgetful River Prefecture Lord: ...

Luo Si's Nine Abyss Water-Draining Net, which he had cast on his Divided Spirit, had been shattered by the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God. Luo Si retrieved half of the Netherworld Ferrying Line.

However, the root cause of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's Qi leakage remained within the Forgetful River Immortal City. Without the Nine Abyss Water-Draining Net, the problem remained unresolved.

The Nirvana Buddha Phantom wasn't about to be deceived by mere words. As the conversation continued, it steadily approached the Sacrificial Altar.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let out a guttural roar, intercepting the Nirvana Buddha Phantom mid-approach.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The moment they clashed, it was a fierce, white-hot battle.

The Black Cloud Battlefield rapidly began to collapse.

Earlier, Ning Zhuo had exhausted himself using his Confucian techniques to exert a significant influence. But now, the Void Return Black Sphere had crushed the Formless Pivot, utterly destroying it.

This shattered the grand formation's foundation, like a tower already swaying and unstable suddenly losing its base. Collapse and destruction were inevitable.

Since the Black Cloud Battlefield was the manifestation of the grand formation, it naturally couldn't endure.

Ning Zhuo once again embarked on a desperate escape.

This was the umpteenth time.

For someone at the mere Foundation Establishment stage to involve himself in such a battlefield was incredibly dangerous. Most of his time was spent fleeing for his life.

However, he was more worried about the Qing-Jiao Army than himself.

"At least I have my Black Iron Han Armor to protect me. But these soldiers don't have that. If something goes wrong, they might plummet from the dizzying heights of the Cloud Layer."

"Huh?!"

The next moment, Ning Zhuo's face lit up with surprise.

A dim light flickered around him, and a yin wind materialized out of nowhere, swirling around his limbs.

This scene felt familiar to Ning Zhuo - the Night Wanderer Divine Art was activating!

"So much time has passed, yet this Night Wanderer Divine Art is still active."

"The Night Wanderer we summoned is truly extraordinary!"

Ning Zhuo's worries about the Qing-Jiao Army's situation vanished.

Their charge into the Cloud Layer had relied on the Night Wanderer Divine Art. However, once they entered the Black Cloud Battlefield, their enemies activated a Grand Formation that suppressed the Night Wanderer Divine Art, forcing the Qing-Jiao Army to fight on foot.

Now that most of the Heavenly Aspect Formation had been destroyed, leaving only the core of the Sacrificial Altar intact, the situation had changed. The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, preoccupied with the Nirvana Buddha Phantom's attacks, had no time to intervene. With the suppression lifted, the Qing-Jiao Army regained their ability to fly.

"Qing Chi, lead the Qing-Jiao Army down. It's too dangerous up here!" Ning Zhuo commanded remotely through the Life Hanging by a Thread technique, his divine sense carrying his voice.

The Qing-Jiao Army was still too fragile.

Throughout this scale of battle, aside from their initial impact, they could only serve as a provider of military might. A slight misfortune, such as a glancing blow from a Soul Formation-level technique, could spell their complete annihilation.

Forget that; even the Night Wanderer Divine Art might run out of power at any moment. If that happened, all the cultivators in the Qing-Jiao Army below Golden Core-level, save for a few exceptions, would plummet to their deaths.

Ning Zhuo still needed them to provide military might, so having them descend first was the prudent choice.

Qing Chi immediately accepted the order, disassembled the Ceremonial Barracks, and handed them over to Jiao Ma's biological father. She escorted the Qing-Jiao Army down, entrusting them to their father halfway down before soaring back up to rejoin the battle.

"Qing Chi, listen..." Ning Zhuo sensed a sudden shift in her through Life Hanging by a Thread.

Qing Chi's eyes blazed with unyielding resolve. "I won't! I must avenge them! The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord must pay with blood!"

"And..."

"Little Ma, you're all I have left. I'll fight by your side, and if it means death, then let's die together!"

Ning Zhuo's heart trembled, his expression complex.
