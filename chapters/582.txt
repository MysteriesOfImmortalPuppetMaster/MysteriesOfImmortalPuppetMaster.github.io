Chapter 582: Again Facing Assassination

“Hee hee hee…” The small-headed ghosts, each the size of a millstone, floated in midair, leaping up and down.

“Ha yi ha yi ha yi…” The large-headed ghosts, as big as a carriage compartment, pulled faces and bobbed up and down in the surging yin energy like rolling stones.

The initial ghost tide basically consisted of these two types of ghosts.

They surged like a tide, intermingling with one another, continuously crashing against White Paper Immortal City.

The commander of the city guard, holding an iron fan one zhang and eight chi long, stood atop the city wall, looking down at the city below.

The small-headed and large-headed ghosts rolled and collided against the wall, causing it to tremble and unleashing talismans.

The talismans emitted a dim light that turned into water, forming a black tide that engulfed the surrounding ghosts and caused them to sink into the dark water.

Some of the large-headed ghosts spat out yin energy, creating rising gusts of yin wind.

The small-headed ghosts rode the yin winds and charged toward the city wall, attempting to scale it.

The city guards stationed on the wall sprang into action, continuously hacking with paper made halberds and greatswords.

Each small-headed ghost that was cut down either fell into the black water and couldn’t rise again, or simply transformed into a piece of talisman paper on which ink had vividly painted its likeness.

The city wall absorbed these talisman papers, adding them to its surface and applying a new layer.

The commander of the city guard said nothing as he witnessed the entire assault from beginning to end.

The first wave of the ghost tide had come to an end.

The defenses of the White Paper Immortal City were formidable and remained unshaken. The city guards were experienced and dealt with the assault with composure.

Yet the commander of the city guard was deeply worried.

He had received reports that a portion of the city guards had searched the city several times but still could not discover where this squad of water-ghost yin soldiers had emerged from.

Their initial guess was the Ghost Gate Pass, but the city guards had not seen a trace of Ghost Gate Pass.

As long as this high‑level internal traitor was not captured, there would be no peace!

“If this continues, sooner or later our city will face difficulties inside and out, and the chances of it being breached will only increase.”

“Sigh, I might as well go discuss this with Sang Le Youling ( Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer ).”

Seeing that the city defenses were temporarily secure, the commander of the city guard decisively slung his giant iron fan onto his back and entered the city to see Sang Le Youling.

Since the last attack, Sang Le Youling had been lying on a sickbed.

“Commander Tie,” Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer said as she half-sat up on the bed, only to set off a fit of coughing.

Commander Tie Guzheng saw Sang Le Youling and couldn’t help but furrow his brows. “At present, the lord of the city is self‑sealed within her mansion, and you lie on a sickbed, yet the ghost tide has arrived ahead of schedule…”

Sang Le Youling’s face was pale as she forced out a smile. “Isn’t there still you, Commander Tie? I already know the purpose of your visit, which is nothing more than to investigate the source of those yin-soldier water ghosts.”

“Without a doubt, there is a traitor in our city who occupies a high position, otherwise those water ghosts would not be unaffected by the city’s great formation.”

Tie Guzheng hesitated for a moment, then said, “Sang Le, you may need to divine on this matter.”

Sang Le Youling shook her head. “I need time to recover my injuries.”

“If I force the divination, it will surely delay my healing, making a full recovery impossible.”

“This is more likely the enemy’s scheme to wear me out.”

“At present, the overall situation is manageable and does not require us to be so pressed.”

“Although the internal traitor is unaffected by the great formation, the water-ghost yin soldiers he summons are affected. So long as their numbers are not large, the more that come, the more are doomed, and they can easily be exterminated by the city guards.”

Sang Le Youling saw the situation clearly. “The key to the ghost tide has always been our city lord.”

“And to restore the lord’s condition, we must focus on yang energy.”

“Our enemy planted us at risk when recruiting so many male concubines; it’s time to let them play their role.”

Tie Guzheng nodded. “I understand. I will have people distribute pills to the Hidden Yang Residence, the Zhuangyang, Yingyang, and Jiaoyang Institutes.”

After the two discussed matters, Tie Guzheng reminded Sang Le Youling to take good care of herself, then took his leave.

Moments later, he returned. “There is one matter I almost forgot to mention.”

Sang Le Youling helplessly sat up. “What… wait! You are not Commander Tie!”

Before her words finished, the assassin disguised as Tie Guzheng let out a sinister laugh and suddenly attacked Sang Le Youling.

Boom boom boom…

The two collided with a tremendous noise.

Tie Guzheng, who had just stepped out of the courtyard, was shocked and immediately turned back to aid them.

He was quite close and burst into Sang Le Youling’s room, but the attacker decisively fled. Tie Guzheng’s eyes filled with hatred, but all he saw was the last corner of the assailant’s garment being transmitted away.

Leaning against a corner of the wall, Sang Le Youling saw Tie Guzheng appear and let out a breath, involuntarily coughing up a mouthful of fresh blood.

Her old injury had been compounded by a new one, and all the time she had spent recovering was wasted.

-----
First‑Class Room Number One.

Sun Lingtong drank a few sips of water, calming his mood.

He told Ning Zhuo what had happened, lamenting that a Golden Core cultivator like Jin Yangzi had perished just like that.

Ning Zhuo felt little emotion. “Warfare is perilous. In the War of Two Note Country, campaign against the Thousand Peak Forest, many Golden Core cultivators perished in the same way. White Paper Immortal City faces dangers both inside and out; the clouds are turbulent and treacherous. We must be more cautious and avoid drawing too much attention, lest we be targeted by the traitor.”

Sun Lingtong shook his head, emphasizing, “Jin Yangzi was not an ordinary Golden Core cultivator; he was a true heir of a national superpower! His own strength was formidable, and I suspect he could, to some extent, contend with a Nascent Soul cultivator.”

“Unfortunately, the ambusher was even stronger; with the combination of the Hidden Dragon Sect’s prowess and the Hidden Scales of the Dragon Pool Formation, they were too powerful and annihilated Jin Yangzi.”

“My identity here has already been exposed. I will undoubtedly be discovered by that internal traitor. Little Zhuo, you must be extra careful from now on! Otherwise, you might as well revert to your original identity and leave this place.”

Ning Zhuo nodded, finding the suggestion very good.

Sun Lingtong then concealed himself inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, returning to their original arrangements.

Just as Ning Zhuo was about to depart, a paper servant summoned him, announcing the decree of the Silver‑Robed Chief Steward - the ghost tide had descended, the entire White Paper Immortal City would begin martial law, and with another traitor’s appearance, the city guard would begin a thorough investigation of all suspicious individuals. Furthermore, the Hidden Yang Residence would activate its great formation, and no male concubine was allowed to go out!

Sun and Ning were both somewhat surprised.

Sun Lingtong only brought back intelligence about the ambush and Jin Yangzi’s grim fate; he was unaware of the ghost tide.

“If I act in my true form, I fear I’ll have to evade the city guard.”

After all, Ning Zhuo had sneaked into the city using the identity of Jiao Ma.

“What if I were to do so?” Ning Zhuo insisted on leaving, and the Mechanism Ring on his finger quietly shrank!

Ning Zhuo glanced at the ring on his finger, his expression grave.

He told Sun Lingtong his conjecture: “It seems that the internal traitor may have traced Jiao Ma’s identity through your appearance. If I leave, I’ll be killed to silence me. It’s actually better to stay…”

Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, but the ring gave no response.

He continued: “It’s actually a better choice to stay.”

Sun Lingtong shrugged. “Then let’s do that.”

Both of them were adaptable and decisively stayed, refraining from going out recklessly.

Sun Lingtong pondered: “The Hidden Yang Residence houses a large number of male concubines. This concerns the White Paper City Lord’s condition, so its defenses are stringent; it won’t be easy for the internal traitor to act. In the short term, it should be our ideal refuge.”

The two of them began to make extensive arrangements in that room, adding many security measures.

After two hours of busy work, they finally stopped.

Ning Zhuo took out his newly added life‑origin artifact, the Spirit‑Communing Mirror.

“Boss, let’s study and discuss further the use of this precious mirror. I still feel there is much to explore.”

Ning Zhuo was in high spirits.

Sun Lingtong nodded. “It was thanks to this mirror that I was rescued. Using it to deploy sentient mechanized constructs is extremely convenient.”

Sun Lingtong’s escape from the Hidden Dragon Sect’s formation was due to Ning Zhuo tracing his life thread, sending him back.

Naturally, Sun Lingtong was full of spirit and cooperated willingly; from a certain perspective, he could be seen as an exceptionally agile flesh‑and‑blood mechanized puppet.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong began practice.

They mainly focused on using the mirror to instantly teleport and deploy Sun Lingtong.

“It won’t do, it won’t do!” After being deployed by the mirror’s light a few times, Sun Lingtong was dizzy to the extreme and nauseated.

“My physical foundation is sufficient, and I have absorbed the Evil Void God’s bones, so I can withstand such communing and deployment. But I’m dizzy and disoriented, unable to fight immediately.” Sun Lingtong shook his head. 

This issue could not be resolved, and the tactic was a failure.

Ning Zhuo frowned in thought. “Then I’ll try with a construct.”

He took out the Shadow Edge Blade: Night Tiger.

The life thread descended, linking Ning Zhuo and the Night Tiger.

Ning Zhuo held up the mirror and shone it, first collecting the Tiger into the mirror, then shining it again to deploy it at a distance.

Night Tiger followed Ning Zhuo’s intent and immediately attacked without hesitation, slicing the target into four or five pieces!

“Brilliant!” Sun Lingtong praised.

He could see that Night Tiger’s state was not affected in the slightest.

Ning Zhuo, more prudent by nature, continued to experiment several times, thoroughly confirming that Night Tiger remained at its peak state throughout.

Sun Lingtong looked at the mirror. “The technique the Three Sects Masters designed, the ‘Mirror Platform Spiritual Communication Technique,’ was clearly meant to coordinate with mechanized constructs. This is the true use of this life‑origin artifact!”

Ning Zhuo nodded, agreeing with this interpretation.

He gazed at Night Tiger, his heart stirred. “In that case, we should upgrade Night Tiger with higher‑grade precious materials.”

Without a doubt, the mirror’s deployment capability had extremely strong tactical value.

Having participated in the wars of Two Note Country, Ning Zhuo instantly recognized this fact.

The Buddhist Healer, Meng Yaoyin, was a trump card; Ning Zhuo would not use her lightly before the time was right.

The Heavy‑Armored Blood Ape, Dasheng, was meant to guard at his side, so the mirror’s deployment was of little significance to it.

Night Tiger, specializing in surprise attacks and assaults, would benefit enormously from the mirror’s teleportation use, as if adding wings to a tiger!

“This method will likely become my most frequently used move,” Ning Zhuo realized.

It wasn’t that his Five Elements spells were poor; combined with the Spirit God Arts of the Five Viscera Temple, he could cast them quickly and powerfully. But even at lightning speed, they still took a few breaths of time and consumed his own magical power.

The combination of the Spirit Mirror and the Night Tiger required only a second to shake the mirrow.

Night Tiger would immediately engage in close combat, far more stable and enduring than Golden Core level techniques, because it had more attack methods and was more threatening!

Ning Zhuo shifted his cultivation focus, temporarily investing in improving Night Tiger’s materials.

He was now at the Talisman Stage of the Foundation Establishment realm, which primarily tested his understanding of his cultivation method. The deeper his comprehension, the more complete the spell talismans he could obtain.

Once he obtained three complete spell talismans, Ning Zhuo could ascend to the next stage.

Contemplating the cultivation method again, it was another water‑powered method, making gains unstable. In comparison, improving his body, soul, or Night Tiger’s materials was more pragmatic, as each cultivation session yielded tangible gains.

Sun Lingtong used the Yin‑Yang Qi Kettle to convert yin energy while Ning Zhuo immersed himself in cultivation.

When it was time for dinner, the paper servant brought many pills and related orders.

The orders required all the male concubines to take the pills, exert all their strength to produce more yang energy, convert more yin energy, and contribute to the overall situation of White Paper Immortal City.

Male concubines ranked in the city’s records would receive more cultivation resources.

Ning Zhuo learned the details of these resources and was somewhat tempted.

The rest aside, the spiritual food pills could greatly enhance his soul’s foundation. This was a treatment rarely enjoyed elsewhere. Even if he could access it elsewhere, the cost would be far greater!

Ning Zhuo accepted the pills, used the spiritual food, and was about to cultivate when someone came to visit unannounced.

Ning Zhuo touched his ring, opened the door, and saw the visitor.

The visitor had a full beard and exuded a strong masculine aura - it was Yang Weida.

“Jiao Ma, how did you like my Virility Elixir? Want another batch? I’ll give you a 30% discount!” Yang Weida stated his purpose as soon as he spoke.

Ning Zhuo understood.

Obviously, not only he but other male concubines had also received a large quantity of Yang Pills. This situation would inevitably deal a strong blow to Yang Weida’s oinment business.

This compelled Yang Weida to take the initiative and sell as much as he could.

Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and took two large boxes of Virility Elixirs, then tried to send Yang Weida on his way.

But Yang Weida did not hurry to leave; instead, he told Ning Zhuo: “Jiao Ma, thank you for supporting my business. As expected from one of us.”

“I’ve interacted with many other male concubines and gathered quite a bit of intelligence.”

“Let me tell you, the situation in the city is very dangerous. The Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was attacked again, and the assailant was extremely decisive and bold. Commander Tie Guzheng had just left when he struck Sang Le Youling.”

“The Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer is the city lord’s right‑hand aide. This time she was severely wounded and is not in good condition.”

Ning Zhuo was shocked and felt helpless after careful inquiry.

He had originally wanted to find a way to contact the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer in secret to have her divine.

But now Sang Le Youling had been stabbed again and seriously injured.

In these circumstances, her surroundings would be heavily guarded. How could Ning Zhuo approach her?

“And as the ghost tide grows larger, the city’s martial law will deepen.”

“If we cannot find Sang Le Youling again in the short term, there may be no opportunity at all.”

Sang Le Youling is the city lord’s right‑hand aide with high rank and power and will surely devote herself entirely to the city’s defense, making it impossible to spare time for “small matters” like Ning Zhuo’s divination.
