Chapter 688: Second Natal Magical Artifact

Su Lingkou hesitated, glancing at Lin Jinglong before her.

Lin Jinglong was of the same caliber as Shen Xi, a young prodigy who had long since made a name for himself. Su Lingkou knew his identity well, but her intense gaze was now focused on Gongsun Yan.

Gongsun Yan stood beside Lin Jinglong, his subordinate.

His appearance was strikingly inhuman, radiating fiery Qi that raised the surrounding air temperature with even a brief presence.

His skin resembled bronze, crisscrossed with lava-like fissures. His right arm was wrapped in dragon-scale fire-resistant cloth, while the bones of his left arm were exposed, gleaming with a dark golden luster. Cold marrow shackles bound his ankles.

What truly concerned Su Lingkou was the intelligence she had gathered about Gongsun Yan.

"This is the man with the low-grade Melting Heart Innate Talent. Ah... if only Cousin had possessed such talent."

Lin Jinglong, tall and lean, still wore his signature azure robes trimmed with gold embroidery. He smiled faintly at Shen Xi. "Brother Shen, where is Ning Zhuo, the recruit you mentioned? How should we proceed with our duel?"

It turned out that after Shen Xi, Yu Heye, and Ning Zhuo had gathered for drinks at Boulder Cave Mansion, Shen Xi returned to inform Situ Xing that Ning Zhuo had been confirmed as qualified to join their group.

To strengthen his argument, Shen Xi even presented the Ghost Path Golden Cores Ning Zhuo had given him.

Situ Xing frowned slightly. "Even if Ning Zhuo gave you these Ghost Path Golden Cores, it doesn't prove his own strength."

Situ Xing continued his speculation: "Ning Zhuo's every move reeks of political maneuvering, just like the tactics of our Great Clan disciples. But he's never personally intervened in any conflict. It's likely his elders suppressed Yu Heye from behind the scenes."

"Or, more likely, he bribed Yu Heye with some rare treasures or materials."

As he spoke, Situ Xing glanced pointedly at the Ghost Path Golden Cores in Shen Xi's hand, his gaze almost accusing: Shen Xi, were you bribed too? Is that why you're singing Ning Zhuo's praises to me, trying to get him into our group?

Situ Xing possessed his own pride and knew that his alliance with Lin Jinglong and Shen Xi would undoubtedly shine brightly at the Flying Cloud Assembly.

In recent days, many cultivators had proactively sought him out, eager to join his group.

A considerable number even offered Situ Xing bribes.

After all, joining a powerful faction would make navigating the Flying Cloud Assembly far easier.

Su Lingkou's willow-leaf brows arched sharply as she retorted, "This Ghost Path Golden Core wasn't cheap! My cousin had to sacrifice his Array Gap Shuttle, a magic treasure, to repay the favor!"

"Situ Xing, stop making baseless assumptions."

Situ Xing snorted coldly, unwilling to stoop to arguing with a mere girl.

Though he didn't directly refute Su Lingkou, he refused to let go of his harassment.

As a scion of a Great Clan, Situ Xing's mind quickly devised a new method of torment.

He fixed his gaze on Shen Xi, dredging up old grievances. He reminded everyone how he had previously defeated both Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong to claim first place, yet their subsequent duel had ended in a draw.

"Now that we're establishing our own faction, we naturally need a fair and transparent ranking system."

"However, it would be unseemly to have Brother Shen and Brother Lin face off again. How about this: since Brother Shen so strongly recommends Ning Zhuo, let Ning Zhuo participate in the battle."

"As for Brother Lin, he brought the most subordinates among us. He's sure to find a capable fighter."

Shen Xi pondered for a moment, then nodded with a smile.

He had unwavering confidence in Ning Zhuo.

Thus, the current scene unfolded in the Martial Arts Hall.

Shen Xi couldn't reach Ning Zhuo, and the battle seemed lost before it even began.

Lin Jinglong clasped his hands in a fist salute. "In that case, I accept your concession, Brother Shen."

Shen Xi was naturally unwilling to concede.

He had deliberately relinquished the first seat to manipulate Situ Xing into taking the lead. But the second seat had always been his target.

How could he safeguard his interests as the third-ranked member?

The second position was perfect - moderate risk with substantial rewards. In Shen Xi's mind, it was the ideal spot.

Unfortunately, Lin Jinglong shared the same ambition.

Elite scions of Great Clans were never simple.

"Brother Ning's absence must be due to unforeseen circumstances," Shen Xi argued, defending his position. "But if we declare victory simply because our opponent is absent, Brother Lin, do you truly wish to claim such an unfair advantage?"

The smile on Lin Jinglong's face faded slightly.

Seizing the opportunity, Shen Xi proposed, "How about a best-of-three match? We'll concede this round to you."

Lin Jinglong pondered for a moment before nodding in agreement.

Shen Xi was adept at the art of compromise and negotiation. He acknowledged Lin Jinglong's gain while preserving his own opportunity to continue the competition.

"Very well," Lin Jinglong conceded. "Let's proceed as you suggest."

Su Lingkou, however, protested indignantly, "How can you let him get away with such an easy win? Ning Zhuo may be absent, but I'm still here!"

She turned to Shen Xi, her eyes blazing with determination. "Cousin, I'll fight in the next round and secure our first victory!"

Shen Xi hesitated. "But...

Su Lingkou's usual demure demeanor vanished, replaced by a fierce glint in her eyes. "Cousin!"

Shen Xi chuckled wryly and reached out to touch her forehead. "Alright, be careful. If the battle turns against you, concede immediately. Losing to Fellow Daoist Gongsun is no shame - it's the same as losing to Brother Lin."

Lin Jinglong, a scion of a Great Clan, spoke with polished grace and an air of amiable composure.

A sharp glint flashed in Lin Jinglong's eyes as he quickly offered a few modest words, expressing his expectations to Su Lingkou.

Turning to Gongsun Yan, he said, "Fellow Daoist Gongsun, I'm counting on you this time."

Gongsun Yan replied gruffly, "After the deed is done, don't skimp on the firewood you promised."

Lin Jinglong smiled. "Of course not. You have my word."

Gongsun Yan possessed innate talent and held an exceptional position among Lin Jinglong's subordinates, truly deserving of such special treatment.

The two descended to the Martial Arts Arena.

The vast plaza, paved with massive gray-white stone bricks, was as smooth as a mirror, its edges lined with flowing runes. A faint golden protective barrier, formed by a Formation, separated the arena's interior from the outside world.

Gongsun Yan and Su Lingkou stood facing each other, the atmosphere rapidly tensing.

Seeing Su Lingkou's petite frame, clad in a short, cross-collared tunic and pleated skirt that made her look like the girl next door, Gongsun Yan said in a deep voice, "Miss Su, you've drawn the short straw facing me. I'll give you a chance - I'll let you attack first."

Lin Jinglong's brow furrowed imperceptibly, then smoothed out again.

Su Lingkou narrowed her eyes, feeling underestimated. "You'll regret this," she said coldly.

With a flick of her wrist, the Mystic Water Kan Cord and Purple Fire Li Cord shot forth from her wrist.

The two cords pierced the air, each trailing fine ice crystals and sparks in their wake.

Gongsun Yan took a deep breath, steeling his resolve. He cast a defensive spell, enveloping himself in a semi-transparent sphere of fire.

To his surprise, the cords swerved around the fiery barrier.

Su Lingkou formed a hand seal, silently chanting, "Yin-Yang Interlock!"

The cords twisted mid-air, instantly forming a luminous knot shaped like two Taiji Fish, their heads and tails interlocked in an endless cycle.

As the Yin Fish swallowed the Yang Eye and the Yang Fish devoured the Yin Pupil, the glowing knot crashed to the ground with a resounding hum that reverberated across the Martial Arts Arena.

A layer of Profound Ice instantly spread across the gray-white stone tiles, its frigid Qi surging upward to encase Gongsun Yan's feet in a thin sheet of ice.

Scorching. Yet beneath the bone-chilling cold, Gongsun Yan sensed an underlying heat.

He dared not underestimate his opponent. He retrieved a small hammer Magic Artifact and gripped it tightly.

In the next instant, the muscles in his left arm bulged as he slammed the hammer against the ice.

Dong! The hammer struck like a drumbeat. The ice shattered, erupting in a torrent of crimson Flowing Fire.

While Gongsun Yan was entangled with the Flowing Fire, Su Lingkou's gaze remained calm. She lifted the hem of her skirt, and the seventy-two pearls adorning it shot forth silently, scattering around Gongsun Yan like stars in the night sky.

With a thought, Su Lingkou retrieved the Plain Silver Array Plate and held it in her left hand. The plate was studded with fine needles connected by delicate threads.

"Activate Array!" she intoned sharply, and the formation plate erupted in brilliant, otherworldly light.

Gongsun Yan swept aside the Flowing Fire with his hammer and strode toward Su Lingkou.

But as he moved, the pearls around him began to glow, forming illusory ropes that layered around him, hindering his advance.

Gongsun Yan channeled his Spell into the hammer and swung it again in a sweeping arc.

Though the illusory ropes shattered, they instantly transformed into a barrage of needle-like beams of light that pierced through Gongsun Yan's Protective Fire Shield.

The beams struck his bronze-like skin with metallic clangs, raining down relentlessly like a torrential downpour.

Enduring the assault, Gongsun Yan exhaled two streams of golden-white fire from his nostrils.

The fire streams coiled around his neck, arms, and even the hammer's handle like fiery dragons.

The hammer seemed to come alive, its power surging exponentially!

Gongsun Yan swung the hammer wildly once more, obliterating the remaining illusory ropes in a series of explosive strikes.

The reaction reached Su Lingkou's side as the fine strings on her formation plate snapped one by one, sending the inserted needles flying. One grazed her cheek, leaving a thin trail of blood.

Her expression grave, Su Lingkou didn't hesitate. She parted her lips slightly, bit the tip of her tongue, and spat a mouthful of vital essence onto the formation plate.

The plate hummed!

Eight illusory ropes surged forth, coiling around Gongsun Yan's body and limbs. The small hammer in his hand was completely enveloped in layers of rope.

Chaos Coiling Intestines... Knot!

The formation plate creaked under the strain. Su Lingkou poured every ounce of her strength into forming the knot.

Once the knot was complete, the Formation would be fully activated, sealing Gongsun Yan on the spot.

Gongsun Yan knew this was the critical moment.

Without hesitation, his heart pounded like a war drum, accelerating its rhythm to unleash his Innate Talent and summon a surge of Heartfire.

The Heartfire erupted, engulfing him in flames yet leaving him unharmed.

When the Heartfire touched the illusory ropes, they instantly glowed red, softened, and then melted away one by one.

Su Lingkou matched his efforts, replenishing each melted rope with all her might.

The two were locked in a stalemate!

Crack.

A hairline fracture appeared at the edge of the formation plate.

Gongsun Yan coughed up blood from all seven orifices, feeling as if he were being crushed by a giant python, his body on the verge of shattering from the inside out.

Outside the arena, Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong exchanged a glance before simultaneously shouting:

"Stop, Fellow Daoist Gongsun!"

"Cousin, cease hostilities!"

Gongsun Yan and Su Lingkou harbored no deep-seated grudges. Hearing the calls, they gradually withdrew their power, ultimately releasing each other.

This was merely a friendly exchange, not a life-or-death struggle, nor a settling of scores.

While neither Gongsun Yan nor Su Lingkou could match Lin Jinglong or Shen Xi in strength, they were both valuable subordinates to the latter two. A mutually destructive exchange resulting in severe injuries would be a significant loss for both sides.

Moreover, any lingering injuries could jeopardize their participation in the upcoming Flying Cloud Assembly, making the situation even more dire.

"Cousin, I didn't win..." Su Lingkou returned to Shen Xi's side, her face etched with guilt.

Shen Xi waved his hand, stopping her apology. "Fellow Daoist Gongsun's strength is remarkable," he reassured her. "There's no need for a mutually destructive outcome. I wouldn't want you to risk your life for me like that."

A faint blush crept across Su Lingkou's cheeks.

Lin Jinglong interjected, "Brother Shen, how about we declare this match a draw?"

Shen Xi nodded in agreement.

"Best of three," Lin Jinglong said. "Let's schedule the next match for three days from now. Brother Shen, that should give you enough time to gather your allies, right?"

Shen Xi forced a bitter smile. "I'll do my best and leave the rest to fate. That's all I can promise."

As Lin Jinglong and Gongsun Yan departed, Su Lingkou's face clouded with worry. "Cousin, do you really think Ning Zhuo can handle this?"

"His mastery of the Five Elements is indeed remarkable, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's a formidable fighter."

Shen Xi replied, "I trust Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo."

"However, I must admit, I've never actually seen him in combat."

"I see..."

"I'll send him another urgent message immediately. But we should also start looking for other potential candidates."

Ning Zhuo remained unaware of the urgent message.

At that moment, he was completely absorbed in another task: crafting his Natal Magical Artifact!

Earlier, while cultivating the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual, he had successfully planted a Phenomenal Seed Talisman and obtained the Natal Spirit Communication Art. This had allowed him to create the Spirit Communication Mirror.

Now, having successfully planted a second Phenomenal Seed Talisman, he had acquired the Natal-level Five Elements Creation and Destruction Art, naturally enabling him to forge a second Natal Magical Artifact.

This was one of the great advantages of Three Dantian Concurrent Cultivation.

Most cultivators possessed only one Lifebound Treasure.

But in theory, Ning Zhuo could wield three.

The three Mechanism Platforms once again proved invaluable to Ning Zhuo.

A brand-new Mechanical Fan had been forged!

Its twelve ribs, crafted from the Five Elements, served as the Spirit Pivot Axes of this mechanical construct.

The fan's surface was made of Cloud Shark Silk, a pristine blank canvas.

Five-pointed star-shaped rivets secured the silk, and it was here that Ning Zhuo had inscribed the talismanic seal of his Innate Spell.

Grasping the warm, smooth handle, Ning Zhuo gently pushed with his thumb and flicked his wrist.

With a soft poof, the twelve ribs exploded open like a startled peacock, scattering a dazzling array of five-colored light.

As the fan fully unfurled, five-colored clouds swirled across its surface, constantly shifting and transforming - sometimes erupting, sometimes vanishing.

With a gentle wave of the fan, Ning Zhuo unleashed a torrent of Five Qi.

Another wave, and the torrent rapidly dissipated, vanishing completely into the air within moments.

Beneath the fan's control, the Five Elements and Five Qi were ruthlessly manipulated, flowing solely according to Ning Zhuo's will.

Ning Zhuo closed his fingers, smoothly folding the Mechanical Fan shut.

"With this fan's assistance, my strength has increased significantly."

"Could this be the key to resolving Meng Yehu's predicament?"

Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo immediately retrieved the Mechanism Meng Yehu.

Its spiritual energy lay dormant, the construct motionless. No matter how Ning Zhuo called out to it, his voice sank like a stone into the sea, eliciting no response whatsoever.

Ning Zhuo unfolded the Mechanical Fan and waved it at Meng Yehu.

Several times.

Meng Yehu remained as silent as stone.

Ning Zhuo sighed and retrieved the frozen Yuan Dasheng, attempting the Mechanical Fan on him as well.

Failure.

"Hmm?" As Ning Zhuo put away the two mechanical constructs and composed himself, he noticed two urgent messages from Shen Xi.
