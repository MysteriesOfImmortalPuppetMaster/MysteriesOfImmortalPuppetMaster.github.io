Chapter 472: Fate Pointing?

The old demon-cultivator continued to question Liu Er about Ning Zhuo and finally understood the reason.

“Ning Zhuo temporarily relied on Liu Er because of a family feud.”

“He himself also had traveling goals, so after this great battle, he would leave.”

“Moreover, as soon as the war did not go favorably, and he saw no hope of revenge, he would depart midway.”

“As for the support he and the Ning Family gave to Liu Er, on one hand it was because Ning Zhuo himself had a good relationship with Liu Er, on another hand it was due to the family feud, and finally it was for the profit from the spoils of war.”

“After all, war profits were often the most violently lucrative.”

Thinking of this, the old demon-cultivator no longer paid attention to Ning Zhuo.

When Liu Er saw his master behave this way, he knew the old demon-cultivator was skilled in divination. He could not help feeling a stir in his heart and probed, “Teacher, is Ning Zhuo unrelated to my destiny?”

The old demon-cultivator spoke sternly, “Liu Er, you must immediately abandon such thoughts!”

“Although you possess a king’s destiny, you must understand that nothing in a king’s destiny is absolutely certain to happen.”

“A king’s destiny is only a great tendency, and it can be changed.”

“Therefore, even if Ning Zhuo and your destiny have no connection, you can still alter that through your own efforts, turning no connection into a connection, making him your subordinate.”

“If Ning Zhuo was fated to be connected to you, yet you repeatedly give up opportunities, causing the loss of talent, then it is your fault. If you cannot seize destined opportunities, it is all in vain.”

“Do you understand?”

By the time the old demon-cultivator finished, his tone had already changed, scolding harshly.

Liu Er hurriedly knelt, respectfully thanked his master for the reprimand, and promised to remember these words in the future.

“Mm.” Only then did the old demon-cultivator nod, his expression easing.

Precisely because a king’s destiny could be altered, the old demon-cultivator had personally come to protect this key node.

In Liu Er’s early development, Mulan was particularly important, the most crucial stepping stone that would allow Liu Er to blend into the officialdom of the Twin Rivers Country in a positive manner.

Otherwise, if he relied solely on his half-demon status to struggle, he would never be accepted by the mainstream upper echelons. Even if he had talent, it would remain buried for many years.

The old demon-cultivator changed the subject: “Regarding the matter of the ownership of the spoils of war, Liu Er, how have you considered it?”

Liu Er wore a solemn expression and bowed: “This disciple sees two major drawbacks.”

“First, it might harm our reputation for trustworthiness. Such a reputation needs to be cherished. Mingling in the righteous path requires it. My identity is awkward, and without trustworthiness and many other righteous virtues, I would find it nearly impossible to take even a single step.”

“Second, our army’s expenses are mostly sponsored by Ning Zhuo, and in the future they might be entirely funded by him. If we take back the rights to the spoils, it would be as if the entire army is living off the Ning Family’s provisions and pay. If this continues for a long time, will the Three Generals Battalion still be ours or will it belong to the Ning Family?”

Observing the old demon-cultivator’s expression, seeing him stroke his beard and nod in satisfaction, Liu Er grew bolder and continued, “Previously, this disciple wanted to ask about the fate between the king’s destiny and Ning Zhuo.”

“In fact, it was also to consider this matter.”

“If Ning Zhuo and I have no destined affinity, then while accepting the Ning Family’s aid at this time, I might act more boldly.”

“After all, the Ning Family is in Souther Bean Country, not in the Twin Rivers Country.”

Seeing that Liu Er still wanted to speak, the old demon-cultivator decisively raised his hand: “Enough, just handle it that way.”

“This time I called you here for another matter, one a thousand times more important than Ning Zhuo or the spoils of war!”

“Liu Er, since you want to pursue Mulan, then be resolute, bold, proactive, and open.”

“Mulan was a tiger’s daughter from a general’s family and admired battlefield heroes above all. If you behave like someone who sneaks and schemes, even if you finally defeat Shuang Jing and Sun Gan, Mulan would not be moved by you.”

Liu Er was taken aback: “This... Teacher, this disciple does have a heroic spirit and wishes to display it.”

“It’s just that the enemy’s forces were great, and my Three Generals Battalion had only just been established. This small enterprise could easily be crushed.”

The old demon-cultivator raised his hand again, stopping Liu Er’s explanation.

“Go now.”

The old man waved in the direction of the Three Generals Battalion.

Liu Er was surprised, but soon understood. As he left, he said, “Teacher, I understand your meaning.”

“After returning, I will act openly and grandly to pursue Mulan.”

When Liu Er looked up again, he found that the old demon-cultivator had already vanished.

“Teacher is still so mysterious and unfathomable,” Liu Er sighed and turned back toward the camp.

The old demon-cultivator had not left, but remained where he was.

It was just that the old man’s illusion techniques were extraordinary, having deceived Liu Er.

The old demon-cultivator’s face was deathly pale, blood spurted from his seven orifices, and a large amount of essence and lifespan flowed with the blood, rapidly consumed.

The old man endured bitterly.

The agony of both mind and body made him feel worse than death, every moment like a year.

In the end, the pain gradually diminished, and blood no longer flowed from his seven orifices.

This was the drawback of divination.

Everything had two sides, benefit and harm, a natural balance.

Divination often could predict future trends, which was the great benefit of this cultivation art. But its drawbacks were far more numerous and severe than those of other cultivation techniques.

What the old demon-cultivator had just experienced was the result of using divination to guide a key figure, causing a violent fluctuation in destiny and making him endure this backlash.

And this still did not count as a critical reminder!

A critical reminder was also called fate pointing, and it was extremely difficult. It required the diviner to have a strong spirit of sacrifice, as one might die from the backlash of leaking heavenly secrets.

What the old demon-cultivator had just given was not a critical reminder, not fate pointing.

If previously, before Liu Er had learned about Mulan’s dual cultivation and other key information, before he even considered pursuing Mulan, the old demon-cultivator had clearly reminded him of this matter, that would have been fate pointing.

After receiving valuable guidance from his teacher, Liu Er acted decisively upon his return.

He summoned Guan Hong, Zhang Hei, and Ning Zhuo, and publicly announced the retraction of some people’s rights to the spoils of war, but only for a portion of them.

“Since these people no longer want this right, we will increase their provisions and pay to draw them in.”

“As for those who still want to keep their right to the spoils, we will let them keep it.”

“We must count these two groups of people. The work is complicated, the tasks numerous, so we must rely on the adviser.”

Ning Zhuo quickly said it was his duty, praising Liu Er’s arrangement as mature, steady, and far more comprehensive and excellent than his own suggestion.

After that, Liu Er announced that he would openly and grandly pursue Mulan.

As expected, this decision met with the simultaneous opposition of the other three.

But Liu Er displayed a fearless masculine courage and an unyielding will, which stirred Guan Hong’s and Zhang Hei’s blood. They both pledged their firm support.

Seeing this, Ning Zhuo could not help but wonder what trump card Liu Er had to be so confident!

However, since the three generals had already agreed, Ning Zhuo, though curious, also decisively expressed his compliance.

“In this way, the situation of the Three Generals Battalion would worsen sharply, becoming even more difficult than that of the Red Flower Battalion.”
