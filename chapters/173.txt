Chapter 173: Discovery of an Inside Traitor?

The "Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon" that Ning Zhuo exchanged for was quickly read through.

The book, from Luo Yunzi's perspective, narrated his misfortunes, wandering across the world, and experiencing various local customs and traditions.

The story was quite interesting, and Ning Zhuo felt he gained a lot of insight into different regions' customs and cultures.

However, regarding fate energy and techniques to alter fate, it only touched the surface without any in-depth exploration.

This was already the best book Ning Zhuo could exchange for at the All-Book Pavilion.

The other books related to fate energy that he looked at were even less informative than the "Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon."

"Content about fate energy is not widely known and is only circulated within a small range. From what I can see, the Celestial Bureau has the most knowledge about these secrets."

"Although the Celestial Bureau is a super sect, it is sparsely populated and extremely mysterious. According to Luo Yunzi's account, he once studied at the Celestial Bureau, but the 'Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon' does not mention it at all."

"However, Luo Yunzi could change others' fortunes within a certain period and range, giving them wealth, official positions, romantic luck, and so on."

"But these spells all have drawbacks. Once specific taboos are touched, the results will be even worse." Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly.

His previous plan fell through; he couldn't rely on the "Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon" to elevate the Life Thread Divine Ability to a qualitative change.

But it wasn't without gains.

At least he understood that changing others' fortunes had many drawbacks.

"So, Meng Kui, your Sitting Mountain Observation Technique can create different fate energy fields. What are its drawbacks?" Ning Zhuo pondered this question.

For him, Meng Kui was also a competitor for the Lava Immortal Palace.

Reality is cruel.

Just because Meng Kui is at the Nascent Soul Stage and Ning Zhuo is only at the Qi Refining Stage doesn't mean they don't have a competitive relationship.

When the final moment comes, Ning Zhuo will inevitably face Meng Kui of the Nascent Soul Stage.

"But if I can find the weaknesses of his divine abilities before then, it will undoubtedly increase my chances of winning." Ning Zhuo continued his arduous cultivation.

His Divine Sea cultivation had reached its limit.

His Qi Sea cultivation had also reached its peak, but his magical power needed purification.

His Essence Sea cultivation still had room for improvement.

Ning Zhuo's cultivation speed was quite impressive through the extensive consumption of spirit food and spirit pills.

"However, even if my Essence Sea cultivation reaches the peak of the sixth transformation, I still can't break through the current bottleneck."

Ning Zhuo was almost certain that the difficulty behind the second Demonic Gate was the same as the Buddhist Gate and Taoist Gate.

If nothing unexpected happened, he would still be stuck.

"Behind the second gate is a special checkpoint that issues the Five Elements Transformation Disk. The more proficient I am in the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique, the better the quality of the Transformation Disk I will receive."

"Referring to the coffin room of the first Buddhist Gate, I might only get one chance to choose, so I must be extremely cautious. I need to elevate my proficiency in the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique as much as possible before choosing the Transformation Disk." The Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique required diligent practice, and the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra even more so.

According to Ning Zhuo's assessment, this technique was the key to breaking the deadlock!

After all, compared to the Taoist Gate and Demonic Gate, the Buddhist Gate was his advantageous path.

Thus, Ning Zhuo focused on the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra, followed by the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique, and then the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.

He meticulously scheduled his eating, drinking, and sleeping time down to a single finger snap.

Ning Zhuo's diligence and effort left those around him in awe.

"I always thought I was hardworking, but compared to Brother Zhuo, I'm nothing!"

"To be so diligent and tireless, no wonder Brother Zhuo has achieved what he has today. I am thoroughly convinced."

"Brother Zhuo is so outstanding and works so hard. What right do we have to slack off?" Ning Yong, Ning Chen, and others were greatly inspired.

They all took Ning Zhuo as their role model and began their own intense cultivation.

As Ning Zhuo's status continued to rise, his constant success brought about a surge in his influence.

Without any deliberate actions, Ning Zhuo could directly change the mindset of those around him.

Upon discovering that Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others were emulating him, Ning Zhuo decisively said to them, "We are all at the peak of the third layer of Qi Refining. To explore deeper into the Immortal Palace, we must fully enhance our proficiency in mechanical constructs."

"How about this, I can introduce you to the Flying Disc Workshop."

"Once there, you can refine various mechanical constructs and accumulate hands-on experience, which will be very beneficial to you." Ning Yong, Ning Chen, and others had no objections.

Since Ning Zhuo said so, he must have his reasons.

These young cultivators chose to listen, and none refused.

Thus, Ning Zhuo introduced them to Chen Cha.

Ning Zhuo also gave Chen Cha new mechanical blueprints: "This is my modified version of the mechanical fire bomb, a new model primarily used for combat." Chen Cha took a look and nodded in satisfaction, "The materials are much more solid than last time."

Ning Zhuo smiled, "It's mainly for the Monkey Head Gang. This kind of combat mechanism needs to be reliable, as it concerns lives." 

The days flew by.

That afternoon, as scheduled, Ning Zhuo took a short break to listen to the reports from Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian.

Many of the stewards dismissed by the main branch had been recruited by Ning Zhuo, with Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian being the most outstanding among them.

Ning Zhuo appointed these two as leaders.

After unifying the black market and setting rules, Ning Zhuo almost became a hands-off manager.

For the past half month, it had been maintained by the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators.

The emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace and the recruitment order attracted many outsiders, continuously flooding into Fire Persimmon Immortal City, causing the black market's business to boom tenfold.

As the black market's revenue increased, so did the difficulty of management.

Fortunately, these Ning family cultivators were all at the Foundation Establishment Stage, and they were not ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivatorsâ€”those selected as stewards by the main branch naturally had their specialties.

These cultivators were the elite among the Foundation Establishment.

Their use of icebox spells was also very suitable for capturing people.

When cultivators were frozen, they often retained their lives.

According to Sun Lingtong's arrangements and forces, they couldn't manage the current black market.

However, the former stewards of the Ning family managed the black market in an orderly manner.

"These days, you have all worked hard." After listening to the report, Ning Zhuo immediately proceeded with the distribution.

He had already investigated the specific salaries of these Foundation Establishment cultivators when they served as stewards for the Ning family.

Ning Zhuo took out 80% of the black market's revenue to distribute.

This reached the monthly salary standard these Foundation Establishment cultivators once had.

"Since it's the end of the month, let's distribute it."

Ning Xiangguo said, "Young Master Zhuo, it seems there's a mistake. We only worked for half a month, but this is a month's salary." Ning Zhuo nodded, "The extra part is a welcome gift from me to everyone."

"In the future, every clan member who joins us will receive half of their monthly salary as an entry gift in their first month." Ning Xiangqian was delighted, "This is a good idea, everyone will like it!"

Ning Zhuo continued, "Next, based on individual evaluations and achievements, we will calculate this month's bonus."

"According to the rules I previously set, we will conduct detailed calculations. The process and results of the calculations will be presented to the cultivators for verification."

"This bonus will be distributed at the end of next month, along with next month's salary."

"In short, salaries are distributed at the end of the month, and bonuses are distributed at the end of the following month. This way, it will be convenient for those who have disputes about the bonus calculation to report and correct them." Ning Xiangqian nodded repeatedly, "This is a good method. This way, everyone working in the black market will at least feel the same as working in the family. The more contributions they make, the more they get, which is very fair!"

Ning Xiangguo, however, frowned slightly, "This way, there will be almost no surplus from the black market's revenue. Young Master Zhuo, you should keep some for yourself. Forgive me for being blunt, but you are distributing too much." Ning Xiangqian was taken aback and, after thinking carefully, also nodded, "It seems to be the case."

Ning Zhuo smiled and waved his hand, "It's just the first month. I believe we will do better in the future."

"There will be more outsiders coming to the black market."

"In fact, as long as the Lava Immortal Palace has not recognized a master, there will be an endless stream of cultivators coming from afar."

"They come from afar, and even if they can't gain the recognition of the palace spirit and enter the Immortal Palace, most of them will choose to live in the Lava Immortal Palace for a while."

"These people will greatly stimulate the business in the Immortal City, and the black market is growing larger and larger, isn't it?" Ning Xiangqian grinned, "That's true!"

Ning Xiangguo, however, said with a deep gaze, "But Young Master Zhuo, do you really want to keep controlling the black market?"

"I personally think this is not a long-term plan."

"We need legitimate businesses. After all, the black market is not the righteous path."

"Holding onto it for too long and getting too deeply involved will harm the reputation of our Ning family."

"For now, it's still acceptable. People will think: the four major forces have reached a consensus, allowing the Ning family to take over the black market for the stability of the Immortal City."

"In the future, once there are fewer outsiders and the Immortal Palace recognizes a master, we won't be able to hold onto this territory and will have to give it up." Ning Xiangqian immediately frowned, puzzled, "Why can't we hold onto it? The black market is something we fought for."

Clearly, Ning Xiangguo was more strategic, able to see the bigger picture and think long-term.

Ning Xiangguo continued, "Therefore, I sincerely suggest, Young Master Zhuo, that you don't need to be so generous. Take advantage of this rare opportunity to gather more resources and keep them for yourself. When we withdraw from the black market in the future, at least we will have a reserve of resources."

Ning Zhuo looked deeply at Ning Xiangguo.

During this period, although Ning Zhuo kept a low profile, he still used his fragmented time every day to interact with the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators one-on-one as much as possible.

In this process, Ning Zhuo also gathered more real information about each of them through the Turtle Breath Gang.

Now, most of the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators already had the Life-Hanging Thread.

Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian were among them.
