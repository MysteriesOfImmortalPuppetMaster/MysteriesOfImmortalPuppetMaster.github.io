Chapter 829: First Place

The Dao of Time was undoubtedly a weakness for Ning Zhuo.

He rarely came into contact with it in his daily life.

Much like the Dao of Destiny, it was an esoteric study, unlike prominent studies such as Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism.

Indeed, very few cultivators mastered it. Let alone mastering it, even those who had deep contact with it were rare. Ning Zhuo had absorbed three waves of demonic souls, yet none had touched upon this aspect deeply.

This was because the Dao of Time often involved lifespan.

Methods for extending life had always been cherished secrets, strategic elements that influenced the grand scheme of major powers!

However, his Master-level attainment in the Formation Dao once again provided Ning Zhuo with immense help. Knowing the answer, the veil of mystery over this Nine Twists Cloister Array was thoroughly lifted, rapidly becoming clear in Ning Zhuo's eyes.

"The changes in the flow of time follow a pattern."

"Fast, slow, and reverse - these three states appear alternately, forming a cycle. The length of this cycle is thirty-six breaths. Within that, twelve breaths are fast, twelve are slow, and twelve are reversed..."

When it was fast, he went all out, every action executed with precision to dismantle the formation.

When it was slow, he accumulated strength, preparing for the next fast phase.

When it reversed, he stood still, allowing time to act upon him, doing no useless work.

After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, Ning Zhuo felt his entire body lighten.

The Sixth Twist, passed.

At this moment, Shen Xi was still setting up his "array within an array."

The cultivators hosting the main formation naturally saw this situation clearly.

In fact, at this stage of the trial, Ning Zhuo and Shen Xi's progress was already ranked within the top five.

The leading cultivators naturally attracted the most attention.

"Ning Zhuo has overtaken Shen Xi!"

"His speed in passing the Sixth Twist was considerably fast."

"Could it be that his attainment in the Formation Dao actually surpasses Shen Xi's? This is only Ning Zhuo's first time encountering the Sixth Twist, right?"

This scene felt absurd to many cultivators. Yet, the facts were right there, contradicting almost everyone's understanding.

At this moment, the vast majority of gazes were focused on Ning Zhuo.

Everyone wanted to see Ning Zhuo's performance in the Seventh Twist.

After some probing, Ning Zhuo revealed a look of conflict on his face.

He used his divine sense to spy on his surroundings, and it went very smoothly. The range of his divine sense in the Seventh Twist was not suppressed; in fact, it had even expanded somewhat.

He quite smoothly found various traces of the formation and quickly calculated the approximate form of the array in his mind.

But that was exactly what was strange - it was too smooth!

Ning Zhuo showed a rare look of hesitation. There was no reason for the Seventh Twist to be simpler than the previous six, and simpler by such a large margin.

Thus, Ning Zhuo employed various means, including formation-breaking treasures, to probe continuously.

The final results obtained were no different from before.

"Then, give it a try?" Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment and decided to act.

In this situation, overthinking was useless.

Ning Zhuo mobilized his spiritual energy and activated a Manifestation Talisman.

Bang.

The Manifestation Talisman had only burned halfway before it was shattered by a tremor.

In the next moment, the power of the formation backlashed, causing Ning Zhuo's body to shake and a sweet taste to rise in his throat.

The backlash brought by the talisman was far more indirect than other methods. Even so, Ning Zhuo still nearly vomited blood.

Ning Zhuo's pupils constricted to the size of pinpoints. "So, the profound mystery of this twist lies in two words: Truth and Falsehood!"

In the cloister, every pillar, every green brick, and every tile was a mix of real and fake.

"There is an illusion array here!"

And the "truth" of the formation that Ning Zhuo had calculated earlier was obviously far from the real answer. Otherwise, using the Manifestation Talisman wouldn't have gone so terribly wrong.

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but fall into deep thought. "How do I break this?"

"Break for me-!" Shen Xi shouted.

The Nine Palaces Minor Array he was presiding over erupted with a brilliant pillar of light, shooting straight into the clouds with imposing momentum. Finally, in one vigorous effort, under the premise of severely interfering with the flow of time, he smashed through the Sixth Twist.

The moment it was broken, the Nine Palaces Minor Array reached its limit and completely collapsed.

Shen Xi, who was hosting the array, inevitably suffered a backlash. His body stumbled, and more than ten wounds suddenly appeared all over him, each spurting fresh blood.

Shen Xi almost tumbled into the Seventh Twist. He knelt on the ground, listless, covered in blood, his face pale and defeated.

He nearly fainted, barely holding on at his limit. He stopped the bleeding, and after a good while, he finally caught his breath.

He hurriedly sat cross-legged to make emergency adjustments.

Once his injuries were half-healed, turning from severe to light, Shen Xi immediately raced against time to scout his surroundings.

"There isn't much time left; this Seventh Twist is strange!"

"Sigh, I hope I can pry into its secrets."

While Shen Xi was racing against the clock, Ning Zhuo had already used his formation-breaking treasures in multiple rounds, striking several corridor pillars in succession.

When he reached the eighteenth pillar, the sound of the strike changed.

Ning Zhuo laughed heartily and immediately used the Array-Gap Roaming Shuttle, carrying himself directly into the pillar.

The next moment, his vision changed abruptly as he moved from the Seventh Twist into the Eighth Twist.

"Ning Zhuo has left Shen Xi in the dust and entered the Eighth Twist!"

"His Formation Dao attainment is profound. What happened during the first trial? Was he deliberately making a fool of himself? What benefit would that bring him?"

"Currently, there are three people who have reached the Ninth Twist. There were originally sixteen in the Eighth Twist. Ning Zhuo makes seventeen!" A cultivator was tallying the numbers.

These few individuals were the candidates with the highest hope of breaking through the Ninth Twist and seizing first place in this year's Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

Whoever succeeded in breaking through first would be the winner of this trial!

The cultivators hosting the grand formation fell into a brief silence.

When this trial began, none of them could have predicted that Ning Zhuo would charge directly into the Eighth Twist. This meant he had become one of the seeded candidates for this trial!

Outside the field.

In the crowd, Su Lingkou nervously clenched her fists.

The later it got, the more nervous she became.

"Cousin still hasn't come out! Yet the vast majority of people have already been eliminated."

"The longer he lasts, the deeper he must be."

"Cousin, you can do it!"

Su Lingkou's heart was tied to Shen Xi as she prayed silently.

The brilliance of teleportation suddenly appeared and then dissipated.

Shen Xi appeared before the public.

He looked pale, his steps unsteady. As soon as he appeared, he was immediately subjected to gazes of envy, jealousy, admiration, and curiosity from the crowd.

Su Lingkou hurriedly went forward to support him as he walked down. She lowered her voice and said excitedly, "Cousin, this time, you were again one of the few who lasted until the end. You must have broken through the Sixth Twist, right?"

"En. The progress was good this time; I have already glimpsed the mysteries of the Eighth Twist. Unfortunately, my strength fell short, and time ran out. There is great promise for the next attempt." Shen Xi nodded faintly.

Su Lingkou was filled with surprise and joy. "The Eighth Twist? Then doesn't that mean..."

Shen Xi slightly held her arm and said indifferently, "I haven't won first place yet, so there's nothing to be happy about. Hmm, how many people are still in there after me?"

Su Lingkou shook her head. "I haven't been here long..."

The next moment, the brilliance of teleportation flared again.

Ning Zhuo appeared before the public's eyes.

"It's him!?"

"It really is Ning Zhuo!"

"He lasted until the end this time. Does that mean his performance was excellent?"

"Then how do you explain his score last time? Perhaps he deliberately stalled in the first twist and only now decided to come out?"

"No! Ning Zhuo might have weak Formation Dao attainment, but he would absolutely not do that. With Noble Spirit present, he naturally possesses a backbone of pride!"

"Then he must have been trapped in the first few twists, researching continuously without being able to get out, until all his time was used up..."

Su Lingkou revealed a look of astonishment.

Shen Xi turned around, looked at Ning Zhuo, cupped his fists, and just as he said, "Fellow Daoist Ning..."

Just then, the sound of bells and chimes rang out. Immediately, a Golden Core cultivator gradually emerged and announced to the public: "The First Place of this Nine Twists Cloister Array Minor Trial is - Ning Zhuo!"

The entire venue was stunned, followed by an uproar.

"Ning Zhuo?!"

"Why is it him! How could it be him?"

"Did I hear that wrong just now?"

Many people found it hard to believe. Especially those cultivators who had disparaged Ning Zhuo earlier; at this moment, it felt like they had been slapped across the face.

"If Ning Zhuo has such strength, how could he fail to break even the Third Twist the first time?"

"How exactly did he do it?"

"Could it be that his first performance was just an off day?"

"Was it an off day, or was it intentional?"

"It's unclear! The thoughts of such geniuses are truly hard for us ordinary cultivators to fathom."

Su Lingkou's eyes widened as she stared at Ning Zhuo, her face full of shock. She sent a divine sense transmission to her cousin Shen Xi: "Cousin! How could Ning Zhuo possibly surpass you and win first place?!"

"Don't we know his level of Formation Dao attainment? He must have cheated!"

Shen Xi immediately transmitted back, cutting Su Lingkou off: "Cousin, speak cautiously!"

His gaze flickered uncertainly. He also couldn't figure out this point, but he was, after all, the Foundation Establishment face put forward by the Shen family of Nine Palaces Immortal City.

He first comforted Su Lingkou: "Based on the strength Fellow Daoist Ning displayed previously, he is indeed far inferior to me. Perhaps... he accidentally acquired some miraculous treasure that allowed him to breach the Nine Twists Cloister Array in one fell swoop."

Su Lingkou shook her head. "Cousin, stop deceiving yourself! Tell me, what kind of treasure could help Ning Zhuo to this extent?"

"The variety of formation-breaking treasures in the Commerce Hall is indeed vast and dazzling. But breaking a formation and combat are two different things. Just having a powerful formation-breaking treasure is absolutely not enough. There is a major prerequisite: the cultivator using these treasures."

"And this cultivator must be proficient in setting up arrays. Otherwise, the slightest deviation could lead to a world of difference."

"Cousin, do you think Ning Zhuo is such a person?"

Shen Xi remained silent.

Su Lingkou gritted her teeth. All along, in her heart, her cousin was her idol, the one who most deserved to win and enjoy unlimited glory.

Just now, Shen Xi had indicated that he had reached the Eighth Twist. To Su Lingkou, this sounded like her cousin had become the strongest contender for the top spot in this minor trial!

First place was right in front of them, but suddenly, it was snatched away by someone else.

If it were any other famous formation expert, Su Lingkou would have let it go. But it just had to be Ning Zhuo. And it just so happened that earlier, she had witnessed the entire process of her cousin instructing Ning Zhuo.

This made Su Lingkou feel extremely stifled inside. "Cheating! Ning Zhuo definitely cheated!"

"It's too shameful!"

"Letting a cheater like this surpass my cousin and take first place - what justice is there in the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Flying Cloud Assembly!"

A strong impulse rose in Su Lingkou's heart to expose this fraud on the spot.

However, she had been cultivated from a young age and possessed the underlying character of a great clan. She forcibly held it back and suggested to Shen Xi, "Cousin, I really can't figure it out! Why don't we ask Ning Zhuo for advice and see how he passed the level!"

Shen Xi actually harbored the same suspicion in his heart.

However, a smile appeared on his face. While cupping his fists to congratulate Ning Zhuo, he transmitted to his cousin via divine sense: "The Rising Cloud Minor Trials of the Myriad Manifestations Sect are as numerous as ox hairs. Why make things difficult for Ning Zhuo over this small detail?"

"Cousin, you must understand, he is our friend, not our enemy."

"Obsessing over this matter and turning a friend into an enemy would be our loss!"

Su Lingkou's eyes reddened, feeling it was unworthy for Shen Xi. "Cousin, you're just such a nice person. Always thinking of others, considering the big picture. Haven't you suffered enough losses like this?"

Shen Xi had intended to feign ignorance, but Ning Zhuo spoke up instead: "Fellow Daoist Shen, being able to clear the trial quickly and obtain first place this time is largely thanks to your guidance!"

"The Shen family of Nine Palaces Immortal City truly lives up to its reputation!"

"I would like to host a banquet for Brother Shen tonight, and I also invite Fellow Daoist Su Lingkou to grace us with her presence. During the meal, there are still many questions regarding the Formation Dao that I wish to ask Brother Shen."

Ning Zhuo deliberately spoke loudly so that the surrounding cultivators could hear.

Everyone immediately broke into discussion.

"What? Ning Zhuo winning first place was actually due to Shen Xi's contribution?"

"Shen Xi and Ning Zhuo are competitors, yet he has such high moral character, imparting all his insights and experience?"

"Even so, isn't the gap between Ning Zhuo's before and after performances a bit too large?"

Various discussions lingered in his ears. Shen Xi looked at Ning Zhuo in front of him, a thought flashing through his mind: Is Ning Zhuo deliberately showing goodwill and publicly elevating my reputation because he wants me to play along and endorse him?

The key question is, did he cheat or not?

Shen Xi pondered for only three breaths before nodding in agreement to the invitation, emphasizing: "We are of the same generation; there is no need to talk of 'asking for advice.' An exchange of ideas will suffice."

Ning Zhuo's heart stirred slightly, revealing a look of joy. He immediately left Nine Twists Peak accompanied by Shen Xi and Su Lingkou.

As for the reward for first place in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, the cultivator hosting the formation had already informed Ning Zhuo to come and collect it tomorrow morning.

Inside a private room at a restaurant.

Ning Zhuo invited the two to sit and poured tea personally. "Coarse tea and simple food, a small token of respect. Brother Shen, please do not disdain it."

Su Lingkou looked at the table full of delicacies and sneered inwardly, feeling more and more that Ning Zhuo was bribing the two of them. This was all because the two of them knew Ning Zhuo's true colors regarding the Formation Dao.

Shen Xi sent a divine sense transmission, secretly instructing, "Cousin, do not actively bring up matters of array arrangement next, and especially do not mention the Nine Twists Cloister Array."

He still wanted to maintain a good relationship with Ning Zhuo and didn't want to tear down the stage to his face.

But as a result, Ning Zhuo spoke up next: "I wonder how Brother Shen broke the formation in the Sixth Twist?"

Su Lingkou was stunned, then laughed out of anger.

Shen Xi weighed his words and explained to Ning Zhuo as simply as possible.

Ning Zhuo nodded frequently, then suddenly interjected, "So Brother Shen's idea was this..."

He directly summarized Shen Xi's method in two sentences.

Shen Xi heard this and was stunned at first. Then he clapped his hands, revealing a look of excitement. "Brother Ning's words are incisive and hit the nail right on the head!"

Even he felt he couldn't have achieved such a precise understanding.

Ning Zhuo smiled and proactively stated his own solution. At the same time, his fingers moved frequently, sketching a miniature formation in the air to assist his explanation.

After the explanation, the private room fell into silence.

Shen Xi and Su Lingkou stared at the temporary formation model Ning Zhuo had sketched with spiritual energy, unable to speak for a long time.

After a long while, Su Lingkou blurted out, "Ning Zhuo, since you have such attainment, why did you trick me and my cousin before?"

Shen Xi also cupped his fists with a bitter smile. "Brother Daoist Ning, you hid it from us so well."
