Chapter 441: Who Is the Main General?

Several Golden Core cultivators attacked together. Even though they encountered interception, only more than thirty cultivators were killed.

Such a meager result was pitiful.

This was because the Three Generals Camp was an official army unit of the Two Note Kingdom, part of the national defense, enjoying the blessing of national power. Any external attack would inevitably be weakened by the national defense.

Moreover, the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp had always been in formation, marching in a straight-line snake formation. Their military strength was condensed and unified, giving them certain defensive capabilities.

But when Liu Er, Guan Hei, and others saw such losses, they shouted in shock and anger.

The Three Generals Camp was not large in scale, with only more than three hundred people.

In the first round of attacks, they lost ten percent. If they suffered two or three more rounds, the morale would collapse, and the army would scatter.

This army was not the Golden Halberd Army; it was newly formed and had the weakest foundation among all armies.

As long as casualties reached around thirty percent, the cultivators would become terrified and flee in all directions.

Describing them as a mob was very appropriate.

"Change formation!"

"Change formation!"

Liu Er and Guan Hei shouted simultaneously.

On the other side, Guan Hong gritted his teeth, enduring severe pain. He had just swallowed a pill to stabilize his injuries and hastily bandaged his right arm.

His right arm was severely injured, almost useless.

But at this time, the army was under attack. Hearing the divine sense transmissions from Liu Er and Guan Hei, he knew he had to hold on!

Guan Hong mobilized his magic power, coordinating with Liu Er and Zhang Hei, directing the surrounding soldiers to begin changing formation.

The straight-line snake formation was very suitable for marching, but when used to deal with a small number of elite enemies, the formation line was too long, with the head and tail far apart, making it difficult to take care of both ends.

Fortunately, the three generals had undergone extremely arduous special training before, mainly practicing two battle formations.

The straight-line snake formation was practiced later; they spent most of their energy and time on the triangular arrow formation.

The soldiers of the Three Generals Camp felt numbness on their scalps but followed orders one after another, urgently maneuvering according to their usual training.

They still retained their rationality, knowing that as Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators, if they scattered and fled, they would surely be slaughtered by Golden Core cultivators, with heads rolling and no chance of survival. Instead, forming a formation could rely on the battle formation and national defense for self-protection.

If they were lucky enough to repel the attacking Golden Core cultivators, they could even earn some military merit!

In no time, the long snake turned its head and curled its tail among the mountains, coiling into a group.

"Quick, attack them!" Chen Lingfeng hurriedly transmitted his thoughts, giving commands.

Changing formations was a matter of skill.

Rashly changing formations would create flaws.

Referring to when the White Jade Camp dealt with Tu Ming, Shuang Jing commanded the battle. During the change of formation, only the inner elite soldiers and personal guards changed formation, while the outer layer still maintained the Jade Wall Heavenly Barrier Formation.

This was to cover up the flaws during the change of formation.

But the Three Generals Camp couldn't do this.

On one hand, the Three Generals Camp had too few people, only about three hundred, unable to form two sets of battle formations inside and outside.

On the other hand, their training was insufficient. This defect of the Three Generals Camp was even greater than that of the Barbarian Demon Camp! Xu Dali of the Barbarian Demon Camp at least had his own personal guards and elite soldiers, but the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang were all alone, starting from scratch to build the army.

Fortunately, the enemies they faced at this time were not as many or as strong as those of the Barbarian Demon Camp.

Wind Movement Spell —Wind Like Dusk!

Chen Lingfeng flapped the wings on his back, utilizing his talent, and cast a spell.

In an instant, heaven and earth dimmed, and a fierce wind swept through, causing the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp to be unable to open their eyes. Some even couldn't stand, their bodies swaying, almost being blown away by the gale!

Wu Hen had fled to a safe area.

"I'm joining in!"

Ghostly Dao —Shadow Silk Ensnarement!

From the edges of Wu Hen's black robe, black shadows frantically emanated.

The black shadows surged like a layer of pitch-black tide, clinging to the ground, attacking the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp.

The soldiers were gathered together, their figures connected into patches, which made it very convenient for Wu Hen to attack.

Liu Er shouted loudly; in the dim gale, he rode on a yellow steed, raising the Xuanhuang Sword high!

Military Tactic —Defend the Land and Strengthen the Foundation.

This was a tactic inherent in the Xuanhuang Sword. When activated, it immediately turned into earth-yellow halos, blessing each soldier.

The halos rapidly spread, covering the entire army, forming a strong defense against the blowing gale, but they couldn't withstand the tide of black shadows rushing along the ground.

"Got you," Wu Hen grinned, letting out a chilling sinister smile.

This was the advantage of the Ghostly Dao.

Wu Hen was unhindered and made contact with the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp.

In the next moment, the shadows of the soldiers touched by Wu Hen rebelled one after another, turning into strands of shadow silk, rising from the ground, entangling their owners' legs and arms, restricting their movements.

For a moment, the speed of changing formation slowed down considerably.

Many soldiers fell to the ground, struggling frantically but unable to break free from the bindings of the shadow silk.

Some, in their impatience, cast spells or used magical artifacts to attack their own shadows.

As a result, along with the damage to their shadows, corresponding injuries appeared on their bodies!

This put them in a dilemma, feeling quite helpless.

"Very good, very good."

Another Golden Core cultivator, named Luo Xiwei, practiced the Earth Element cultivation method "Earth Penetration Technique", adept at digging tunnels.

According to the previous arrangement, he then made his move, holding the magical artifact Earth Vein Five-Section Staff, casting Earth Element spells.

In an instant, the mountainous terrain changed, rapidly softening and loosening from solid rocky ground, eventually turning into vast areas of quicksand.

The soldiers of the Three Generals Camp were already entangled and bound by shadow silk, unable to move, and could only watch helplessly as they were swallowed by the quicksand.

This quicksand move was quite vicious.

It wouldn't kill the soldiers immediately but would let them watch themselves sliding into the abyss of death, greatly shocking their fighting spirit, thereby shaking the entire army's morale.

They had weapons that each contained a military tactic, but all were used for offense.

"How hateful," Liu Er was extremely anxious.

Generals Guan and Zhang also gnashed their teeth.

Now, the triangular arrow formation required the three generals as the core to maintain. If any one of them rushed out to kill the enemy, it would inevitably cause one corner of the battle formation to collapse, and the resulting flaw would be so great that the other Golden Core cultivators could take the opportunity to attack fiercely, killing a large number of soldiers.

The three generals naturally did not want to see this scene; after all, this was their only foundation.

But the defense of the triangular arrow formation itself was not outstanding; if this continued, with continuous losses, it would collapse sooner or later.

Zhang Hei shuddered, thought of something, and couldn't help but transmit via divine sense, shouting, "Eldest Brother, Second Brother, isn't this the prophecy poem calculated by the military advisor!"

That prophecy poem:

Hooves trample falling flowers; wind rises, shadows sink into sand.
Who can retain the bright moon? Who will be buried among the rosy clouds?

The current situation corresponded exactly to the line "wind rises, shadows sink into sand," fitting incomparably!

Liu Er and Guan Hong had actually already thought of this and hurriedly transmitted, urging Zhang Hei not to speak recklessly.

Now the army's morale was already violently shaken; the three generals were struggling to hold on. If they themselves panicked, the battle would completely collapse, irretrievable.

Zhang Hei held his tongue, thinking to himself with deep regret, "Had I known, I should have heeded the military advisor's words more."

Ning Zhuo's divine sense penetrated the carriage, observing the battlefield. Seeing this scene, he felt a strange emotion.

"A prophecy poem I randomly made up actually matched the situation?"

"What's going on?"

"It must be a coincidence."

At this moment, he hadn't guessed that this was the plan proposed by Cave Master Mo Yuan, turning their trick against them.

This plan was indeed ingenious; even though the three generals did not spread it, their own hearts were already shaken because of it!

They were the foundation of maintaining the army's morale; once their hearts were in turmoil, it immediately affected the power of the entire battle formation.

The attacking Golden Core cultivators felt much more at ease, and the soldiers sank into the quicksand even faster.

"Is our army going to be annihilated today?!" Liu Er couldn't help but feel despair.

"If we're going to be destroyed sooner or later, we might as well rush out now and fight to the death!" Zhang Hei gritted his teeth, eyes showing ferocity.

Guan Hong's face was cold: "Since we can't change the situation, we might as well take a risk and charge once."

If they did this, the number of casualties among the soldiers would probably be enormous, but the three generals seemed to have no other choice.

"Generals, don't worry, watch me display my methods." At the critical moment, a young cultivator stepped out of the carriage.

To his right was the Heavy Armored Blood Ape, Da Sheng; to his left was the Buddhist Physician, Meng Yaoyin.

It was Ning Zhuo!

The mechanical dragon on Ning Zhuo's waist was no longer there; Sun Lingtong had quietly left the army long ago.

Ning Zhuo took out his own Military Advisor's Small Seal, multitasking, activating the seal while casting spells.

Earth Element —Binding Sand and Solidifying Earth!

He was an official Military Advisor Libationer, enjoying the national defense blessing of the Two Note Kingdom and the enhancement of the triangular arrow formation. The battle formation itself could enhance the offensive, making his spells extremely sharp.

Immediately, centered on Ning Zhuo, a yellow wind rose.

Where the yellow wind blew, the flowing sand solidified, restoring into solid ground.

The Golden Core cultivator Luo Xiwei had to resist the national defense; the actual power of his spells had already been greatly reduced. He had been casting spell attacks for a while and was suffering from national prestige backlash, his combat power rapidly declining.

In contrast, Ning Zhuo was getting blessings, like a fish in water.

Between the ebb and flow, Ning Zhuo's spells kept winning, causing Luo Xiwei's spells to retreat step by step.

After a moment, the ground of the Three Generals Camp had been restored!

"It's that Ning Zhuo!" Chen Lingfeng looked down from above, overlooking the battlefield. Seeing this scene, he felt some resentment.

"Wu Hen chose wrongly."

"He attacked the three generals but didn't manage to kill even one. It would have been better to focus his strength on dealing with Ning Zhuo."

Luo Xiwei also felt it was a pity: "I was about to succeed! I didn't expect Ning Zhuo to have mastered a spell specifically targeting mine; his luck is too good."

He didn't know that Ning Zhuo had observed for a moment, learned the principles of his quicksand spell, and then reversed it, creating an improvised usage.

"It's him!" Wu Hen saw Ning Zhuo, his heart stirred.

When he had infiltrated the carriage and saw Ning Zhuo for the first time, he had a premonition that this young cultivator would be trouble.

Now, his premonition had come true!

Wu Hen's five fingers suddenly clenched inward; countless shadow silks were pulled by him, attacking Ning Zhuo from all directions.

"Protect the military advisor!" Liu Er shouted.

Without a doubt, Ning Zhuo was the key to their defense!

Guan Hong was at a farther position; Zhang Hei had already set off, rushing towards Ning Zhuo.

Facing thousands of shadow silks, Ning Zhuo stood firm.

The Buddhist Physician, Meng Yaoyin, lightly swung her arm; the mechanical sickle swept in a circle in the air, then gracefully paused, returning to its original position.

"Swish!"

Like the sound of waves crashing against rocks, the thousands of shadow silks disintegrated and collapsed completely.

Wu Hen's body trembled, his face changed drastically, blood oozing from his mouth and nose: "What a powerful Night Rain Demon Soldier!"

The three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang, who witnessed this scene, also felt their hearts tremble.

Zhang Hei, being the closest, even felt a chill on his neck.

The three generals were greatly shocked, thinking that their military advisor actually possessed such a powerful Golden Core combat strength!

"He seems even stronger than me."

"This... who is the main general?" Liu Er felt both joy and a hint of absurdity.
