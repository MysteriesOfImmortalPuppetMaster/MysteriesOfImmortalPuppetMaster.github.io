Chapter 734: You're Truly Cut Out for the Righteous Path!

What is a Divine Compensation Relic?

It's an object imbued with divine power and Divine Arts, transformed from its original nature into something entirely different, brimming with divinity.

Gods are beings of divine wisdom and enlightenment.

They grasp the principles of heaven and earth, executing the laws of existence.

Gods often possess Divine Arts and can establish Dao Fields.

Dao Fields contain profound principles that can alter entire regions, creating unique environments. Within their own Dao Fields, Gods can unleash their full power.

However, because Dao Fields constantly manifest these principles, they also expose the God's foundational essence. Enemies with exceptional insight who linger within a God's Dao Field risk discovering the God's vulnerabilities.

Divine Rainbow Legacy Treasures operate similarly.

For example, the half-mirror left by the Underworld Judge was created when he used a Divine Art, leaving behind lingering principles that temporarily solidified into a physical form.

One could think of it like a time-limited secret manual. As time passes, the principles gradually dissipate, and the Divine Rainbow Legacy Treasure eventually vanishes.

Before it disappears, however, the Divine Radiance Legacy Treasure can grant enlightenment to nearly all cultivators. Naturally, cultivators with higher spiritual aptitude will gain deeper insights.

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were no strangers to Divine Compensation Relics.

In the Underworld, they had obtained a wealth of such relics from the Ash Bone Elder's burial site - the corpses of gods and ghosts who had fallen in battle.

However, these relics left behind by the Underworld Judge were both similar to and different from those they had encountered before.

The similarity lay in their origin: all were remnants of gods who had been invoked, imbued with Divine Power, and wielded Divine Arts before their defeat.

The difference was that the former were Paper People, while the latter were based on wooden god statues.

These Paper People originated from White Paper Immortal City, tracing back to the Void Refinement Stage cultivator, the Profound Primordial Scholar. Highly advanced, they showed no signs of disintegration even after centuries.

Yet their complexity made them exceedingly difficult to comprehend.

In contrast, the half-mirror fragment left by the wooden god statue was already showing signs of dissolution. Paradoxically, this made its secrets more accessible, allowing others to study and understand it.

After a moment's thought, Ning Zhuo decided, "Elder Brother, your comprehension is stronger than mine. You should study this Divine Radiance Relic first."

Given their close relationship, Sun Lingtong didn't stand on ceremony. He nodded immediately. "Time is limited. It's best if I go first."

"However, to ensure we get the most out of it, teach me the 'head hanging from the beam' and 'thigh pricking with an awl' methods first. And lend me your Intentional Brush."

Ning Zhuo nodded without hesitation. "Of course!"

Their bond went far beyond mere life-saving. Ning Zhuo even shared the Fire Offering Prajna Spirit Release Sutra with Sun Lingtong.

Ning Zhuo taught him meticulously, and Sun Lingtong learned quickly.

During their continuous practice, Ning Zhuo constantly corrected his technique. By the third session, Sun Lingtong was executing the movements flawlessly, with perfect form.

"I'll practice a few more times, then we can discuss it," Sun Lingtong said, dismissing Ning Zhuo to ponder the technique on his own.

Ning Zhuo moved to the other side of the Void within the formation and began playing his musical instruments.

Many Demons possessed musical skills; in fact, many Demonic Cultivator Cultivation Arts were activated through sound. The Buddhist Sect had the Lion's Roar, Heavenly Dragon Zen Chant, Great and Small Thunderous Sounds; the Daoist School had the Cloud Pavilion Heavenly Music, Profound Capital Spirit-Startling Rhythm, and Brow Sea Tide-Rising Melody; the Confucian School had the Great Righteousness Long Song and Spring and Autumn Echo; and the Military Strategist School had the Enemy-Urging War Drum, Formation-Breaking Tune, and Ten-Sided Ambush Sound.

The Buddhist Sect emphasized fierce destruction and purification, the Daoist School focused on harnessing natural forces, the Servant Clan valued order and humanism, and the Military Strategist School prioritized practical combat and morale-boosting.

In contrast, Demonic Cultivator musical techniques were sinister, deceptive, and capable of manipulating minds, often evoking negative emotions and desires.

Next, Ning Zhuo repeatedly used the Chrysanthemum Soul Rolling Boat Technique to deliver righteous punishment upon all the soul vessels Sun Lingtong had purchased.

He acquired numerous Demonic Cultivator musical techniques in the process.

For example, the Nine-Spun Auspice required the performer to infuse their own vital essence and soul into the instrument. Its mournful, resonant tones evoked the wails of ten thousand souls.

Those struck by its melody would find their minds overwhelmed by negative emotions, their fighting spirit crumbling as tears of blood flowed ceaselessly.

Another example was the Wondrous Music Rod Asia. Plucking its strings produced an entrancing, low hum, its music both beautiful and seductive.

It lulled listeners into a false sense of security, immersing them in illusory pleasures until they died in the throes of ecstasy.

Then there was the Xu Yu Bone Flute. This required a specific bone flute Magic Artifact to play. Its piercing, distorted, and unpredictable notes sounded like a cacophony of chaotic curses, screams, maniacal laughter, and spiteful sobs. The flute's sound directly assaulted the listener's consciousness, implanting terrifyingly realistic and chaotic hallucinations.

Ning Zhuo felt as if he had personally used these techniques, so vivid and deeply ingrained were the memories.

"It seems like there are many options, but in reality, few are truly usable," Ning Zhuo said with a wry smile.

These methods were far too steeped in Demonic Cultivator practices, clashing sharply with Ning Zhuo's own style.

In the end, Ning Zhuo chose to wait.

Patience is the key to stability.

This musical technique employed an overwhelming number of sweeping strums, producing zither notes so piercing they felt like red-hot Profound Iron spikes hammering directly into the eardrums and skull.

The sonic waves materialized as invisible blades, each capable of shattering armor. Layer upon layer of these sonic blades could inflict the agonizing death of a thousand cuts, a cruelty characteristic of the Demonic Cultivator's brutal methods.

Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, his eyes closed. He visualized a zither before him, his hands hovering in the air as his fingers danced across imaginary strings, plucking and sweeping with practiced ease.

Simultaneously, he secretly activated the Ripping Coin, Hidden Delay, Steady musical technique.

This wasn't a Cultivation Art, but rather a spell-like technique. Lacking a physical instrument and a compatible Cultivation Art, Ning Zhuo temporarily substituted with Five Elements Spiritual Power, conjuring sonic blades in the five elemental colors: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth.

For a moment, the five-colored sonic orbs swirled and flashed in a dazzling display, creating a visually striking spectacle. Yet Ning Zhuo shook his head inwardly at their actual power.

Before long, someone knocked on the array from outside. "Young Master Ning Zhuo, the tenth-grade ingredient you requested has been acquired."

It was Old Chef.

After selecting the music skill, Ning Zhuo immediately sent a Flying Letter to arrange for Old Chef to go out and purchase the necessary materials.

The large-headed youth remained cross-legged on the thin cushion, his eyes narrowed into slits as his divine sense spread out, manipulating the Cave Residence Jade Token to control the Martial Arts Arena Formation and open a narrow Void.

Old Chef stood outside the Formation, watching its transformations with a mixture of surprise and suspicion. His experienced eyes quickly detected that something was amiss with the Martial Arts Arena Formation; the spatial layers unfolded in a rushed and chaotic manner.

Though only a fleeting glimpse, the interior of the Formation appeared disheveled, as if it had endured a fierce battle.

While Old Chef had been guided to Ning Zhuo's side by the White Paper City Lord, he genuinely cared for the young master's well-being. He hurriedly asked, "Young Master, are you alright?"

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "I'm fine. I was just sparring with my servant, though it wasn't very satisfying. This Martial Arts Arena Formation isn't very sturdy."

"That's good, that's good," Old Chef replied hastily.

Secretly, however, he clicked his tongue in astonishment. The Young Master and his servant are both only at the Foundation Establishment Stage. I know this Formation well; under normal circumstances, it should easily withstand a battle between two Foundation Establishment cultivators.

"Unless they possess combat power equivalent to the Golden Core stage.

"I'm not surprised Young Master can unleash Golden Core-level power. He's already obtained a stone tablet, making him one of the most outstanding newcomers in the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect.

"What I didn't expect was that his little servant also has some tricks up his sleeve."

In Old Chef's mind, Sun Lingtong had always been Ning Zhuo's servant, naturally leading him to underestimate the latter.

Meanwhile, after returning, Ning Zhuo informed Old Chef, Qing Chi, and Gongsun Yan about obtaining the stone tablet. The trio were overjoyed, further convinced that following Ning Zhuo was a path to a bright and prosperous future.

When Ning Zhuo received the zither, he discovered it was a Magic Artifact.

Old Chef had thoughtfully attached a Flying Letter to the instrument, detailing the purchase channel and price.

As it turned out, Old Chef had immediately set out upon receiving his orders, heading to the nearest Trading Hall to directly purchase a zither.

The Trading Hall lived up to its reputation as one of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's sixteen halls, offering a vast array of goods as numerous as the stars in the sky. The zither, being a relatively common instrument, wasn't difficult to acquire.

Now that Ning Zhuo had a zither of his own, he immediately began practicing.

After just one practice session, he was already playing the final section with remarkable fluency. Even Sun Lingtong, who was on the other side of the room, was drawn by Ning Zhuo's playing and glanced over.

By the time Ning Zhuo finished his second practice session, he was playing with complete mastery and composure, as if he were an experienced musician with decades of experience on the zither.

Yet he was only seventeen years old.

Sun Lingtong shook his head in amazement. "Little Zhuo, you're really taking off! This rate of progress is simply unbelievable."

Ning Zhuo gently pressed his hands against the zither to silence the lingering notes.

Turning to Sun Lingtong, he shared his insights with genuine excitement: "It doesn't feel like I'm learning something new. It's more like an old man who hasn't touched his instrument in years. The moment my fingers touched the strings, waves of familiarity washed over me. That feeling has been constant ever since."

"My mind was already deeply familiar with the zither. All I needed was for my body to remember the movements buried in my muscle memory - to remember how to use the instrument."

This rate of progress was truly astonishing.

Even the big-headed youth couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement.

Sun Lingtong's eyes flashed with sharp light. "So, White Paper Immortal City is extremely important to you, Little Zhuo!"

Ning Zhuo nodded solemnly. "Yes! If we can control White Paper Immortal City, we can not only harvest vast quantities of Soul Drives at a lower cost and with greater stability, but also potentially increase our Yang Heaven Merit by using the Soul-Burning Ferry Technique!"

Lower cost!

Stability!

Vast quantities!

These words, combined, elevated White Paper Immortal City to the highest tier of importance. For Ning Zhuo's cultivation, this was of paramount significance.

Damaging the Nether Heavens' possessions could potentially earn favor from the Yang Heaven, as proven by their previous confrontation with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

Sun Lingtong's brow furrowed slightly, his gaze sharpening. "So, if the higher-ups of the Myriad Manifestations Sect try to seize White Paper Immortal City, what should we do?"

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "This is precisely our opportunity.

"First, the Myriad Manifestations Sect is a Super Sect - we can't possibly defeat them directly.

"Second, conflict is inevitable. But by joining the sect, we can transform this external conflict into an internal one. We can use their own strength against them, just like we're doing now with the Confucian cultivators and the Hall of Zhu Yu."

"That's a perfect example."

Even with the Qing-Jiao Army, Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and their group stood no chance against the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

If you can't beat them, join them.

Ning Zhuo was exceptionally pragmatic and adaptable.

"Finally, White Paper Immortal City has its own City Lord. The Myriad Manifestations Sect, being an arm of the Flying Cloud Kingdom, can't act with impunity here.

Our current position is strategically crucial and gives us a distinct advantage. We can play both sides, maintaining good relations with both factions while using their conflict to our benefit - borrowing strength to strike with strength!"

Sun Lingtong clapped in admiration, grinning. "I get it, I get it! At the Myriad Manifestations Sect, we'll use White Paper Immortal City as leverage in negotiations with the higher-ups. And once we're in White Paper Immortal City, we can rely on the Myriad Manifestations Sect to negotiate with the White Paper City Lord!"

"Brilliant strategy, brilliant strategy! Ning Zhuo, you're truly born to thrive in the Righteous Path!"

Ning Zhuo chuckled. "I was born into the Righteous Path, Boss."

His smile faded slightly as he added, "It's a pity you lack my Innate Talent, Boss. Otherwise, you could have progressed just as rapidly."

Sun Lingtong shook his head. "My passion lies solely in theft. But the world's greatest thieves almost all come from the Void Sect. How could I ever target my fellow sect members?"

"Lu Zhuo, study diligently, strive for continuous progress, and integrate all your knowledge. Your corresponding realm will naturally accumulate."

"Then I can learn directly from you," Sun Lingtong replied. "You can impart the true meaning to me and elevate my realm. That would be much more efficient."

Ning Zhuo nodded. It was indeed a viable approach. After all, wasn't that how he had advanced his own Five Elements realm?

Ning Zhuo pondered, "In that case, I'll need to consult the Confucian cultivators about their teaching methods - how they instruct others in the Method. In the areas of imparting knowledge, teaching skills, and resolving doubts, the Servant Clan excels above all other sects."

"This Flying Cloud Assembly truly presents countless opportunities, more than I can count."

"Now is the perfect moment. After making some deliberate moves, I can get the Servant Clan cultivators to help me design a corresponding Flourishing Cloud Minor Trial."

This was the tacit understanding Ning Zhuo had already established with the Confucian cultivators.

Sun Lingtong, however, remained skeptical. "Little Zhuo, you've already changed your stone tablet. The Confucian cultivators will undoubtedly learn of this. I wonder if their attitude toward you will change?"

"Will their attitude change?" Ning Zhuo asked.

Ning Zhuo smiled confidently. "Even if they change their minds and decide not to come after me anymore, it won't matter. The future is long, and with a friend like Wen Ruanyu, learning some Confucian cultivation methods shouldn't be too difficult."

"Indeed," Sun Lingtong nodded, then added, "It's always better to rely on oneself. There's another way."

Ning Zhuo swallowed. "Boss, are you talking about that demonic Confucian cultivator you mentioned before?"

"Exactly!" Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up as she spoke. "The first time I heard about the Great Sage Great Thief Scripture, my heart stirred. I've been extremely interested in this cultivation art ever since."

Ning Zhuo's expression shifted, his tone becoming serious. "If that's the case, then no matter the price, we'll do everything we can to acquire it."

Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had risked his life to rescue Sun Lingtong. This sum of money was nothing in comparison.

Sun Lingtong waved his hand. "There's no need for such haste. We can investigate the relevant information first before making a decision. While cultivators' spiritual intuitions are sometimes accurate, they've become increasingly unreliable lately."

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "Elder Brother, don't forget we recently triumphed in the Underworld Prefecture. Our Yang Merit and Qi should be at their peak right now. Under these circumstances, any Inspiration we receive deserves serious consideration."

Sun Lingtong nodded. "That's true."

He grinned. "You make a valid point. I'm even more intrigued by the Great Sage Great Thief Scripture now."

After finalizing their plans and exchanging insights on their studies, the sworn brothers parted ways discreetly.

Sun Lingtong, carrying the Divine Compensation Relic, secretly returned to the Jade Stream Emperorate, intending to use the Luo River Scroll pages to help him comprehend the Divine Rainbow Legacy Treasure.

Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, instructed Gongsun Yan to select materials for a new divine statue. He planned to secretly craft the statue himself and then invite the deity to inhabit it.

The previous statue had been destroyed, and he needed to erect a new one to reactivate the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda.
