Chapter 770: Lord Qingwu

Ning Zhuo’s gaze was calm as he looked at the remaining three cultivators.

He wore a solemn expression and cupped his fists in salute: "Fighting further is futile. What do you three fellow Daoists think?"

The three cultivators looked at each other in dismay.

Originally, if Tie Zheng and Ning Zhuo had continued to wear each other down, they would have had high hopes. However, with a single sentence, Ning Zhuo struck directly at the weakest point in Tie Zheng's heart, successfully persuading him to surrender.

The remaining three cultivators, facing Ning Zhuo who still possessed combat strength, immediately fell into an awkward situation.

To fight or not to fight?

All three showed hesitation.

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath. Mobilizing his divine sense, several pieces of Profound Weapon Armor flew slowly around him.

Crack.

The bronze long whip lashed out, producing a loud, crisp sound.

This sound snapped the three cultivators back to reality.

One of them let out a long sigh: "Fine. Since a Golden Core like Tie Zheng surrendered, I will admit defeat as well."

His declaration immediately drew glares from the other two.

But as he was teleported out of the arena, the remaining two felt helpless.

"I concede! Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo is indeed a cut above," the second person said, dropping his weapon and allowing himself to be teleported away.

The last cultivator held a kitchen knife in his hand.

He was still in the middle of refining it.

"Sigh, what a pity!" He looked at the kitchen knife with regret, eventually throwing it down. He cupped his hands toward Ning Zhuo and publicly conceded as well.

In the limestone cave, only Ning Zhuo remained standing proudly, surrounded by Profound Weapon Armor scattered all over the ground.

"Eleven, twelve... sixteen."

The cultivators of the Profound Armor Cave counted carefully, confirming the number of Profound Weapon Armor pieces in the arena.

Since only Ning Zhuo remained with no competitors, all these pieces of Profound Weapon Armor counted towards his score.

"First place!"

"Ning Zhuo is the winner of this Rising Clouds Minor Trial."

"Another first place has emerged."

"Phew, I didn't expect this result. At the beginning, I thought he would be eliminated very quickly."

"Among all the winners, Ning Zhuo will be one of the most memorable cultivators. Haha, intelligence regarding him will certainly sell for a good price."

Cultivator Hao listened to the crowd's discussion, but he felt no relief. He glanced at the surrounding cultivators, a cold light flashing in the depths of his eyes: "Although the Rising Clouds Minor Trial has ended, it is not over yet."

At the edge of the cliff, the sea of clouds surged.

Neither Ban Ji nor Ban Jie had the leisure to enjoy their tea. The mountain wind blew, ruffling their hair and clothes, leaving them feeling only irritable and cold.

This was because the latest intelligence had just been delivered to their hands.

"Ning Zhuo actually became the final victor? And took first place?!"

"That Golden Core waste, Tie Zheng, actually surrendered voluntarily!" Ban Ji's face was covered in gloom.

His gaze was sharp, filled with anger and hatred, as he stared at Ban Jie: "Why did you split the manpower you planted this time into two waves? If you had deployed them all at once, the final result might have been very different!"

Ban Jie sighed and rolled her eyes at Ban Ji, thinking to herself: If I didn't control the level of assistance, how could I temper and stimulate your Royal Mandate?

Of course, she only kept this thought in her heart.

On the surface, she explained: "If we had deployed all our manpower, it would have likely made you a target for everyone! The three Golden Core cultivators, combined with Ning Zhuo and the others, would have eliminated you first."

Ban Ji was not so easily persuaded: "Of course, we wouldn't have revealed our hand and used our full strength right at the start. The real opportunity was right after Tie Zheng eliminated Lu Zeng and Ao Pan. Why didn't you unleash our full power then?"

Ban Jie scoffed coldly: "Don't forget, before the victory was decided between the Golden Core cultivators , you and the Rust Calamity Artisan had already been forced into a disadvantage by Ning Zhuo and the others. I activated the ambushers only because I had no other choice."

She paused for a moment before continuing: "There is another point. If we had used all our manpower, how would outsiders view our Ban family? Even if you took first place, it would have been an unfair victory. At that time, not to mention others, Ning Zhuo alone would definitely make a big issue out of it. Our clan would be very passive!"

Ban Ji’s breathing grew heavy; he clenched his fists, veins popping out.

A wave of hostility rose in his heart, and he gritted his teeth secretly: "Reputation again! Always hesitating due to scruples everywhere; it's not satisfying at all. Ahhh! I really want to disregard everything, lead my forces to sweep through and crush them, defeating Ning Zhuo, Tie Zheng, and the rest, stepping them all under my feet!"

Ban Jie could not hear his inner thoughts, but seeing Ban Ji's bad expression, she could only advise him tactfully: "For this minor trial, we received strong support from the family, planting nearly ten people in ambush. It’s just that from the very beginning, we fell into Ning Zhuo's rhythm. Being forced to activate the ambushers repeatedly meant that our painstaking advance preparations yielded very low returns."

"There is one more point: I miscalculated Tie Zheng."

"Judging from his performance in the arena, this person likely has a Heart Demon. I activated the ambushers to help you, but it ended up making you a thorn in his side."

Reminded by these words and thinking of how the family had assisted him so much only for him to be eliminated, Ban Ji was immediately overcome by shame.

He took a deep breath and shook his head slightly: "You didn't miscalculate; you just underestimated Tie Zheng. This isn't your blame either. Looking solely at the old intelligence, who could have seen that Tie Zheng had a Heart Demon?"

Seeing Ban Ji's expression soften a bit, Ban Jie continued: "There is one more point that caused us to swallow the bitter fruit of defeat. That is Ning Zhuo actually having a seventh piece of Profound Weapon Armor! Yet the insider we bought off concealed this. This led to a severe misjudgment on our side!"

If she had known earlier that Ning Zhuo had a seventh weapon, Ban Jie would have included Ning Zhuo when she was secretly provoking the Golden Core cultivators.

Ban Ji recalled the events, emitting wisps of killing intent: "That kid Ning Zhuo is cunning!"

"He kept the bronze whip hidden away and didn't bring it out until the very end."

Ban Ji suddenly froze, thinking of Ning Zhuo's bronze shield. The corner of his eye twitched: "That kid losing the shield - could that also have been him deliberately showing weakness to the enemy?"

Seeing that her persuasion had stabilized Ban Ji’s emotions and successfully shifted his attention to Ning Zhuo, Ban Jie said calmly: "It is very possible!"

"According to the intelligence, although he held the upper hand at the end, he used words to persuade Tie Zheng to surrender."

Ban Jie rubbed the tea cup, which was full of cracks, in her hand, her expression grave: "Ban Ji, this person is different from the cultivators you usually deal with. Setting aside his innate talent, his negotiation methods alone show his insight into and manipulation of human nature."

"He is not so easy to deal with."

Ban Ji said impatiently: "Do you need to tell me that? He is my Human Tribulation!"

"Why are we still staying here? To drink the mountain wind?"

Saying so, he stood up.

This was near the Profound Armor Cave. Ban Ji had tasted defeat here and learned that Ning Zhuo had won, suppressing him once again. He did not want to stay here any longer.

Ban Jie sighed: "You leave first."

"I still have to clean up the aftermath."

She had bribed quite a few cultivators of the Profound Armor Cave this time; otherwise, the intelligence would not have been transmitted so quickly.

Her assistance to Ban Ji involved activating hidden hands with too much force, which had already offended the Profound Armor Cave.

Next, she needed to hurry to apologize and offer gifts to ease the relationship.

Ban Ji grunted in acknowledgement and left directly.

Ban Jie’s face was unsightly as she packed up the tea set and cups, dismissed her subordinates, and flew alone toward the Profound Armor Cave.

This operation was a complete failure.

Ban Ji’s Royal Mandate was not triggered, nor did he take first place, and their relationship with the Profound Armor Cave had deteriorated significantly.

"Human Tribulation ... is this the Human Tribulation of a Royal Mandate ?" When Ban Jie looked at Ning Zhuo now, she was at least ten times more cautious than before.

Pivot Cave.

Cultivator Hao knelt on the ground, having finished reporting the detailed situation.

He was very self-aware. Realizing that the higher-ups would definitely investigate, he took the initiative to come to the Pivot Cave as soon as the Rising Clouds Minor Trial ended. He confessed to the higher-ups and asked for punishment: he had accepted some bribes from the Ban family but did not expect the Ban family to act in such a way. However, after realizing something was wrong, he immediately took measures to cover up and disguise Ning Zhuo's seventh battle.

The high-ranking cultivator listened to his statement and snorted coldly, scolding Cultivator Hao with a few words. Just as he was about to let him off lightly, his expression suddenly changed as he received a divine sense transmission.

The high-ranking cultivator immediately adopted a solemn expression, sat up straight, and said indifferently to Cultivator Hao: "You keep kneeling!"

"The Lord has issued a decree: Summon Ning Zhuo for an audience."

"As for your punishment, wait and see what the Lord decides."

Cultivator Hao immediately cried out in alarm: "How could such a small matter disturb the Lord?!"

The high-ranking cultivator shook his head slowly: "The Lord is unfathomable; every move carries deep meaning. How can subordinates like us speculate on it?"

Deep inside the Pivot Cave residence, a set of ancient bronze armor was enshrined year-round. It was the main body of the Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor!

Hidden within the armor was a god named Lord Qingwu.

Lord Qingwu was currently reviewing the intelligence on Ning Zhuo. From the very beginning of Ning Zhuo's participation in the Profound Armor Cave's Rising Clouds Minor Trial, right up to the end where he became the sole victor and took first place - the entire process was very complete.

Lord Qingwu chuckled and muttered to himself: "Interesting. The Ban family forcibly intervened, causing Ban Ji to encounter the bronze sword and bronze blade, but he missed the bronze shield that should have been assigned to him. It also caused the bronze long whip to be assigned to Ning Zhuo."

"Later, when they revealed their ambushing manpower, it instead provoked Tie Zheng to attack. Forcing assistance led to the opposite result. It’s more like shooting themselves in the foot."

As a god, although Lord Qingwu controlled the Profound Armor Cave, he was very indifferent. He did not take the Ban family's offense to heart.

He focused more of his attention on Ning Zhuo.

"Firstly, he is not a martial cultivator or a body cultivator, but a mechanism cultivator."

"Secondly, he is very young and has outstanding talent; a genuine genius."

"Finally, his Qi Luck is extremely flourishing, far higher than that of ordinary people. The Ban family helped Ban Ji, but indirectly benefited him instead."

"Satisfying these three points, he is the fated person I have been waiting for, for many years!"

Lord Qingwu made a judgment and could not help but recall a scene from the past.

He had made a special secret visit to Master Dunjia: "I ask the Mystic Master to perform a divination for me, to calculate my path of cultivation."

Master Dunjia was a Demon Cultivator who had been fortunate enough to obtain a fragmented inheritance of divination in his early years. Coincidentally, his true form was a mystic turtle, which matched this inheritance quite well. After thousands of years of bitter cultivation, he had accumulated some divination ability.

Master Dunjia had no way to refuse Lord Qingwu's request and had to perform the divination for Him.

He calculated for seven days and seven nights. Upon obtaining the result, he told Lord Qingwu: "My Lord, your choice to take the path of becoming a god is correct. Just follow the steps and proceed."

Lord Qingwu snorted unhappily: "It is precisely because I have encountered a bottleneck on this path that I came to find you for a divination."

"Do not brush me off. Tell me quickly, how do I break through next!"

Master Dunjia nodded hurriedly and continued to explain in detail: "My Lord, your true form is the artifact spirit of the Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor. Because you absorbed countless Profound Weapon Armors refined by others, you accumulated vigorous Dao and principles, gradually giving birth to divine miracles and transforming from an artifact spirit into a god."

"The reason you have fallen into a bottleneck is precisely because of this."

"The principles you have accumulated are too numerous and overly complex. Only by achieving purity can you go a step further!"

Lord Qingwu's expression softened slightly: "Before coming to you, I also consulted many experts of the same sect. I already know this crux. I asked you to calculate how to achieve purity!"

Master Dunjia then said: "Lord, do not worry. I have already calculated the cultivation opportunity related to you."

"Wait until twelve years from now. The Myriad Manifestations Sect will hold the Flying Cloud Assembly again. The Profound Armor Cave will also hold multiple Rising Clouds Minor Trials. Your fated person will stand out at this time, participate in the minor trial, take first place, and appear before you on his own initiative."

Lord Qingwu raised his eyebrows slightly: "Oh?"

Master Dunjia continued: "This person is a male cultivator, uniquely gifted, very young, and possesses Qi Luck that is extremely flourishing, far above ordinary people. When the Lord meets him, it will be clear at a glance."

Lord Qingwu thought for a moment and asked: "Since this person is young, his cultivation is likely not high. Since he is actively participating in the Profound Armor Cave's minor trial, his cultivation is likely between Foundation Establishment and Golden Core."

"Can such a cultivation level help me break through my bottleneck?"

Lord Qingwu was somewhat unconvinced.

Master Dunjia said: "Lord, do not worry. I have calculated the method for you. At that time, you only need to use the pretext of awarding the first place prize to instill the many True Intents within yourself into him. Strip away the principles and bless him with them."

Lord Qingwu raised his eyebrows again.

Master Dunjia said again: "Lord, your accumulation is too thick. The path of divine cultivation lies in the word'purity.' However, the True Intents and principles you have comprehended mainly consist of four parts. The first is Mechanism arts, the second is Artifact Refining, the third is Military Strategy , and the fourth is Martial Arts."

"Whichever path you choose to become a god with, you must discard the other three aspects."

Lord Qingwu sighed: "I have long since found out about this method. But to instill True Intent and bless someone with principles is extremely difficult. It requires finding extremely precious materials capable of bearing True Intent and principles. It also requires the help of an Artifact Refiner Grandmaster to help me stabilize my form. Otherwise, I will suffer heavy injuries and risk disintegration. Is my fated person an Artifact Refiner Grandmaster?"

Master Dunjia shook his head: "He is not. I do not know the relevant details. I only calculated that this person can help the Lord break through the bottleneck and make further progress. As for how exactly he accomplishes it, that is not within the results of this divination."

Lord Qingwu could not help but narrow his eyes, half-believing and half-doubting.

The past was like smoke; twelve years passed in a flash.

Lord Qingwu was still half-believing and half-doubting.

He smiled slightly, coming back to his senses: "Since things have come to this, I will summon this Ning Zhuo to test him, and then I will know if the divination was true or false."

"If it is false, I will definitely settle the score with Master Dunjia! Uh, I almost forgot he is already dead."

"Fine, fine."
