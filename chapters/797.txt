Chapter 797: Could it be One-Sided Affection?

Zhu Guizhi stood below the stage, witnessing the entire battle between Gu Qing and Zhu Fenxiang.

Deep within, she sighed, nearly reaching up to cover her face in exasperation. Why did it have to come to this? What benefit was there in offending Gu Qing? Zhu Guizhi couldn't fathom it, but she was powerless to intervene. Up until now, Zhu Fenxiang had been giving her the cold shoulder, using cultivation and battle preparation as excuses to avoid meeting her.

"No, after this battle, I must have a proper talk with Fenxiang." Seeing Zhu Fenxiang walk out of the Martial Arts Hall, Zhu Guizhi immediately sent a divine sense transmission, her tone solemn.

Zhu Fenxiang’s heart stirred, and she felt an instinctive flash of annoyance. However, knowing she eventually had to face her mother, she replied indifferently, "This battle is over. We shall speak when we return."

Back at their rented immortal cave, the mother and daughter finally had a private conversation.

Zhu Guizhi shook her head and sighed. "Even if Gu Qing and Zhao Hansheng are outsiders, there was no need to offend them like this. What benefit did Young Master Ning Zhuo give you to make you help him so fervently?"

Zhu Fenxiang shook her head. "Ning Zhuo hasn't even contacted me privately. This was my own decision."

Zhu Guizhi stared at her. The claim was too far-fetched; she didn't believe it for a second.

Zhu Fenxiang felt a bitterness she couldn't voice. She hadn't actually wanted to alienate Gu Qing to such a degree. Having received elite training since childhood and worked her way up to become the Foundation Establishment representative of the Zhu family’s current generation, she possessed considerable political acumen.

But... she had no choice. True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard had insisted!

Zhu Fenxiang’s true reliance was this great deity. Upon learning of the situation, the Sovereign had laughed heartily and decided to cooperate with Ning Zhuo to stir up trouble. When the thigh is thicker than the arm, what could she do? She could only comply.

However, she couldn't tell her mother the truth. On one hand, this involved the Sovereign, who had explicitly demanded secrecy. Furthermore, she didn't want to appear weak, which would damage her image and reputation. On the other hand, her relationship with Zhu Guizhi was incredibly tense. She wanted to stay as far away from her mother as possible.

Because of these reasons, Zhu Fenxiang ultimately uttered only one cold sentence: "This is my business. It has nothing to do with you!"

Zhu Guizhi’s brows shot up as anger flared within her. From her perspective, her daughter had caused trouble, and she had traveled thousands of miles to clean up the mess. She had first tried to negotiate with Ning Zhuo only to be rebuffed, then waited at the cave only to be ignored. Seeing her daughter offend Gu Qing filled her with frustration at her perceived "wasted potential."

"Fenxiang! I came here for your sake," Zhu Guizhi snapped. "You handled this matter poorly. To win over Ning Zhuo, you gave away the first layer of our clan's Divine Summoning Art. You have vastly underestimated the implications."

"Our political rivals are already spreading rumors and blowing this out of proportion. They want to use this as leverage to strike a heavy blow against our lineage. If we cannot cross this calamity, your status as the Foundation Establishment representative might very well be stripped away."

Zhu Fenxiang was slightly stunned. "Is it that serious? In the clan’s history, haven't the first few layers of the Divine Summoning Art been sold before?"

Zhu Guizhi shook her head with a bitter smile. "You are being too naive. The Divine Summoning Art is the foundation of our clan's heritage - it is no trivial matter! How many times has it actually been traded? Every single time was under exceptional circumstances. What does Ning Zhuo count as? He is merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator with an obscure background and status, and he's only at the mid-stage."

"No," Zhu Fenxiang shook her head immediately. "He is different."

Zhu Guizhi froze, then looked at her daughter with suspicion and scrutiny. "Fenxiang... don't tell me you have strong feelings for him? Was giving the Divine Summoning Art and fighting Gu Qing with all your might just your own unrequited passion?"

Zhu Fenxiang’s denial of her mother and her affirmation of Ning Zhuo had been too swift and resolute. She seemed to have an inexplicable, massive amount of confidence in him.

Zhu Guizhi didn't know the inside story: Fenxiang's confidence came from the Sovereign. From Fenxiang’s perspective, if a Great Deity favored Ning Zhuo so much that he was willing to help him, it was a clear sign to follow suit. But she couldn't say that.

So, Zhu Fenxiang could only face her mother with a stiff, cold expression and reply: "Affection? You can interpret it that way if you like."

"Disaster!" Zhu Guizhi’s heart sank to the bottom. She came to a mistaken conclusion: Her daughter had fallen for Ning Zhuo and was actively sacrificing for him, while he likely didn't share those special feelings.

In the tea room atop the mountain, Gu Qing stood with his hands down before Zhao Hansheng.

He had lost again. If the first loss could be attributed to carelessness and Ning Zhuo's sneak attack, the second loss was a defeat despite his best efforts. He could only watch helplessly as his painted avatar was crushed by the Sovereign’s divided spirit.

A sense of powerlessness filled his body and mind. He was also filled with confusion. He could understand Ning Zhuo, but why did Zhu Fenxiang show no "Righteous Path" tacit understanding? Summoning the Sovereign must have cost her dearly - it was her trump card. Was it really necessary to use it against him?

"I'm just an outsider! I never thought about joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect; we could have been friends!" he wanted to shout at her.

Zhao Hansheng sipped his tea calmly. "So, my student, what do you plan to do next?"

Gu Qing took a deep breath. "Teacher, I have made my decision. After the battle with Zhu Fenxiang, my situation has worsened. Her final words skewed public perception of me and encouraged others to try and defeat me as quickly as possible. I've become a benchmark for combat power, which is extremely disadvantageous."

"I must continue using the painted avatar to fight, as I specified in my challenge letters. But if I continue now, the pressure to win quickly will force others to ignore any 'friendly' matches. Therefore, I plan to wait."

Zhao Hansheng nodded in approval. "Good. A great man knows when to bend and when to stand tall."

Gu Qing knew that if he delayed too long, he would be labeled a coward. He predicted that Ning Zhuo would likely spread rumors to further damage his reputation. However, he had a counter-strategy.

"The third round of the Confucian 'Rising Cloud Trial' for the Flying Cloud Assembly is about to begin. I will claim I am preparing for this trial - that should silence the critics. It is also a stage better suited for me. If Ning Zhuo doesn't show up, then the rumors will be about him being too afraid to face me again."

Deep within the Ban Clan’s ancestral hall, several Supreme Elders gathered around the Luck projections of the Destiny mechanism. Their eyes were fixed on the image of Ning Zhuo's destiny.

The "Hand of Luck" representing Ning Zhuo was now covered in a thicker layer of ice. This ice resisted the entanglement of thorns while significantly mitigating the erosion from the "paper pages" and "ink rain" representing the Confucian influence.

"What? Ning Zhuo's situation has improved this much?" "How did he do it?" "By relying on an ice-attribute Golden Core mechanism, he defeated Gu Qing’s painted avatar and even framed him. Now, Gu Qing is a public target for other geniuses. One must admit, Ning Zhuo played this hand beautifully."

The elders understood the ice armor's effect, but they were baffled by why the "thorns" were also being suppressed. They were still in the dark about his private clash with Zhu Guizhi.

"As expected of a human calamity for the Royal Mandate. Truly troublesome." "Should we intervene?"

"Hold! If we jump in now, we will only implicate Ban Ji. The stronger Ning Zhuo is, the more Ban Ji will gain when he eventually defeats him!"

Suddenly, the luck imagery shifted. The Confucian "paper pages" representing Gu Qing and Zhao Hansheng rose, distancing themselves from Ning Zhuo. As the distance grew, the single page multiplied into many. The ink rain became finer and more persistent. Most notably, the "thorns" began to absorb the ink rain, causing fine script to appear on them.

"Oh? The destinies of these three are becoming so entangled that Gu Qing’s luck is starting to affect the other party. Perhaps we can use Gu Qing’s movements to identify who those thorns represent."

The thorns seemed to receive a long-awaited rain, swelling and sinking deeper into the "Hand of Luck," while the paper pages became slightly yellowed and thin, as if their nutrients were being siphoned.

Inside his bluestone cave, Ning Zhuo was reviewing his battle with Zhu Guizhi.

"The Divine Summoning Art is truly convenient. The deities fight autonomously without the cultivator's control. From the process, Snow Pivot Guard Xie was the pillar, holding back the most pressure. Snow-Colored Maiden Hui acted more as support; she's still a bit lacking when facing Golden Core-level opponents."

Ning Zhuo decided to perform a large-scale material upgrade for Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, just as he had done for Snow Pivot Guard Xie.

"However, I cannot use materials like Perpetual Silent Profound Ice on her. Her Innate Talent is 'Ice-Fat Jade Hands,' which contains vitality. That characteristic is the polar opposite of Perpetual Silent Profound Ice."

With his improved skills in artifact refining and mechanisms, Ning Zhuo was confident. He wouldn't overhaul the blueprints due to time constraints but would instead refine and improve her existing foundation. He intended to replicate his previous success once more.
