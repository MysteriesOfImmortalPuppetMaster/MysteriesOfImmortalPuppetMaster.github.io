Chapter 268: Ning Xiaohui's Testimony Before Death

Zhu Xuanji quickly transformed.

"Sun Lingtong has served as the master of the black market in Fire Persimmon Immortal City for many years, constantly laying plans. The underground secret base exposed during the battle with Cheng Bai is clear evidence." "At the beginning of the Golden Core chaos, it was also Yang Chanyu who deliberately revealed the Demonic Dao Scripture. However, this scripture was fake, and the Zheng family thus faced accountability from Tai Xiao Palace." "The Void Sect uses such schemes to undermine the close alliance between me and the three cases. They have succeeded!" "Good, truly worthy of being a major evil sect, the best at thievery under heaven." "So you have been preparing for at least over a decade, which can be considered long-term planning."

Just as Zhu Xuanji was about to continue listening, a letter flew in from outside the window.

The flying letter hovered in front of Zhu Xuanji, clearly meant for him.

Zhu Xuanji unfolded the letter, and his expression changed drastically after a quick scan with his divine sense.

The letter originated from a Golden Core cultivator of the Zheng family, informing Zhu Xuanji that the Lava Immortal Palace had encountered a shocking change, the spherical light shield was damaged, and a large number of Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts had surged in, threatening the Historical Records Pavilion.

They hoped Zhu Xuanji would return for assistance immediately!

Zhu Xuanji suddenly felt extremely uneasy.

He looked at the timestamp on the letter and realized that it had already been a tea's worth of time since the letter was sent.

"Damn it!" Zhu Xuanji could no longer sit still and stood up directly.

"Sir?" Ning Zhuo quickly inquired.

Zhu Xuanji looked at him: "A major incident has occurred at the Lava Immortal Palace. I must go resolve this matter first; we can discuss your issues later."

"Wait!" Ning Zhuo suddenly shouted.

"Sir Zhu!" Ning Zhuo's face was filled with urgency, "Is it possible that the Void Sect has struck again?" "Take me with you, please!"

"I'm afraid the walls have ears; they may have already discovered that I have turned to the light." "If you leave, I will be left here alone, and I am scared!" "I am too dangerous; I want to stay by your side!" Zhu Xuanji was momentarily at a loss.

However, after a moment's thought, he felt that Ning Zhuo had a point.

"You brat..." Zhu Xuanji grabbed Ning Zhuo by the collar and leaped out the window, transforming into a long rainbow, flying towards Fire Persimmon Mountain.

On the way, three more flying letters arrived.

Zhu Xuanji did not examine them closely and did not stop at all, flying at full speed towards the Lava Immortal Palace.

The peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain was not far away.

After a dozen breaths, Zhu Xuanji reached the summit of the volcano.

Upon arriving, several more flying letters had just been sent out, heading towards Zhu Xuanji.

Zhu Xuanji waved his arm to sweep them all aside.

He was multitasking, using his divine sense to read the letters while keeping his eyes on the Lava Immortal Palace, focusing on the holes in the spherical light shield, his brows furrowing deeply.

Meng Kui had already taken action against the countless Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts outside the holes.

Without the dragon turtle fire spirit to siphon off the magical power, the spherical light shield was receiving ample magical power infusion, and the holes at the top were rapidly healing.

Zhu Xuanji's expression changed again, his aura surged, and for the first time, he lost his composure, exuding a strong killing intent.

This was because he saw in the letter: the Historical Records Pavilion had been destroyed, Ning Xiaohui was dead, and Yang Chanyu was still on the run!

"Good, good, a fine job by the Void Sect." Zhu Xuanji was furious, gritting his teeth.

He took Ning Zhuo and charged towards the Lava Immortal Palace.

Outside the Immortal Palace, the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were already in a frenzy, attacking the spherical light shield madly.

Zhu Xuanji's unhidden actions attracted a large number of demon beasts to attack him.

However, flames, magma, and so on were all blocked by Meng Kui's Nascent Soul hand.

Zhu Xuanji moved smoothly, approaching the Lava Immortal Palace, and was successfully guided in by the treasure light along with Ning Zhuo.

Once inside the Immortal Palace, he let out a long howl.

The howl echoed throughout the Immortal Palace, the surging sound waves reverberating within the spherical light shield.

Zhu Zhen, the Golden Core cultivators from the three families, were all pleasantly surprised, knowing that Zhu Xuanji had returned.

Soon, they converged in mid-air.

"Divine Constable!"

"Hurry, we just lost track of Yang Chanyu, and we urgently need you to take action." "This is the time for your golden eyes to display their might!"

After gathering, another piece of bad news hit them.

Zhu Xuanji's expression darkened again: "Wasn't Yang Chanyu supposed to have a tracking method placed on her?"

The Golden Core cultivators sighed, one of them said: "It was the supreme virtuous water! I sensed that she used a drop, quickly dispelling my method." "Quickly take me to the last known location." Zhu Xuanji was unwilling to delay.

The Golden Core ancestors all moved in unison.

Upon reaching the destination, Zhu Xuanji's eyes glowed with golden light as he employed various techniques.

He held onto Ning Zhuo while leading the other cultivators in pursuit.

As a result, the clues became increasingly numerous, and the traces split into multiple paths.

Ultimately, Zhu Xuanji stopped, his face as dark as water: "Indeed, it is the true transmission of the Void Sect; the method of forging false traces is excellent." The Golden Core cultivators exchanged glances.

Zhu Zhen said: "Brother, this is not your fault. There are many places in the Lava Immortal Palace that we cannot approach." "This makes it extremely convenient for Yang Chanyu to hide."

Zhu Xuanji's expression was stern as he turned to the Golden Core cultivators, coldly saying: "Return to the Historical Records Pavilion!" Meanwhile.

Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong had converged.

"This time, we have truly angered Zhu Xuanji. I just saw his expression; it was terrifying." Yang Chanyu laughed.

Sun Lingtong said solemnly: "Next, we will likely face the combined forces of Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui." Yang Chanyu shrugged, not caring about the upcoming situation.

She took a few steps forward, actively walking up to Sun Lingtong, then bent down to closely examine Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong frowned, instinctively wanting to step back, but unwilling to lose face, she straightened her neck and widened her eyes: "What are you doing?"

Yang Chanyu stared into Sun Lingtong's eyes: "The Water Virtue Supreme Treasure is indeed useful!" "You seem to care about me."

"If it weren't for you sending it in time, I would probably be chased by Zhu Xuanji to the ends of the earth right now." "I can sense that his golden eyes have nearly reached the level of divine abilities!" Sun Lingtong rolled her eyes: "As long as you understand this matter, it's good."

Saying this, she changed direction, wanting to bypass Yang Chanyu and continue forward.

As a result, Yang Chanyu stepped across and blocked Sun Lingtong's path.

Her beautiful eyes fixed intently on Sun Lingtong, and she leaned forward, bringing their faces within a fist's distance.

Sun Lingtong could no longer hold back, stepping back and shouting: "What are you up to? Walk properly!"

Yang Chanyu chuckled, her gaze sharpening: "Tell me, what is your relationship with that Ning Zhuo?" "Haven't I already told you? It's a cooperative relationship!" Sun Lingtong spread her hands.

Yang Chanyu: "But I feel like it's not that simple."

"Ning Zhuo was called out of the Immortal Palace by Zhu Xuanji. The moment he left, you asked me to take action against Ning Xiaohui. You also told me that there was a high possibility of Golden Core cultivators lying in ambush." "Isn't it convenient to take action at this time to clear his suspicions?"

"Goodness, you actually dared to act under Zhu Xuanji's nose, letting the divine constable be your eyewitness. That's quite bold, isn't it?" Sun Lingtong took a step back, while Yang Chanyu took a step forward.

With a pressing demeanor, she continued: "And the bombardment of the Five Elements Cannon Tower was also your doing, right?" "Your arrangements in the Immortal Palace were all in the Historical Records Pavilion. So, you simply blew up the Historical Records Pavilion." "You targeted Ning Xiaohui because this silly girl held a position in the Historical Records Pavilion and could potentially discover your crimes!" Sun Lingtong raised her voice: "What are you thinking?"

"Can we control the Five Elements Cannon Tower? You think too highly of yourself."

Yang Chanyu was not foolish, letting out a cold laugh: "Why can't we control the Five Elements Cannon Tower? Ning Zhuo controls the Medical Pavilion, and even an outsider like me can secretly be installed." "The essence of the Five Elements Cannon Tower and the Medical Pavilion is the same."

"Now still hiding things from me is definitely not going to work!"

"I don't want to be chased by Golden Core cultivators one day and end up getting bombed by the Five Elements Cannon Tower!" Yang Chanyu showed a determined expression, indicating her resolve to know the truth.

Sun Lingtong clicked her tongue, thinking: This woman is indeed hard to deal with! What a hassle.

For a moment, Sun Lingtong felt a headache, quickly pondering what should be said and what should not be said.

The struggle for the Lava Immortal Palace had reached its final juncture.

A precious combat force like Yang Chanyu needed to be fought for with all their might.

But Sun Lingtong could not raise Yang Chanyu's expectations too high, as she still had Elder Qing behind her.

If expectations were set too high, it would easily provoke Elder Qing and others.

Yet she could not give her no expectations.

She just needed to make her feel that there was a chance in this matter, that she could profit from it, so that she could continue to be useful in the future.

Sun Lingtong began to carefully choose her words.

Zhu Xuanji brought Ning Zhuo and the others to the original site of the Historical Records Pavilion.

It was a massive crater, the Historical Records Pavilion had been utterly destroyed, not a trace left.

Zhu Xuanji employed tracking methods but found no results.

His expression was terrifyingly dark.

Ning Zhuo held his breath, not daring to make any large movements.

The other Golden Core cultivators also remained silent.

After a long while, Zhu Xuanji finally spoke: "Let's go, to the next location." Soon, they arrived at the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest.

They stood before a silver furnace.

The silver furnace had already been destroyed.

The one who acted was Zheng Danlian.

"Ning Xiaohui had my monitoring spell on her."

"When I sensed that she had lost her life, in a moment of panic, I directly destroyed this silver furnace." "But... ultimately, I couldn't save her."

Zhu Xuanji ignored him, standing amidst the ruins of the silver furnace, where fragments of the furnace were scattered everywhere.

Zhu Xuanji directly activated his golden eyes and used the Origin Tracing Technique.

Soon, he "saw" Ning Xiaohui in a panic, hiding inside the silver furnace.

He then "saw" Sun Lingtong performing the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra, burning Ning Xiaohui.

Finally, he saw Ning Xiaohui frantically trying to survive in the furnace, knowing she was doomed, and using her magical power to etch words into the ice bricks!

It turned out that Ning Xiaohui was filled with a strong desire for revenge, desperately trying to leave clues for Zhu Xuanji.

Ning Zhuo was quite far from Ning Xiaohui, and previously, it was already difficult to contact her across the Lava Immortal Palace.

By the time they reached the silver furnace, the flames had ignited, making the sensing even more vague.

The characters left by Ning Xiaohui in the ice bricks were very small and concealed.

Neither Ning Zhuo nor Sun Lingtong had noticed!
