Chapter 406: Ning Zhuo's Terrifying Talent

After obtaining the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, Ning Zhuo's desire to leave grew stronger.

This was his biggest goal since coming to Wanyao Valley, which he had finally achieved by luck. Ning Zhuo couldn't wait to ride the Ten Thousand Li Dragon and fly far away.

Staying at Myriad Medicine Sect would no longer help much in treating Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin.

Previously in the Linglong Mirror Wall, Ning Zhuo had already consulted with Fairy Jingyu and others, bringing out Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin and requesting the ancient sages to treat her.

Many doctors, dan masters, and mechanism cultivators shook their heads, expressing their inability to help.

Although the Linglong Mirror Wall was nearly a celestial artifact, it still had its limits. When it came to external paths, it was beyond its capabilities.

The earliest Blood Remnant Dynasty, representing the paths of demons and monsters, could be adapted to and absorbed by the Linglong Mirror Wall. But for the later Forbidden Dynasty, the wall couldn't yet adapt to the Buddhist and divine paths.

Not to mention the ghostly and strange principles of the Night Rain Dynasty.

And Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's dao injury was closely related to the Night Rain Dynasty.

However, many artifact refinement masters were attracted, staring intently at the Buddhist doctor with gleaming eyes.

"This mechanism contains spirituality, it's truly a spiritual treasure!"

"Today's cultivators can create spirituality, the younger generation is impressive!"

"So, we've all grown old, become ancient. We must trust in the wisdom of future generations!"

Originally, Ning Zhuo had hoped the Three Sect Superiors would leave their images in the Linglong Mirror Wall. But the inquiry results left him disappointed.

Even if the Linglong Mirror Wall wasn't self-sealed in the earth's core, it remained in a hidden state. Only those with destiny could touch it and leave their images.

Obviously, although The Master of the Tree Sects was powerful, he had no destiny with the Linglong Mirror Wall.

Sun Lingtong, as an observer, noticed Ning Zhuo's unusual mood and directly reminded him: "Ning Zhuo, stay steady!"

"You've achieved such a high goal as the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, you should be grateful and comforted."

"Don't be too impatient."

"Haste makes waste, you still have many important loose ends to tie up."

"Calm down!"

Under Sun Lingtong's rebuke, Ning Zhuo forcibly endured.

He knew Sun Lingtong was right - he indeed had many important matters left unfinished.

At Original Mountain, in the Maoshu Tower.

Ning Zhuo sat at the highest level, with tea and pastries laid out before him, being treated very well.

However, he had no mind for food and drink.

He slowly opened a scroll.

The Enlightenment Diagram - Golden Dragon Breaking Through Clouds.

The vast plains stretched endlessly. The sky was covered in dense clouds, like heavy curtains hanging from heaven. A dazzling light broke through the sky, transforming into a giant dragon emerging from the sea of clouds.

The dragon's body was covered in golden scales, each scale flashing with metallic light, as if forged from divine weapons. It tumbled through the air, stirring up gusts of wind, tearing apart the cloud layers, revealing golden lightning, displaying a divine appearance!

"The metal-element spell Golden Dragon Breaking Formation..." Ning Zhuo only needed to look two or three times before immediately comprehending the spell contained within this enlightenment diagram.

He only needed continuous practice to master it thoroughly.

"This Golden Dragon Breaking Formation spell still has many areas that can be improved."

Ning Zhuo carefully pondered for a moment and immediately discovered that this spell still had quite a few flaws that could be completely improved, enhancing its power while reducing spiritual energy consumption.

His current level in the Five Elements realm was at least at the master level. Looking at these enlightenment diagrams, he could not only perceive the spells and comprehend the paintings in just a few breaths but could also detect flaws and imperfections.

"What is my true level in the Five Elements realm?"

Even Ning Zhuo wasn't quite sure about this.

After all, back then, with the boost from his celestial talent and Spirit Concealment Willow, by the final stage, he was completely dazed and couldn't distinguish clearly.

As for what his celestial talent was, he had also asked the Five Elements Divine Lord.

The Five Elements Divine Lord told him: After helping to boost his realm earlier, he had sought out many dharma bodies from the reflection wall to calculate.

These dharma bodies had one thing in common - they were all skilled in divination.

The calculation results showed that the Five Elements Divine Lord not taking Ning Zhuo as a disciple was an absolutely correct decision. Another correct matter concerned Ning Zhuo's celestial talent. The later this talent was revealed, the more beneficial it would be for Ning Zhuo. The earlier it was revealed, the more it would bring disaster, making Ning Zhuo unable to bear it and triggering a life-or-death crisis.

The Five Elements Divine Lord specially warned Ning Zhuo: "Regarding your celestial talent, you must let nature take its course, absolutely must not actively seek it out, don't conduct tests. When the time is right, this answer will automatically come to you. This would be best for you."

"Many things in this world aren't better known earlier. Sometimes, not knowing is actually most beneficial."

Ning Zhuo, though disappointed, chose to believe the Five Elements Divine Lord's judgment and temporarily stopped exploring his own celestial talent.

This wasn't difficult for him.

Because in his heart, the most urgent and important matter was still finding a way to cure his mother.

Ha ha ha!

Lin Jingshan's senior brother Lao De stepped heavily on the wooden stairs.

He brought a batch of enlightenment diagrams, feeling indignant in his heart.

"How has Master become confused? Actually letting me bring so many enlightenment diagrams for that thief Ning Zhuo to view."

"It must be little junior sister who spoke many good words for Ning Zhuo!"

"The key is that when reporting to big senior brother, he actually was happy to see it happen! Ah, big senior brother is too kind, and too noble."

Regarding the matters of the Linglong Mirror Wall, according to the alliance agreement, all involved parties had to maintain secrecy.

Lao De and others' talents and abilities were insufficient, so they were kept in the dark.

Lao De walked to the top floor of the library tower and saw how well Ning Zhuo was being treated, his expression darkened further.

He thought to himself: "In the past, only Master and big senior brother have sat in this position. Now it's being occupied by an outsider like Ning Zhuo, how preposterous."

Constrained by his sect's rules, Lao De couldn't act out, so he could only put on a cold face and place the enlightenment diagrams on the table.

Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows: "Why are there only these few? Didn't your Master ask you to gather all the Five Elements-related enlightenment diagrams from the entire sect to show me?"

Lao De thought, it would take you at least several years to comprehend these, what's the rush?

But verbally he explained that knowing Ning Zhuo was anxious, he decided to first deliver the portion that had been gathered.

Ning Zhuo nodded, even without using Life Thread Silk, he could roughly understand Lao De's mood and thoughts just by observing his expression.

"Wait a moment, I'll return these to you after I finish looking at them," Ning Zhuo stopped Lao De who wanted to withdraw.

He opened a newly delivered enlightenment diagram.

At the top of a high mountain, a cultivator wearing a red robe raised both hands to the sky, as if guiding the sun's power.

In the sky, the scorching sun hung high, sunlight poured down like flames, and the world was filled with intense heat.

The cultivator was surrounded by raging fire, light flames distorted the air, ignited the mountain's vegetation, triggering raging flames that burned everything.

Fire element spell - Blazing Sun World Burn!

Ning Zhuo's heart trembled: "What a fierce and domineering spell."

He put down the enlightenment diagram, stretched out his hand, his five fingers forming seals, and after a dozen breaths, a flame emerged from his palm.

This flame somewhat resembled the one in the diagram.

Seeing this, Lao De was shocked to his core and involuntarily asked: "This! Ning Zhuo, have you previously learned this spell?"

He absolutely couldn't believe that Ning Zhuo could comprehend the spell from the enlightenment diagram after just a few glances.

This was truly inconceivable.

Lao De couldn't even imagine it!

However, Ning Zhuo glanced at him and immediately rebuked: "Silence!"

"I let you stay here to be like a wooden post, not to speak and disturb my comprehension."

Lao De could only close his mouth, his expression becoming increasingly indignant.

Ning Zhuo looked at the flame in his hand and secretly sighed: "The Blazing Sun World Burn spell needs true sun fire to truly display its power. Without this fire seed, even though my realm is profound, I'm only imitating. Even at full power, I can't reach fifty percent of the spell's true power."

He continued comprehending.

The next diagram was quite unique.

In an ancient valley. The ground split open, molten rock surged out, clear springs flowed down from the walls, the two met at the valley bottom, steam rising together. Within the steam, fire dragons and water dragons appeared, intertwining and encircling each other, creating a magnificent sight.

"This is a spell containing both fire and water elements - Water Fire Fusion!"

"Interesting, interesting."

Ning Zhuo looked a few times, put down the enlightenment diagram, one hand producing fire, one hand producing water.

The flames and water flow merged together, achieving harmony and coexistence within their turbulent opposition!

Seeing this, Lao De couldn't help but bulge his eyes, becoming suspicious again, though this time he kept his mouth shut.

Subsequently, enlightenment diagram after enlightenment diagram was comprehended by Ning Zhuo.

Having seen enough, Lao De gradually realized the truth, his mouth slowly opening wide, eyes bulging, like an ant being stepped on.

"Ning Zhuo, this kid's comprehension ability, has actually reached such a level!!"

"Unbelievable!"

"No wonder Master, little junior sister, and big senior brother treat him so differently."

"Terrifying, such comprehension ability is terrifying!"

After realizing this, the confusion and resentment in Lao De's heart disappeared.

He immediately imagined that this was his sect, his Master, little junior sister, and big senior brother seeing potential in Ning Zhuo's future, showing goodwill at his budding stage to build good karma!

Ning Zhuo finished comprehending all these enlightenment diagrams and let Lao De take them back.

"When will you bring me the next batch of enlightenment diagrams?" Ning Zhuo asked coldly.

Lao De bowed repeatedly: "I'll gather them as quickly as possible, definitely can have them ready by tonight, please wait a bit, Young Master Ning."

"Then go quickly and return quickly." Ning Zhuo's eyes opened slightly.

He didn't give Lao De any pleasant expression, yet precisely this attitude made Lao De more respectful.

Lao De hurriedly withdrew.

Only then did Ning Zhuo put away his casual expression and smile slightly.

This time he took the opportunity to make an impression, which would definitely be effective. Not only did he remove the misgivings in the hearts of Lao De and others, but he also cleared some obstacles for the future entry of the Ning family members into Myriad Medicine Sect.

According to the alliance agreement, both the royal Zhu family and the Fire Scale Ning clan would send some people to station at Myriad Medicine Sect.

And the Myriad Medicine Sect would also send some disciples to station in the Southern Bean Kingdom's capital and Fire Scale Immortal City.
