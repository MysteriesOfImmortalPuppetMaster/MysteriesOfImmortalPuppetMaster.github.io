Chapter 517: Kill the Enemies!

For a moment, Du Tiechuan found himself in a dilemma.

It was naturally impossible to make the steel torrent change direction.

If it could change direction flexibly, then when facing the Ghost Gate earlier, he would not have forced himself to charge forward —why not simply bypass it, saving 20% of his troops?

But to continue moving forward and break through his own vanguard naturally would not cost much of the main force.

However, that did not mean that the combat power would not decline.

According to the art of war, the main body that carries and executes military strategies is usually the officers and soldiers. And the morale and spirit of the soldiers have a tremendous impact on the effectiveness of the fighting force.

Once infighting occurred, it would certainly allow the enemy to revel in misfortune and boost their morale, while the own side deeply realized that they had fallen into the enemy’s treacherous trap, being manipulated at their whim. No matter how strong the strategy was, it would appear foolish.

As a result, morale would greatly diminish, combat power would plummet, and huge vulnerabilities would arise, giving the enemy an opportunity to exploit.

It must be understood that although the Iron Flow Levels the Plains military strategy was extremely formidable, it had already penetrated deep into the enemy’s interior, and once its combat power declined seriously, it would definitely be besieged by the enemy.

Sure enough, even before it charged into the vanguard camp, the main force had already fallen into chaos, and hearts were unsettled.

The soldiers wavered, and so did the commanders.

If such infighting truly occurred, how could they explain it upon returning to the capital? There would undoubtedly be serious accusations. Those who were not strong enough might even be imprisoned and convicted!

In the court of Twin Rivers Country, the atmosphere was just like this.

In the previous ambush, Sun Gan had served as a warning.

At that time, the Golden Halberd Army commanded by Sun Gan was trapped by Qing Shan Zhong Wu Tu; although they broke out, they had already missed the opportunity to rescue.

The White Jade Camp suffered heavy casualties, and all its talents were lost.

A large number of the noble class’s offspring were lost, and the court’s opinion of Sun Gan was extremely negative.

Later, when Sun Gan intervened in the matter of Mulan, the Twin Rivers army became even more detested.

Therefore, during the subsequent probing, Du Tiechuan directly arranged for the Golden Halberd Army to be sent out as a pawn to investigate the enemy forces in Thousand Peaks Forest.

To the extent that Sun Gan was captured and the entire Golden Halberd Army was annihilated.

And now, the situation of the heavy-armored main force was undoubtedly even worse!

They had not lost the battle achievement, nor had they stood by in the face of death —they were killing each other!

Even the great general Du Tiechuan would bear extremely heavy responsibility.

Even if the monarch pardoned him, his reputation would suffer devastating damage.

One might ask —if he charged straight ahead, who would dare to fight under his command in the future?

This stain of infamy was too heavy.

If handled poorly, Du Tiechuan would be sidelined, almost completely cutting off his path to becoming a general.

At this moment, Lu Hongtu, with a somber gaze, observed the battle situation.

He wore a smile, taking his time, enjoying the marvelous feeling of overall strategic command.

The surrounding cultivators occasionally cast looks of admiration and awe at him.

This leader of the Six Caves Sect displayed the power of his wisdom at this moment.

"Du Tiechuan, even if you are at the Soul Formation stage, the decision you make at this moment will affect your entire life."

"Then, what should you choose?"

"I, Lu, am very curious."

At this moment, Du Tiechuan seemed as if he had thought a lot, yet also as if he had not thought at all.

His face was calm, his eyes fixed straight ahead, his gaze neither scattered nor wavering, and there was not the slightest hesitation.

Just as the deputy commanders anxiously sought his orders, he had already spoken—

"Advance."

The response was only one word.

The deputy commanders stared, and someone transmitted a thought with their divine sense, urgently exclaiming, "But, Great General......"

"Advance further," Du Tiechuan spoke again.

His tone was ordinary, neither impassioned nor gritted with teeth, still concise and to the point.

The deputy commanders were dumbfounded, shivering all over, their hearts filled entirely with awe.

"Stop, stop quickly, we are allies!" In the vanguard camp, the generals’ expressions changed dramatically, and they cried out in unison.

The elite soldiers stationed there also panicked.

This vanguard was the regular army of Twin Rivers Country, well-trained and of high caliber. Many were well aware of the terrifying might of the Iron Flow Levels the Plains military strategy.

"If we delay any longer, we are as good as dead."

"Hurry and reposition."

"Damn it! The formations are everywhere around us; we simply cannot get out. To break through, we must shatter the formations."

But breaking the formations obviously required a great deal of time.

At this critical moment, that would be too deadly!

Some deputy commanders hurried over to the main general.

"Sir, now there is simply no time to break the formations."

"The enemy’s scheme is too vicious; since they have designed it this way, they surely will not let us leave this place easily."

"What should we do now?"

"Let us give it our all, attacking and defending to the death; perhaps there is still a glimmer of hope!" A young general proposed angrily, his face filled with shock.

His suggestion was endorsed by many of the generals.

The middle-aged main general looked deeply at the young general and sighed heavily, "It has come to this, we can only do this."

Immediately, the main general took out the military seal, stationed himself at the center, and then dismissed the other deputy commanders, ordering them to guard the various formation points and bases, forming the strongest battle array.

The soldiers were all mobilized; in order to survive, they would surely give their all this time.

"Giving our all—perhaps there is still a sliver of hope to live!" The young general loudly rallied those around him.

However, just as the formation was about to be successfully established, it suddenly collapsed into pieces.

The formation failed, and the soldiers wailed and fell to the ground; countless people coughed up blood, and many fainted on the spot.

The scene was utter chaos.

The generals also suffered from the backlash.

Among them, a young general cried out in disbelief, "Impossible!"

He hemorrhaged from all his orifices and ran frantically to the main general’s tent, facing the main general and shouting, "Sir!"

The main general, having suffered the heaviest backlash, had already collapsed to the ground, with a pool of blood beneath him.

Subsequently, the deputy commanders, also bearing injuries, gathered in the tent.

Seeing the main general in that state, the look of shock and anger on their faces gradually subsided.

Only the young general remained indignant.

The main general looked around calmly and said, "Everyone, if we stubbornly resist, we will certainly offset the combat power of our main force.

"This is precisely the enemy’s treacherous scheme!"

"If we do this, we will fall into their trap."

"Therefore, I deliberately allowed the formation to fail, so that letting the Iron Flow Levels the Plains military strategy break through us is the best decision for the current situation!"

"Marshal Du Tiechuan... though I do not like it, as soldiers of Twin Rivers Country, we must see the situation clearly."

"The enemy uses vile schemes; if we engage in a war of attrition with the main force, the outcome of this battle is still uncertain."

"But if we act in this way, this new army will undoubtedly become a doomed force, their morale surging uncontrollably!"

"Everyone! You must be clear: it is the enemy, not our allies, who are deceiving us. Only by doing so can we achieve the most righteous revenge, which is exactly what the enemy least wishes to see."

"Ahem, ahem, ahem."

At this point, the main general lowered his head and coughed up blood continuously.

Some of the deputy commanders wore grave expressions, some were filled with raging anger, some gritted their teeth in resentment, but none of them objected.

Even the young general was the same.

"Bastards! To think that the enemy has managed to scheme against us."

"Even if I become a ghost, I will not let the person who executed this treacherous scheme off."

"Sir, you are absolutely right; although it is very disheartening, this is the only way."

"Ahem, ahem, ahem." Others also coughed up blood and laughed bitterly, "What choice do we have? Even if we want to stubbornly resist, with our injuries like this, there is no hope."

"Sir, I hate you, but I also respect you."

"But if you sacrifice yourself for the country, our clan will surely be rewarded and supported by the monarch. Forget it, let it be so!"

The deputy commanders were all convinced, or forced to admit, and voluntarily gave up struggling.

They all left, returning to their posts, comforting the soldiers, and dismantling all the defensive formations.

Only the young general stayed behind.

He walked to the main general, crouched down, and tried to help him up.

It did not succeed.

The main general’s injuries were too severe, so that even the slightest extra movement might cut off his last breath.

Thus, the young general ultimately only crouched on the ground, holding the upper body of the main general.

The young general gritted his teeth, but the tears that he could not hold back ran along his cheeks, dropping onto the main general’s blood-stained armor.

The main general’s eyes had already dimmed, entering the countdown of life.

He managed to recognize the face of the young general and said, "I am sorry that your first battle has ended like this."

The young general, who had been choking with grief, suddenly laughed upon hearing this, "Father, I have been practicing diligently for decades, and I have long yearned and fantasized about killing the enemy in my first battle."

The main general also laughed, "You little brat, joining the army, you must call me 'Sir'..."

His voice grew fainter and then abruptly ceased.

The young general’s expression instantly stiffened; tears streamed down uncontrollably, yet the corners of his mouth twisted into a brilliant smile, "Father, rest assured. Even if we all perish, I still have a son, and you still have a grandson. My Wu family will surely prosper!"

He carefully laid his father’s corpse flat on the ground.

Then, he stood up, put on his helmet, lifted the camp curtain, held his head high, and strode out of the main general’s tent.

He ordered the gates to be opened, and standing on the gate tower, fully armed, he raised his arms and shouted, "Soldiers, shout with me —Kill the Enemies!"

Under the leadership of the generals, the vanguard had all come to terms with the situation and were already solemn.

Upon hearing the young general’s shout, many felt their blood boil, raising their voices; many eyes reddened as they shouted loudly.

"Kill the Enemies!"

"Kill the Enemies!!"

"Kill the Enemies!!!"

They abandoned all defenses, donned full armor, all for the sake of dignity before death.

Their all-out, determined shouts echoed through the heavens and the earth, shaking the skies.

At this moment, it even seemed louder and more heart-shattering than the roaring thunder of the Iron Flow Levels the Plains military strategy crashing and sweeping away everything!

"Vanguard, they…"

Countless soldiers in the heavy-armored main force, with tears welling in their eyes, were emotionally stirred and choked with grief.

Du Tiechuan took a deep breath and, for the first time in a tone that was not flat, roared, "Advance!"

Rumbling...

In an instant, the Iron Flow Levels the Plains military strategy broke through the vanguard camp, grinding everything into dust.

The vanguard soldiers stood proudly in place, motionless, with incomparable courage, staring at the approach of death.

The cries of "Kill the Enemies" continued until the moment they lost their lives.

This was both an instruction and an expectation, and also a heavy responsibility that fell like a mountain upon the shoulders of the heavy-armored soldiers.

The heavy-armored main force’s morale became wildly fierce!

"Kill the Enemies!"

"Kill the Enemies!!"

"Kill the Enemies!!!"

They charged forward while shouting.

The cry of “Kill the Enemies” did not fade away with the destruction of the vanguard; rather, it was naturally passed on to the heavy-armored main force.

No one wavered any longer.

Everyone was filled with roaring anger.

Ning Zhuo, though he was a man of another nation, was deeply shocked by the scene before him.

He was strongly affected, and at this moment, he threw himself into it selflessly, becoming one of the countless shouting soldiers.

And as he devoted himself entirely, his understanding of the Iron Flow Levels the Plains military strategy’s martial tactics broke through his previous limits and reached a peak.

He not only felt the emotions of the comrades around him, but could also sense the thoughts of dozens of people by his side.

"The enemy is too insidious; find the mastermind behind the scheme and grind him to dust."

"Kill, Kill the Enemies! This time, kill double, laying the foundation for the vanguard!"

"If we don’t spill blood all over the mountains, we shall not rest!!"

United in purpose, the military strength surged explosively.

The heavy-armored main force, in a wildly ferocious manner, violently crashed toward the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain.

"Such bloody heroism... magnificent." Even Shen Qinghe, a delicate woman, felt her heart surge at the sight.

Zhu Xuanji’s eyes flashed, and he sighed, "Though Twin Rivers Country is small, its soldiers are willing to give their lives; one must not regret it lightly."

In contrast, the faces of the cultivators in the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance were all very grave.

Lu Hongtu no longer retained his previous demeanor, his face ashen, and before the vanguard’s voluntary sacrifice, he felt like nothing more than a clown.

Lord Long wore a look of deep worry, with fear evident in his eyes.

He watched the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain with a heart full of dread, crazily shouting inwardly, "No, we must absolutely not let the enemy knock down Dragon King Mountain!"

However, even as powerful as he was, he did not dare to show his full strength, knowing well that it was utterly foolish to think that one could block such a torrent of steel with one’s own power.

Lord Long was helpless, and the other cultivators were even more at a loss.

The mountain trembled violently.

Countless Ginseng Whiskers, like great dragons or giant pythons, rushed out from underground.

In the blink of an eye, they transformed the battlefield into an entirely different scene.

Brown-red Ginseng Whiskers spread over the mountains, blocking out the sky, numbering in the tens of thousands, rushing toward the steel torrent.

Boom, boom, boom!

The Ginseng Whiskers pounded into the Iron Flow, splashing countless heavy, jet-black waves.

The steel torrent continued its charge.

Every single Ginseng Whisker held out for at least twenty breaths before disintegrating.

Countless massive Ginseng Whiskers, from the front, the sides, and from behind the torrent, from all directions, struck, slapped, encircled, and divided the heavy-armored main force.

A brutal melee unfolded before the eyes of numerous cultivators.

For the first time, the Iron Flow Levels the Plains military strategy suffered a true restraint, its speed dropping drastically.

The only force capable of such an effect was the Ginseng Whiskers Dragon King, a true Soul Formation level combat power!

And in order to restrain this steel torrent, the Ginseng Whiskers suffered heavy casualties as well. But no matter how many were sacrificed, new Ginseng Whiskers continued to appear, one after another.

"Kill the Enemies!"

"Kill the Enemies!!"

"Kill the Enemies!!!"

The heavy-armored main force continued to roar in unison, disregarding the sacrifice of comrades around them due to the attacks of the Ginseng Whiskers, and fully executed the military orders, charging forward with Du Tiechuan.

Boom!

They broke through layer after layer of encirclement, crashing headlong into the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain.

Countless defensive formations, spells, and talismans on the mountain shone with dazzling brilliance.

Within less than ten breaths, the mountain trembled violently, then slowly collapsed, crashing down heavily.

Rumbling...

The mountain shuddered violently, and thick smoke billowed.

The Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain had fallen!
