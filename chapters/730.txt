Chapter 730: Soul Trading (National Day Bonus Chapter Complete!)

The bottom of the well led to a narrow stone staircase. Following the steps, the pair arrived at an underground cavern.

The cavern wasn't large, its ceiling hung with numerous stalactites. Patches of faintly glowing moss clung to them, adding to an eerie atmosphere.

A few figures stood in the shadows or sat on randomly placed stone stools, keeping a wide distance from one another and conversing in hushed tones that echoed faintly through the cavern.

The dim, flickering light cast swaying shadows against the rough stone walls, transforming the figures into ghostly silhouettes reminiscent of shadow puppets.

Yu Heye led Sun Lingtong straight to a corner of the cavern.

There, a figure clad in a loose gray robe, its hood drawn low to obscure nearly its entire face, sat cross-legged atop a flat, massive boulder. No stall or wares were displayed before him; he sat motionless, like a stone statue.

Yu Heye and Sun Lingtong stopped before him.

Yu Heye whispered, "Do you have the goods?"

The Gray-Robed Cultivator didn't nod. Instead, the space around him shimmered slightly, revealing several floating, grayish-white ceramic urns.

"The goods are all here," he said.

Yu Heye turned his head slightly to glance at Sun Lingtong beside him.

Sun Lingtong had already disguised himself, his height and build indistinguishable from an adult's.

Yu Heye immediately activated his divine sense, probing into the gray urns.

Each jar contained at least one soul.

The Qi Refining-level souls numbered in the hundreds, crammed into the smallest jars. These souls were mostly indistinct humanoid orbs of light, their colors dim like gray mist. Within their containers, they moved and collided unconsciously, emitting silent shrieks, their faces twisted with primal fear and agony.

Most of the gray urns sealed Foundation Establishment Stage souls.

Their forms were far more solid than those of the Qi Refining stage, with clearly discernible facial features and even remnants of their former attire. Their colors ranged from deathly pale to faint crimson, their expressions varying from rage to despair to numb resignation.

They struck the jar walls more frequently, their soul bodies fluctuating violently, leaving afterimages within the containers. Some seemed to retain faint traces of consciousness, their hollow eyes staring blankly out of the jars.

There was only one Golden Core Stage soul.

It was sealed within the largest gray urn, its soul body almost solidified, radiating a faint but distinct spiritual pressure. Crimson red like fire, it was clear this soul had cultivated a fire-attribute Cultivation Art in life.

The Golden Core-level soul's eyes burned with intense hatred, so palpable that even Sun Lingtong and Yu Heye felt a chill.

It remained almost motionless, secretly gathering power, clearly attempting to break free from its prison and reclaim its freedom. Unlike the Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining souls, this one displayed greater strategy and patience.

After observing for a moment, Sun Lingtong nodded in satisfaction. "Good. I'll take them all."

The Gray-Robed Cultivator was slightly taken aback.

Yu Heye, standing beside him, was equally surprised, having underestimated the scale of this transaction.

"Are you sure?" the Gray-Robed Cultivator asked.

Sun Lingtong immediately produced a Ghost Path Golden Core and handed it over. "Examine it. We'll adjust the price accordingly."

Sun Lingtong adopted an air of extravagant wealth.

The Gray-Robed Cultivator inwardly gasped, his suspicion growing. "Who is this person? I was merely selling a Golden Core cultivator's soul, yet he casually produces a Golden Core!"

He slowly reached out, accepted the Ghost Path Golden Core, and examined it thoroughly. Confirming its authenticity, he glanced up at Sun Lingtong, his demeanor now markedly changed.

He clasped his hands in a respectful bow. "May I inquire as to your esteemed name?"

Sun Lingtong smiled faintly. "You may call me Old Sun."

Sun Lingtong's disguised appearance was that of a middle-aged man. Even if someone were to see through his illusion and glimpse his true form - that of a young boy - they would likely be puzzled. After all, this image clashed sharply with the title "Old Sun."

This was precisely Sun Lingtong's characteristic style - a blend of truth and deception, leaving others unable to discern his true intentions.

The Gray-Robed Cultivator addressed him respectfully, "Old Sun."

Sun Lingtong nodded slightly, his brow furrowing as he asked directly, "These souls... are they truly all heinous criminals, deserving of death?"

The Gray-Robed Cultivator chuckled. "Old Sun, you worry too much. We wouldn't dare take in or sell souls that didn't deserve to be annihilated - those whose very existence is an insult to the heavens."

"The Myriad Manifestations Sect is a renowned righteous sect. Trying to peddle innocent souls here would be suicide!"

"For such meager profits, risking beheading? Only a fool would take that gamble!"

Sun Lingtong paused, accepting this explanation. His gaze swept over the struggling souls trapped in their containers. He suddenly asked, "Do you have... a Confucian cultivator's soul?"

"A Confucian cultivator?" The Gray-Robed Cultivator's brow seemed to twitch beneath his hood, his gaze lingering on Sun Lingtong for a moment longer. After a few silent breaths, as if recalling his inventory, he hesitated before finally uttering a single word: "Yes."

He added, "And... of exceptional quality."

"Oh?" Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up.

Confucian cultivators who turned to the Demonic Path were exceedingly rare. This was because Confucianism, as a cultivation sect, inherently emphasized moral principles and values.

Confucian cultivators emphasize benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness. Consequently, far fewer practitioners defect to the Demonic Path compared to those from the Daoist or Buddhist schools.

Sun Lingtong had come for Ning Zhuo, carrying out Ning Zhuo's wishes.

Ning Zhuo was now diligently practicing Confucian spells, his cultivation advancing rapidly. He deeply understood the importance of this cultivation in mastering a wide range of skills, ultimately refining his expertise in Mechanism Arts. Naturally, his need for Confucian cultivator souls had grown even stronger.

However, both Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo knew that Demonic Path Confucian cultivators were exceedingly rare. Their expectations were therefore quite low.

So, when the Gray-Robed Cultivator gave an affirmative response, Sun Lingtong couldn't help but feel a surge of pleasant surprise.

"What's the price?" Sun Lingtong immediately asked.

He had already resolved to acquire the soul, even if the price was significantly inflated.

Sun Lingtong was intimately familiar with Ning Zhuo's cultivation progress. The two never concealed anything from each other in this regard. He understood perfectly how crucial a Confucian cultivator soul would be for Ning Zhuo's advancement.

The grey-robed cultivator paused before speaking. “This one… is somewhat special. I am not yet certain if I can procure this person’s soul to sell to you.”

Sun Lingtong frowned. "What's the reason?"

He added, "The price is negotiable."

The Gray-Robed Cultivator didn't immediately respond about the price. Instead, he turned his gaze to Yu Heye beside him. "Actually, many fellow sect members at Myriad Manifestations Sect know about this. He has quite a reputation. His name is... Qin De."

"Qin De?!" Yu Heye clearly recognized the name, his face darkening with worry and a hint of fear. "Him! The disgrace of the Confucian school."

Sun Lingtong, however, looked utterly puzzled.

Yu Heye explained in a low voice, "This man committed a taboo. It caused a huge uproar back then, but the higher-ups have been suppressing the information ever since. Any intelligence you might find through normal channels would have been censored and won't mention him."

Sun Lingtong's curiosity piqued, and he pressed for more details about Qin De's background.

"The Great Sage's Thief Sutra?" he asked, hearing the name for the first time. When he heard the name of the Demonic Path Confucian Cultivator's cultivation art, his heart suddenly began to race. His spiritual intuition flared, sending a shiver down his spine.

Sun Lingtong suddenly realized, "This Cultivation Art seems extremely important to me?!"

Concealing his surprise, he swiftly reviewed Qin De's information in his mind.

Qin De had been a promising young Confucian cultivator, deeply versed in the Confucian classics, exceptionally knowledgeable, and brimming with talent.

Yet, perhaps precisely because he had studied so many scriptures, he had created his own Cultivation Art: the Great Sage's Theft Sutra.

This art linked sages and grand thieves, claiming that the higher a cultivator's moral character and merit, the more formidable their Theft Path Methods would become, granting them massive amplification!

The art was considered heretical, practically urging all Confucian cultivators to become thieves.

Moreover, the ideas radiating from the Great Sage's Theft Sutra convinced Duanmu Zhang and the Confucian cultivator community that Qin De had fallen into madness, his mind twisted by excessive study, driven to demonic obsession by his reading!

Thus, after all attempts at persuasion, reasoning, and even coercion failed, Duanmu Zhang and the others had no choice but to report to the Sect, defeat Qin De, and imprison him.

Qin De had been imprisoned in Cloud Prison for over thirty years.

The Gray-Robed Cultivator recounted Qin De's crimes: after creating his Cultivation Art, he committed several major thefts. The man was indeed a grave criminal.

But Sun Lingtong had a new concern: "Within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, there are many Confucian cultivators who are fiercely united. What is their view of Qin De?"

The Gray-Robed Cultivator chuckled. "Rest assured on that front. Qin De has fallen too deeply into the demonic path, beyond redemption. The Confucian cultivator community completely abandoned him over a decade ago."

"They've even repeatedly proposed destroying Qin De, to eradicate this evil ideology at its source and prevent it from contaminating the orthodox Confucian tradition."

"If you were to eliminate Qin De, I believe the Confucian cultivators would actually be grateful."

Having considered the matter thoroughly, the Gray-Robed Cultivator formally stated his price: "The market rate for a Golden Core cultivator's soul  is 300,000 mid-grade spirit stones."

"Due to the rarity and unique characteristics of Confucian cultivators, which are seldom seen on the market, I'll add an additional 100,000 mid-grade spirit stones."

"Furthermore, securing access to Cloud Prison and navigating the necessary channels will incur significant expenses. Therefore, my total fee is 400,000 mid-grade spirit stones."

Yu Heye's pupils constricted slightly.

As a Golden Core cultivator himself, he knew this sum was undeniably excessive.

If it were him, he would never have spent such a massive sum of Spirit Stones just to acquire a single Golden Core-grade Soul.

But Sun Lingtong simply smiled. "I'll take it. Here's the deposit."

He produced another Ghost Path Golden Core.

A chill ran down the Gray-Robed Cultivator's spine. Two Golden Cores in a row... This man is warning me not to cross him! I'd better handle this transaction carefully, or I'll end up like the Golden Core Master himself...

He accepted the Golden Core. "Very well, Old Sun. Please wait a while for good news from our side."

Sun Lingtong nodded. "Don't deliberately delay. If the goods aren't delivered within a month or two, how will we settle the account? We need this urgently."

The Gray-Robed Cultivator chuckled confidently. "Rest assured, Qin De has long been forgotten. He's been confined within Cloud Prison all this time. If he can't endure it and suddenly dies, that would be perfectly plausible."

"As Fellow Daoist Yu Heye knows, I've been conducting business here for years. I've always been fair and honest, with reputation as my top priority."

"I can secure the item within a week at most."

Seeing the Gray-Robed Cultivator's confidence, Sun Lingtong felt even more assured. "Good. In that case, let's sign the contract."

The Gray-Robed Cultivator nodded without hesitation. This was standard procedure. He was genuinely confident in his ability to deliver.

He believed it. He had made this kind of deal countless times, and he knew the ropes well.

Demon Subjugation Hall.

Within the formation's space.

The central stone platform.

The elderly cultivator gazed at Ning Zhuo with satisfaction. "I have one final question."

Ning Zhuo extended his hand. "Please ask, Senior. This junior will answer truthfully, from the depths of my heart."

In the Upper Dantian of his divine sea, the Buddha-Heart Demon Seal glowed faintly.

The elderly cultivator's voice suddenly deepened, as if carrying the weight of a thousand pounds, pressing down on Ning Zhuo. "Third question: In the fierce competition for the Great Dao, destiny cannot be escaped. If one day you must sacrifice your flesh and blood, burning away your Divine Soul and true Qi, to sever a cataclysmic demonic surge and save billions of lives from annihilation...

"And after this act, your name, your path, and every trace of your existence might be tainted by demonic corruption, scorned and misunderstood by the world, eternally cast into the abyss of darkness, never to return... Would you still be willing to go?"

Silence hung heavy in the air after this question, as if the very atmosphere above the stone platform had solidified.

The high-ranking cultivators of Demon Subjugation Hall stared expressionlessly at Ning Zhuo, scrutinizing every minute shift in his expression.

Ning Zhuo furrowed his brow, lowered his head, and gazed at the stone tiles beneath his feet, lost in deep contemplation.

The cultivators of Demon Subjugation Hall waited with bated breath. As time ticked by silently, their tension grew.

The three questions posed by Demon Subjugation Hall were a hidden assessment, reserved for the most outstanding participants of the first round of the Rising Cloud Trial.

Among those who answered, the vast majority passed the first two questions, but very few could answer the third.

This was because the third question was exceptionally rigorous:

To sacrifice oneself, to face death is already heroic. What then of bearing eternal infamy?

For the sake of the Righteous Path, must one truly sacrifice oneself to such an extent?

What is the purpose for which the world pursues justice?

"It's alright, just answer from the heart," the elderly cultivator said, unable to resist prompting Ning Zhuo after his prolonged silence.

He feared Ning Zhuo might lie and be detected, leading to his immediate and permanent disqualification. The Demon Subjugation Hall would then be forever closed to him, with no chance of future admission.

Unbeknownst to them, Ning Zhuo wasn't pondering the question itself, but rather his own predicament.

Ning Zhuo had a clear realization: "With the Buddha-Heart Demon Seal protecting me, they can't detect my true thoughts."

"I naturally know how to answer to pass smoothly."

"But if I do, I'll almost certainly claim the top spot."

First place...

This would be Ning Zhuo's third first-place finish in the Rising Cloud Trial.

With this, Ning Zhuo would gain priority qualification, allowing him to exchange his wooden token for a stone token ahead of most participants.

He would distinguish himself in this first round of the Rising Cloud Trial, joining the ranks of rising stars like Situ Xing!

Previously, although Ning Zhuo had also passed Che Zhuzi's Rising Cloud Trial with excellent results, Che Zhuzi refused to acknowledge his first-place finish.

Che Zhuzi intended to use the reward to attract more participants to his Rising Cloud Trial and naturally wouldn't announce it prematurely.

The Rising Cloud Trial could be held in multiple rounds, but the first-place honor could only be awarded once.

The Demon Subjugation Hall had many branches, but if Ning Zhuo were awarded first place this time, while such Rising Cloud Trials could continue to be held, the honor of first place could never be bestowed upon another.

Ning Zhuo stood at the crossroads of three diverging paths.

Should he emulate Fire Persimmon Immortal City, remaining patient and maintaining a low profile?

Or should he forgo the immediate opportunity, aiming for first place later - just not in Situ Xing's first round - and tread the middle path?

Or should he seize the present opportunity, secure his third first-place finish, bask in glory, and stride boldly forward?
