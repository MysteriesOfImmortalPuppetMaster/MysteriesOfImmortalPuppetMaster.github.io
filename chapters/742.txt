Chapter 742: Ning Zhuo: Damn it! Who ambushed me?

Rust Disaster Artisan, Mad Monk, and Liu Qingyan departed together, leaving Ban Ji alone in the empty cave abode.

Ban Ji's face was as dark as water, his heart now colder than angry.

"This Ning Zhuo is far more troublesome than I imagined!" Ban Ji deeply felt the weight of Ning Zhuo's methods.

In the past, even when facing rogue Demonic Cultivators whose individual combat strength far surpassed his own, Ban Ji had always handled them with ease.

This was because he not only had the backing of the Ban Clan but also held significant advantages from the Righteous Path, such as manipulating public opinion and using their momentum against them.

But now, facing Ning Zhuo, Ban Ji realized that his previously reliable tactics were useless.

In terms of background, Ning Zhuo seemed no less formidable than himself. In terms of reputation, Ning Zhuo's cultivation of Demonic Arts was even slightly inferior to Ban Ji's. As for personal combat strength, Ning Zhuo possessed Golden Core-level mechanical constructs, making the outcome unpredictable.

More crucial was Ning Zhuo's methods!

"Just by spreading a few rumors, he made the Demonic Cultivators I hired at great expense retreat on their own. This Righteous Path tactic is remarkably effective!" Ban Ji found himself in a difficult situation.

A very difficult situation!

Though Ban Ji cultivated Demonic Arts, his upbringing in the Ban Clan had given him a deep understanding of the Righteous Path's strategies.

Therefore, he immediately recognized the profound mastery of the Righteous Path displayed by Ning Zhuo's move. He was far too seasoned to ignore them.

How could one gauge such mastery?

Simple - by its cost!

Ning Zhuo had merely spread a few rumors, yet he had persuaded the Demonic Cultivators Ban Ji had painstakingly hired at great expense to withdraw.

His costs were remarkably low.

In this round of strategic maneuvering, Ning Zhuo's expenditures were far less than Ban Ji's, while simultaneously weakening Ban Ji's forces.

"The rumors targeting the Mad Monk, Liu Qingyan, and the Rust Disaster Artisan prove that Lady Spiderweb has fallen into Ning Zhuo's hands, yet she hasn't been coerced into confessing!"

"Ning Zhuo's strength and the talent he's displayed - rivaling my own - have indeed prompted the remaining three to withdraw voluntarily. This shows he has a firm grasp of human psychology!"

"Ah, how am I supposed to deal with him?"

Ban Ji frowned deeply, his mind troubled.

He realized that in confronting Ning Zhuo, his past advantages had become liabilities.

Under normal circumstances, Ning Zhuo, as an outsider, wouldn't have posed much of a threat. After all, even the mightiest dragon struggles against a local serpent. But the Flying Cloud Assembly had changed everything. By leveraging the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Ning Zhuo had neutralized Ban Ji's greatest advantage.

"Is this my Human Tribulation?"

"The difficulty is truly daunting!"

"Why hasn't the family responded yet?"

Ban Ji had sent out his plea for assistance long ago.

"I've reached the final stage of the Foolish Old Man's Rising Cloud Trial."

"My plans cannot be derailed now!"

"I must obtain the Stone Tablet as soon as possible. How else can I uphold the honor of my family name?!"

The three Demonic Cultivators had already withdrawn their efforts, even returning their commissions. Ban Ji found it difficult to spare the time or energy to take action against Ning Zhuo.

"The tables have turned," Ban Ji thought, his expression grave. "Now I'm the one who has to worry about whether he'll interfere with me!"

Just then, a subordinate bowed outside the cave abode, bearing a letter from the Ban Clan.

Ban Ji read it with confidence, his face lighting up with joy. "Excellent! The clan is aware of my situation and has already begun moving against Ning Zhuo."

"With the clan's support, I have nothing to fear!"

Green Stone Cave Abode.

Chen San had just finished his report, bringing Ning Zhuo good news. He had discovered that the Mad Monk, Liu Qingyan, and the Rust Disaster Artisan had all visited Ban Ji together and left together.

Afterward, the trio issued a joint statement declaring that the rumors targeting them were false. They were not acting under Ban Ji's orders and had never intended to harm Ning Zhuo.

To demonstrate their sincerity, the Mad Monk even withdrew his challenge against Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo nodded. "You've done well."

After a pause, he asked, "Have you confirmed Ban Ji's current activities?"

Chen San immediately replied, "Ban Ji is fully focused on participating in the Blind Foolish Old Man's Rising Cloud Trial. Here's the relevant intelligence."

"Young Master, if you wish to intercept Ban Ji, I believe approaching the Blind Foolish Old Man directly would be most effective."

"Given your current reputation, Young Master, even joining the Rising Cloud Trial midway would be an honor for the Blind Foolish Old Man."

Ning Zhuo immersed his divine sense into the Jade Slip, quickly reviewing the information. "The Blind Foolish Old Man is hosting the Rising Cloud Trial solely to propagate the teachings of a certain mountain god. Those who pass the trial will receive the Blind Foolish Divine Art."

"This isn't a Mechanism inheritance. Why is Ban Ji participating?"

Chen San: "This subordinate will investigate immediately!"

Ning Zhuo raised a hand slightly. "You and Old Chef should take some gifts and pay a visit to the Blind Foolish Old Man. Express my intention to participate."

Chen San immediately accepted the order. "Yes!"

Ban Clan Ancestral Shrine.

A circle of Supreme Elders gathered, one of them retrieving a treasure box.

As the heavy lid of the box was opened, a precious material carefully preserved for years was revealed.

The material consisted of black-gray crystals, semi-transparent and varying in size. The largest were comparable to an adult's fingernail, while the smallest were as minute as grains of sand.

Upon closer inspection, one would notice a faint, eerie glow emanating from the crystals. The light was extremely faint, tinged with purple within the gray, and evoked a chilling, unsettling sensation.

Several Supreme Elders glanced at the crystals, but after only a few breaths, their vision blurred and their minds grew disoriented. They quickly averted their gazes.

They were all Nascent Soul-level cultivators, and the Supreme Grand Elder present was even a Soul Formation-level avatar. Yet all felt a deep sense of dread toward the black-gray crystalline substance.

This was no ordinary treasure; it was a fragment of the Yuan Star itself.

Among the countless stars in the heavens, there were auspicious stars and the Yuan Star. The treasure box contained Star Shards from the Yuan Star.

Its purpose was clear: to corrupt Luck and sever Qi Luck. Without proper containment, it would bring misfortune to all living beings in its vicinity.

"Begin," the Supreme Grand Elder's avatar declared.

A Supreme Elder in the late Nascent Soul stage held his breath and performed a series of rapid hand seals, his fingers dancing like butterflies. He channeled an invisible force that swirled around the Star Shards in the box.

The Star Shards levitated into the air, grinding into fine powder. Under the Supreme Elder's spiritual energy, the powder coalesced into a gray-purple stream of light.

The luminous stream pierced through one of the copper rings of the Clan's Mechanism Chain, transforming into a gray-purple energy that surged wildly along the chain's length.

The chain's original luster was swiftly corrupted, turning as dull as iron rusted for millennia.

The Mechanism Chain trembled violently, emitting a grating, grinding sound as the copper rings expanded and contracted, as if struggling to digest a deadly poison.

Increasingly decaying wisps of gray silk emerged from the gaps between the chain links. These wisps drifted onto the jade tiles, causing them to crumble into dust. When they landed on the pillars, the wood immediately took on the color of rot, and patches of mold bloomed across the surface.

"Ning Zhuo! Becoming the Human Tribulation destined to fulfill my clan's Royal Mandate is your greatest misfortune!"

"First, I'll sever your Qi Luck. Then you'll understand what it means to be possessed by the Yuan Star!"

The Supreme Elder chanted softly, his face filled with unwavering determination.

The Clan's Mechanism Chain spun faster and faster, emitting a wisp of gray-purple Qi that spiraled upward. The upper half of the Qi merged into the Void, vanishing without a trace.

Meanwhile, in the Green Stone Cave Abode...

Ning Zhuo stood within the Martial Training Array, attempting to master the Forest-Piercing Azure Python Mirror.

This mechanical mount, crafted primarily from millennium-old Prostrate Azure Python Bamboo, consisted of ninety-nine interlocking bamboo segments. Flood Dragon Tendons were embedded between the joints, allowing the structure to extend and contract like a living python or giant cicada.

The python's head was cast in the shape of a jade Bixi, its eyes inlaid with Nether Pool Soul Crystals that emitted a three-foot azure glow at night, illuminating the miasmic fog for ten miles.

The bamboo-green body was engraved with Wind-Thunder Vortex Winnows. As the vehicle moved, these winnow patterns floated into the air, grinding through any vines that blocked its path. Beneath the belly were seventy-two Profound Void Wheels, neither metal nor jade, but refined from Spirit Bamboo root nodules. These wheels moved silently across the ground, transforming into lotus-like formations on steep slopes, allowing the vehicle to climb cliffs as easily as traversing flat ground.

A sudden opening appeared seven inches from the Azure Python's head, revealing a Coiling Dragon Bamboo chair crafted from millennia-old Coiling Dragon Bamboo. The chair's surface was engraved with a Dust-Repelling Wind-Returning Formation, causing fallen leaves to be swept away by swirling Qi currents three inches before touching the chair.

The python's tail incorporated a bamboo whistle structure. As it moved at high speed, the whistle drew in the rushing wind, converting it into sonic waves that propelled the python forward, further increasing its speed.

Ning Zhuo sat upright in the bamboo chair, channeling his spiritual energy and divine sense through the chair into the entire Forest-Piercing Azure Python Chariot. The python's body remained still, yet its movements responded instantly to his will, as if it were an extension of his own arm.

As the speed increased, the Dust-Repelling Wind-Returning Formation behind the chair neutralized the oncoming gale, allowing Ning Zhuo to breathe normally.

Despite the chariot's rapid maneuvers and sharp turns, Ning Zhuo's body remained remarkably stable in the bamboo chair, swaying only slightly.

The more Ning Zhuo controlled the chariot, the greater his delight grew.

Having been fascinated by mechanical arts since childhood, piloting the Forest-Piercing Azure Python Chariot felt like receiving a magnificent new toy. He couldn't put it down, reveling in the sheer joy of playing with it.

Suddenly, Ning Zhuo's expression shifted. A primal instinct surged through him as he sensed an immense, invisible danger bearing down upon him.

He instinctively commanded the Forest-Piercing Azure Python Chariot to flee, but even as he moved, he felt the attack strike him squarely.

"What's happening?!"

As Ning Zhuo looked around in shock, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his Upper Dantian Divine Sea suddenly erupted, unleashing a vast and profound Qi that swept across his surroundings, instantly enveloping his entire being.

Ban Clan Ancestral Shrine.

Pfft! The Supreme Elder, who had been maintaining the spell with all his might, was struck as if by a heavy hammer, spitting out blood on the spot.

Moments later, the Supreme Elders manipulating the Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain shuddered violently. In the blink of an eye, their hair turned snow-white, and vertical fissures split open between their brows, blood gushing forth.

"What's going on?!" The crowd paled in terror.

Crack!

Even more horrifying, a massive copper ring on the Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain suddenly snapped.

Aaaah!

A chain reaction of destruction followed. Copper rings, chains, rails, and other components shattered, sending fragments flying like deadly arrows in all directions.

"Damn it!" The Supreme Elder's avatar's eyes burned with fury. "Stop the spell immediately!"

But the Supreme Elders controlling the Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain were severely wounded, their minds reeling and spirits shaken, unable to salvage the crumbling situation.

In this critical moment, the Supreme Grand Elder's avatar, disregarding his own safety, leaped forward and thrust his arms into the heart of the collapsing mechanism.

The Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain's destruction was forcibly halted!

The Supreme Grand Elder's avatar grew dim and ethereal, his form flickering like smoke, utterly drained.

The price had been catastrophic!

The remaining Supreme Elders finally regained their composure and swiftly manipulated the Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain, altering its form to cease targeting Ning Zhuo, thus stabilizing the situation.

"How could this happen?!"

"We merely probed Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck, yet we suffered such a severe backlash? Unbelievable! We are at least Nascent Soul-level cultivators, and the Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain is our Subordinate Clan's most treasured artifact!"

The Supreme Elders were shocked and bewildered.

They had probed others' Qi Luck countless times before, but they had never encountered such a catastrophic outcome.

The Supreme Grand Elder's avatar rasped, "It's a Nation-Suppressing Treasure!"

"The force backing Ning Zhuo also possesses a Nation-Suppressing Treasure."

A deathly silence descended upon the Ancestral Shrine.

Any faction wielding a Nation-Suppressing Treasure was undoubtedly extraordinary. In this confrontation, the Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain had clearly been utterly defeated by the opposing Nation-Suppressing Treasure.

What power lay behind Ning Zhuo?

The cultivators' faces turned ashen as turmoil raged within their hearts, each struggling to process and accept this brutal reality.

The Supreme Grand Elder finally broke the silence with a bitter smile. "I forcibly severed the Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain's operation, enduring a massive backlash. I must immediately return to my True Form, or this avatar will perish."

"Handle the rest yourselves. Remember to maintain perfect balance!"

With those words, his avatar dissolved into a wisp of smoke and dispersed into the air.

The Supreme Elders exchanged uneasy glances.

They all understood the Supreme Grand Elder's intentions and approved of his decision.

The severely damaged Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain and the heavily wounded Soul Formation-level avatar had deeply shaken them.

"This Ning Zhuo is no ordinary figure. We must not underestimate him."

"Otherwise, he wouldn't have become Ban Ji's Human Tribulation. This is a target of the Royal Mandate - how could it be simple?"

"We can't diminish his Qi Luck, yet we must help Ban Ji overcome his Human Tribulation. What should we do?"

"It wasn't a complete failure. We disrupted his Qi Luck midway through the Method. It was a mutually destructive outcome. He must be suffering as well!"

Green Stone Cave Abode.

Ning Zhuo sat blankly on a bamboo chair, his expression doubtful.

He had never witnessed such a massive and violent reaction from his Buddha Heart Demon Seal.

Yet this overwhelming aura had appeared and vanished swiftly, lasting no more than three breaths.

Ning Zhuo waited for a long time, but the Buddha Heart Demon Seal remained still, floating quietly within the Upper Dantian Divine Sea, restored to its original state.

"What exactly attacked me?"

Ning Zhuo patted his body, probing his mind and body with his divine sense repeatedly, but found nothing amiss.

He was completely unharmed.

Examining the Buddha Heart Demon Seal closely, he found no damage whatsoever - not even a scratch.

"This must be some kind of counter-attack technique. An enemy far away has secretly cursed me!" Ning Zhuo's expression turned grim.

"The passive activation of my Buddha Heart Demon Seal likely prevented my opponent from gaining any advantage either."

"Are they coming back?" Protected by his powerful treasure, Ning Zhuo felt secure enough to harbor a flicker of anticipation.

After all, the more he used this spell, the more likely he was to uncover some clue.

He waited for a while, but nothing unusual happened.

Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly, his vigilance heightened. This isn't surprising. My high-profile actions and recent fame have undoubtedly stirred envy and attracted many hidden enemies.

Ah, how despicable! I walk the Righteous Path and am ill-suited for such underhanded schemes. I don't even know who my enemies are.

Ultimately, my external deterrent power remains insufficient!

Qing Huangzi's test had solidified Ning Zhuo's reputation, but it hadn't intimidated others into submission.

"Ban Ji!" A fierce glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes. This man is perfect for establishing my authority! Dealing with him decisively will send a powerful message to everyone else.
