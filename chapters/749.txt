Chapter 749: Ning Zhuo: I've Come to Uphold Justice

The conversation between the Ban Clan's Supreme Elders and Escaped One changed Ban Ji and the entire Ban Clan.

After three days and three nights of intense debate, the Supreme Elders made a momentous decision: to fully support Ban Ji's claim to kingship!

They secretly activated the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain, forging an unbreakable bond between the Ban Clan and Ban Ji, ensuring their fates were intertwined: shared glory or mutual ruin.

This became the clan's greatest secret!

They continuously expended Escaped One's precious materials to divine Ban Ji's path forward.

Ban Ji, guided by these calculated paths, grew rapidly. Despite practicing the Demonic Path and occasionally acting recklessly, he maintained a strong relationship with the clan.

The Ban Clan and Ban Ji had been preparing for this year's Flying Cloud Assembly for over a decade.

They prepared for whatever the divinations revealed.

Of course, due to the long time intervals, earlier divinations sometimes contradicted later ones.

Divination was merely a form of calculation and deduction; the actual course of events in the real world could be altered by countless unforeseen factors.

Several years ago, the Supreme Elders of the Ban Clan used the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain to calculate the starting point of Ban Ji's Royal Mandate: the main gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. The timing was set for the current Flying Cloud Assembly.

Subsequent divinations consistently confirmed this result.

Qing Huangzi's legacy - the Empty Valley Syllable Azure Mechanism Cylinder - Che Zhuzi's Void Spider Silk, and the Blind Foolish Old Man's Blind Fool Divine Art were all destined to become Ban Ji's cultivation resources, the fuel for the Royal Mandate's full manifestation.

Beyond the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, there were also various tasks to be completed upon officially arriving at the Flying Cloud Assembly.

The Ban Clan had meticulously arranged the order in which Ban Ji should acquire these opportunities. The frequent divinations had continuously drained the clan's Qi Luck, secretly consuming vast resources and exacting an immense price.

Though the Ban Clan maintained a facade of prosperity, their relentless investment in Ban Ji had nearly emptied the clan's treasury.

Fortunately, this was the final phase of investment. Once the Royal Mandate fully manifested, its power would become apparent. At that point, fortune would rain down from the heavens, prosperity would flow like a river, and even minor setbacks would transform into blessings in disguise.

The Ban Clan's decades-long, no-expense-spared investment was finally about to bear fruit.

-----
Mechanism Cave-Abode.

Ban Ji, drenched in sweat, gritted his teeth as he severed the mechanical anomaly at the end of his right leg.

A spray of blood erupted, but the wound was instantly sealed with spiritual energy, halting the bleeding almost immediately.

Ban Ji activated his healing techniques.

His movements were so practiced they had become instinctive.

After all, he had endured this situation far too many times.

Soon, his right leg regenerated, the newly grown skin noticeably paler and more tender than the surrounding areas.

Ban Ji flexed his calf, ankle, and toes, then weakly stood up.

He approached the carriage-sized cluster of mechanisms before him and carefully retrieved a scroll, channeling spiritual energy into it.

Countless runes erupted from the scroll, swirling around him to form a three-dimensional spiritual formation that enveloped the mechanical construct.

Ban Ji chanted softly, intensifying the flow of spiritual energy. The runes blazed with light as the formation activated at full power, its radiance blindingly intense before vanishing abruptly.

Along with the formation, Ban Ji's right calf disappeared.

The scroll grew heavy, several times heavier than before. Countless runes formed concentric circles, at the center of which lay a carriage-like diagram of a mechanism. Beneath the mechanism extended a massive iron hand. The entire construct radiated wisps of purple energy.

This purple energy had already begun to permeate and corrode the surrounding runes.

The runes remained temporarily stable, but Ban Ji knew they could only withstand the onslaught for a few months at most before collapsing. At that point, he would need to reactivate the formation to reseal the Myriad Transformations Demon Abomination.

Of course, this was no longer his concern, but rather the Ban Clan's responsibility.

For over a decade, Ban Ji had employed various methods to suppress his Immortal Talent, the Myriad Transformations Demon Abomination, allowing it to activate and unleash its power only at intervals.

Each time the Demon Abomination manifested, Ban Ji's body would undergo a grotesque transformation, coalescing into a bizarre and terrifying amalgamation of mechanisms.

These mechanical constructs, infused with the principles of Mechanism Art, the Demonic Sect, and the Strange Path, appeared sinister and harmful, yet their actual value was immeasurable.

They were essentially living scriptures, recording the divine truths of these three domains - truths bestowed by heaven itself!

It was thanks to the Myriad Transformations Demon Abomination Immortal Talent that Ban Ji's physical body could bear these divinely bestowed principles.

Over the past decade, the number of these flesh-and-blood scriptures had swelled to nearly ten thousand volumes.

Yet Ban Ji had failed to successfully comprehend even a single one.

"If it were just Mechanism Art or Demonic Sect doctrines, any ordinary person could read and learn them. But the Strange Path is mixed in... Alas!"

Ban Ji sighed deeply, rolled up the sealed scroll, and temporarily tucked it into his robes.

His eyes gleamed with sharp intelligence as he mused, "This time, enduring the Immortal Talent's manifestation was far easier than before."

"All thanks to the Blind Fool Divine Art."

"Heh. The world believes I mastered the Blind Fool Divine Art to use against enemies. But its true purpose was always for myself!"

In the past, Ban Ji had to sever at least both legs, and sometimes even bisect his lower body, to withstand the torrent of divinely bestowed principles.

This time, however, he only needed to amputate his right leg - and not even the entire limb.

The Blind Fool Divine Art's assistance was undeniably immense and evident to all!

"My father nearly bankrupted our family and sacrificed his dignity to activate the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain multiple times, all to calculate my path forward."

"The Blind Fool Divine Art truly works wonders for me!"

"So, the Empty Valley Syllable Azure Mechanism Cylinder and the Void Spider Silk..."

As these thoughts crossed his mind, Ban Ji's expression darkened.

Clenching his teeth, a chilling murderous intent surged from the depths of his heart. "Ning Zhuo, I'll temporarily entrust these two opportunities to you."

"Hmph, when the time is right, I'll personally come to claim them."

"I will personally overcome my Human Tribulation!"

"And when that day comes, taking your life will be a mere afterthought."

"Until then, the inheritance of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor remains my top priority. If I can obtain this armor, it might positively influence - or even control - the mechanical constructs that manifest from my flesh and blood when my Immortal Talent activates!"

Time was limited, and this inheritance was clearly more crucial.

Ban Ji had no choice but to set Ning Zhuo aside for now.

The next day, Ban Ji arrived at Armament Peak before dawn.

The mountain peak pierced through the sea of clouds, resembling a colossal bronze blade pointing diagonally toward the heavens.

Its towering form was composed of countless layers of dark azure rock, between which veins of crimson-gold ore seeped through the cracks, resembling blood grooves on a quenched weapon.

The main mountain range's ridge was as sharp as a knife's edge, with hundred-forged rock slabs branching out on either side. Though still dark green, the slabs possessed a grayish-white sheen.

Veins of crimson gold ore were most visible within the mountain's interior. From a distance, they resembled streams of molten gold cascading down from the peaks, converging in the mountain's belly to form golden rivers and lakes.

The inheritance site for the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor wasn't on the mountain's summit, but within a cave deep inside the mountain - the Profound Armor Cave!

"It's Ban Ji!"

"Just as I suspected."

"Damn, why did we have to run into him here?"

"Stay calm. The Rising Cloud Minor Trial for the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor happens every year. There's competition, but it's rarely intense."

"True. Fatalities are rare inside the Profound Armor Cave. Besides, as long as you reach the third stage, every cultivator gets a Ninefold Armor Plate."

Many cultivators recognized Ban Ji.

Ban Ji had also obtained a stone tablet, though his performance hadn't been as dazzling as Ning Zhuo's or Situ Xing's initial surge. Still, he had distinguished himself.

More importantly, recent rumors circulating within the Myriad Manifestations Sect's mountain gate had linked Ban Ji and Ning Zhuo.

Leaning against the cave wall, Ban Ji listened to the murmurs about him, his eyes narrowing to slits that revealed amber-like glints of cold light.

As time passed, more and more cultivators gathered at the entrance to the Profound Armor Cave.

The cultivators sized each other up, exchanging polite greetings while silently calculating their rivals' strengths and their own positions in the competition.

Few cultivators could truly capture Ban Ji's attention.

"Ao Pan. A Golden Core Body Cultivator specializing in whip techniques. His tendons and meridians stretch like a dragon's, allowing him to extend his whip beyond his body and crush magic treasures."

"Zhang Wangxing. A Foundation Establishment Body Cultivator with low-grade Innate Talent. He can drastically reshape his entire body - flesh, bones, and all - into unpredictable forms."

"Tie Zheng. A Golden Core-level Martial Cultivator skilled in swordsmanship. He commands twelve Golden Core-level blade beasts."

"Lu Zeng. A Golden Core-level Mechanism Cultivator adept at crafting intricate mechanical components. He can adapt his creations to an immense variety of mechanical constructs."

The Rising Cloud Minor Trial for the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor naturally involved multiple rounds. Surveying the field, Ban Ji identified only four cultivators who warranted his caution.

Because the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's True Form was a Spirit Treasure, and each individual armor plate was a magic treasure of considerable utility, it had attracted the participation of Golden Core cultivators.

In some Rising Cloud Minor Trials, the organizers strictly limited the cultivation levels of participants. For example, Qing Huangzi's trial only accepted Foundation Establishment cultivators.

The two trials organized by the Confucian cultivators secretly favored Ning Zhuo by restricting the cultivation range to the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages.

The Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's trial, however, allowed cultivators from the Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, and Golden Core stages to participate.

In reality, few Qi Refining Stage cultivators participated in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial. The grand prize, the Ninefold Armor Plates, were magic treasures, far too advanced and impractical for Qi Refining cultivators.

With so many Rising Cloud Minor Trials available, Qi Refining cultivators naturally chose those better suited to their level, offering greater assistance and higher chances of success. There was no need to force their way into the Profound Armor Cave.

It wasn't unheard of for Qi Refining cultivators to attempt the trial, but such efforts usually ended in ridicule, becoming a source of amusement for others.

Ban Ji silently assessed his true opponents. "Only four pose a genuine threat. Given the large number of participants, the odds of encountering them are slim."

"Even if we do clash, we should focus on eliminating the others first. That's the wisest course of action."

Ban Ji's cultivation base was at the peak of Foundation Establishment, yet his combat prowess rivaled that of a Golden Core cultivator. He felt no fear when facing Golden Core cultivators.

While he observed others, they observed him in turn. Ban Ji leaned against the mountain wall, adopting an aloof posture, his eyes narrowed as he scrutinized the crowd, radiating an aura of formidable presence.

His Ban Clan lineage and his past victories against Golden Core cultivators had earned him considerable respect.

The assembled experts were also evaluating each other, strategizing how to avoid certain opponents in the upcoming Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

Suddenly, Ban Ji's eyes widened. He shifted his stance, turning to face the mountain wall, his gaze piercing as he clenched his jaw, staring intently into the Void.

Seeing Ban Ji's sudden alarm, the others realized something was amiss and turned to follow his gaze.

They saw a white-robed youth riding a mechanical python crafted from green bamboo, gliding toward them.

The youth's head was slightly large - it was Ning Zhuo.

The mechanism he rode was none other than the Forest-Piercing Azure Python Chariot, inherited from the Empty Valley Syllable Azure Mechanism Cylinder.

"Ning Zhuo! What's he doing here?!"

"Did he guess I'd be here? Or has my information been leaked?!"

Ban Ji's expression twisted in an instant, revealing a surge of anger.

"The craftsmanship and style of that mechanical python... it must be Qing Huangzi's legacy!"

"Damn it! That should have been mine!!"

At this thought, a torrent of hatred surged in Ban Ji's eyes.

The cultivators stirred with excitement.

"It's Ning Zhuo!"

"Though he's not from our nation, his talent is extraordinary, his future boundless. He's the foremost genius of this generation!"

"Has Ning Zhuo come for the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor, or is he here specifically to target Ban Ji?"

"Hahaha! Whatever the reason, this is going to be a good show!"

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Ban Ji couldn't leave - what would become of the Ban Clan's reputation?

Ban Ji carried the secret of the Royal Mandate, a truth even he was unaware of. He had witnessed firsthand the immense sacrifices the Ban Clan had made for him, and he held their efforts close to his heart.

Therefore, he would always consider the Ban Clan's interests.

Ning Zhuo landed gracefully on the ground, cupping his hands in a respectful greeting to the surrounding cultivators, a warm smile on his face as he introduced himself.

Most cultivators returned his smile or nodded in acknowledgment, eager to show goodwill. No one wanted to offend a promising young genius with a bright future. According to past precedent, nearly all the first wave of cultivators to emerge were invariably recruited by the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

After exchanging greetings, Ning Zhuo strode directly toward Ban Ji.

The crowd parted instinctively, clearing a path for him.

Expressionless, Ning Zhuo stood before Ban Ji. "Fellow Daoist Ban Ji, we meet again."

Ban Ji gritted his teeth, his killing intent palpable. He yearned to strike Ning Zhuo down on the spot, to reduce the white-robed youth to ashes.

But this was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main gate, where strict rules forbade violence. He couldn't act, nor did he dare to.

Ban Ji snarled, "Ning Zhuo, this isn't Green Bamboo Peak anymore. How dare you obstruct me again? Who gave you the audacity? What makes you think you can defeat me? Hah! You'll reap the bitter fruits of your arrogance!"

Ning Zhuo's expression turned solemn. "Reap the bitter fruits? I walk a righteous path, sit upright, and live with integrity. What evil have I committed to warrant such a fate?"

Frowning deeply, Ning Zhuo declared with righteous indignation, "It is you who will meet your end through your own wickedness! You plotted against me, driven by greed for my Golden Core Puppet. Know this: I'm here not just for myself, but for the countless innocent souls you've persecuted and betrayed!"

"So, the Ban Clan wants to offer lavish gifts to smooth things over?"

"Hmph! Do you think Ning Zhuo is the kind to abandon righteousness for profit? You underestimate me!"

"I've come here to confront you, to stop you, to show you what it means to reap the bitter fruits of your actions, to prove that evil can never triumph over righteousness, and that justice will always prevail!"
