Chapter 221: Gu Cultivator Li Jiǔqu

The first duel of the generals was unfolding.

At the edge of the battlefield.

Both Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were riding the mechanical dragon, quietly observing the battle in the dragon’s head cabin.

The Blood Shadow Cave Master had once given them trouble, and now was dueling with Lei Qingyang, a righteous Nascent Soul cultivator of Two Note Nation.

“If Lei Qingyang did not have the means to see through it, the Blood Shadow Cave Master, by relying on his genuine and false duplicates, would have been able to firmly seize the initiative,” Sun Lingtong commented.

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. He also agreed with this assessment.

“Learned!”

“It appears that next, I must also master a method for seeing through disguises.”

“Previously, Lin Bufan, the sect leader, suffered because the enemy’s illusion techniques were extremely formidable.”

Sun Lingtong mumbled, “Little Zhuo, you have far too much to learn.”

Ning Zhuo, rarely picking up on the implication, nodded deeply with a serious expression: “Yes, I am still too young; there is indeed much to learn!”

Sun Lingtong opened his mouth: “Don’t forget, you have me watching over you. With these spirit eyes of mine, I can see through many false appearances.”

Ning Zhuo laughed: “Having the boss here is naturally good. But I still must learn some things, to be prepared for any eventuality.

“However, considering your innate talent, boss, perhaps I should postpone this learning plan.”

“Learning first how to disguise oneself and to construct duplicates is also acceptable.”

Sun Lingtong: ……

While the two were conversing, the Blood Shadow Cave Master and Lei Qingyang engaged in several more rounds of dueling, evenly matched.

Lei Qingyang, the Thunder Celestial Master, suddenly roared a shout; the Tian Gang Lei Ji Sword pierced through the all-pervading blood mist, wild thunder qi surged in all directions, blasting out the true form of the Blood Shadow Cave Master.

This scene caused all the cultivators of both armies to tremble in unison.

Within the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance, most people's expressions changed in unison. In contrast, in the main camp of the Two Note Nation, there was an eruption of cheers.

In the previous rounds of the duel, Lei Qingyang was gradually being pressed into a disadvantage because it was difficult to discern true from false.

Now, he had found a method to glimpse the position of the true form, which meant that the situation of the battle would accordingly change.

The true form of the Blood Shadow Cave Master was struck, and he was seriously injured.

The blood light around his body surged violently, turning into a hundred-zhang sea of blood.

Nine huge blood pythons soared out of the sea of blood, stirring up an all-pervading tide of blood; their snake mouths gaped open, spitting out countless blood-demon yin thunders.

Everyone in both armies fell silent and held their breath, all aware that this was now the most critical moment of the contest!

Lei Qingyang, seeing that his opponent’s offensive had become unprecedentedly fierce, decisively bit through his own tongue.

A mouthful of refined blood spurted onto the Tian Gang Lei Ji Sword, on whose blade ancient thunder patterns emerged.

The Tian Gang Lei Ji Sword flew up into the sky.

Lei Qingyang then sent his thirty-six anti-evil thunder jades swirling around the Tian Gang Lei Ji Sword, using the sword as the formation’s core, and quickly formed a formation.

Finally, he held the Lei Ze Gourd in one hand, and once again unleashed a large amount of thunder clouds.

The thunder clouds enveloped all thirty-six anti-evil thunder jades and the Tian Gang Lei Ji Sword, rapidly expanding, and soon pushed aside the sea of blood, occupying half of the battlefield.

Divine Technique - Nine Heavens Thunder Enlightened Body.

“Nine Heavens Thunder Prison, open!”

Lei Qingyang bellowed a sharp shout, using his divine technique to summon the thunder of the nine heavens. Countless bolts of lightning shot out from his body in all directions, from below to above, striking into the thunder clouds.

The thunder clouds churned incessantly, emitting rolling thunder sounds, and quickly transformed into a temporary thunder pool.

The Blood Shadow Cave Master’s blood pythons and blood-demon yin thunders were all obliterated in the explosion of the thunder pool, and the sea of blood was evaporated, leaving only a core area of three zhang.

Lei Qingyang then shouted once more, summoning thousands of bolts of lightning, and in one burst of energy, completely annihilated the stubborn sea of blood at its core.

When the thunder light dissipated, at the core of the sea of blood there remained only a blood pearl, floating in midair.

Lei Qingyang squinted his eyes, about to once again employ a method to obliterate the blood pearl.

In the next moment, the blood pearl suddenly erupted, transforming into a blood line, and charged straight towards him.

The blood pearl was too fast; countless cultivators watching the battle showed expressions of shock, and for a moment none of them could clearly see it.

In the critical moment, Lei Qingyang’s body suddenly burst with electric light, carrying him as he shifted to the right.

The blood line grazed his neck, carving a long wound on it, then halted in the distant high sky, transforming into the true form of the Blood Shadow Cave Master.

The Blood Shadow Cave Master was panting heavily, exhausted beyond measure.

The wound on Lei Qingyang’s neck had already stopped bleeding; he slowly turned, his majestic body cloaked in a fluttering robe, his voice as steady as a mountain: “You are defeated.”

The battlefield fell into silence.

Even Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo felt that Lei Qingyang, who had mastered the temporary thunder pool, indeed had a tremendous advantage and had already secured victory.

Just now, although the Blood Shadow Cave Master’s desperate counterattack was shocking, its results were minimal, clearly showing that the Blood Shadow Cave Master was already fatigued.

However, the Blood Shadow Cave Master burst into hearty laughter: “No, I have won.”

Barely had he finished speaking when toxic blood oozed from the corner of Lei Qingyang’s mouth. The toxic blood glowed blue and had an extraordinarily foul, fishy stench.

Lei Qingyang hurriedly employed a method to suppress the toxin.

But the toxins within his body erupted at that moment, like a mountain-calling tsunami, difficult to restrain.

Lei Qingyang’s spiritual energy plummeted all the way, directly falling to the bottom of a valley.

The thunder patterns on his palm disintegrated because of this, and the temporary thunder pool could no longer be supported, disintegrating in an instant into thirty-six anti-evil thunder jades and one Tian Gang Lei Ji Sword. As for the thunder clouds that filled the sky, they were entirely expended without a trace.

Lei Qingyang gritted his teeth, crushed the jade pendant at his waist, and immediately took off in a streak of lightning.

The lightning enveloped him, slicing through the air, and quickly returned to the main camp of the Two Note Nation.

Zhao Xi and the others hurriedly came to greet him: “Quick, treat Thunder Celestial Master’s injuries!”

Lei Qingyang waved his hand in refusal: “The first duel of the generals, a matter of great importance, I have lost, and I have no face to further burden you all by consuming your spiritual energy to treat my injuries.”

“I can handle it!”

“From now on, I can only rely on all of you.”

Lei Qingyang staggered as he withdrew from the city wall, going off into seclusion to treat his injuries, without further mention.

Over there, the Blood Shadow Cave Master had also suffered immense losses, lacking the strength to fight further, and returned to formation in a weakened state, triggering a round of cheers.

The cheers reached the main camp of the Two Note Nation, and were exceedingly piercing.

Zhao Xi furrowed his brows deeply; as a leader, he had to confront the current predicament and resolve the immediate problems.

“Having lost the first duel of the generals, with the situation looking grim, the second one must absolutely not be lost!”

Zhao Xi looked around at the various Nascent Soul cultivators by his side; while they were hesitating, another cultivator flew out from within the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance.

This person’s appearance was rather terrifying.

His figure was hunched like an old ape, his skin a corpse-blue color, with a surface covered in honeycomb-like pores, and countless black maggots darted in and out of the pores, devouring rotting flesh and then spitting out toxic silk to repair his body.

He had no hair on his head; instead, there was a layer of semi-transparent flesh membrane, beneath which one could see three leeches swimming in the grayish-white brain matter, a sight that was nauseating.

His nasal bridge was rotten and perforated; within his eye sockets were not normal human eyeballs, but instead two poisonous beehives, with hexagonal pores flickering with a ghostly green phosphorescence.

“I am the Gu Cultivator Li Jiǔqu, hehehe, who will come to meet death?”

As he spoke, the corners of his mouth tore up to his ears, revealing a mouth full of serrated black teeth, and a vast patch of ghastly green moss parasitized on his tongue, as if there were some mysterious purpose.

“Li Jiǔqu?!”

“It really was him!”

“I didn’t expect that he was truly hiding in Thousand Peaks Forest.”

“Terrible! This man is a Gu Cultivator, and his main cultivation technique is ‘Ten Thousand Maggots Eroding Immortal Technique.’

To cultivate this method, one must hollow out one’s own bones, fill them with rotting immortal maggot larvae, and use one’s own refined blood to nurture them to grow. The bone-eroding toxin secreted by the maggots can dissolve magical treasures, and can also gnaw on an enemy’s flesh and blood to nourish the host in return.”

On the side of the Two Note Nation, the cultivators discussed incessantly, each with a rather grave expression.

In terms of reputation alone, Li Jiǔqu was notoriously infamous, a wanted criminal in several cultivator nations, far more so than the Blood Shadow Cave Master.

Because the environment in the Thousand Peaks Forest was lax, Li Jiǔqu had taken refuge here.

Now, in the second great battle, he appeared for the first time, catching the Two Note Nation off guard, and also causing quite a bit of astonishment throughout the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance.

It was all because before Li Jiǔqu went into battle, he had always hidden his identity, and they were not aware of him.

Lu Hongtu had also been kept in the dark; at this moment, upon seeing Li Jiǔqu, he instinctively cast a glance towards Lord Long.

Lord Long sat expressionlessly in his main seat.

The second great battle was of great importance, especially as it pertained to the Dragon King Wooden Mountain; the entire Dragon King Temple was extremely attentive. Lord Long had mainly invited the virtuous young master Shengxu, while Li Jiǔqu was heavily hired by other temple attendants of the Dragon King Temple.

“Hehehe, are you deaf or dumb? Can’t you understand what I say?”

Li Jiǔqu once again challenged.

There was no doubt that Li Jiǔqu was a formidable enemy!

Many of the Nascent Soul cultivators from the Two Note Nation looked at each other in dismay, and for a moment found it difficult to decide.

Zhao Xi was also hesitating; in his view, none of them had the certainty of victory, and might even risk their lives!

At that moment, someone stepped forward proactively: “I will fight him.”

Everyone’s gaze immediately turned to the one who had spoken, seeing him in a black robe, with a myna perched on his shoulder; was it not Mo Yecheng or someone else?

Zhao Xi: “You...”

Mo Yecheng smiled lightly: “Lord Zhao, all my comrades, rest assured for now; I am volunteering to fight, not to go to my death, but because I have a certain degree of confidence.”

“Of course, if any among you have more confidence than I do, I, Mo Yecheng, am also willing to yield my position.”

No one spoke in response.

Zhao Xi nodded helplessly, watching with concern as Mo Yecheng flew out of the city wall.

Li Jiǔqu had already challenged twice, and had already cut the morale of the Two Note Nation’ army twice; they could not let him continue any further.

Li Jiǔqu fought against Mo Yecheng.

“Fool who volunteers to throw yourself to death, hehehe, then let me start by killing you first.”

Li Jiǔqu’s black robe billowed, and all the pores on his body simultaneously emitted a baby-like wail.

The wailing was so piercingly sorrowful that it pierced the hearts, agitating the spiritual power and affecting one’s mind.

Mo Yecheng made no move; the myna on his shoulder had its pupils gleaming like stars, and suddenly emitted a clear shriek that pierced through heaven and earth.

That call from the myna immediately revealed an aura of Nascent Soul level; its shriek overshadowed the wailing, scattering countless silver radiance across the battlefield.

“This bird is actually a Nascent Soul-level demonic beast!” Ning Zhuo exclaimed.

Sun Lingtong also changed expression slightly: “At the beginning, I did not realize its true nature.”

Previously, Du Tiechuan had dispatched four armies, proactively invading the Thousand Peaks Forest, in order to probe the enemy’s military deployment’s strengths and weaknesses.

After Ning Zhuo, with the help of talismans, teleported to the Red Flower camp to assist Mu Lan in shooting and killing Di Lu and defeating the Ancient God of the Pale Moon, it was the myna that transmitted the message, informing them of the order to retreat.

Therefore, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo, along with Mu Lan and Zhang Zhongyi, all had an encounter with this myna.

Li Jiǔqu’s body swayed slightly.

With his wailing method suppressed, in his anger he took out a magical treasure.

Rotten Immortal Poison Basket!

The Poison Basket was woven together from the spinal bones of cultivators, and within it nurtured tens of thousands of poison gu, including rotten skin worms, rotting flesh maggots, bone-eroding centipedes, and so on.

At the bottom of the basket, there was also concealed a Maggot Gu Matriarch, which could control all the poisonous insects within a hundred li to form a swarm.

Li Jiǔqu shook the Rotten Immortal Poison Basket vigorously.

An enormous mass of poisonous insects surged out like a jet-black river, raging and flowing.

The insect swarm collided and rubbed against each other, their chitin producing a screeching sound like metal scraping. The maggots’ mouthparts spewed out an immense amount of purple mist, and wherever it passed, the vegetation and forest instantly turned gray.

Mo Yecheng quickly retreated, using spatial maneuvering to buy time.

He still did not make a move; the myna on his shoulder flapped its wings and shrieked, its sound wave forming a semi-transparent ripple.

The insect swarm collided with the sound waves, and a large number of poisonous insects exploded with a bang; ghastly green and withered yellow juices splattered everywhere in the high sky.

“Hehehe.” Li Jiǔqu sneered, his divine sense penetrating into the insect swarm.

In the next moment, over a dozen gu flew out from the insect swarm.

The rotten skin worms charged forward first, corroding the sound wave; the rotting flesh maggots rushed towards Mo Yecheng and self-detonated, forming a highly toxic aura; the bone-eroding centipedes attempted to burrow into Mo Yecheng’s body, but were swallowed one by one by the myna.

Once swallowed into the bird’s stomach, Li Jiǔqu immediately lost the close connection between himself and the gu.

This caused the notoriously infamous demonic-path Gu Cultivator to immediately frown.

The cultivators from both armies, upon seeing this scene, all displayed expressions of astonishment.

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo also figured it out.

Sun Lingtong blurted out: “No wonder this man volunteered; it turns out that this myna has the ability to counteract the gu.”

Ning Zhuo nodded, his attention more focused on Li Jiǔqu: “A Nascent Soul-level Gu Cultivator, this is the first time I have seen one.”

His heart stirred slightly, his emotions somewhat complex.

For some reason, he seemed to have a unique sentiment towards Gu Cultivators.

Seeing that the poisonous gu were not working effectively, Li Jiǔqu immediately cast a spell, attacking one man and one bird.

Mo Yecheng finally made a move, brandishing his hands, sending forth one spell after another in a duel, resulting in a battle that was hard to tell who was winning.

Li Jiǔqu’s gu left the onlookers astounded, while Mo Yecheng stirred up a black tide, devoured the light, concealed himself, and defended in a balanced manner.

Li Jiǔqu’s strength was indeed formidable, clearly superior to Mo Yecheng.

But in this battle, Mo Yecheng had the aid of the myna on his shoulder.

His bird companion was not only of the Nascent Soul level, but also possessed the power to counteract gu.

The man and his bird, assisting each other, actually managed to stalemate with Li Jiǔqu.

Lu Hongtu observed the battle for a long time, and with his divine sense transmitted his thoughts to Lord Long: “Li Jiǔqu is all reputation with no substance; he is unable to defeat even Mo Yecheng. Time is very tight, and our advantage in Nascent Soul level powerhouses may very well be lost due to the imminent reinforcements from Two Note Nation.”

Lord Long nodded, and immediately ordered the remaining cultivators to enter the battle.

“I am the Demon Heart Cave Master; those on the other side, come forth and battle with me!”

“Pale Moon Tribe, Lone Fang is here!”

“Old woman Bi Tengyi, hehehe, who will come and spar with me?”

“Gao Cuo has come; please bestow your guidance upon me.”

……

In a short time, nearly ten Nascent Soul cultivators were dispatched.

Zhao Xi’s expression was extremely grim.

The number of Nascent Soul cultivators on the side of the Two Note Nation was far inferior to that of the Thousand Peaks Forest.

The feeling of having one’s weakness thoroughly exploited by the enemy was truly unpleasant.

At this critical moment, a female cultivator stepped forward.

“Barbarians from the Nascent Soul level, exceedingly arrogant.”

“I am the princess of the nation; now, let me teach you a good lesson!”

It was none other than the ingenious Princess Shuang Ling.

She flew up into the sky, releasing over a hundred mechanized fairy figures that could fly, which surrounded her.

“Come, let’s charge together!” Shuang Ling launched a challenge to the numerous Nascent Soul cultivators on the enemy side.

She was actually intending to fight against all of them by herself.
