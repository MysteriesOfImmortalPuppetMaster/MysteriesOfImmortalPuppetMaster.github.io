Chapter 740: The Fortunes of Objects and Men

As night deepened, Ning Zhuo sat in the Green Stone Cave, setting down the Jade Slip with a weary expression, deep in thought. He had just finished skimming through all the Jade Slips, quickly and superficially.

"Empty Valley Melodic Mechanism Manual..." the big-headed youth murmured.

This Nascent Soul-level inheritance contained numerous Jade Slips covering various aspects of cultivation.

The primary cultivation art was the Great Thousand Mechanisms Wisdom Sutra, a technique for Mechanism Cultivators focused on the Upper Dantian. This art allowed cultivators to perceive the inherent sonic frequencies of objects, granting them a unique divine sense capable of detecting the specific tonal scales within mechanical components.

Ning Zhuo had first reviewed the Empty Valley Green Mechanism General Outline. This Jade Slip served as a comprehensive index and provided a guiding framework for the rest of the inheritance's contents.

In addition to the core cultivation art, there were numerous other methods covering a wide range of disciplines.

For example, the Empty Valley Echoing Bend Transformation was a sonic attack technique that utilized echoes to mimic the cries of crows, creating devastating sound waves capable of piercing through multiple layers of heavy armor with astonishing effectiveness.

Another example is Qingfu and Xunfeng's Essentials, a text attributed to a certain generation's successor. This individual cultivated in a bamboo forest, gaining enlightenment from observing countless bamboo stalks swaying in the wind. It's neither a cultivation art nor a spell, but rather a pure understanding of the natural world and a philosophical exposition of its principles.

There's also the Profound Principles of a Thousand Mechanisms for Tongue Construction, which focuses on crafting short-tongue mechanisms. The book details thousands of models capable of replicating nearly every sound in existence. The Vowel Foolish Fragment Book that Ning Zhuo had studied, along with his hypothesized Consonant Foolish Fragment Book, represent only the foundational chapters of this comprehensive work.

Then there's the Sweeping the Dusk, Wiping the Heavens Manual, a martial art that utilizes sweeping brooms as weapons. A successor seized an opportune moment to incorporate this technique, leading to the development of unique Spirit Bamboo Puppets with unparalleled efficacy.

The Jade Shattering Melody Manual is a musical score. According to the General Outline, it had originally been lost. However, a successor stumbled upon fragmented remnants during a life-altering encounter. Recognizing its perfect resonance with the inheritance, they dedicated themselves to its recovery. Through the collective efforts of several generations, the complete musical score was finally restored.

After quickly reviewing all the Jade Slips, Ning Zhuo gained a clearer understanding of the entire Empty Valley Melodic Mechanism Manual inheritance.

"To fully master this inheritance, one needs two cultivation arts: Mechanism Art and Musical Art."

"The inheritance's practical effect lies in using Musical Art to control Mechanisms and using Mechanisms to amplify Musical Art, creating a mutually reinforcing cycle. In combat, music establishes the battlefield, with various sonic attacks providing a battlefield suppression advantage. Enemies must simultaneously contend with sonic attacks and diverse mechanical constructs, often becoming overwhelmed and unable to respond effectively."

"The primary cultivation resource for this inheritance is Spirit Bamboo of various types. From its origins, the Empty Valley Melodic Mechanism Manual was developed to defend against enemies using bamboo forests. Its foundation lies in Spirit Bamboo. Subsequent generations of inheritors, skilled in Spirit Plant cultivation and Spirit Farming, further solidified this foundation."

Consequently, the Jade Slips also contain numerous cultivation techniques, experience summaries, and other materials related to Spirit Plant cultivation and Spirit Farming.

What Ning Zhuo found most intriguing were the various mechanical constructs detailed in the Jade Slips.

There were mechanical musical instruments like the Gold-Shattering Stone-Splitting Whistle, Wind-Sifting Moon-Leaking Flute, and Embrace-the-Joints Heart-Guarding Flute. There were also various mechanical constructs, such as Qingde, the Joint-Embracing Sword Servant; Xuhuai, the Pill-Breaking Royal Guard; Yingfu, the Wall-Clinging Shadow Guard; Saoshi, the Wind-Listening Monk; and the Tearful Azure Buddha. Additionally, there were mechanical weapons like the Jade Hundred-Jointed Bow and a mechanism carriage called the Forest-Piercing Azure Python Carriage.

Ning Zhuo instinctively compared these creations to those used by Yuan Dasheng, Meng Yehu, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and the rest of his creations.

"These mechanical bodies currently used by the deceased were all designed by me," he thought.

"Compared to the mechanical constructs described in the Empty Valley Melodic Mechanism Manual, my designs are clearly much cruder. The vast difference is immediately apparent."

The various mechanical constructs recorded in the Empty Valley Melodic Mechanism Manual had either been rigorously tested or refined through countless iterations. Any substandard designs were excluded from the records to prevent future generations from inheriting flawed techniques.

As a result, these mechanical constructs had undergone countless improvements over generations, reaching a level of maturity that, at least in Ning Zhuo's eyes, left virtually no room for further refinement.

"With my current capabilities, can I even create these mechanisms?" This was Ning Zhuo's first thought.

He pondered for a moment: "With my Mechanism Platform, my ability to create mechanisms far surpasses even Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages."

"Now that I have complete and detailed structural diagrams, most of the creations should be straightforward."

"However, I still can't produce Nascent Soul-level constructs."

"Without the authentic spiritual energy from the Great Thousand Mechanisms' True Scripture, many steps in the crafting process require corresponding modifications."

"Hmm... I still need to study diligently and thoroughly grasp this inheritance to create mechanisms more efficiently. Otherwise, jumping straight into crafting would lead to frequent failures, wasting materials and consuming excessive time."

Ning Zhuo felt confident in his ability to learn.

He had already mastered various techniques of Mechanical Cultivator, which had proven consistently effective.

"These Jade Slips are ancient artifacts, mostly originating from original cultivators, with successive inheritors adding their insights over the ages."

"If I use them for transcription practice, the results should be exceptional!"

"It's a pity that a cursory glance reveals no miraculous solutions for dealing with Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu."

Finally, Ning Zhuo examined the three Storage Pouches.

One pouch contained a vast quantity of Spirit Stones: over 100,000 Low-Grade Spirit Stones, tens of thousands of Mid-Grade Spirit Stones, and several thousand High-Grade Spirit Stones. This resolved one of Ning Zhuo's most pressing concerns.

"At least I won't have to keep paying with Ghost Path Golden Cores anymore."

Ning Zhuo had profited handsomely from the war in Thousand Peaks Forest, so the quantity of Spirit Stones didn't surprise him.

"Low-grade, mid-grade, and high-grade Spirit Stones are all here. This inheritance even anticipates various dangerous scenarios. If I were to flash a High-Grade Spirit Stone while in dire straits, it would only attract greedy opportunists and malicious intent."

The second Storage Pouch contained precious materials, primarily various types of Spirit Bamboo.

There was Dragon's Roar Bamboo, its hollow segments whistling like a dragon's roar when the wind passed through.

There was Startling Goose Bamboo, slender and resonant, capable of emitting a piercing vibration that could shatter breath.

There was Ghost's Wail Bamboo, its falling leaves resembling ghostly weeping, capable of capturing souls during rainy nights.

There was Golden Jade Bamboo, its stalk golden and leaves jade-like.

There was Silk-Binding Bamboo, its silken strands as supple and resilient as a dragon's sinew, able to bind enemies in a thousand coils.

There was Prostrate Azure Python Bamboo, which grew horizontally along the ground, its segments extending and retracting like a serpent's slithering.

And there was Empty Valley Echo Bamboo, a superior material for crafting sound-transmission devices...

The third Storage Pouch contained the fewest items, but they were the most practical for Ning Zhuo.

Foundation Establishment-level Magic Artifacts were abundant and need no further mention.

Let's focus on the Golden Core-level treasures:

There was the Great Thousandfold Insight Robe, a Golden Core-level long-sleeved magic robe.

There was the Azure Sharp Hundred Transformations Armor, a mechanical exoskeleton that could disassemble into seven hundred and twenty components and reassemble into a seamless, protective suit for the cultivator's physical body.

There was the Jade Hundred-Jointed Bow, a magic treasure with intricate mechanisms that could unleash sonic attacks when drawn and released, the sonic attacks also assisting in the whip's movements.

There was a Golden Core-level Spirit Bamboo Puppet, serving as Xu Huai Zhe Ren's personal guard.

Finally, there was a Mechanism Carriage called the Forest-Piercing Azure Python Carriage, renowned for its ability to navigate complex forest terrain.

"No Nascent Soul-level mechanical constructs?" Ning Zhuo murmured, a hint of disappointment in his voice. This also revealed the dire straits of Qing Zhuzi's lineage.

"If he possessed such constructs, he would have a Nascent Soul-level deterrent. He wouldn't have been reduced to this desperate state, hastily selecting a successor through the Rising Cloud Trial."

Within the Martial Arts Formation's simulated space, Ning Zhuo tested these magic treasures.

He discovered that he could only unleash less than half of their potential power.

"Firstly, I lack orthodox spiritual energy. Secondly, mastering sonic control requires proficiency in the Empty Valley Melodic Mechanism Manual inheritance, which is essential for proper operation."

After personally testing each item, Ning Zhuo found that only the Forest-Piercing Azure Python Carriage required minimal sonic control and was the easiest to operate.

"I happen to need a means of transportation. I'll focus on mastering this Mechanism Carriage first."

"Once Qing Huangzi passes away, I'll take over Azure Bamboo Peak and use the mountain's various Spirit Bamboo to cultivate the Empty Valley Melodic Mechanism Manual inheritance."

The thought of Qing Huangzi inevitably dampened Ning Zhuo's spirits.

He fell into a long silence before finally letting out a deep sigh, his heart filled with melancholy.

"Azure Bamboo Peak was originally a place of inheritance, but it was absorbed into the Myriad Manifestations Sect. As its successor, I can only lease it now.

"Although Qing Huangzi's talents were limited, he did his utmost to maintain this inheritance, never betraying the warnings of our predecessors..."

What is the purpose of living?

What is the purpose of cultivation?

Inheritance...

This concept held immense significance, representing one of the fundamental meanings of existence and cultivation throughout the history of the cultivation world.

No one has ever achieved true immortality.

Reaching new cultivation realms does extend one's lifespan, but it is never limitless.

A cultivator's lifespan always has its limits; even the strongest among them must eventually die.

Beyond bloodlines, passing down and innovating cultivation arts and techniques to the next generation is one of the primary life goals pursued by most cultivators.

Though I may die, I will have existed, and my cultivation will have meaning. Even if my improvements are only minor...

Even if my improvements are minor, as long as they benefit and influence future generations, they will remember me. My existence will have meaning.

Ning Zhuo naturally understood the significance of "inheritance."

Previously, he had only grasped this concept through books. Even after benefiting from the Five Elements Divine Lord, the feeling hadn't truly resonated with him.

Now, having met Qing Huangzi - a fleeting figure in his life, weak in strength, and facing death - Ning Zhuo felt a profound sense of awe.

"Young Master, this is the intelligence on Chen San," Gongsun Yan reported.

Ning Zhuo hummed in acknowledgment, slightly opening the Martial Arts Formation. An invisible force drew the Jade Slip containing the intelligence from outside the formation into his palm.

He owed a debt to the Universal Commerce Hall.

This organization was remarkable, capable of trading in a vast array of goods, including intelligence.

As a newcomer, Ning Zhuo had relied on the Universal Commerce Hall to quickly fill the major gaps in his information gathering.

Around Flying Cloud Era 1875: Suspected to be a descendant of mine slaves from an abandoned mine affiliated with the Green Central Sect.

Flying Cloud Era 1878-1882: Served as a low-ranking menial laborer at the Green Time Sect, responsible for cleaning and sweeping the outer grounds. During this period...

Some disciples called him "Hidden Rat."

Flying Cloud Era 1882: Implicated in an internal theft case at the Green Time Sect, the Sect ruled him responsible, abolished his meager cultivation, and formally expelled him from the mountain gate. From then on, he became one of the lowest-tier unaffiliated cultivators.

Flying Cloud Era 1883-1888: Fan was hired by low-level medicinal herb gardens and small mining sites around Grey Marsh Town and Blackstone Town, working as a guard or tracker.

Flying Cloud Era 1889: He established stable connections with "Old Monkey," a guide from Grey Marsh Town; "Quick-Tongue" Tea Xiaoer, a tea server from Clear River Town; and "One-Eyed Zhang," a tycoon from Blackstone Town. Using specially crafted mechanisms called "Deputy Son Whistles" to transmit and receive intelligence, he formed his initial intelligence network.

Same Year: Rumors he spread about the discovery of a rich Red Copper Vein in West Forest Gully caused the price of Red Copper ore in West Market City to surge nearly 30% within a short period during the winter season of the Flying Cloud Era 1889. This triggered small-scale panic buying and chaos, but the vein's existence was later proven false.

Flying Cloud Era 1891: Hired by the Bamboo Mountain Hall, he participated in their conflict with the Blackwater Gang over a small refined iron ore deposit in Wild Dog Forest.

The struggle for the Refined Iron ore deposits...

Flying Cloud Era, 1893: Multiple sources confirmed that the "Official's Son Sentinel" information network had established stable coverage over the three towns of Gray Party, Blackstone, and Clear River, as well as the surrounding fifty-mile radius. Chen San emerged as a crucial node for the circulation of grassroots intelligence in the region, effectively providing information on the edges of ruins, movements of low-tier demonic beasts, and minor factional conflicts. His fee structure was transparent (small amounts of Spirit Stones or equivalent value), and the timeliness of his information delivery earned widespread approval among the common folk.

Flying Cloud Era, 1894: The Human Golden Toad Casino's massive Spirit Stone fraud case...

Flying Cloud Era, 1895: Mid-spring. "Broken Tooth" Sun Biao, hired to hunt down a young rogue cultivator carrying Warm Jade Marrow, entered Chen San's primary operational area. Three days later, Sun Biao was found heavily wounded, poisoned by multiple mundane toxins, and showing clear signs of Mechanical Rat and Crow Howl suction marks. The wolf-fox companion had escaped. He made no mention of his target, only raving, "Official's Son! Official's Sons are everywhere!" The target safely reappeared in Clear River Town, the Warm Jade Marrow still in his possession.

Flying Cloud Era, Year 1896: ...

Ning Zhuo quickly scanned the report and fell into deep thought.

He knew little about Chen San. Chen San's public declaration of allegiance had taken Ning Zhuo completely by surprise.

However, Ning Zhuo understood that this matter could not be handled lightly.

Therefore, he neither accepted nor rejected Chen San's offer. Instead, he instructed Chen San to deliver Spirit Food to Huo Wa'er, essentially buying more time.

After leaving the tavern, Ning Zhuo immediately sent a flying message to Gongsun Yan, instructing him to gather intelligence on Chen San.

Only with this crucial information could Ning Zhuo make an informed decision.

After reviewing the entire report, Ning Zhuo discovered that Chen San was not a Demonic Path cultivator. Born into poverty and an unaffiliated cultivator, he drifted between the Righteous Path and the gray areas, surviving in the shadows.

"So, should I use this man or not?"

--------
Flying Cloud Kingdom, Ban Clan.

Ancestral Hall.

The Supreme Elders, the core power holders of the Ban Clan, had gathered almost in full. Their faces were grim, some icy, others heavy with dark solemnity, as they stared at a colossal mechanical construct before them.

The Clan Art Nexus Chain!

This massive, uniquely shaped mechanism, the Clan Art Nexus Chain, was linked to the Ban Clan's fortune, constantly monitoring their Qi.

"The Nexus Chain's unusual behavior... is it because of Ban Ji's current Calamity? If we handle this poorly, our entire clan could be in danger!"

"What kind of calamity could be so terrifying? Remember, Ban Ji possesses the Royal Mandate!"

"No, his Royal Mandate hasn't fully awakened yet."

"That doesn't make sense. We arranged for Ban Ji to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect after multiple divinations. Once he joined and acquired the Mechanism Inheritances we planned, his Royal Mandate should have gradually activated. Why is there such a drastic deviation now?"

"Here's the current situation: Ban Ji's Human Tribulation is named Ning Zhuo. We've confirmed he's a foreigner, but his exact origins and background are still under investigation. All signs suggest he's no ordinary individual - a genius of the same caliber as Ban Ji."

"So far, he's already seized the opportunities meant for Qing Huangzi and Che Zhuzi, leaving Ban Ji with only the third inheritance we planned for him."

"Is that a big problem? Even if the King's Mandate hasn't erupted, in his 'Hidden Dragon' state, he shouldn't be easily suppressed by outsiders."

"The Hidden Dragon period is indeed weak. Don't forget, for selfish reasons, shortly after Ban Ji's birth, we used the Clan Technique Pivot Chain to completely link his Destiny with our clan's Destiny. This means Ban Ji is being held back by the entire family."

"How can you say 'held back'? He is a Ban, a blood descendant of our family. How many resources have we secretly funded for him? This is to escort him!"

The Supreme Grand Elder interjected at this moment: "Exactly, we must once again escort him this time."

"Activate the Clan Technique Pivot Chain, link to Ning Zhuo through Ban Ji's Destiny, and I want to see this person's current state of Destiny."

The others quickly obeyed, activating this clan-protecting mechanism Destiny magical treasure.

The Clan Technique Pivot Chain immediately began to rotate its various components: sliders, chains, and rotating wheels, causing its entire appearance to undergo a tremendous transformation.

The Supreme Grand Elder frowned first, acutely sensing the difficulty in the Pivot Chain's operation. After the upper half deformed, the lower half struggled.

A Supreme Elder's eyes flashed with severity: "This child's background is indeed significant! He must have a magical treasure shielding his own Destiny, or his family possesses a clan-protecting Destiny magical treasure. Even our Clan Technique Pivot Chain can't fully calculate it."

Another said: "Calculating only half is still enough to observe many details. Huh?"

As he spoke, the upper half of the mechanism began to deform again.

Such an anomaly drew the close attention of the various Supreme Elders.

After more than ten breaths, the transformation of the Clan Technique Pivot Chain finally ended. The new mechanism structure caused the expressions of the numerous Supreme Elders to change.

"Not good! Ning Zhuo has a new opportunity!"

"His Destiny suddenly increased greatly! Did he acquire some major treasure?"

"It's not just a Fortune of Treasure; it's also a Fortune of People. More accurately, the Fortune of People accounts for the largest proportion! This indicates that Ning Zhuo is about to encounter a talented person who will be important in his life and can bring him tremendous help!"

The Supreme Grand Elder reached out, stopping the increasingly urgent discussion of the others: "Calm down."

"The mechanism is still slowly changing."

"The form is not truly fixed, indicating that Ning Zhuo has not yet gained the person, and is still in the process of selection and hesitation. Nothing is set in stone yet."

The gathered Supreme Elders couldn't help but hold their breath, slightly nervous.

This Fortune of People was truly powerful. If Ning Zhuo acquired it, it would deal an even stronger blow to Ban Ji.

And with Ban Ji's King's Mandate yet to erupt, suffering a setback meant the entire Ban family would suffer a setback!

The damage to the Ban family's future would be extremely serious.

Night was late, and Chen San arrived outside the Azure Stone Cave Dwelling.

He landed lightly, cautious in his movements, observing the cave dwelling's entrance, nervously clearing his throat.

He bowed silently, his manner careful, and then sent a flying message, stating that he had handled the matter Ning Zhuo assigned and wished to request an audience and report back.
