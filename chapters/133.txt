Chapter 133: Stealing the Formation and Seizing Energy

The raging fire burned fiercely in front of Sun Lingtong, with thick smoke billowing into the sky.

Shouts and cries of battle also erupted.

The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator and the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator were under siege.

This was Ning Zhuo's plan, contacting Sun Lingtong's subordinates before launching the attack.

"Lord Cheng Bai!"

"He's a dignified Golden Core cultivator; how could such an explosion kill him? We should worry more about ourselves." "Where has Han Ming gone?"

"Not long ago, the setup we left in the underground prison was triggered. She went to investigate secretly."

"Damn it! The timing can't be this coincidental. The enemy used our setup against us, successfully dividing our forces!" The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator and the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator communicated telepathically, seeing through Ning Zhuo's tactics, but it was already too late.

They were heavily surrounded and trapped in a bitter battle.

"Interesting, very interesting." From the raging flames, Cheng Bai leisurely walked out.

The violent explosion just now hadn't harmed him in the slightest.

A faint golden glow continuously enveloped him, protecting him completely.

Cheng Bai's face was dark, his gaze locked onto Chui Xu Ke: "You actually came to teach people?" "At your age, you should understand the difference between the Golden Core and Foundation Establishment stages." "Heh, mere peak Foundation Establishment, are you here to save people or to die?"

As he spoke, Cheng Bai's gaze fell on the unconscious Sun Lingtong, a complex emotion flickering in his eyes.

"However, I can somewhat understand you."

Cheng Bai revealed a cruel smile, like a venomous snake spitting its tongue from the shadows: "This makes me even more eager for the wonderful moment of marrying you both." "I will dismember you in front of him, hahaha!" Cheng Bai laughed wildly, his laughter filled with arrogance.

Amidst his laughter, the surrounding crimson flames suddenly shifted, transforming into a ghastly green cold flame.

Ghostfire!

He pointed his finger.

The ghostfire condensed into a pack of wolves, charging towards Chui Xu Ke.

Chui Xu Ke's long black hair split into several strands, binding Sun Lingtong and retreating swiftly with him.

During the retreat, Mechanical Thunder Silence Birds continuously flew out from under Chui Xu Ke's cloak.

The Thunder Silence Birds struck the ghostfire wolves, occasionally erupting with thunderous roars, shattering the ghostfire wolves.

Cheng Bai's figure soared, shooting towards Chui Xu Ke. 

But in the next moment, the Fire Persimmon Immortal City Grand Formation surged up, condensing countless formation patterns in mid-air, like a cage, blocking Cheng Bai's attack route.

"Soul Devouring Sect's Golden Core, deal with the grand formation first, then come find me." Chui Xu Ke sneered, taking Sun Lingtong and disappearing into the shadows of the alley.

"Interesting!" Cheng Bai looked at the formation patterns around him that intercepted him and seemed to be contracting, yet he remained calm and composed, without a trace of tension.

Chui Xu Ke, carrying Sun Lingtong, leaped a few times, crossing two or three streets, and then dived into the sewers. 

The teleportation array activated, and they immediately entered an underground base. 

Of course, this was not the base where Han Ming was previously held.

After some emergency treatment, Sun Lingtong still did not wake up. 

Moreover, his life force was gradually extinguishing. 

His injuries were too severe!

A pill was fed into Sun Lingtong's mouth, quickly digesting with the help of spiritual power.

Autumn Life-Saving Pill!

This pill was originally given by Zhu Xuanji to Yuan Er, intended to save Yuan Dasheng's life. 

After several twists and turns, it finally ended up in Ning Zhuo's hands.

As expected, the pill from the royal family had excellent efficacy.

With the use of the Autumn Life-Saving Pill, Sun Lingtong's life force stabilized.

But before Ning Zhuo could breathe a sigh of relief, an overwhelming pressure descended.

The ground trembled, and a figure pierced through the earth nearly ten zhang, arriving at the underground base.

The divine sense of the Blind Judge Cheng Bai quickly enveloped the area.

"Where do you think you're escaping to?"

"I've planted a unique mark on Sun Lingtong's body."

"Hehehe, Chui Xu Ke, unless you abandon him, you have no chance of survival. Otherwise, you are doomed!" Chui Xu Ke's voice was hoarse, filled with hatred and anger: "You talk too much nonsense!"

In the next moment, the formation patterns surged again, encircling Cheng Bai.

"Again with this trick?" Cheng Bai snorted coldly, his expression disdainful.

But in the next moment, the formation patterns radiated brilliantly, causing blood to flow from Cheng Bai's nostrils, ears, and eyes.

Chui Xu Ke sneered: "The base on the surface was deliberately restrained to avoid implicating Boss Sun. But here, deep underground, even if discovered, they can't drag out Boss Sun, so we can go all out. Enjoy it, Cheng Bai!"

The formation patterns radiated brilliantly, frantically eroding Cheng Bai's defenses.

"Damn it!" Cheng Bai tightly closed his lips, sweeping away his previous arrogance, fully resisting the Fire Persimmon Immortal City Grand Formation.

Time rewinds to several years ago.

In the underground base.

"Little Zhuo, your mother was quite impressive as a mechanical cultivator," Sun Lingtong remarked, looking around the underground base in awe.

While Ning Zhuo was practicing mechanical techniques, he accidentally discovered a map hidden in the underground workshop.

Following the map, they navigated through a section of the sewer and eventually arrived at the underground base.

"Your mother really put a lot of thought into this."

"She deliberately hid this mechanical map, ensuring that only when your mechanical skills reached a certain level could you unlock it."

"This place is indeed not very safe!" Sun Lingtong commented.

"I understand," Ning Zhuo nodded. "Inside and outside Fire Persimmon Mountain, there is the Immortal City Grand Formation. Creating a secret space underground in the city is extremely difficult."

"Once you touch any formation pattern of the grand formation, you'll be discovered."

"I'm actually quite surprised that this underground base has remained hidden for so many years without being discovered," Sun Lingtong chuckled. "I get it now."

Ning Zhuo: "What?"

Sun Lingtong: "Under normal circumstances, the Immortal City Grand Formation needs to be re-planned and arranged periodically. Although it is very costly, it ensures the reliability of the grand formation, preventing enemies with ulterior motives from probing its secrets and paralyzing it at critical moments."

"The situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City might be special, possibly related to the Lava Immortal Palace, causing the grand formation to remain unchanged."

"Or perhaps, a certain city lord was corrupt and didn't genuinely carry out the renovation of the Immortal City Grand Formation."

"That being said, Fire Persimmon Immortal City is located in the heart of the Southern Bean Immortal Kingdom. Even if a large-scale war breaks out, it wouldn't reach here immediately."

"Perhaps the successive city lords thought: when the flames of war ignite, there will be enough time to adjust the formation."

Ning Zhuo's eyes suddenly lit up: "In that case, we can set up several more underground bases like this."

"We just established a gang and need to maintain expenses, so we have to do business."

"We can use the underground bases for transit and engage in smuggling. This place can also serve as our warehouse."

Sun Lingtong praised, "Brilliant! This way, we can raid other factions' warehouses, and they won't be able to find ours!"

"However, once this place is discovered, it won't hold up for long. The defenses are too weak."

The underground base couldn't be equipped with defensive formations.

Because the operation of any formation would interfere with the Immortal City Grand Formation.

The City Lord's Mansion would also get clues and eventually trace it back here.

Sun Lingtong stroked his chin: "Later, I'll set up some Void Sect talismans to minimize the presence of this place."

"When I reach the peak of Foundation Establishment, I can barely use the magical treasures my master left me to set up some formation patterns here."

"These formation patterns can weakly connect with the Immortal City Grand Formation, so even if the grand formation discovers them in the future, it will mistakenly think they are part of it."

Ning Zhuo's eyes widened in astonishment: "That powerful?"

Sun Lingtong smiled proudly: "Our Void Sect's expertise in formations runs deep. Because in this world, the most valuable treasures are almost always protected by layers of formations."

"My method is called Joyous Array Energy Theft."

"When we have our own gang's base in the future, I will use this method in the base to steal a lot of magical power from the Immortal City Grand Formation, while paying very little in fees."

In the process of taking control of the black market and eliminating dissenters.

The two led their subordinates to heavily surround the enemy gang's base.

"Little Zhuo, are you confident?" Sun Lingtong transmitted his voice.

"Boss Sun, just watch." Ning Zhuo was very confident.

With a wave of his hand, the mechanical carts charged forward.

Each cart was filled with numerous explosives.

Boom! Boom!

The enemy gang activated their defensive formation, and the explosions did not harm a single person.

The enemy gang members all laughed mockingly.

Ning Zhuo, however, stood by calmly, counting down clearly: "Three, two, one!"

When he counted to one, the enemy's defensive formation suddenly collapsed, and the high-ranking members of the main formation all suffered backlash, either severely injured or dead.

Sun Lingtong loudly praised and curiously transmitted his voice: "Little Zhuo, how did you do it?" Ning Zhuo replied, "It's simple. Boss Sun, didn't you teach me the method of stealing array energy?" Sun Lingtong was even more curious: "But I am restricted by sect rules and never taught you any related spells or talismans." Ning Zhuo shrugged: "It's simple. You told me the principles, and I used other methods to achieve the same effect. Practically speaking, it works, right?" Ning Zhuo looked at Sun Lingtong for approval.

Sun Lingtong's expression remained calm, and he nodded slightly: "Hmm, it's acceptable."

Finally, they became the controllers of the black market.

Sun Lingtong's face turned pale: "Little Zhuo, there's no need to secretly bury so many explosives in my residence, right?" Ning Zhuo shook his head: "Boss, it's very necessary. We must be cautious, humble, and prepared for all possible adverse situations. For example, if a cultivator far more powerful than us comes to cause trouble. Nascent Soul level and above cultivators are beyond our scheming, the gap is too large. But for Golden Core cultivators, we can put in some effort."

"That Fei Si is insidious and ruthless, not a good person. Maybe one day, he will personally come to eradicate our black market forces?" "We must be fully prepared!"

Sun Lingtong could only nod helplessly: "If a Golden Core cultivator comes, can't we just run?" "Well, making more preparations is always good."
