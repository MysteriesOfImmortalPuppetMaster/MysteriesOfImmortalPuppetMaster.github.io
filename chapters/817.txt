Chapter 817: Demonic Seed

Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned, then immediately returned the greeting: "I am indeed Ning Zhuo. Brother Gu’s name resounds like thunder in my ears. The White-Browed Hero acts with kindness and enmity, slaying countless evils; it is truly admirable."

By now, Ning Zhuo’s reputation was significant enough to warrant a different attitude from figures like Gu Huaijiu.

Gu Huaijiu shook his head, his white eyebrows trembling slightly: "It is but an empty reputation. My family is broken and my people are dead; I live ignobly only for revenge. What kind of hero am I?"

He changed the subject, pointing to their surroundings. "This should be the second trial. Has Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo discovered anything?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head and suggested they continue scouting.

Gu Huaijiu nodded: "That is the only way."

After walking for a while, they found the tunnel split into a fork.

Gu Huaijiu frowned slightly: "One left, one right. Which path will Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo choose?"

Ning Zhuo extended his hand, signaling for Gu Huaijiu to choose first: "The second level arranged for us to meet; it must intend to test our cooperation."

"No matter what we encounter, we should do our utmost to coordinate and work together."

"Reasonable." Gu Huaijiu nodded. He immediately agreed on a time limit for exploration with Ning Zhuo. Once the time was up, regardless of the results, both were to return here to regroup.

Thus, Gu Huaijiu went left, and Ning Zhuo went right, temporarily parting ways.

Not long after entering the fork, Ning Zhuo made a significant discovery.

Looking at the familiar blood qi before him, realization dawned in his heart: "So, this second level is connected to the first."

The fork in the path was not complex. Ning Zhuo passed through three iron gates, walked by two torture chambers, and found a curled-up figure at the end.

It was a youth who looked no more than fifteen or sixteen years old. His clothes were tattered, his body covered in cuts and bruises, and he was hugging his knees, shivering. When he looked up, he revealed a pale, delicate face. His eyes were filled with tears, terror, and helplessness.

"Save, save me... I am not an evil spirit, I was forced..." He begged Ning Zhuo for mercy.

At that exact moment, a divine sense transmission reached Ning Zhuo’s divine sea: "You have discovered a Blood Fog Suspect. Eliminate the true culprit to pass this level."

"Hmm?" Ning Zhuo frowned slightly, various thoughts instantly rippling through his divine sea.

"There must be a Blood Fog True Culprit in the second level!"

"I have only encountered a suspect. He might be the true culprit, or he might not."

"Is this level testing the ability to investigate and interrogate?"

"No, there is something else!"

Ning Zhuo pondered deeper and immediately thought of Gu Huaijiu.

"What will Gu Huaijiu encounter on his side?"

"Will he find nothing, or will his situation be similar to mine?"

Ning Zhuo guessed that Gu Huaijiu had likely captured a suspect as well and received the same prompt.

"In that case, is this a confrontational level?"

"Whoever identifies the true culprit first and kills them wins. The loser is... eliminated!"

Realizing this, Ning Zhuo instantly felt tense.

His current situation was similar to Gu Qing’s during the previous Three Confucian Tests: he carried the weight of public expectation and could not afford to fail.

"My goal in participating in this second test is to take first place."

"If I am eliminated by Gu Huaijiu in the second level... how can I face Zhong Dao? How will the public view me?"

Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly, realizing he had fallen into an awkward predicament, finally understanding the immense pressure Gu Qing had felt before.

Earlier, he had thought of cooperating with Gu Huaijiu, but it turned out they were competitors!

"I need to interrogate him for results as quickly as possible and judge whether this youth is a suspect or the true culprit."

"If he is a suspect... then the true culprit is in Gu Huaijiu’s hands."

"In that case, will I have to snatch him from Gu Huaijiu?"

Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo’s frown deepened.

He restrained the youth and began using various methods to interrogate him.

At first, the youth answered everything he knew, his expression earnest. However, his statements were contradictory, his emotions panicked, and his logic chaotic - it was hard to verify what was true or false.

"Wait, this tunnel is full of prison cells and torture chambers. The facilities inside can be used."

"Perhaps this is the intention of the Demon Subjugation Hall’s arrangement?"

Ning Zhuo immediately dragged the youth back, using the facilities in the fork to conduct the interrogation.

Once torture was applied, there was indeed a major breakthrough.

The youth’s expression suddenly changed!

The terror in his eyes receded like a tide, replaced by a look of spiteful, malevolent amusement. The corners of his mouth split open to his ears, revealing rows of fine, sharp teeth, and his voice became shrill and ear-piercing: "Hee hee... I’ve been found out. But do you dare kill me? Once I die, the Blood Fog will inevitably erupt. It won't just fill the entire dungeon, bringing disaster upon you, but it will also leak out and plague the region!"

"When that happens, and countless people die because of you, can you bear that responsibility?!"

"Hahaha!"

The youth became incredibly arrogant.

In that instant, killing intent surged in Ning Zhuo’s heart.

This was merely the Cloud Dream Marsh, not reality. The youth’s threat held no deterrent effect whatsoever.

"It seems my luck is good; I found the true culprit among the suspects!"

"But there is another prerequisite to eliminating the true culprit: containing the Blood Fog that erupts after the enemy is removed."

"Heh heh, if it were Gu Huaijiu, he might struggle. But it just so happens that one of the cultivation methods I practice is the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art."

However, just as Ning Zhuo was about to strike, a thought suddenly moved in his mind, and a gleam of light flashed deep in his eyes.

"The Demon Subjugation Hall has gone to such lengths; is it really this simple?"

"And although this youth admitted it personally, the chain of evidence is actually incomplete."

"So..."

Ning Zhuo subconsciously rubbed his mechanism ring: "The Demon Subjugation Hall arranged for two people to meet. Is the intention to use this competitive pressure to induce cultivators into making the wrong judgment?"

Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo suppressed the last wisp of anxiety and began the torture and interrogation once again.

After the youth changed his face, his mind was very clear, and he confessed candidly to his criminal acts.

After a round of interrogation, Ning Zhuo successfully collected ample evidence, filling in most of the links in the chain of evidence.

Facts proved that this youth was indeed the true culprit!

"There are still a few doubtful points missing, but it shouldn't be a big problem."

"Should I kill him?"

"The agreed time has also arrived..."

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth slightly.

According to his agreement with Gu Huaijiu, they were to meet at the fork. But the youth in Ning Zhuo’s hands was the Demonic Cultivator true culprit... If Ning Zhuo really met up with Gu Huaijiu, it would likely provoke the other party to try and snatch the prisoner.

Why... make an unnecessary move?

"No, on the contrary, I should make this 'unnecessary move'!"

Ning Zhuo grabbed the prisoner and returned the way he came.

Just as he arrived at the fork, he saw Gu Huaijiu walking out from the other tunnel. The other party was also carrying a captive.

This captive was short in stature, a dwarf.

He struggled constantly, his face hideous with exposed fangs, and his skin was an abnormal bluish-purple. Even though his acupoints had been sealed by Gu Huaijiu’s sword qi, he continued to roar incessantly.

When Gu Huaijiu saw Ning Zhuo, a complex emotion flashed through his eyes, and he nodded slightly.

The two approached and successfully reunited. Their first words were remarkably similar: "The one in my hand is (should be) the true culprit."

"Hm?" Gu Huaijiu was slightly stunned.

Ning Zhuo was surprised for a moment, then his scalp went numb and his heart tightened.

Gu Huaijiu was a well-known figure. Immersed in vengeance, his interrogation methods for finding clues about his enemies were certainly extraordinary.

Gu Huaijiu believed the suspect in his hands was the true culprit. This had to be reasonable!

But Ning Zhuo was also quite confident in the identity of the youth suspect he had captured.

Who was right and who was wrong?

"Interesting. Based on Fellow Daoist Ning's statement, it seems I must overturn my view of this second level," Gu Huaijiu said.

Ning Zhuo nodded.

Presumably, Gu Huaijiu had gone through the same mental journey as himself.

At this moment, Ning Zhuo knew that keeping the appointment was truly the right move!

He and Gu Huaijiu immediately exchanged their findings.

Upon comparing notes, Ning Zhuo discovered the dwarf was the true culprit, while Gu Huaijiu felt the youth was also the true culprit.

"Could there be two true culprits?" Gu Huaijiu asked in surprise.

Ning Zhuo fell into contemplation: "Earlier, the divine sense transmission said - 'You have discovered a Blood Fog Suspect. Eliminate the true culprit to pass this level.' Looking solely at this message, there isn't necessarily only one true culprit!"

Gu Huaijiu showed doubt: "But if there are two true culprits, what is the purpose of this arrangement? Assuming two cultivators eager to remove evil simply eliminate them directly, wouldn't they both pass smoothly?"

Ning Zhuo fell silent, sinking into deep thought. After a while, he said, "Why don't we let the two 'true culprits' confront each other?"

Ning and Gu woke their respective captives. As a result of the confrontation, the youth and the dwarf began to curse each other, their emotions becoming increasingly agitated, both claiming that they were the true culprit.

This bizarre scene brought no smile to Ning or Gu. After investigating for a moment, a look of realization dawned on both their faces.

"So that is the truth!" Ning Zhuo said.

"They are both the true culprit, yet neither of them is," Gu Huaijiu added.

The two looked at each other and smiled.

Although it was their first cooperation, both parties had kept their word. Instead of eliminating the "true culprit" in their hands for personal gain, they had been open with each other, which allowed the deeper truth to surface.

If one side had been missing, the true culprit would likely have remained buried.

Therefore, the second level was not a confrontation, but still a cooperative level.

If one really had to speak of confrontation, the confronting force for the cultivators attempting the level was their own selfishness.

In that moment, Ning Zhuo’s impression of Gu Huaijiu improved greatly: "This person keeps his word; he is well worth befriending."

Gu Huaijiu praised silently in his heart: "Ning Zhuo truly deserves such Noble Spirit. At such a young age, to have such breadth of mind and capability!"

After discussing a plan, the two began to act.

Ning Zhuo’s fingers moved like lightning, precisely striking acupoints, using divine sense and spiritual power to penetrate the youth’s dantian.

The youth’s body trembled violently, and a piercing golden-red light suddenly lit up somewhere on his chest.

Gu Huaijiu’s gaze was sharp as lightning. The black iron sword on his person moved without wind, unsheathing itself three inches with a clang!

In an instant, a streak of jet-black sword qi, condensed as if solid, shot out from the gap in the scabbard, striking directly into the golden-red point of light on the youth’s chest.

The point of light was extinguished, and a jet of bright red demonic qi surged out from the needle-sized wound.

As soon as the demonic qi emerged, it was sealed away by Ning Zhuo.

Repeating the method, points of light constantly flashed and were extinguished on the youth’s body.

The demonic qi within him was extracted more and more, until the final moment.

A non-human roar suddenly erupted from the youth’s body! A hideous blood-colored phantom forcibly charged out from the crown of his head. The phantom’s features were blurred; only a giant mouth filled with sharp teeth opened wide, attempting to counterattack Ning Zhuo.

"Come on then!" Ning Zhuo shouted low, forming hand seals faster than the phantom could move.

Light exploded from Gu Huaijiu’s eyes. The black iron sword fully unsheathed, shooting out a beam of sword light in the blink of an eye.

The sword light vanished upon impact.

The roar of the blood-colored phantom came to an abrupt halt.

In the next instant, it shattered inch by inch like glazed glass, turning into specks of dark red light that filled the air.

With this, the Demonic Seed within the youth was finally thoroughly eradicated!

Demonic Seed.

What is a Demonic Seed?

A Demonic Seed is not a naturally occurring evil object, but the accumulated principles of a high-level cultivator's life after they perish. The cultivator’s emotions, spiritual power, memories, experiences, as well as certain precious materials and unconventional forces, combine, mix, and even mutate to create it.

This is somewhat similar to the Sarira (relics) left behind after a virtuous high monk passes away and is cremated.

But a Demonic Seed is far more dangerous than a Sarira.

It is both a treasure of inheritance and a cursed object.

Because a Demonic Cultivator's principles and cultivation methods are often linked to the cultivator themself - such as their physical body, vital essence blood, skin, bones, and so on.

Therefore, if a Demonic Seed is difficult to control, it will infringe upon the inheritor's body.

When high-level cultivators perish, they are often in a state of extreme emotion. Thus, Demonic Seeds often carry monstrous resentment, endless obsession, or mad desires.

If the successor lacks sufficient capability, they will be drowned by these violent negative emotions and become a slave to them.

Demonic Cultivators often carry heavy sins and die during lightning tribulations.

Sometimes, the formation process of a Demonic Seed absorbs the power of the lightning tribulation. This makes the Demonic Seed even harder to control.

Worse still, a Demonic Seed will acquire more "legacy" upon the death of the successor, strengthening itself, making its power more diverse, complex, and immense.

Therefore, a Demonic Seed has no fixed form; it varies according to the original owner's cultivation method, cause of death, and the environment of its condensation. As successors die, the Demonic Seed becomes more powerful and bizarre.

Ning Zhuo and Gu Huaijiu cooperated to successively eliminate the Blood Fog Demonic Seeds within the youth and the dwarf.

The two Demonic Seeds had slight differences.

"This is only a sub-seed, not the original Demonic Seed. Perhaps in the following levels, we will be able to contact the original body," Ning Zhuo guessed.

Gu Huaijiu murmured in a low voice: "Demonic Seed..."

"Envy not the Dao Fruit on another's peak,

Know that beneath the honey, arsenic creates a streak.

The predecessor's blood remains warm and red,

While the successor's bones lie cold and dead.

Cultivation is meant to be a mirror of the heart,

External things but reflections, a deceptive art.

If one gets greedy for a shortcut’s speed,

In future years, one becomes a new Demonic Seed.

The wheel of reincarnation crushes the fragrance of those who ensue,

Heaven's net is vast, and its retribution is true."

He sighed: "To tell you the truth, there is a Demonic Seed inside my body. I rely on this power for my revenge!"

"Perhaps the Demon Subjugation Hall had a purpose in arranging this level."

He bowed to Ning Zhuo again, expressing deep admiration: "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, cooperating with you today has moved me deeply. You might not believe it, but although this is only our first meeting and collaboration, I trust Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo completely."

"If one day, the Demonic Seed within me causes chaos and threatens the common people, I ask Fellow Daoist to take action and help me achieve deliverance via arms."

"All my belongings at that time shall be Fellow Daoist's reward!"

Ning Zhuo was surprised; he hadn't expected the other party to entrust him with a matter of life and death after just their first cooperation.

Ning Zhuo did not hesitate. He immediately returned the bow, expressing his honor, and directly agreed. He also proposed finding a wondrous method to remove the Demonic Seed for Gu Huaijiu so he could recover himself.

Gu Huaijiu, however, shook his head, a look of resolve surging onto his face: "I must rely on the Demonic Seed to carry out my revenge. It is my means of survival, my reliance for avenging my grievances."

"Even if I die because of it, I do so willingly!"
