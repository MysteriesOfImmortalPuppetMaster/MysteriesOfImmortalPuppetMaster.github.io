Chapter 650: The True Form Awakens

Amidst the shifting boulders, one suddenly hurtled toward Ning Zhuo under the influence of repulsive forces.

The rock veered from its original trajectory, and Ning Zhuo was directly in its path!

"Move!" In that instant, Ning Zhuo's heart seized, as if gripped by an icy hand, pounding violently in his throat.

He planted his feet firmly, palms erupting in flames as he thrust them backward, accelerating with all his might!

He activated Military Power Amplification!

The Sky Iron Heroic Armor shattered speed records, successfully outrunning the colossal boulder.

The Five Elements Golden Core Wheel spun wildly on his chest, emitting blinding light as its power surged forth like a flood, sustaining this terrifying expenditure.

Behind him, the Golden Wings sliced through the air, emitting a continuous, ear-piercing shriek like tearing silk.

He periodically launched a few, or even a dozen, Mechanical Golden Swallows, directing them to collide with the flying rock. Sometimes they mutually annihilated, but other times they deflected the boulder's trajectory, carving out a narrow path of escape for Ning Zhuo.

"Hmph!" The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God watched Ning Zhuo closing in on the Ice Coffin and clapped his hands together before his chest.

In the next instant, Earth Lung Turbid Qi roiled downward, coalescing above Ning Zhuo into an island-sized mass!

An overwhelming terror gripped Ning Zhuo.

He didn't even need to look up. His divine sense already made him acutely aware of the perilous situation closing in around him.

The colossal boulder above Ning Zhuo was as massive as an island, plummeting down with unstoppable, world-crushing force, like a fragment of the sky collapsing.

Its enormous shadow engulfed Ning Zhuo, its terrifying gravity abruptly halting his momentum.

At that moment, every formation within the Sky Iron Heroic Armor began to wail in distress.

Ning Zhuo unleashed a swarm of Mechanical Golden Swallows.

Like moths drawn to a flame, the Golden Swallows collided with the colossal mass, their self-destructive fire instantly swallowed by the behemoth, unable to even make it tremble.

Ning Zhuo marshaled all his resources for a desperate sprint.

He can't evade it!

As the calculation reached its conclusion, a cold despair welled up in Ning Zhuo.

"Little Ma!!" Qing Chi cried out in alarm.

Still in the corridor, she witnessed the unfolding disaster.

Without hesitation, the Ghost Clan Girl flew toward the danger.

As she sped forward, crystalline tears streamed from her eyes.

Too late, too late!

"No, Little Ma!"

"No, no - !"

In her desperation, a storm of lightning seemed to surge within her divine sea, countless thoughts surging and exploding in an instant.

She frantically reviewed the Military Manual, her heart burning with the desire to save her beloved.

What can I do? How can I make Little Ma go faster? Faster?!

This overwhelming urgency led Qing Chi to a sudden realization of a military strategy:

Military Strategy - Speed is of the Essence!

This was the most classic and widely-used military strategy, but Qing Chi had never been able to grasp it.

Now, under the pressure of the situation, her exceptional military talent was forced to the surface, allowing her to not only achieve sudden enlightenment but also successfully activate the strategy on the spot.

A significant portion of her Military Might was consumed!

Ning Zhuo's speed surged dramatically!

A terrifying propulsion, like a giant hammer, slammed brutally into his back.

Buzz - clatter!

The Sky Iron Heroic Armor emitted a bone-chilling groan, as if it might disintegrate at any moment.

In that instant, Ning Zhuo's vision darkened at the edges, blood-red streaks appearing like his eyes were about to burst from their sockets.

The excruciating pain in his hips and back reached its peak; he could even hear his bones creaking under the strain!

The Sky Iron Heroic Armor transformed into a streak of golden light, tearing a path through the world-destroying pressure of the colossal rock.

Whoosh - !

Just as the island-massive boulder was about to crush him completely, the Sky Iron Heroic Armor, trailing a screeching sonic boom and elongated flame trails, shot past the edge of destruction at a razor-thin angle, daringly surging forward!

Incredible!

Ning Zhuo had broken free from the shadow of certain death! And the massive Ice Coffin lay just ahead!

His momentum faltered slightly as he slammed into the Ice Coffin's tail section.

Bracing his hands against the Ice Coffin, he began pushing it toward the Branch of the Wangchuan River with all his might.

The Ice Coffin began to descend, its speed accelerating.

The terrifying cold radiating from it seeped through the palms of the Sky Iron Heroic Armor, launching a horrifying assault on Ning Zhuo.

At first, it was tolerable; the chill even helped cool the overheated battle armor.

But soon, Ning Zhuo began to shiver violently.

The temperature plummeted with terrifying speed, as if he had been transported from a volcanic inferno straight into a thousand-year-old ice cavern!

Gritting his teeth, Ning Zhuo pushed with all his might, refusing to let go.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God roared with fury!

Despite exerting all his power, he had failed to stop Ning Zhuo and even allowed him to move the Ice Coffin.

Under no circumstances could the Ice Coffin be allowed to fall into the Branch of the Wangchuan River!

The battle between the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and Yin Jiuzhu had already revealed the terrifying power of the Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle. That candle had nearly frozen the entire branch of the Wangchuan River solid.

"Stop this!" the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God roared, the black smoke billowing from his head instantly turning a deep crimson.

The crimson smoke coalesced into a colossal, sky-obscuring hand, radiating earth-shattering power as it slammed down towards Ning Zhuo.

Though the attack's area of effect was limited, it was locked onto Ning Zhuo.

As the distance closed, Luo Si let out a roar, gripping the cracked fishing rod with both hands and hurling the hook with all his might.

"Fishing Art - World-Piercing Hook!"

Clang!

A crystalline sound, like ice shattering in a glass vessel, pierced the air as the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook embedded itself within the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

Luo Si yanked the rod upward.

Buzz - !!! The fishing rod trembled violently, groaning under the strain.

"Roar - !" The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let out an unprecedented howl of pain.

His body convulsed violently, and the dark crimson smoke hand he controlled suddenly went haywire, dispersing by more than half and losing most of its power.

Ning Zhuo felt the pressure ease, the shadow of death dissipating once more.

The Sky Iron Heroic Armor erupted with a fiery blast over three meters long, pushing the Ice Coffin forward despite its near-collapsed state, gradually accelerating its momentum.

The Ice Coffin's terrifying cold had already severely eroded Ning Zhuo's senses, numbing his hands and arms completely.

Under Ning Zhuo's desperate exertions, the massive Ice Coffin gained speed, like a giant ice mace hurled by a celestial warrior. It smashed through the final stretch of distance and plunged into the Branch of the Wangchuan River with a thunderous splash.

Crack! Crackle! Crack - !!!

Centered around the Ice Coffin, the waters of the Wangchuan River instantly froze.

White frost rapidly spread through the tributaries, transforming the flowing water into pale, solid ice.

"No!" The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God roared, charging furiously toward the tributary of the Wangchuan River.

The fishing rod in Luo Si's hand snapped into pieces, and he collapsed to one knee on the Bronze War Chariot, coughing up a mouthful of blood.

Qing Chi had already collapsed in the passage, her overexertion causing blood to seep from her eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Exhausted to the point of death, she strained her eyes open with her last ounce of strength to see Ning Zhuo successfully push the Ice Coffin into the tributary. Only then did her tension ease, and she slipped into unconsciousness.

"It worked!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed triumphantly. The Sky Iron Heroic Armor, having fulfilled its purpose, reached its limits. Covered in horrific scars and distortions, the armor's components clattered to the ground, falling away from his body.

"Now that the tributary is frozen, I can reach the Sacrificial Altar."

Even the pursuit of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God brought him no fear.

For now, the Sacrificial Altar was defenseless. He could seize the initiative, coordinate with Luo Si, and keep the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God pinned down!

At that moment, Lord Wangchuan's true form, hidden within a tributary of the Wangchuan River, suddenly opened his eyes.

Sensing imminent danger, he was jolted awake from his slumber.

"Hmm?!" In an instant, he grasped the situation.

Activating both his divine sense and spiritual energy, he unleashed a cataclysmic disturbance within the tributary.

The freezing process immediately slowed by eighty percent, hindered by his intervention.

The river churned violently, forming turbulent undercurrents that coiled around the Ice Coffin like serpents, dragging it deep into the water.

Lord Wangchuan's true form sneered from within the river. "So, young man, you're my greatest Human Tribulation?"

"Not impressive!"

"In fact, I should thank you for returning my Nether Dragon Scissors."

Ning Zhuo's face paled.

He had been blindsided by inadequate intelligence, unaware that Lord Wangchuan's true form was concealed within the tributary.

At the critical moment, Lord Wangchuan had awakened!

By manipulating the tributary, he had instantly contained the spreading frost. Ning Zhuo's desperate struggle now seemed like a futile attempt to deliver the prize directly to Lord Wangchuan!

The sudden reversal left Ning Zhuo gasping for air.

His actions had inadvertently revealed the true form's aura of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

A Soul Formation-level entity!

Two Soul Formation-level beings - how could a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator like Ning Zhuo possibly handle this?

"Didn't the Ash Bone Elder say I'd only face Nascent Soul-level opponents at most? Did he miscalculate?!" In that moment, Ning Zhuo felt despair wash over him once more.

Forgetful River Immortal City, City Lord's Mansion.

A child darted between bookshelves, small hands constantly touching the personnel files on the shelves.

With each touch, the files vanished from their place and materialized in the child's storage bracelet.

Beside him, Zeng Jide, the elderly man, stroked his beard and nodded approvingly. "You've laid a solid foundation, boy. The basic techniques of the Theft Path come to you as naturally as breathing."

"However, gathering all these personnel files from the Forgetful River Prefecture officials won't be of much use."

"To truly exploit these files, the most fundamental requirement is national power."

"The secondary condition is higher official rank. Only high-ranking officials can discipline lower-ranking ones."

"You can't use Wangchuan's national power, and you don't hold any position in the Forgetful River Prefecture. At best, these files serve as observational intelligence."

"But this intelligence is superficial. If you want to uncover secrets, you'll either have to investigate personally or purchase information from intelligence organizations."

Sun Lingtong wiped his nose. "Is that so?"

His hands remained busy as he spoke, chuckling mischievously. "Since we've come all this way and taken such risks, it'd be a shame to leave empty-handed."

"A thief never goes home empty-handed, you know."

"Even if they're not particularly valuable, these records will be useful for the Forgetful River Prefecture."

"Whenever I imagine the Prefecture Lord of the Forgetful River arriving here and seeing empty bookshelves, I can't help but laugh."

"Heh heh heh..."

Zeng Jide was amused by this, finding Sun Lingtong increasingly to his liking.

After sweeping the place clean of all the personnel records, Sun Lingtong slipped away with his senior sect brother.

Zeng Jide led Sun Lingtong through the City Lord's Mansion, moving stealthily.

A well-equipped team of Patroling Cultivators marched past in unison, each employing different detection methods.

The departure of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and the brazen assault of the Painted Skin Rakshasa had put them on high alert, driving them to patrol with utmost vigilance.

Zeng Jide gripped Sun Lingtong's arm and leaped, transforming into a pool of shadow that merged into the low grass.

Theft Path Method: Shadow Escape!

Sun Lingtong's heart trembled with awe.

The grass was clearly visible, having been swept by over a dozen detection methods, yet none revealed the old and young members of the Void Sect hidden within.

The moment the Patrol Guards turned the corner at the end of the corridor, Zeng Jide moved.

Pulling Sun Lingtong along, he leaped like a spirit cat, landing with several quick steps before scaling the wall and vaulting onto the roof.

It was broad daylight!

The Patroling Cultivators never neglected scanning the rooftops.

Yet Zeng Jide always managed to seize the gaps between their scans, choosing the perfect moment for action, whether lying low or advancing boldly.

When he moved, it was with brazen audacity! So daring it bordered on recklessness.

Yet he remained undetected!

Sun Lingtong's eyes widened, his mind shouting: What immense experience must one have to achieve such mastery of stealth!

Hopping across rooftops allowed Zeng Jide and Sun Lingtong to swiftly navigate the City Lord's Mansion, with its numerous buildings and complex layout, rapidly approaching their target.

Zeng Jide continued to grip Sun Lingtong's arm, hiding in the shadows of the eaves as they evaded several groups of Patroling Cultivators.

Sun Lingtong found it peculiar that Zeng Jide had stopped moving. Then, through a mental transmission of his divine sense, Zeng Jide communicated secretly, "This is the place."

Sun Lingtong:?!

Despite being so close to Zeng Jide, Sun Lingtong hadn't detected any use of extraordinary means. Unaware, Zeng Jide had already scanned the interior of the house.

Pulling Sun Lingtong along, Zeng Jide nimbly climbed onto the roof without a sound.

Sun Lingtong's body felt light as a feather or a shadow, following closely behind Zeng Jide.

Zeng Jide extended his slender fingers and, with seemingly casual movements, pried and pressed at the roof. Several seemingly seamless glazed tiles popped open, revealing a narrow gap barely wide enough for a cat to pass through.

Zeng Jide, who was rather short, squeezed through the opening.

Sun Lingtong's eyes widened as he watched, up close, Zeng Jide seemingly shed his bones. His body shrank effortlessly, his weight seemingly vanishing as he smoothly "flowed" into the house.

They landed silently on the tiled floor.

Zeng Jide stood on the small tile, not moving forward. Sun Lingtong's hair stood on end as he obediently imitated him, not daring to move a muscle.

Sun Lingtong knew well that the defensive formation inside the room had not been dismantled. If he were in charge, he would undoubtedly choose a door or window as his point of entry, attempt to break the formation, and then proceed cautiously step by step.

But Zeng Jide, bold and skilled, had directly plunged into the formation within the City Lord's Mansion - the very residence of the Monarch himself.

Zeng Jide's cloudy old eyes scanned the surroundings, his lips curling slightly in disdain.

He extended his hand, making empty gestures in the air - pressing, tapping, or pointing. Spiritual light flickered at his fingertips, stirring spiritual winds in the air.

After three breaths, he lowered his hand.

"Safe," he declared, striding forward with broad steps.

Sun Lingtong instantly sighed in relief and began moving freely around the room.

He surveyed the surroundings and discovered it was a treasure storehouse. Shelves lined the walls, divided into compartments that held vast quantities of precious materials, each category neatly separated and displaying its own unique forms.

The more Sun Lingtong looked, the more puzzled he became. He realized he didn't recognize a single one of these precious materials.
