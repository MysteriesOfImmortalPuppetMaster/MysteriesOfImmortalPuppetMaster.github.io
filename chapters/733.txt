Chapter 733: "Virtue, My Ass!" - The Underworld Judge's Rampage

Sun Lingtong, having long mastered the Soul Search technique, was acutely aware of its limitations.

A standard Soul Search spell treated the subject's memories like a book, allowing the caster to search for specific lines of text within it.

But the Maple Boat Soul Crossing Technique was different.

This spell allowed the caster to convert the subject's memories into their own, effectively experiencing them firsthand.

While this had significant drawbacks, Ning Zhuo's Innate True Self Talent perfectly mitigated these issues.

"Zhuo, your greatest weakness is your age! You've had far too little time to cultivate," Sun Lingtong exclaimed.

"But with your Innate True Self Talent and the Burning Boat Soul Crossing Technique, you can absorb others' cultivation experiences as your own, completely overcoming your age disadvantage!"

"Each time you use this technique, you gain the equivalent of someone else's entire lifetime of experience! Imagine the terrifying potential!"

Sun Lingtong grew increasingly agitated, unable to contain his excitement as he grabbed Ning Zhuo by the shoulders.

Ning Zhuo, however, remained far calmer than his elder.

He slowly shook his head. "Even the Innate Talent "True Self" has its limits, no matter how powerful it seems. We just haven't discovered them yet."

Sun Lingtong burst into laughter, already envisioning the future. "Little Zhuo, your comprehension is extraordinary, and you're adept at synthesizing knowledge. Many things..."

"You've achieved all this through self-study. Now that you have such a shortcut to cultivation, your future progress will be terrifying!"

Ning Zhuo gazed at the Merit Guidance Tower in his hand. "The Burning Boat Soul Crossing Technique has five key points. I'm not worried about the others, but I fear the Red Lotus Karmic Fire clinging to me.

"The reason I went to the Demon Subjugation Hall was to control the accumulated sins within me.

"I just burned all the souls for Ash Bone Elder, and I previously burned part of Lady Spiderweb's soul. I need to see the true state of my merits and demerits."

Sun Lingtong stepped back, waiting for Ning Zhuo to act.

Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo channeled his spiritual energy into the tower. The Meritorious Pagoda blazed with light once more, but this time, Ning Zhuo was measuring himself.

The pagoda began to tremble violently. After a few breaths, it started to expand, golden light erupting from within like a geyser.

A pillar of golden light shot from the pagoda's crown, piercing the heavens. Had this occurred outside the Formation Space, it would have caused a massive uproar in the world.

On the jade blood altar's base, the faint blue-gold glow of the Cauldron's first-level fire nearly extinguished.

Meanwhile, on the second level, the Book of Merit and Demerit flipped through its pages with frantic speed. Golden characters appeared and vanished across the pages in rapid succession.

"How is this possible?" Ning Zhuo murmured, momentarily stunned. He then noticed the Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his divine sea activating again, exerting its influence on the Book of Merit and Demerit.

The Book of Merit and Demerit seemed caught in a violent storm, its pages flipping wildly without a single word settling.

Meanwhile, the Divine Statue on the third floor seemed to come to life, its gaze piercing through the pagoda's walls to fix on Ning Zhuo. A smile spread across its face as it intoned, "Good! Good! Good!"

The voice, emanating from within the statue's sleeve, expressed profound admiration for Ning Zhuo.

Sun Lingtong, who had been observing the scene, squinted against the blinding golden light. "Little Zhuo, you're a truly virtuous man! Not even a trace of sin?"

Though the Book of Merit and Demerit had been rendered ineffective, Ning Zhuo had already fused with the pagoda, granting him a clear understanding of the situation. "Strange... My merit is overwhelmingly vast, yet I have no sin whatsoever."

"What could be the explanation?"

For a moment, Ning Zhuo even suspected the pagoda's measurements were faulty.

Such a malfunction seemed almost impossible.

Even the most virtuous sages in the world must have committed some minor sins, right? After all, to err is human. Mistakes often accumulate as karmic debts, weighing down cultivators.

Sun Lingtong squinted, considering a possible explanation. "Perhaps your merit has offset your sins. Your virtue has canceled out your flaws."

Ning Zhuo had also considered this possibility: "It seems the Yangtian Merit we obtained is even more valuable than we initially thought."

Under normal circumstances, merit and demerit should not cancel each other out.

Just as Ning Zhuo had recently tested the soul pouches of numerous Qi Refining Stage Demonic Cultivators. Their sinful karma and merit were clearly recorded in the Book of Merit and Demerit, with each sin and merit listed separately. If they could be offset against each other, such coexistence would be impossible.

Yet Ning Zhuo possessed only merit, without a trace of sinful karma.

He turned to Sun Lingtong: "Big Brother, I suspect you're the same. Let me test you."

"Sure, sure," Sun Lingtong readily agreed.

He had participated in the war against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and played a crucial role in Forgetful River Immortal City.

Logically, he should also possess a share of Yang Merit, and a substantial amount at that!

Ning Zhuo acted swiftly, activating the Merit Guidance Tower and aiming it at Sun Lingtong.

The tower hummed, its body trembling, and once again erupted with golden Buddhist Light, though its intensity was noticeably weaker than when used on Ning Zhuo.

The Calamity Fire remained dormant. The Book of Merit and Demerit recorded every good deed Sun Lingtong had performed, from childhood to the present,

The battle at Forgetful River Prefecture was recorded.

"Hmph!" The Divine Statue on the third level suddenly glared fiercely.

Just moments before, it had been praising Sun Lingtong, but now it abruptly declared:

"Good, good, good... what hypocrisy!"

The Underworld Judge had erupted in fury!

This Divine Statue within Sleeve was an integral part of the Merit Guidance Tower. As such, it possessed a deep understanding of the Book of Merit and Demerit.

It was precisely through their collaborative efforts that the Merit Guidance Tower could wield its formidable power to discern truth, assess merit and demerit, and deliver righteous judgment.

The Underworld Judge had discovered the truth: the child cultivator before him was guilty of heinous crimes, utterly beyond redemption, and was an object of the Nether Heavens' loathing.

Whose side did the Underworld Judge stand on?

The Underworld Prefecture - of course, Sleeve sided with the Nether Heavens.

In the next instant, the Underworld Judge leaped from its divine throne, shattered the tower platform, and charged toward Sun Lingtong.

The battle had erupted with shocking suddenness!

Ning Zhuo had grown careless. Having just used the technique on himself without incident, he subconsciously assumed Sun Lingtong would be fine as well.

The Underworld Judge shattered the tower's structure, entered the Martial Arena Formation, and swelled to colossal size. Its beard and hair stretched to six meters, its massive frame exuding overwhelming power.

His imposing aura was overwhelming.

"Those despised by the Nether Heavens, whose crimes are unforgivable, shall suffer the punishment of having their tongues pulled out and used to plow the fields!"

The Underworld Judge Hongmu roared, his Divine Power stirring into a raging storm as he unleashed the Divine Art Profound Iron Sin Shackles.

Iron chains materialized around Sun Lingtong, poised to constrict and bind him securely. But Sun Lingtong vanished from his spot in an instant.

Technique: Void Piercing!

The Profound Iron Sin Shackles snapped shut on empty air.

The Underworld Judge tilted his head back and spat out a Ghost Pearl. The pearl emitted an eerie, cold light that blanketed a ten-zhang radius.

As soon as Sun Lingtong reappeared, the cold light struck him, slowing his movements tenfold.

The Profound Iron Sin Shackles reappeared, their iron pincers lunging straight for Sun Lingtong's collarbone.

Ning Zhuo's pupils constricted. He unleashed a pre-prepared spell: a golden light erupted to shield Sun Lingtong, blocking the shackles' grasp, while a fiery spell, like a living serpent, coiled around the shackles, burning them relentlessly.

After casting these two spells, Ning Zhuo turned to face the Underworld Judge. Forming hand seals in sync with body seals, he channeled a Wood Element Spell.

Vines erupted from beneath the Judge's feet, ensnaring his ankles and coiling upward to bind his legs.

Five Viscera Spirit God Art!

Innate Technique: Five Elements Creation and Destruction Art!

The combined power of the two allowed Ning Zhuo to cast any Five Elements Spell with both speed and precision.

The Underworld Judge, thwarted in his efforts, glared at Ning Zhuo and declared, "Aiding criminals makes you an accomplice! You will face severe punishment!"

With a flick of his left palm, a treasure mirror materialized from his heart center. The mirror emitted a gray-white beam of light that swept toward Ning Zhuo.

Prepared for this, Ning Zhuo immediately dodged.

The withered beam of light veered toward Sun Lingtong.

Suppressed by the Ghost Pearl, Sun Lingtong retreated hastily, but the beam struck his left shoulder. The protective spell Ning Zhuo had cast was pierced, and the flesh on Sun Lingtong's left shoulder instantly melted away, exposing bare bone.

Ning Zhuo's brow furrowed deeply. He slapped his Storage Belt, releasing a massive swarm of mechanical constructs.

Mechanical Fire Serpents slithered across the ground, while Mechanical Thunder Farmer Birds soared through the air, crackling with electricity as they rained down like a storm of arrows.

A cold smile still lingered on the Underworld Judge's lips. "Two Foundation Establishment juniors struggling in vain!"

The mirror floating above his palm spun rapidly, its beam sweeping across the battlefield. Wherever the light touched, whether Mechanical Fire Serpents or Thunder Farmer Birds, they melted like wax in boiling water, hissing and disintegrating under the beam's intense heat. Countless constructs collapsed and scattered on the ground.

Ning Zhuo's expression remained cold and resolute as he relentlessly deployed mechanical constructs.

For every loss he sustained, he immediately released another.

After such a prolonged battle, the number of ordinary Mechanisms he had accumulated had long since reached a substantial reserve, perfectly suited for this war of attrition.

The Underworld Judge swept the battlefield with his mirror's light, achieving considerable results, but as he witnessed the endless stream of mechanical constructs emerging, his expression finally shifted.

The Underworld Judge wasn't fighting with his True Form; rather, after sensing the anomaly within Sun Lingtong, he had temporarily inhabited the Divine Statue, expending vast amounts of Divine Power to use it as an avatar.

The Divine Power he consumed far exceeded what his actions conveyed. After all, his True Form remained in the Underworld Prefecture while this battle unfolded in the Living Realm.

Therefore, he needed to secure a swift victory.

The Underworld Judge lightly stroked his official robes, his gaze lingering on the intricate embroidery of countless ghostly creatures adorning the fabric. In the next instant, these ghostly creatures sprang to life, leaping from the robes and swarming toward Sun Lingtong.

Though the number of ghostly creatures still couldn't match Ning Zhuo's mechanical swarm, each possessed the combat prowess of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Like a series of heavy blows, they shattered the layers of obstacles before them and encircled Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong, wielding his saber, darted nimbly through the sea of ghostly creatures, his movements fluid and agile.

His swordsmanship was razor-sharp, allowing him to swiftly dispatch several Foundation Establishment ghosts while maintaining impeccable self-defense.

The Underworld Judge's expression darkened further. "If not for being in the Living Realm and this body... even my ghost techniques would be far more effective."

Suddenly sensing something, the Underworld Judge whipped around, his razor-sharp gaze locking onto Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo had already retreated far away, his left palm supporting the Meritorious Pagoda as he activated its power.

The Underworld Judge's Divine Statue had been housed within the pagoda's third level since the beginning, making it an integral part of this Combined Magic Treasure. Naturally, it was now subject to Ning Zhuo's influence.

Forced to counteract Ning Zhuo, the Underworld Judge poured more Divine Power into the statue. Inevitably, his Qi and combat strength began to plummet rapidly.

Taking a deep breath, the Underworld Judge retrieved his Judge's Brush. Consuming vast amounts of Divine Power, he unleashed a Divine Art, conjuring massive tombstones that rained down from the Void.

Each tombstone was as large as a horse, their impact shaking the entire Martial Arena Formation. The formation groaned under the strain, and countless formation patterns shattered.

"Not good," Ning Zhuo thought. As the temporary master of the Azure Stone Cave Mansion, he knew the Martial Arena Formation was designed to withstand battles up to the Foundation Establishment level without issue.

However, despite the Underworld Judge's weakened state, his combat strength still stemmed from a Golden Core foundation. Prolonged combat was inevitably causing the formation to deteriorate rapidly.

Ning Zhuo transmitted a command through divine sense, ordering his forces to attack.

In the next moment, a female-shaped mechanical construct materialized on the battlefield.

She wore an Ice Mirror Pot helmet and Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor, its plates resembling interlocking hexagonal honeycomb tiles. Bestial shoulder guards, shaped like snarling ice ants, flanked her shoulders, while her eyes glowed with Aurora Glazed Glass. Six mechanical Spheres constantly orbited her, hovering nearby.

The Underworld Judge's expression shifted again as he sensed the unmistakable Golden Core Grade spiritual energy emanating from Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.

"Execute the Clan Leader's Battle Order!" Snow-Colored Maiden Hui commanded, launching her six mechanical Spheres. They streaked forward like lightning, spewing frost-white streams of frigid air that plummeted the temperature within the formation space.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui extended her twin whips, striking simultaneously. Vast snowflakes materialized from the void, and under her control, the chilling aura froze the barrier walls, tombstone, and ghostly creatures alike.

Even ice crystals began to form on the Underworld Judge's robes, spreading with relentless tenacity.

A flicker of alarm crossed the Judge's usually impassive face. He immediately redirected the mirror's beam toward Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui made no attempt to evade. The Aurora Glazed Glass in his ice ant shoulder guards suddenly blazed to life, firing two beams of icy light that converged mid-air into a single, devastating strike that collided violently with the mirror's beam.

The two beams of light collided mid-air, crackling violently as they clashed, locked in a brief stalemate.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui lowered her outstretched hands, palms facing upward, and thrust them forward from below.

Whoosh!

In an instant, a frigid wind surged, whipping up a blizzard of fine, powdery snow. The miniature storm engulfed the battlefield, completely obscuring the Underworld Judge's figure.

When the blizzard subsided, an eerie silence descended upon the battlefield.

The ghost creatures, rows of tombstones, and Profound Iron Sin Lock all vanished without a sound.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui flicked her wrist, dispersing the ice and snow to reveal the Underworld Judge and Sun Lingtong, who had been concealed behind her sleeve.

Sun Lingtong's saber emitted a blue blade of light, piercing the Underworld Judge through the back.

The Underworld Judge's face froze in a mask of hatred before his Divine Power slowly dissipated, revealing the wooden core of the Divine Statue beneath.

Moments later, the dilapidated Divine Statue stood fully exposed.

The Underworld Judge had been defeated.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong exchanged wordless glances.

The Meritorious Pagoda, newly acquired, had been damaged after only a brief use. It could only be restored by filling it with a new Divine Statue and inviting...

The Divine Statue must be successfully repaired before we can use it again.

But that's not the main issue.

Sun Lingtong, panting heavily as he treated his shoulder wound, said, "Gods and the heavens are one. It seems we're truly unwelcome in the Underworld."

"We already used the Merit Accumulation Sutra on the Ash Bone Elder earlier."

"If we hadn't done that, this battle would have been even more difficult."

Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with sharp insight as he analyzed the situation inwardly. "When I measured myself earlier, the Buddha-Heart Demon Seal activated passively, suppressing the Book of Merit and Karma, which is why I wasn't detected."

"It was only after measuring Big Brother Lingtong that we angered the Underworld Judge, causing him to go berserk."

"Ah, this is the downside of Combined Magic Treasures forged using the Harmonious Vessel Technique. Their control is far inferior to conventional magic treasures, and they might even rebel against their master or backfire."

"We've suffered a setback this time! I still wasn't cautious enough. If only I had taken more precautions earlier..."

Sun Lingtong suddenly let out a soft exclamation. "Little Zhuo, look! There's something strange about this Divine Statue. It seems to be emitting a divine radiance..."
