Chapter 760: Ning Zhuo Discusses the New Formation

Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on the ground, slowly closing his eyes.

The cultivators of Profound Armor Cave watched this scene with puzzled expressions.

Ning Zhuo had emerged unscathed from the recent battle. He hadn't practiced with his newly acquired bronze spear, so shouldn't he be seizing this moment to fight and secure the sixth Profound Armament Armor?

The more Profound Armament Armor a cultivator possessed, the greater their advantage in the third trial would undoubtedly be.

Though the cultivators didn't understand, they refrained from voicing their doubts.

Ning Zhuo had initially lagged behind while learning and practicing, but he had steadily caught up, securing his advancement with unwavering resolve. This had made everyone realize his extraordinary nature, and they dared not offer hasty judgments.

While the other cultivators couldn't perceive the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Art, Ning Zhuo was using it to maintain close communication with Sun Lingtong, who was far away at the Jade Cleansing Pavilion.

"Boss, this shield is amazing! I'm going to keep it close and use it for constant protection," Ning Zhuo suggested.

Sun Lingtong replied, "Exactly. With the fifth spear already capable of 'winning without using any moves,' you'd be vulnerable without proper defense."

"Besides, it suits your temperament - steady and cautious."

"The battle formation we designed is tailored for you, so it naturally aligns with your personality."

Ning Zhuo added, "Defense should be our primary focus, with offense as secondary. The remaining Profound Armament Armor will be used to launch attacks."

Sun Lingtong pondered for a moment. "Then what weapons should we prioritize?"

Ning Zhuo considered briefly before replying, "Swords and blades should be our main weapons. Firstly, they're the most common type. In the third trial, I might be able to seize swords and blades from others as replacements. Secondly, we previously devised three combined sword and blade techniques that can be fully integrated into the battle formation, allowing us to retain these trump cards."

Sun Lingtong nodded. "Makes sense!"

The two quickly finalized their design goals: to establish Ning Zhuo's True Form shield defense as the formation's foundation, with the remaining Profound Armament Armor serving as the Formation Core, prioritizing offense while maintaining secondary defensive capabilities.

The design process was now clear:

1. Design the formation's foundation. 

2. Design the Formation Core. 

3. Integrate and optimize the entire formation.

Sun Lingtong: "Little Zhuo, stand up and demonstrate the shield techniques."

Ning Zhuo promptly opened his eyes, gripped the shield, and executed the techniques in place.

The shield was his fourth Profound Armament Armor, possessing basic maneuvers, combo attacks, and routines. It could also adapt to momentum and leverage external forces, demonstrating considerable agility.

"Ning Zhuo has indeed resumed his practice."

"At this point, he's likely certain he's already advanced to the third stage. So, there's no need to rush."

"So, he really was just resting earlier..."

Just as the cultivators finished discussing, they saw Ning Zhuo sit down cross-legged again, closing his eyes to meditate.

"Uh..."

"Just one practice run?"

"Why practice with the shield? The bronze spear is his newest Profound Armament Armor!"

The cultivators were starting to find Ning Zhuo incomprehensible.

Sun Lingtong's comprehension surpassed Ning Zhuo's, his memory was exceptional, and his foundation in the Martial Dao Realm was far deeper. For him, a single observation was sufficient.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong continued their discussions, aided by the Luoshu. Every calculation they made was swift, accurate, and efficient, greatly accelerating their progress.

Within the time it takes to brew half a cup of tea, the duo had designed thirty percent of the battle formation, completing the foundational framework.

They then began designing the Formation Core.

Dynamic Formations were typically used in large-scale battles. In military formations, the Formation Core was often led by a general.

Therefore, the loss of a general could severely cripple a Dynamic Formation. If the sole commander fell, it could devastate the entire army's combat effectiveness.

Despite this significant drawback, the heavy responsibility of activating the Dynamic Formation Core still fell upon the shoulders of the commanding general. Because Dynamic Formations were mobile, the requirements for their Formation Cores were far more demanding than those of static formations.

When Sun and Ning designed their formation, they chose Profound Armament Armor as the Formation Core.

Profound Armament Armor were no ordinary weapons. Their unique forging methods and rare materials imbued them with martial principles, even allowing them to react autonomously to enemies.

Using them as the Dynamic Formation Core turned out to be surprisingly fitting.

Having already decided on swords and sabers as the primary weapons, Ning Zhuo used his divine sense to manipulate the blades, rehearsing their movements in mid-air around him.

Next came the long spear and gauntlets.

Soon, the Bronze Artifacts were swirling around Ning Zhuo, sometimes the swords and sabers coalescing into a single mass, other times the spear leading with the saber trailing behind, or the gauntlets flanking him on either side.

The four pieces of Profound Armament Armor constantly adjusted their positions, occasionally executing fragmented maneuvers in a disjointed rehearsal.

The cultivators watched with growing bewilderment.

"What exactly is Ning Zhuo up to?"

"He... seems to be deep in thought."

"Could he be designing a battle formation?"

A wave of shock rippled through the crowd.

"Is he trying to design a battle formation on the fly, or a Dynamic Formation?"

"How deep is his mastery of Formation Dao to give him such confidence?"

"It looks like he's aiming for a Dynamic Formation. That requires not only expertise in Formation Dao but also knowledge of Military Strategist principles."

Had anyone else attempted this, the cultivators would have scoffed in derision.

But after Ning Zhuo's earlier performance had thoroughly humiliated them, they wisely kept their mouths shut, observing his actions with rapt attention.

Sun Lingtong and his partner had already devised six strategies, but none satisfied them.

With time running out, Ning Zhuo was about to choose one when Sun Lingtong suddenly exclaimed, "Wait, wait! I've got an idea!" He seized the inspiration that had flashed through his divine sea. "Yes! Rotation! We alternate attacks. A sword strike follows immediately after a saber slash, and before the sword's momentum fades, the saber rises again!"

His expression grew increasingly animated as he spoke faster, his right hand instinctively gesturing in the air.

Ning Zhuo listened patiently, a glint of understanding sparking in his eyes. "Excellent idea! Boss, did you expand this from the Parting Waters, Teasing the Moon Stance?"

Sun Lingtong laughed heartily. "Little brother, you know me too well."

The Parting Waters, Teasing the Moon Stance was one of three combined sword and blade techniques they had previously created together. Its core principle was to leverage feedback to propel the blade and sword, creating a relentless, continuous assault.

With this design completed, the Dynamic Formation was now eighty percent finished.

The remaining twenty percent involved refinement, repairs, and improvements.

Ning Zhuo rose again, shield in hand, using himself as the formation's foundation. The four Profound Armament Armor pieces hovered around him, orbiting his body.

Suddenly, the weapons began to spin rapidly. A blade slashed, followed immediately by a sword strike. A spear swept horizontally, seamlessly transitioning to a gauntlet strike.

At first, there were some stumbles. After all, this was Ning Zhuo's first time practicing the formation.

But after a dozen breaths, the weapons moved with fluid precision.

Cultivator Hao's pupils constricted sharply as he witnessed this. "A battle formation! Ning Zhuo actually pulled it off! He improvised on the spot, designing a Dynamic Formation specifically tailored to the existing Profound Armament Armor."

The surrounding cultivators erupted into murmurs.

"Is this what genius looks like?"

"This is beyond absurd!"

"I don't know much about Dynamic Formations. Can someone evaluate it? What if it's just for show...?"

The cultivators instinctively turned to one of their own.

This cultivator, who also cultivated Dynamic Formations, stared with his mouth agape, his face filled with astonishment.

Seeing his expression, the others immediately understood the truth.

When they looked at Ning Zhuo again, their expressions were far more complex.

Such an achievement was completely beyond their individual capabilities. Yet this young man had accomplished it with apparent ease.

Comparison is the thief of joy.

Ning Zhuo, however, showed no hint of self-satisfaction.

As he continued to practice, he discussed with Sun Lingtong, "Offensive and defensive rotations, core stability, variable deployment, alternating attacks... How about calling it the Guarding Simplicity Wheel-Slaying Formation?"

Sun Lingtong shrugged. "Whatever you like, Little Zhuo."

Ning Zhuo sighed. "It's a pity neither of us are skilled Military Strategists, and my formation techniques are only at the artisan level."

Sun Lingtong laughed heartily. "What's the rush, kiddo? You're at the Myriad Manifestations Sect now! The Rising Cloud Minor Trials are perfect opportunities to advance in all realms!"

Sun Lingtong held Ning Zhuo in high regard.

This was the golden age of Cultivation, where countless methods, thousands of schools, and hundreds of arts flourished!

Broadly speaking, their realms could all be measured by the same standard: Apprentice, Artisan, Renowned Master, Master, Grandmaster...

Apprentices focused on learning fundamental theories, familiarizing themselves with basic materials, tools, runes, techniques, and more. This was the foundation-building stage, where they often knew what to do but not why.

Upon reaching the Artisan realm, cultivators could independently execute standard processes, master core techniques, and gain a preliminary understanding of underlying principles, achieving proficiency through practice.

Renowned Masters could tackle complex problems, optimize processes, and demonstrate a deeper understanding of principles, consistently producing high-grade standard components. Their unique craftsmanship often left a personal stylistic imprint on their work.

Ning Zhuo had laid a solid foundation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, achieving Artisan status in all Four Arts of Cultivation. However, he rarely displayed his skills publicly, even within the Ning Clan's academy.

Beyond this, Ning Zhuo's primary focus was the Mechanical Art, where he had already reached the Renowned Master realm. His original creations - the Blazing Monkey, Shadow Blade Night Tiger, Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom, and Snow Pivot Guard - Rest - served as irrefutable proof. Each of these mechanisms bore his unique craftsmanship and ingenious design.

However, his highest achievement lay in the Five Elements Realm, where he had attained at least the Grandmaster level. Below Grandmaster came Master, and only below Master was Renowned Master.

While the Master realm transcended superficial craftsmanship, the Grandmaster realm allowed one to establish their own sect. Every Five Elements Spell Ning Zhuo had created in battle possessed the potential to form the foundation of a new sect.

The Five Elements Realm was Ning Zhuo's greatest opportunity. Even without it, his mastery of the Mechanical Arts and the Four Arts of Cultivation would have been considered extraordinary and exceptional.

This was the culmination of his years of patient endurance, relentless study, and unwavering practice, never daring to slacken his efforts for even a moment.

In the Martial Dao Realm, Ning Zhuo had long remained at the apprentice level. After his travels across the land, he finally addressed this deficiency. Having experienced the battlefield firsthand, he had now reached the Martial Artisan level.

Ning Zhuo had yet to achieve the state of "no technique surpassing technique," nor had he attained the Renowned Master realm in martial arts.

Yet, considering the remarkably short time he had invested and the astonishingly meager resources he had expended, his progress was nothing short of miraculous.

The combination of the Burning Boat Soul Crossing Technique and his Innate Talent would propel Ning Zhuo's cultivation across multiple realms. Given enough time, his strength would inevitably surge dramatically.

Learning through practice wasn't unique to Ning Zhuo's approach in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial; it was a common strategy in other trials as well.

Ning Zhuo deliberately revealed his exceptional comprehension and terrifying learning ability to the public. This was both his official explanation and a carefully constructed facade.

While Sun Ning and the others practiced and refined their techniques, the Rust Disaster Craftsman clashed with his sixth Profound Armament Armor, reaching a critical moment.

The battle halberd crashed down with brutal force!

Clang!

The Bronze Artifact used by the Rust Disaster Craftsman to parry shattered into two pieces with a deafening clang.

The Rust Disaster Craftsman barely managed to twist aside, his rust-covered cast-iron robes billowing open to reveal his arm.

Clang!

The metallic clang of impact rang out as the halberd's blade nearly severed the Rust Disaster Craftsman's hastily raised arm.

The Rust Disaster Craftsman's arm gleamed with a metallic sheen, revealing it to be a mechanical construct.

The halberd's blade vibrated, wedged in the arm, struggling to withdraw.

The Rust Disaster Craftsman was already battered and exhausted.

He sensed this might be his last chance and decisively poured all his remaining strength into a final, desperate strike.

Innate Talent - Golden Fiend!

The Golden Fiend energy he had painstakingly accumulated within his body erupted without restraint, surging into the battle halberd.

The battle halberd, which had been radiating a brilliant glow, instantly dimmed under the assault, its surface becoming encrusted with a thick layer of rust.

The Golden Fiend energy rapidly permeated the halberd, corroding its internal structure.

The battle halberd, now mottled with rust and its Qi plummeting, was finally refined by the Rust Disaster Craftsman.

The Rust Disaster Craftsman knelt on the ground, utterly exhausted, leaving the halberd embedded in his arm.

He had paid a terrible price, his life force nearly extinguished.

The cultivators of Profound Armor Cave remained silent for a moment before murmuring among themselves.

"Alas, he still managed to win."

"The intelligence was accurate. His Innate Talent is indeed the Golden Fiend, granting him overwhelming dominance over Metal Element artifacts."

"He's an Automaton after all. I think I understand why he approached Ban Ji now."

By this point, despite the Rust Disaster Craftsman's attempts at concealment, his true nature had been almost completely exposed.

The Rust Disaster Craftsman's desperate counterattack had secured his sixth Bronze Artifact, but only through extreme peril.

Ban Ji remained locked in a stalemate.

He gasped like a bull, each breath searing his lungs as if they were being burned.

The nunchaku in his hands had snapped in two, and only a few throwing knives remained. All five Profound Armament Armor pieces were severely damaged.

But compared to these, Ban Ji's arm bones were already fractured, and blood seeped from his tiger's mouth.

Yet the Bronze Artifact he sought to capture remained as vigorous as a dragon, its relentless attacks pressing down on him in waves, leaving him gasping for breath.

Sweat mingled with blood streamed into his eyes, blurring his vision. He could only parry instinctively with his Profound Armament Armor, his bones and muscles screaming in agony, his internal organs churning. Each step backward brought him closer to the brink of defeat.

"Why is the sixth Profound Armament Armor so strong?"

"This doesn't match the intelligence reports!"

"I must endure... I must hold on..."

Zhang Wangxing shared Ban Ji's desperate cries.

Hunted relentlessly by the sixth Profound Armament Armor, Zhang Wangxing darted across the battlefield like a cornered rat. His ability to drastically alter his flesh and form provided him with the foundation for daring evasions.

Even so, he left a trail of blood in his wake, too terrified to turn and fight, fleeing with his head buried in his arms, desperate to escape with his life.

Ning Zhuo glanced at his own sixth Profound Armament Armor.

It was a fan.

The fan struck, only to be deflected by Ning Zhuo's shield. It unfurled mid-air and unleashed a vicious sweep.

Instantly, several razor-sharp wind blades slashed toward him.

Ning Zhuo crouched behind his shield.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Every strike was blocked!
