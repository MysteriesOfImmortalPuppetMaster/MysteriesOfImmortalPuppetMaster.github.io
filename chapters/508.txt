Chapter 508: So-called "Fairness"

According to the military order issued by Du Tiechuan, even if the Red Flower Camp bought out their entire quota, the heavy armor they obtained would not be enough to cover all the soldiers in the camp.

As the grand battle approached, all the armies had been expanding their ranks and conducting frequent military training in recent days.

This plunged Ning Zhuo into a dilemma.

Should he choose Mulan or Liu Er?

The more Ning Zhuo thought about it, the harder it became to decide.

Both were Golden Core-level cultivators.

In terms of combat power, Mulan was clearly superior.

Once she unleashed her divine ability, the Red Heart Swan Arrow, paired with her weapons, the Red Phoenix Bow and the Fierce Heart Arrow, her combat power would skyrocket to an exaggerated level—reaching the peak of Nascent Soul!

As for Liu Er's combat power, it was also considerable, placing him at the top tier among Golden Core-level cultivators.

In terms of status, Mulan was the sole heir of the Mu Grand Marshal's Mansion in the Twin Rivers Kingdom, firmly positioned within the upper echelons of the kingdom. However, the entire Mu Grand Marshal's Mansion was in a precarious situation, coveted by the court. Even the king of the Twin Rivers Kingdom had attempted to abolish it.

Liu Er also had status, and an even more impressive background —he was a royal relative of the Blood Slaughter Empire. However, while this status would have placed him at the pinnacle of power in the Blood Slaughter Empire, in the current era, it was no longer advantageous and was merely a title.

In fact, Liu Er's mixed human-demon heritage was not well-received by the mainstream cultivation world.

In terms of financial resources:

Mulan was poor, and Liu Er was even poorer.

In terms of connections:

Despite the precarious situation of Mulan and the Mu Grand Marshal's Mansion, they still had some influence within the Twin Rivers Kingdom's court.

Liu Er was weak in this aspect, but from the Yin-Yang Qi Pot, Ning Zhuo could vaguely sense that Liu Er's background was not as simple as it appeared on the surface.

Mulan and Ning Zhuo were in a marital relationship, but it was essentially an alliance of interests.

The alliance of interests between Liu Er and Ning Zhuo was actually closer and more solid than that between Mulan and Ning Zhuo. This was because Ning Zhuo had started investing in the Three Generals Camp (Liu, Guan, and Zhang) a long time ago.

Up to now, Ning Zhuo remained the largest financial backer of the Three Generals Camp!

For a moment, Ning Zhuo fell silent, unconsciously fiddling with the mechanical ring on his finger.

Unfortunately, since this situation did not involve his personal safety, the mechanical ring remained motionless, showing no reaction.

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly and said, "Generals, I have a somewhat immature idea."

"Have you two ever thought about... merging into a single army?"

Ning Zhuo glanced at Mulan, then at Liu Er: "Our heavy armor is limited and can only cover a little over half of the soldiers."

"In this situation, the Three Generals Camp could remove some soldiers and merge them into the Red Flower Camp."

"After this great battle is over, we can separate and rebuild the formations. That would be acceptable."

Mulan's eyes lit up: "This is a pretty good idea."

"Under normal circumstances, my Red Flower Camp would never accept so many outsiders. Mainly because the Red Flower Battle Formation requires experienced soldiers who have undergone years of training."

"For us, it's not a case of the more soldiers, the better."

"But this grand battle is about implementing Marshal Du's military strategy, the Iron Flow Plains. Therefore, the Red Flower Battle Formation cannot be formed, and we might even win in a single battle. So, adding many outsiders is acceptable."

On the other hand, Liu Er looked troubled: "General Mulan, Military Advisor, please allow me to go back and think about it."

Mulan snorted coldly: "Then you'd better decide quickly."

She no longer looked at Liu Er but turned her gaze to Ning Zhuo: "Husband, let's not talk about anything else for now. Let's go to the quartermaster together and buy our full quota."

Ning Zhuo clasped his hands and smiled wryly: "General Mulan, it's better to just call me by my name or my military title. Our relationship was a twist of fate and shouldn't be taken too seriously."

Mulan waved her hand: "I am the daughter of a military family and have never cared about trivial matters like status."

"In the face of war and life, what does mere reputation matter?"

"Life and death are the real issues!"

"Let's hurry."

Mulan kept urging Ning Zhuo, who had no choice but to apologize to Liu Er and leave with Mulan.

Liu Er, with a displeased expression, walked back to the Three Generals Camp with a heavy heart.

"I bear a royal mission and have been determined since childhood to establish a kingdom for demon cultivators."

"My master advised me to maintain an independent status."

"If I cannot lead my own army, it will be difficult for me to claim credit. After all, I am just a half-blood."

"Sigh, Master, where are you? What should I do?"

Liu Er estimated that the best-case scenario would be for Ning Zhuo to favor the Three Generals Camp and allocate all the heavy armor to them.

But after putting himself in Ning Zhuo's shoes, Liu Er felt that this possibility was extremely slim.

"Ning Zhuo and Mulan are, after all, in a marital relationship. Moreover, Mulan's status is noble, and her background is far superior to mine."

"Although Ning Zhuo is young and passionate, he comes from a prominent family and is skilled at weighing pros and cons."

"If he ultimately chooses to favor the Red Flower Camp, I wouldn't be surprised and would completely understand."

"What should I do?"

Ning Zhuo had invested too much in the Three Generals Camp, and Liu Er now realized that he had no right to persuade Ning Zhuo.

Liu Er then thought of the Yin-Yang Qi Kettle.

"If I offer this item as a gift, would it make Ning Zhuo more inclined to favor us?"

He shook his head with a bitter smile.

As he approached the gates of the Three Generals Camp, Liu Er came up with a new idea.

He thought of someone.

"Perhaps I can seek his help?"

White Jade Camp.

Shuang Jing stood in front of the commander's tent, smiling as he welcomed Ning Zhuo.

"Little friend Ning Zhuo, please come in," Shuang Jing gestured.

Ning Zhuo immediately bowed, expressing that he was overwhelmed by Shuang Jing's gracious treatment.

Although he had once vehemently rejected Shuang Jing's recruitment offer, after the Mulan incident, he had hosted a banquet for all parties involved and, through his own efforts, greatly improved his relationships with everyone.

This included his relationship with Shuang Jing.

Shuang Jing looked at the young man in white before him, marveling at Ning Zhuo's extraordinary fortune. In the past, he would never have imagined that this sixteen-year-old Foundation Establishment cultivator would become Mulan's husband and the son-in-law of the Mu Grand Marshal's Mansion!

The reason he stood at the entrance of the tent to welcome Ning Zhuo was not because of Ning Zhuo himself, but because of his status as a member of the Mu Grand Marshal's Mansion.

Ning Zhuo was led into the tent and quickly explained his purpose.

It turned out that although the White Jade Camp had a quota for heavy armor, they had not used any of it.

This was not because the White Jade Camp lacked the funds to purchase it, but because they were so wealthy and well-equipped that they already had superior heavy armor, making external purchases unnecessary.

After the ambush battle, the White Jade Camp suffered heavy casualties and lost most of their military supplies due to the Old Stone Monster's plundering.

But after returning to Green Forest Immortal City for reorganization, Shuang Jing began a massive reconstruction of the White Jade Camp.

His financial resources were not as abundant as before, but his backing forces were all stepping up, providing new support in terms of funds and personnel.

His aunt, Shuang Ling, was a prominent Nascent Soul-level figure within the Twin Rivers Kingdom's royal family, possessing substantial wealth and greater ability to leverage family and allied resources.

Shuang Ling's arrival brought a huge investment to the White Jade Camp.

The Three Generals Camp, Red Flower Camp, Barbarian Demon Camp, and Golden Halberd Army had all, under new military orders, advanced into the Thousand Peaks Forest.

While they fought their way through, the White Jade Camp had been resting and training vigorously in Mulan Town, growing stronger by the day.

Hearing Ning Zhuo's request, Shuang Jing took a sip of tea, neither immediately agreeing nor refusing.

He was pondering what conditions to propose.

At that moment, the general's seal in his pocket trembled slightly, conveying a piece of new intelligence to him.

"Oh? Liu Er is also coming to visit me?"

"How interesting..."

Shuang Jing glanced at Ning Zhuo and suddenly came up with a plan.

He smiled and said to Ning Zhuo, "Little friend Ning Zhuo, please wait in the inner room for a moment. I have another guest to attend to."

Although Ning Zhuo and Liu Er were closely connected, Shuang Jing did not inform Ning Zhuo of the visitor's identity.

Ning Zhuo smiled and immediately stood up: "The guest follows the host's arrangements."

He then followed Shuang Jing's guidance and sat down in the inner room.

Shuang Jing pointed to a nearby bookshelf: "I have some leisure books here. Little friend Ning Zhuo, feel free to read them to pass the time. I'll quickly deal with the visitor, and then we can continue our discussion."

Liu Er followed a Golden Core-level deputy general through the White Jade Camp.

Tall white jade walls surrounded the camp. The barricades were carved from white jade, covered with layers of talismans.

The watchtowers were well-constructed, towering and upright, with spacious tops, each equipped with mechanical crossbows.

The flagpoles flew the White Jade Army's banners. The dragon patterns embroidered with silver threads had glowing eyes, as if they could take flight at any moment.

The soldiers trained in the wide training grounds, each riding a goat, galloping and leaping around.

This made Liu Er particularly envious, as the Three Generals Camp had not yet been equipped with mounts.

Compared to the White Jade Camp, the Three Generals Camp, despite receiving Ning Zhuo's support, still appeared shabby and poor.

Liu Er stood in front of the commander's tent and loudly requested an audience.

Hearing the familiar voice from the inner room, Ning Zhuo was about to stand up.

Shuang Jing immediately activated the tent's power, confining Ning Zhuo to the inner room. Although Ning Zhuo could move freely within the room, no sound could escape.

Shuang Jing smiled faintly, leisurely sipped his tea, and then said, "Enter."

Liu Er bowed his head, slightly lifted a corner of the tent flap, and then, with a respectful expression, stooped and entered the tent.

The tent was filled with the scent of incense, creating a serene atmosphere.

Shuang Jing sat with a dignified air, his deep eyes exuding a noble arrogance in every movement.

"Liu Er, what brings you here?" Shuang Jing asked directly, his tone flat. He did not invite Liu Er to sit, and his attitude was not particularly courteous.

Liu Er clasped his hands and saluted: "Lord Shuang Jing, I have come to request some of the heavy armor quota you possess."

"During the ambush battle, my Three Generals Camp helped the Red Flower Camp break free from Ma Feitui's entanglement. The Red Flower Camp then came to aid your army, so my Three Generals Camp indirectly contributed."

"Please consider this and accommodate us."

Shuang Jing remained silent for a long time.

Liu Er felt disappointed and puzzled, so he slowly raised his head, only to see Shuang Jing leisurely drinking tea, calmly watching him. His sculpted face was full of arrogance and aloofness, his gaze carrying a heavy sense of condescension.

"Liu Er."

Shuang Jing spoke: "You seem to have underestimated the difficulty of this matter."

"Indeed, I could use my quota to purchase heavy armor from the quartermaster and then transfer it to you."

"But this is not actually what Marshal Du wants to see."

Liu Er was slightly stunned.

Shuang Jing continued: "Marshal Du appears fair and just, but he has his own plans."

"Do you think the heavy armor quota was simply allocated evenly by the quartermaster based on the number of heavy armors available?"

"Haha, don't be naive."

"This is all Marshal Du's deliberate arrangement!"

"He intentionally made the heavy armor quota less than the total number needed by your armies, to induce you to merge and reduce your numbers."

"Ultimately, through the Iron Flow Plains standard, he will eliminate the unqualified armies."

"The eliminated armies will no longer share in the military achievements and will save a lot of military supplies."

"Do you know how much he has invested in building the parade ground this time?"

Shuang Jing held up three fingers: "A conservative estimate is at least three million high-grade spirit stones!"

"So, he wants to sell the heavy armor at a high price."

"And he wants to eliminate a large number of your personnel, streamlining the entire army."

"After this grand battle, the remaining allied armies will almost certainly be those enhanced by the Iron Flow Plains strategy. Thus, they will all owe him a debt of gratitude, admire him, and even pledge loyalty to him."

"This is Marshal Du's method. Even if you know about it, you are forced to comply."

"So, while it seems like I'm doing you a small favor, in reality, I'm disrupting Marshal Du's plans."

"The intangible cost I would have to pay is much greater than you imagine, perhaps even immeasurable. Do you understand?"

Liu Er was stunned, frozen in place, momentarily speechless.

The Twin Rivers Kingdom was short on military forces, and the main armies were all needed to defend their respective fronts. Moving one would affect the whole, so the king of the Twin Rivers Kingdom had not mobilized them.

This time, he had recruited from various sources, even issuing a decree to recruit talented individuals, gathering many new armies.

Hadn't Liu, Guan, and Zhang formed the Three Generals Camp through this decree, with their own funds?

Even Shuang Jing, a noble, was not originally from the military. This time, he and his family had seized the opportunity to fund and form an army to participate in this great campaign.

This meant that the army led by Marshal Du Tiechuan was mostly composed of new forces, each with its own background and origins.

Except for the vanguard.

The vanguard was a regular army of the Twin Rivers Kingdom, but unfortunately, it was currently enveloped in poisonous miasma, and its situation was unclear.

Marshal Du Tiechuan was indeed one of the top generals. After Princess Shuang Ling's Mountain-Treading Wheel mechanism plan failed, he immediately switched to a second plan.

The grand strategy of Iron Flow Plains, before dealing with the enemy in the Thousand Peaks Forest, first internally consolidated and unified the forces, bringing everyone closer together under Du Tiechuan's command!

Shuang Jing tapped the table with his finger, admiringly saying, "It must be said, Marshal Du's methods are quite brilliant."

"While ostensibly eliminating dissent, he does so in such a grand manner that no one can find fault."

"Moreover, he employs both soft and hard tactics, not relying solely on force."

"Do you think the so-called Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique was released by his deputy alone?"

Shuang Jing sneered: "This must have been authorized by Du Tiechuan himself!"

Gentlemen, Happy New Year!!! Looking back at 2024, there were ups and downs, but also gains. Stumbling along, somewhat clueless, I am grateful for everyone's support and trust. There are so many new things to adapt to. I believe that in 2025, we will all become better!
