Chapter 656: Scholar Meets Soldier

Dark clouds swirled all around, but Ning Zhuo continued to grope his way through the gloom.

He had long since flown past the first marked pivot point. Spiraling outward from that center, his flight path traced a three-dimensional spiral that took him up and down as well as around, moving swiftly through the black clouds.

His divine sense spread outward in all directions while simultaneously monitoring the subtle changes in the snow-white glow within his pouch.

A moment later, the Literary Qi within the pouch trembled faintly, like a gentle heartbeat. Simultaneously, the shape of the halo cast by the snow-white glow underwent an imperceptible shift.

Ning Zhuo's heart stirred, and he immediately altered his course.

Having succeeded once, his movements became even swifter and more purposeful.

Moreover, the Literary Qi and snow-white glow seemed to be tugged by invisible hands, their distortions growing increasingly pronounced until they coalesced into an unmistakable conical shape.

The tip of the cone pointed directly toward a specific direction.

Ning Zhuo followed the trail.

"A marker! The second pivot!" Ning Zhuo's heart surged with excitement. Holding a Jade Slip in one hand, he silently inscribed the coordinates within it.

By now, he had grasped the correct method.

"But how many pivots are there in total?"

Suppressing his anxiety, Ning Zhuo left the second pivot of the Grand Formation and continued his swift flight.

He was like a cartographer groping through a dark maze, constrained by his skill in formations, forced to use a clumsy method: finding and marking each pivot point one by one.

This approach inevitably prolonged the process.

Can Luo Si hold out? Now, I need you to help me stall for time...

If Luo Si were defeated or surrendered, Ning Zhuo's efforts would be wasted, and their last chance to escape would be lost.

This was the moment to test the depth of trust between Luo Si and Ning Zhuo!

Forgetful River Immortal City.

An old man and a young boy arrived at the innermost chamber of the City Lord's Mansion, where they beheld a peculiar giant stone.

Unbeknownst to them, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had activated the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Grand Formation. The core of the Heavenly Aspect Formation was the sacrificial altar used for the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual, while the core of the Earth Aspect Formation was this precious treasure—the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier!

Zeng Jide had sought revenge against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord to restore his dignity and assuage his humiliation. But now, faced with the opportunity, he found himself wavering.

Sun Lingtong, however, felt no such hesitation.

He stared intently at the massive stone, his mind stirred by a growing impulse to steal it.

This impulse was all too familiar!

Even as a child, he had experienced this irresistible urge, one that only grew stronger the more he tried to suppress it. Only by yielding to this impulse and committing the theft could he find temporary relief.

Simply put, his thieving addiction flared up.

His eyes lit up, and he suddenly unleashed a Theft Path Method on the giant stone.

"Don't be reckless!" Zeng Jide exclaimed, startled. He reached out to stop Sun Lingtong, but it was too late.

As Sun Lingtong's Theft Path Method landed on the giant stone, his expression changed dramatically. He felt as if he were trying to move a stone bull while being as weak as a newborn infant.

The giant stone trembled slightly. Then, the spiral holes on its surface began to contract like living things, unleashing a terrifying suction force that threatened to drag Sun Lingtong inside and bury him.

Zeng Jide had no choice but to intervene.

His intervention was decisive, immediately turning the tide.

Applying the same Theft Path Method to Sun Lingtong amplified his strength exponentially, allowing him to instantly suppress the giant stone.

Whoosh.

With a soft sound, a stone core flew out from within the giant stone, shooting out through the surface holes.

The stone core was about the size of an adult's head, an oval shape that pulsed faintly like a living organ.

As the stone core landed in Sun Lingtong's hands, his eyes widened with curiosity. "What is this?"

Zeng Jide didn't answer. His expression grave, he immediately took action.

He formed a hand seal, his fingers dancing like butterflies, dazzling the eyes.

Quickly, he cast the Sealing Spell, rendering the stone core utterly silent and completely severing its connection to the main boulder.

Cold sweat dripped from Zeng Jide's forehead as he glared at Sun Lingtong. "You little brat! You've been on the brink of death three times! Do you even realize that?"

Sun Lingtong chuckled, cradling the stone core in his hands before offering it to Zeng Jide. "Senior, you were there by my side the whole time. With you watching my back, I'd even dare to steal the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's underwear!"

The corner of Zeng Jide's mouth twitched, a faint smile creeping up.

Ah, who could blame him for feeling lonely wandering the Underworld? And then to encounter such a promising junior fellow sect member under these circumstances...

Sun Lingtong's flattery struck true, making Zeng Jide think: Aiyah! Returning to the City Lord's Mansion was truly the right choice!

Suppressing the smile, Zeng Jide continued to glare. "You didn't even know what this was! You hadn't even investigated the Formation here before daring to act?! Acting so recklessly is courting death!"

"After all, I won't always be by your side to wipe your ass, you little brat."

Sun Lingtong retorted stubbornly, "How could I not recognize this formation? It's obvious—it clashes with the surrounding defensive formations. It must have a hidden purpose."

"The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is a fool. It's precisely because this formation clashes that he left this area undefended, making its defenses far weaker than elsewhere. I'm certain this is the easiest place to strike!"

"And the fact that he values this formation so highly, even abandoning proper defenses to set it up, proves that this treasure must be priceless!"

Zeng Jide lightly smacked Sun Lingtong's head in exasperation. "Have I not anticipated everything you've just said?"

"This formation is of the Earth Element, yet it's been placed within the Forgetful River Immortal City. That city floats above the Forgetful River, a domain of the Water Element."

"It's precisely because Earth and Water clash that I was able to assist you so easily."

"If this were a Water-Element Grand Formation, you'd have been torn to shreds by the whirlpool. Even if I used all my strength, I might not have saved you."

Sun Lingtong burst into laughter. "Senior Zeng's strength is truly extraordinary—you would definitely protect me! I understand your intentions; you're just trying to scare me into being more cautious in the future."

At this point, Sun Lingtong smoothly thanked Zeng Jide, effectively cutting off any further remarks.

Then, he asked eagerly, "Senior, Senior, what exactly is this thing?"

Even Zeng Jide seemed hesitant this time. He scrutinized the stone core for a moment before shaking his head. "I can't identify its origin either. It must be an Earth-Attribute Treasure from the depths of the earth."

"It's one of the essences of the giant stone. I've already detected numerous such stone cores within it."

Sun Lingtong rested his head on his hands, his eyes sparkling. "Great! If there are so many cores, let's take a few extra."

"Hmm," Zeng Jide stroked his beard in agreement.

The theft had already occurred, and there had been little reaction. Moreover, this mysterious treasure piqued his curiosity, subtly raising his estimation of its value. All of this made Zeng Jide's heart itch with temptation.

"Since we've come this far, taking a few more wouldn't hurt."

When Zeng Jide took charge personally, his efficiency multiplied several times over Sun Lingtong's efforts. As each Earth Lung Nodule was removed, the giant stone's aura rapidly diminished.

The Altar Battlefield...

Pfft... Pfft... Pfft...

A series of deflating sounds echoed as the once-mighty Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God shrank to only slightly larger than a normal person.

What's happening?!

This sudden turn of events stunned everyone present.

Luo Si seized the opportunity to retreat, putting a safe distance between himself and the god.

"The Earth Aspect Formation's core—the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier—has malfunctioned!" The True Form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord glared fiercely from the Branch of the Forgetful River.

A sense of impending doom welled up in his heart. The moment the barrier failed, an alarm was sent. He would mobilize the entire Forgetful River Immortal City to defend the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier and annihilate all enemies!

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God turned to examine his divine body, feeling regret for the first time.

He had forcibly sealed Luo Si's Nine Abyss Draining Pouch onto his own body. This spell, rooted in a magic treasure, was incredibly potent. Now that the god was weakened, the pouch's power surged, draining him further and exacerbating his frailty.

The combined effects of the Earth Aspect Array Core's Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier and the Nine Abyss Draining Pouch caused the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God to drastically shrink, his combat power plummeting.

Luo Si's eyes gleamed with newfound resolve and vigor!

"It's the Young Master! It must be him!"

"My decision to align with him was correct. Senior Greybone's guidance was peerless!"

"In this battle, the Qi Luck is with us! We will win!"

Luo Si charged into battle again.

This clash differed markedly from their previous encounters.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God sought to shake off the Nine Abyss Draining Pouch, but how could Luo Si let him take the W so easily? He poured every ounce of his strength into binding the Draining Pouch to the Turbid Filth God!

Earlier, the Turbid Filth God had relied on the Earth Aspect Formation, believing his support was inexhaustible. But he had inadvertently kicked the rock that crushed his own foot—the Earth Aspect Array Core's Earth-Attribute Treasure had malfunctioned, undermining his very foundation!

The impact was devastating.

Meanwhile, the True Form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord remained trapped in a tributary of the Forgetful River, utterly depleted. More than half of the beads on his string had shattered, and the Nether Dragon Silhouette he had unleashed moments ago had been his final desperate strike.

With his combat power severely diminished and grievously wounded, Luo Si wisely adopted a hit-and-run strategy.

The Turbid Filth God, limited to brute force, relentlessly pursued him. Though still maintaining the upper hand, he couldn't convert his advantage into victory, leading to a prolonged stalemate.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord observed the battle, secretly anxious, a sense of awe rising in his heart.

His resolve wavered. "Perhaps I shouldn't have seized this advantage, allowing my Divided Spirit to be distracted while I cultivated my Natural God Body? What if I had created another Water-Attribute Divine Incarnation instead? At least that would have given me more options."

"Was it a mistake to place the Earth Aspect Array Core so far away? The Forgetful River Immortal City is beyond my reach, and the energy loss during transmission is staggering. The damage to the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier isn't severe, but the effects here are painfully obvious. If only I had stationed it nearby..."

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord immediately shook his head. "No, if I had placed it nearby, it would likely have been discovered and sabotaged during my earlier battles with Yin Jiuzhu and the others!"

"The situation is gradually turning against me. The Qi Luck is shifting, targeting me!"

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had already reached this realization. He stared at the Nether Dragon Scissors within the Ice Coffin, his bloodshot eyes burning with urgency and fury, as if he wanted to devour the artifact. "Damn it! What method can I use to swiftly reclaim this National Artifact?"

The shifting of Qi Luck was a profoundly dangerous phenomenon.

Especially now, after enduring numerous fierce battles, his condition had deteriorated to its lowest point.

The Nether Dragon Scissors was a National Artifact capable of suppressing Qi Luck. With this treasure protecting him, it could largely counteract the unfavorable evolution of Qi Luck.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord understood his predicament all too well: retrieving the Nether Dragon Scissors was the most critical task!

But the Nether Dragon Scissors was trapped within the Ice Coffin.

Though the Ice Coffin was gradually eroding, it remained a vexing obstacle.

"Yin Jiuzhu!!!" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord roared inwardly, his hatred for the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord surging exponentially.

Overwhelming fatigue and pain battered Ning Zhuo's will like a tidal wave.

Within the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel, the Golden Core had dimmed to a dull glow and shrunk to the size of a soybean.

Ning Zhuo moved with lightning speed, swiftly replacing it with a relatively intact Golden Core.

Unlike before, after the defensive battle at White Paper Immortal City, he now possessed a substantial reserve of Golden Cores. These cores were cultivated using techniques he didn't master.

In this desperate, time-pressed situation, Golden Cores had become expendable resources.

"The ninth pivot."

Ning Zhuo, pushing himself to his limits, had achieved a significant breakthrough in his exploration. A rough map of the pivots had already taken shape in his mind.

His solid foundation in Formation principles gave him the confidence that this Grand Formation had only a limited number of pivots. The nine pivots he had identified already covered the majority of the structure.

Should he continue exploring, or take a different course of action?

Unbeknownst to Ning Zhuo, in Forgetful River Immortal City, Sun Lingtong had naturally achieved a breakthrough, indirectly altering Luo Si's situation.

The longer the time dragged on, the more anxious Ning Zhuo grew.

He mentally analyzed the map: "A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot... This means the pivot we're looking for is in the northern part of the map."

"Even though the map isn't complete, we can still determine that the northern area is the key."

Ning Zhuo altered his flight path and swiftly headed towards the northern region of the pivot map.

As he reached a certain area, the Literary Qi in his pouch suddenly underwent a strange transformation. This time, it didn't merely point in a specific direction or stabilize into a snow-white sphere.

Instead, it fractured into countless strands of light, twisting and turning as if pulled by invisible threads, scattering in all directions like a thousand tendrils.

Ning Zhuo's eyes sharpened. "There's clearly no visible pivot here, so why is there such a transformation?"

"The Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual is a Confucian sacrificial rite, using literary qi as its pivot. The core of the formation should be that sacrificial altar. This is the internal space of the grand formation."

"Could this be the formless pivot mentioned in the texts? All previous pivots have been tangible. Using the tangible to reveal the intangible, and the intangible to control the tangible?"

Ning Zhuo's heart raced, his mouth going dry.

His mastery of formations was only foundational, forcing him to rely on intuition. His Confucian cultivation was even weaker, but fortunately, he had previously consulted Wen Ruanyu.

The more he considered it, the more certain he became that this had to be the place.

"My time is running out."

"Even at the final step, I still need to take a risk!"

Confucian technique: Scholar Meets Soldier!

This technique had also been taught by Wen Ruanyu, relatively simple and easy to cultivate.

It could harness baleful energy to counteract other Confucian techniques.

Ning Zhuo had long mastered the Burden-Bearing Tactics, accumulating numerous baleful energies that formed a perfect complement to this Scholar Meets Soldier technique.

Boom...!

A cataclysmic change occurred!
