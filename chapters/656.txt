Chapter 656: Scholar Meets Soldier

Dark clouds swirled around Ning Zhuo as he continued his exploration.

He had already flown far from the first pivot marker, using it as a center point to spiral outward while simultaneously adjusting his vertical position. He moved swiftly through the black clouds, his divine sense spreading in all directions while actively monitoring the changes in the snowy light emanating from the pouch.

After a moment, the Literary Qi within the pouch trembled gently, like a faint heartbeat. At the same time, the halo projected by the snowy light underwent a subtle shift in shape.

Ning Zhuo's heartstrings twanged, and he immediately altered his course.

Emboldened by his initial success, his movements became even more swift and decisive.

Moreover, the Literary Qi and snowy light seemed to be pulled by an invisible force, their distortion growing increasingly pronounced until they once again formed a perfectly clear conical shape.

The cone's apex pointed directly toward a specific direction.

Ning Zhuo followed the trail.

"A marker! The second pivot!" Ning Zhuo's heart surged with excitement as he pinched a Jade Slip between his fingers, silently sketching the pivot's location within it.

By now, he had grasped the correct method.

"But how many pivots are there in this place?"

Forcing down his anxiety, Ning Zhuo left the second pivot of the Grand Formation and continued his rapid flight.

He was like a cartographer groping through a dark labyrinth, his limited mastery of formations forcing him to rely on clumsy methods: finding and marking each pivot one by one.

This painstaking process dragged out the time.

Can Luo Si hold out? I need you to buy me more time now...

Luo Si's swift defeat or surrender would render Ning Zhuo's efforts futile and cost them their last chance to escape.

This was a test of the mutual trust between Luo Si and Ning Zhuo!

-----
Forgetful River Immortal City.

An old man and a young boy arrived at the heart of the City Lord's Mansion and beheld the strange, colossal stone.

Unbeknownst to them, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had deployed the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Grand Formation. The Heavenly Aspect Formation's core was the Sacrificial Altar presiding over the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual, while the Earth Aspect Formation's core was this invaluable treasure: the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier!

Zeng Jide had sought revenge against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord to reclaim his honor and soothe his humiliated pride. But when the moment arrived, he hesitated.

Sun Lingtong, however, felt no such restraint.

He stared intently at the massive stone, his mind repeatedly triggered by its presence, fueling an overwhelming urge to steal it.

He was intimately familiar with this impulse!

Ever since he was a child, this urge had been irresistible, growing more intense the more he suppressed it. Only by succumbing to it and committing theft could he find temporary relief.

Simply put, his thieving urge had returned.

His eyes gleamed brighter as he suddenly unleashed his Theft Path Methods, targeting the massive boulder.

"Don't be reckless!" Zeng Jide exclaimed, startled, and reached out to stop him, but it was already too late.

Sun Lingtong's Theft Path Methods landed on the boulder, and his expression instantly shifted. He felt as if he were trying to move a stone bull, while he himself was as weak as an infant.

The boulder shuddered slightly in response. Then, the spiraling holes on its surface began to contract like living organisms, unleashing a terrifying suction force that threatened to pull Sun Lingtong inside and bury him alive.

Zeng Jide had no choice but to intervene.

His intervention was decisive, immediately shifting the situation.

By applying the same Theft Path Methods to Sun Lingtong, he amplified the young man's strength tenfold, allowing him to overpower the boulder.

Whoosh.

With a soft hiss, a stone core was stolen from the boulder's interior, shooting out through one of the surface holes.

The stone core, roughly the size of an adult's head and oval-shaped, pulsed faintly like a living organ.

As the core landed in Sun Lingtong's hand, he stared at it with wide, curious eyes. "What is this?"

Zeng Jide didn't answer. His face grim, he immediately took action.

His fingers danced like butterflies, weaving intricate hand seals that dazzled the eye.

Soon, the Sealing Spell struck, rendering the stone core as still as death, severing its connection to the massive boulder.

Cold sweat dripped from Zeng Jide's forehead as he glared at Sun Lingtong. "You reckless brat! Do you realize you nearly died three times just now?"

Sun Lingtong grinned, cupping the stone core in his hands as he presented it to Zeng Jide. "Senior, you were right beside me, weren't you? With you watching my back, I'd dare steal even the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's underwear!"

Zeng Jide's lips twitched, a faint smile tugging at the corners.

Ah, who could blame him? Wandering the Underworld had grown too lonely. And then, in this situation, he'd stumbled upon a fellow sect member he greatly admired.

Sun Lingtong's flattery struck a chord deep within Zeng Jide's heart, making him think, Aiya! Returning to the City Lord's Mansion was the right choice after all!

Suppressing the curve of his lips, Zeng Jide continued to glare. "You didn't even know what this was! You didn't even investigate the Formation here before acting! Your recklessness is practically courting death!"

"After all, I won't always be around to clean up your messes, you little rascal."

Sun Lingtong retorted, "How could I not recognize this formation? It's clearly incompatible with the surrounding defensive formations, meaning it must serve a special purpose."

"The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord made a foolish mistake. Precisely because it's incompatible, he left this area undefended, making it far weaker than other locations. I'm certain this is the best place to strike!"

"And the fact that he values this so highly, even abandoning defenses to set it up, proves this treasure is priceless!"

Zeng Jide, exasperated, lightly tapped Sun Lingtong's head. "Do you think I hadn't considered all that?"

"This formation is Earth-Attribute, yet it's situated within Forgetful River Immortal City, which floats above the Wangchuan River - a Water-Attribute domain."

"It's precisely because Earth and Water are incompatible that I could assist you so easily."

"Had it been a Water-Attribute Grand Formation, you'd already be ground into meat paste by the whirlpools. Even if I used all my strength, I doubt I could have saved you."

Sun Lingtong burst into laughter, declaring, "Senior Zeng's power is extraordinary! He could definitely protect me." He understood the elder's good intentions, realizing he was merely trying to frighten him into being more cautious in the future.

At this point, Sun Lingtong smoothly thanked Zeng Jide, effectively cutting off any further lectures.

Then, Sun Lingtong asked, "Senior, Senior, what exactly is this thing?"

This time, even Zeng Jide hesitated, looking puzzled.

He scrutinized the stone sphere for a moment before shaking his head. "I can't identify its origin. I can only speculate that it must be a significant Earth-Attribute Treasure from deep underground."

"This is one of the core essences of the giant stone. I've already detected that there are quite a few of these stone spheres within it."

Sun Lingtong clasped his hands behind his head and exclaimed excitedly, "That's fantastic! With so many spheres, let's take more!"

"Hmm," Zeng Jide stroked his beard and nodded.

They had already stolen one, and there had been minimal repercussions.

Moreover, the mysterious nature of these treasures had piqued his curiosity and subconsciously increased his estimation of their value. All these factors made Zeng Jide's own greed stir.

"Since we've already gone this far, taking a few more won't hurt."

Zeng Jide personally intervened, his efficiency far surpassing Sun Lingtong's.

One by one, the Earth Lung Spheres were extracted, and the giant stone's imposing aura rapidly diminished.

-----
Altar Battlefield.

Pfft... pfft... pfft...

A series of hissing sounds filled the air as the once towering and formidable Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God shrank to barely larger than an ordinary human.

What's happening?!

This sudden transformation caught everyone present completely off guard.

Luo Si seized the opportunity to retreat, putting a safe distance between himself and the shrinking deity.

"The Earth Aspect Formation! Something's wrong with the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier at the array core!" the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form roared from within the river's branch, his eyes blazing with fury.

A sense of foreboding washed over him. The moment the anomaly occurred, he sent out a command to mobilize the entire Forgetful River Immortal City, ordering them to defend the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier at all costs and eliminate every enemy!

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, meanwhile, stared at his rapidly diminishing form, feeling a pang of regret for the first time.

He had forcibly sealed Luo Si's Nine Abyss Water-Draining Net onto his own body. This powerful Spell, rooted in a magic treasure, was devastatingly effective. Now that the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God was weakened, the Nine Abyss Water-Draining Net unleashed its full power, draining him further and further.

The combined effects of the Earth Aspect Array Core's Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier and the Nine Abyss Water-Draining Net had drastically reduced the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's size and combat strength.

Luo Si's eyes blazed with renewed vigor, his morale soaring!

"It's the Young Master! It must be him!"

"My decision to pledge allegiance was right all along! Senior Greybone's guidance was absolutely correct!"

"Qi Luck is on our side in this battle! We can win!!"

Luo Si charged back into the fray.

This time, the engagement was markedly different from before.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God tried to shake off the Nine Abyss Water-Draining Net, but Luo Si refused to let Him escape so easily. He poured every ounce of his strength into keeping the pouch tightly bound around the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

Earlier, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God had relied on the Earth Aspect Formation, believing He had an endless supply of support and brimming with confidence. But He had shot Himself in the foot. When the Earth Aspect Array Core's treasure malfunctioned, it was like pulling the rug out from under Him!

The impact was devastating.

To make matters worse, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form remained trapped in a branch of the Wangchuan River, utterly drained of combat power. Most of the prayer beads in his hand had shattered, and the Nether Dragon Silhouette he had unleashed earlier was the last of his remaining strength!

Luo Si's combat prowess had also plummeted due to severe injuries, so he wisely adopted a hit-and-run strategy.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's methods were limited, and he pursued Luo Si relentlessly. Though he maintained a slight advantage, he couldn't convert it into a decisive victory, resulting in a stalemate.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord watched the battle, his anxiety growing, a chill creeping into his heart.

Doubt gnawed at him: Should I have resisted the temptation to take this shortcut and divided my spirit to forge a Natural God Body? Would it have been better to create another Water-Attribute Divine Incarnation? At least that would have given me more versatile methods.

And should I have positioned the Earth Aspect Array Core so far away? Forgetful River Immortal City is beyond my reach, and the transmission losses are staggering. The damage to the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier wasn't severe, but the impact here is glaring. If I had placed it closer...

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord immediately shook his head inwardly. No. If it had been closer, Yin Jiuzhu and the others would have found and destroyed it during our earlier battles!

The situation is gradually turning against me. Qi Luck is shifting, targeting me!

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord sensed this shift. He stared at the Nether Dragon Scissors within the Ice Coffin, his eyes bloodshot with urgency and fury, as if he wanted to devour someone. Damn it! How can I quickly reclaim this National Artifact?

The shifting of Qi Luck was an extremely dangerous phenomenon.

Especially now, after numerous fierce battles, his condition had plummeted to its lowest point.

The Nether Dragon Scissors were a National Artifact capable of suppressing Qi Luck. With this treasure protecting him, he could largely counteract the adverse evolution of his Qi Luck.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord understood his dire situation perfectly. Retrieving the Nether Dragon Scissors was paramount!

But the scissors were trapped within the Ice Coffin.

Though the Ice Coffin was steadily eroding, it remained a vexing obstacle.

"Yin Jiuzhu!!!" the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord roared inwardly, his hatred for the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord surging tenfold.

Overwhelming fatigue and pain crashed over Ning Zhuo's will like a tidal wave.

The Golden Cores in his Five Elements Golden Core Wheel had dimmed to a dull glow, shrinking to the size of soybeans.

With lightning speed, Ning Zhuo swapped them out for a Golden Core that was still relatively intact.

Unlike before, after the defensive battle at White Paper Immortal City, he now possessed a considerable number of Golden Cores. None of these Golden Cores were based on Cultivation Arts he had mastered.

In this desperate, time-critical situation, Golden Cores had become expendable commodities.

"The ninth pivot," Ning Zhuo murmured, his voice strained from his relentless exploration. He had achieved a breakthrough, sketching a rough map of the pivots in his mind.

His solid foundation in formation arts allowed him to sense that the Grand Formation contained relatively few pivots. The nine he had mapped already covered the majority of its structure.

Should he continue exploring, or take a different approach?

Unbeknownst to Ning Zhuo, in Forgetful River Immortal City, Sun Lingtong had naturally achieved a breakthrough, indirectly altering Luo Si's situation.

The longer this dragged on, the more Ning Zhuo's anxiety grew.

He mentally deciphered the map: "A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot... This means the pivot is located in the northern region of the map."

"Even though the map is incomplete, determining the northern direction is still possible."

Ning Zhuo changed his flight path, swiftly heading north.

As he entered a specific area, the Literary Qi in his pouch suddenly surged. This time, it no longer merely pointed in a single direction or stabilized into a glowing snow-white sphere.

Instead, it transformed into countless luminous strands, twisting and turning as if guided by invisible threads. These myriad strands scattered in all directions, spreading like tangled vines.

A sharp glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes. "There's no visible pivot here, so why is this happening?"

"The Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual is a Confucian Sacrificial Rite, so it uses Literary Qi as its pivot. The Sacrificial Altar must be the core of the Grand Formation, and this is the formation's inner space."

"Could this be the Formless Pivot mentioned in the books? All the previous pivots were tangible. Using the tangible to support the intangible, and the intangible to control the tangible?"

Ning Zhuo's heart pounded, his mouth suddenly dry.

His mastery of formations was only basic, forcing him to rely on guesswork. His Confucian cultivation was even more dismal, but fortunately, he had consulted Wen Ruanyu earlier.

The more he thought about it, the more convinced he became that this was the place.

"I don't have much time left."

"Even at the final step, I still need to take a risk!"

Confucian Technique: Scholar Meets Soldier!

This Confucian technique, also taught by Wen Ruanyu, was relatively simple and easy to master.

It could harness baleful energy to counter other Confucian techniques.

Ning Zhuo had already learned the Burden-Bearing Tactics, possessing abundant baleful energy, making him a perfect match for the Scholar Meets Soldier technique.

Rumble...

A cataclysmic transformation erupted!
