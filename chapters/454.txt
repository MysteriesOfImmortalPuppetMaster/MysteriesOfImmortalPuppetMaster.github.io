Chapter 454: I Am Very Interested in Ning Zhuo

Lord Long coughed lightly, stood up, and cupped his hands toward the Old Stone Monster: “This battle nearly cost me my life, and I am fortunate to have been saved by Fellow Daoist Shi.”

Such a gesture was extremely rare.

Usually, Lord Long had his eyes set above the heavens and was arrogant in demeanor.

He himself was a great Nascent Soul cultivator, and very senior at that. Even more crucially, as the temple caretaker of the Ginseng-whisker Dragon King, he had an exceedingly solid backing, making him second only to one person and above thousands in the Thousand Peaks Forest.

Yet this time, he actually cupped his hands in thanks to the Old Stone Monster.

Mo Yuan Cave Master, Red Vine Doctor, Azure Vine King, and the others looked toward the stone sphere, all wearing expressions of envy.

Everyone knew that once they returned to the Thousand Peaks Forest, the Old Stone Monster would receive the Dragon King’s great reward!

The next moment, the Old Stone Monster’s hoarse voice sounded: “Little Long, I am your savior. You, as the main general, if you had died, even if we had completely wiped out two or three enemy armies in this battle, it would still have been a disastrous loss!”

“I was the key figure who turned the tide, changing defeat into victory.”

“What kind of reward do you think the Dragon King will grant such a meritorious subject?”

Everyone’s expressions changed dramatically.

They had not expected the Old Stone Monster to speak so bluntly and with such an impolite tone, his manner completely one of flaunting his achievement.

This was not a wise move.

Although it was true that he had saved Lord Long, one should not act like this.

After all, the other party was not just a Nascent Soul cultivator; he was also the temple caretaker of the Dragon King. Treating him so rudely was equivalent to being rude to a Soul Formation level existence!

Lord Long’s eyelid twitched slightly. He lowered his hand, a smile appearing on his face, and said slowly, “Well said, well said.”

“Fellow Daoist Shi, rest assured. Although I cannot decide on the reward, I trust the Dragon King will certainly not treat you unfairly.”

The two of them had been entangled with the Barbarian Demon Camp all along, holding the upper hand, so their withdrawal went very smoothly.

The Old Stone Monster grunted, arrogance clear: “That’s good.”

While he spoke, more cultivators arrived secretly to rendezvous.

They were Di Lu and Gu Ya.

Di Lu’s face was expressionless: “What a pity. That Xu Dali was already at his last gasp. If we had just one more incense stick of time, we would surely have taken him down!”

Gu Ya said nothing.

Compared to his eagerness before the battle, he now seemed depressed.

Gu Ya was a beast tamer who put great care into his wolf pack. In this battle, his wolves suffered heavy losses, which pained him greatly and made him fully realize one point - 

If one truly wanted group warfare, an army composed of cultivators possessed the strongest combat power!

Using a pack of demonic beasts to contend against an army required at least a tenfold numerical advantage.

While everyone exchanged words, Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and others also arrived.

They wore anxious expressions and looked quite battered.

“We underestimated the Three Generals Camp. Although Liu, Guan, and Zhang are itinerant cultivators, none of them are ordinary.”

“Where is Ma Feitui?”

“He was captured alive by the three generals.”

“What?!”

For a moment, everyone was extremely startled.

Ma Feitui was a demon cultivator. His original form was a heavenly horse, and his cultivation had reached Nascent Soul. Even if he could not win, he should have been able to retreat.

They had not expected him to be defeated and even captured alive!

Everyone’s expressions looked unpleasant.

Every piece of Nascent Soul-level combat power was extremely precious. Losing Ma Feitui was undoubtedly a great blow to the Thousand Peaks Forest!

A venomous snake emerged from the ground, spitting out a jade slip.

It was a letter from Tu Ming.

Lord Long read it with his divine sense: “Tu Ming is seriously injured and has led the Hundred Venom Tribe to withdraw first. We need not wait for them.”

Thus, on the Thousand Peaks Forest’s side, one Nascent Soul was seriously injured, one was lost, and their accomplishment was nearly wiping out the Barbarian Demon Camp and the White Jade Camp.

The Red Flower Camp suffered heavy losses, the Three Generals Camp was reduced in number, while the Golden Halberd Army and the Fiery Cloud Camp were unscathed.

Mo Yuan Cave Master swept his gaze around and immediately laughed: “Ma Feitui is truly ridiculous. I said long ago that his name was too apt. From that alone, one could see his weakness - he has achieved almost nothing after dealing with the Mu General’s House for so many years.”

“Now he has failed and been captured, and it was done by three obscure itinerant cultivators named Liu, Guan, and Zhang. This further proves my judgment!”

“He is a northern demon. There are no such weak Nascent Soul cultivators in the Thousand Peaks Forest. Getting caught might actually be a good thing.”

“At least, we will not entrust him with important tasks in the future and be dragged down by him, resulting in more severe consequences!”

Without a doubt, Lu Hongtu understood how to encourage people.

He had led the Six Caverns Faction for many years, and his eloquence was superb. When he described the defeat, it somehow turned into a fortunate event for the Thousand Peaks Forest.

Lord Long waved his hand: “Enough, let us head back first. Ma Feitui’s defeat and capture was something I never expected. How to handle this matter will be discussed further when we return.”

The Old Stone Monster then spoke in a mocking tone: “The two note Nation is truly powerful. Even their rear army alone is already so formidable.”

“Don’t forget, if not for me, Little Long, your end would have been far worse than Ma Feitui’s.”

“At least he was captured alive, still clinging to a small life. If I had come even a moment later, you would have been burned to ash.”

Lord Long’s eyelid twitched once more.

Di Lu and Gu Ya were shocked.

Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and the other Golden Core cultivators widened their eyes, their breath catching in their throats.

What was with the Old Stone Monster? How unbelievably arrogant!

A strong sense of foreboding suddenly rose in Lord Long’s heart. It seemed that in the future, every time he met with the Old Stone Monster, the latter would bring up this lifesaving deed.

The Old Stone Monster ignored the heavy atmosphere and continued, “You all go on. I’ll stay behind and cover your retreat.”

Lu Hongtu was surprised: “Fellow Daoist Shi, you won’t return with us?”

“There’s no need. Having been still for too long, I want to go out and stroll around the outside world,” Ning Zhuo replied.

Lu Hongtu’s face was full of worry: “Just now we ambushed the two principalities’ armies. Next, they will surely be enraged and conduct a full-scale search. For you to remain now would be very risky, Fellow Daoist Shi.”

The Old Stone Monster chuckled: “That is my own affair; do not prattle on. After this battle, there is someone in the enemy army who interests me greatly. I want to investigate him.”

“Lu Hongtu, I have heard that your Six Caverns Faction has much entanglement with that person.”

Mo Yuan Cave Master’s expression shifted: “Fellow Daoist Shi, do you mean that Ning...”

“Precisely, him, Ning Zhuo,” Ning Zhuo spoke.

At the side, Sun Lingtong widened his eyes, looking at him curiously.

Ning Zhuo murmured softly: 

“Horses’ hooves tread upon fallen flowers,”

“The wind rises, shadows sink into sand.”

“Who can keep the bright moon,”

“And who will be buried in rosy clouds?”

“This was the prophetic poem Ning Zhuo deduced, and it was very accurate.”

“Horses’ hooves corresponded to Ma Feitui. Fallen flowers foretold Ma Feitui’s downfall.”

“The rising wind and sinking shadows in the sand reflected our side’s offensive.”

“The bright moon should point to the White Jade Camp’s Many-Stars-Encircle-the-Moon battle formation.”

“Buried in rosy clouds refers to how Little Long almost croaked, nearly burned to ash by the Lifeless Fire.”

All hearts jumped in unison.

You still say such things!

And you’re becoming even more excessive, not the least bit tactful.

Lord Long’s eyelid twitched yet again.

Did his face mean nothing?!

But the problem was that the Old Stone Monster truly was his savior!!

For a moment, Lord Long’s sense of unease about the future became even stronger.

“Who can keep the bright moon, who will be buried in rosy clouds? The more I savor these lines, the more marvelous they seem!” Ning Zhuo, disguised as the Old Stone Monster, became increasingly enthusiastic.

At the side, Sun Lingtong cast a glance at him.

It was the first time he had seen someone so sincerely boasting about himself!

“Not a hint of shame. Little Zhuo’s righteous path skill has risen again,” Sun Lingtong inwardly praised.

Outside, the Old Stone Monster’s voice echoed in everyone’s ears: “This last line of the prophetic poem actually points out that one should not only look at the surface of the battle. Occupying the upper hand or having an advantage is not everything. One must see the final outcome.”

“Look at Little Long. He charged alone into the enemy formation, so majestic, yet how did it end? Did he not almost die and need my rescue?”

Lord Long secretly ground his teeth. In such a short time, Ning Zhuo had mentioned this rescue three times.

Di Lu, Gu Ya, and the others dared not even glance sideways to gauge Lord Long’s expression.

Chen Lingfeng and Wu Hen, both subordinates of Lord Long, wished they could bury themselves in the ground.

Lu Hongtu said, “But, Fellow Daoist Shi, you may not know that precisely after we heard this poem, we deliberately planned our offensive to match the first half of it.”

Ning Zhuo laughed aloud: “Superficial!”

“You underestimate the Dao of divination, Mo Yuan Cave Master.”

“You think you are countering his plan by following the poem, yet you ignore one possibility - that Ning Zhuo had already foreseen your existence and thus deduced this prophetic poem.”

Hiss…

Someone drew in a sharp breath.

Lu Hongtu’s pupils shook slightly, but he quickly composed himself, not fooled by this.

He smiled and shook his head: “The likelihood of that is not high. Ning Zhuo is merely a small Foundation Establishment cultivator; how could he possibly calculate someone like me, a Nascent Soul?”

“Moreover, it was not just me who participated in this ambush, but all of us here.”

“Could a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator have predicted us all?”

Everyone’s expressions eased slightly.

Ning Zhuo said, “In the Dao of divination, is it impossible for the weak to divine the strong?”

He knew he should not push too hard, so he changed tack: “Of course, I also think that this is only a possibility.”

“That’s why I find that little fellow interesting.”

“I will remain outside to ponder him carefully.”

“He is already my prey. Heh heh heh, hahahaha!”

The Old Stone Monster let out a strange laugh.

No one spoke.

Chen Lingfeng and the other Golden Core cultivators had already begun silently mourning for Ning Zhuo.

Lu Hongtu smiled: “For a small Foundation Establishment cultivator to be so highly regarded by you, Fellow Daoist Shi, what good fortune he has.”

After this battle, the prophetic poem would surely make Ning Zhuo’s name soar, garnering great attention.

“After this battle, I am also concerned about him.”

“Since Fellow Daoist Shi will personally take action, we can rest assured.”

Inside the Dragon Head Cabin of the mechanical roaming dragon.

Sun Lingtong gave Ning Zhuo a thumbs-up.

This move was brilliant.

Ning Zhuo had used the Old Stone Monster’s identity as a protective umbrella, blocking any hidden tricks the Thousand Peaks Forest might direct at Ning Zhuo.

This could be called a masterful stroke!

Ning Zhuo said, “Let’s go.”

With that, he focused his mind, preparing to cast Earth Movement Technique.

Being among so many Nascent Souls and Golden Cores, pretending to be one of them was enormous pressure.

Ning Zhuo decided to withdraw quickly to avoid exposing any flaws as time went on.

“Hold on!” Lord Long suddenly said.
