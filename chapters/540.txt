Chapter 540: A Chance for Victory

Tian Shuang’s five fingers condensed profound ice, forming an icy claw set.
He flew straight toward Zhang Hei.

Zhang Hei only saw a blur before his eyes, a strong gust slashing his face; when he fixed his gaze, Tian Shuang, as if having teleported in an instant, had already attacked his position.

The claw set slashed diagonally, and the black snake spear that Zhang Hei had instinctively brandished was directly severed.

Zhang Hei had no time to react; three claw marks appeared on his chest.

In the previous moment, fresh blood surged. In the next moment, the wound immediately congealed into frost, which, while stopping the bleeding, also eroded his internal organs, limbs, and bones.

Zhang Hei felt as though he had suddenly shifted from midsummer to midwinter; his entire body was frozen, every movement sluggish and heavy, extremely arduous.

Tian Shuang swung his claw again.

He was in a very bad mood and was about to take advantage of the close combat to vent his frustration.

Zhang Hei glared, watching with wide eyes as the fatal blow was about to fall.

Clang.

Guan Hong arrived at the critical moment, and the Blood Dragon Blade blocked the ice claw.

Crack, crack!

The Blood Dragon Blade showed several huge cracks, shattering right before his eyes.

The Xuanhuang Sword slanted in and stabbed directly at Tian Shuang’s face.

Tian Shuang snorted coldly, and with his other hand condensed a Nine Nether Cold Spirit Claw, grabbing the Xuanhuang Sword.

Liu Er exerted all his strength, thrusting the sword tip forward, using every ounce of power -gritting his teeth until blood burst -yet it remained completely unmoved!

Although ghost cultivators were clearly not adept in strength, Liu Er had expended much energy enhancing his flesh foundation, but at this moment, when contesting pure force, he was completely defeated!

The gap between the Nascent Soul level and the Golden Core level was obvious at a glance.

“You all…” Ning Zhuo said as he looked at the three generals blocking his path, his emotions surging.

He immediately retreated violently backward.

Sun Lingtong was overjoyed and exclaimed, “Little Zhuo, you finally figured it out!”

In the next moment, Ning Zhuo shouted, “Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, if it is me you want, then come and catch me!”

Sun Lingtong: ......

“Hmph, little ghost, arrogant -if I catch you, I’ll pull out your tongue.”

Tian Shuang’s twin claws struck forcefully, immediately repelling the three generals.

The three generals were drenched in blood on the spot and simultaneously flew backwards.

Tian Shuang charged toward Ning Zhuo, while Di Hui stood aside with arms folded, smiling as he watched the show.

“Main body, do not get stained with killing again!”

Tian Shuang’s ghost face roared and pounced toward Tian Shuang’s main body.

Bang.

Tian Shuang snorted coldly, and with a swing of his sharp claw, directly clawed through the ghost face’s body, severing it into two pieces.

The upper half of the ghost face clung to Tian Shuang’s legs and feet, loudly pleading, “Spare the innocent, and you will spare yourself!”

Di Gui burst into hearty laughter as he watched.

Tian Shuang lifted his foot, summoned his magic, and with one stomp, crushed the head of the ghost face.

Then, frost erupted, completely obliterating the upper half of the ghost face.

The lower half of the ghost face then flew to Ning Zhuo’s side and, after a change in shape, transformed back into an upper half -with a head and face -stretching out its arms to block Ning Zhuo’s path.

Ning Zhuo clasped his hands together and said, “My Buddha above, I shall not enter hell; if I do not enter hell, who will?”

“Tian Shuang, you are a famous expert. I surrender; please spare others.”

Tian Shuang, enraged to the point that his face turned ashen and his honor was completely lost, grinned maniacally and said, “Stinking brat, don’t put on airs before me -I’ll slice you into human sticks!”

Lin Bufan looked nervously toward Zhu Xuanji and said, “Lord Divine Captor, shall we attack together?”

Zhu Xuanji instead squinted his eyes, looking at Di Hui, his expression extremely solemn.

“Not bad, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth -though it appears they are watching a show, they are actually setting an ambush for Tian Shuang!”

“If we try to come to the rescue, we will surely be strongly obstructed by Di Gui.”

“The intention of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth to capture Ning Zhuo alive is very obvious; perhaps we should wait for a chance later? Rather than at this moment when the twin ghosts are on full alert?”

Zhu Xuanji also hesitated.

“Wah ya ya.” Zhang Hei charged toward Tian Shuang.

Bang.

Tian Shuang swung his claw backward.

Zhang Hei once again flew backwards, with blood spurting wildly in mid-air, splattering all along the way.

After falling to the ground, even someone as tough as Zhang Hei could not immediately stand up; more than half of his bones were shattered!

“Zhang Hei, hurry up, leave!” Ning Zhuo shouted.

Zhang Hei struggled to half-kneel, looked up with bloodshot eyes, and said, “Damn it, military strategist, you sacrificed yourself for others, but what do you take me, old Zhang, for?! Fight to the death, fight to the death!”

Guan Hong came to his side, helped him up, and at the same time, using his magical power, infused Blood Light to stabilize Zhang Hei’s injuries.

Guan Hong’s beard fluttered as he declared, “A real man in the world, when righteousness calls, how could he care about a single life!”

Liu Er: ......

He had many words he wanted to say, many sighs, but the atmosphere had reached this point-

He also stood by Zhang Hei’s side, with Guan Hong on one side, and said, “The three of us brothers have long sworn brotherhood -not seeking to be born on the same year, month, and day, but praying to die on the same year, month, and day!”

“Meeting the military strategist was the greatest fortune of my life.”

“Living and dying together -this must be now!”

Tian Shuang’s face was as cold as frost.

Di Hui then clapped with delight and said, “Good, well said.”

He looked the three generals up and down with a peculiar gaze and remarked, “It has been a long time since I’ve seen such interesting characters. However, you will absolutely die, but Ning Zhuo will not die. Yet you need not envy him, because he will live a life worse than death, more miserable than you! Hahaha!”

However, whether it was Di Hui, Tian Shuang, Zhu Xuanji, Lin Bufan, Red Sleeve Fairy, or the group of Liu, Guan, Zhang, Ning, and Sun, none of them could see the changes that were secretly taking place.

If Liu Er’s master had been present at the scene and had used methods to observe fate, he would have seen that the collective qi of the three generals’ camp suddenly soared, blossoming like fresh flowers, resulting in a qualitative improvement!

The monkey-like qi became even more concentrated, lifelike, and extraordinarily dynamic.

Among the qi, an arm-shaped strand of qi also benefited greatly, profiting enormously.

Amid the swirling mechanical dragon, Sun Lingtong was extremely anxious; suddenly, fortune struck him, and his inspiration burst forth.

“Little Zhuo, Little Zhuo! I have thought of a way!!”

Sun Lingtong quickly transmitted his mental consciousness to remind Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up as he pushed his palms forward with all his strength, unleashing a round of Five Elements spell.

Before the spell was even halfway through the air, it was completely frozen and suppressed by the cold air that Tian Shuang had spat out.

“Naive!”

“Did you really think that you would have any power in front of me?”

Tian Shuang’s expression of disdain suddenly froze.

It was all because Ning Zhuo had taken a few steps forward and stood behind Tian Shuang’s false face.

It turned out that Ning Zhuo’s previous offensive was merely to attract attention -a feint to cover up his true tactical objective.

Tian Shuang subconsciously felt something was amiss and immediately prepared to strike.

But Ning Zhuo undoubtedly acted faster.

“It must succeed!”

Ning Zhuo’s momentum erupted as he placed both palms on Tian Shuang’s ghost face, directly unleashing his most powerful trump card.

Divine technique -Life Hanging by a Thread!

A thread of suspended life, as if a string of fate, descended from the sky and landed on the top of Tian Shuang’s ghost face.

At that moment, time seemed to slow down dramatically.

Under the strong anticipation of Sun and Ning, the suspended thread completely landed on the head of Tian Shuang’s ghost face, forming… a connection!

Life Hanging by a Thread, succeeded!

Ning Zhuo exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, but at the same time felt immense pressure, as if a mountain were pressing on his heart and mind, making it hard to breathe.

It had to be known that Tian Shuang’s ghost face was an existence of the Nascent Soul level.

It was created through the ghost face technique, borrowing the power of Tian Shuang’s main body, and had condensed into form, possessing part of Tian Shuang’s might and combat power!

All along, limited by Ning Zhuo’s cultivation, his Life Hanging by a Thread divine technique had never been applied to a Nascent Soul level being.

Whether it was Lin Bufan or Elder Ape, it had always been the same.

But now, he had made a critical, massive breakthrough!

This was logically justifiable.

Ning Zhuo’s flesh foundation had been continuously improving, allowing him to be empower more by the Hero's return technique.

Since the battle began, he had almost lost all his mechanical puppets, with his stock already dropping below a hundred.

He had even released the heavily armored Blood Ape: Dasheng; the loss of this Golden Core level mechanism was also within the scope of the Hero's return techniques!

On one hand, it was Ning Zhuo’s own strength that had been leveraged to an unprecedented degree by the Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings.

On the other hand, although Tian Shuang’s ghost face was of the Nascent Soul level, in essence it had already been weakened to its extreme limit.

The most crucial point was that, under the communication of divine consciousness, Tian Shuang’s ghost face actively cooperated with Ning Zhuo without a trace of resistance.

All these factors ultimately led to the successful connection of Life Hanging by a Thread!

Once successful, Ning Zhuo immediately infused a large amount of Buddhist thought from his mind, along the suspended thread, into the body of Tian Shuang’s ghost face.

The ghost face then surged with Buddha light, shining brilliantly.

Wearing Tian Shuang’s face, it now became full of mercy, clasping its hands together, bowing its head, and beginning to recite Buddhist scriptures.

Tian Shuang was enraged and, like lightning, pounced to the front of Ning Zhuo and the ghost face, slashing fiercely with his sharp claw.

He intended to capture Ning Zhuo alive; this strike was aimed solely at Tian Shuang’s ghost face.

Every breath that this ghost face continued to exist was a humiliation to him.

Clang.

A crisp metallic sound rang out as a powerful ice claw blocked Tian Shuang’s ice claw.

All three generals who were on their way arrived and saw this scene, their eyes widening in shock.

Tian Shuang lost his color, his expression trembling!

Because the one blocking him was none other than himself -not someone else, nor Tian Shuang’s ghost face, but himself!!

Di Gui’s smile of amusement vanished without a trace as he stared intently at Tian Shuang.

Tian Shuang knew the reason.

In his divine sea, a massive amount of Buddhist thought reappeared.

“Why?! I did not use Frost Soul Gaze to attack his divine sea!”

That doubt flashed only for a moment, and Tian Shuang immediately guessed a deeper reason.

“Damn it, it’s the ghost face technique!”

Ghost face technique -this is a spell that can borrow the power of a great ghost to condense into a fixed mask.

The stronger the great ghost’s power, the stronger the ghost face’s power became.

This meant that there was a subtle connection between the great ghost and the ghost face.

When Ning Zhuo connected to Tian Shuang’s ghost face, he could also transfer through it, affecting Tian Shuang’s main body.

Coincidentally, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth had practiced the ghost face technique extremely profoundly -to the point of covering their entire bodies, essentially acting as clones!

This meant that the connection between the two was far stronger than that of ordinary ghost face techniques.

Ghost face technique was a classic spell, and Sun Lingtong, being from an evil sect, was well aware of this inner connection.

The Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth were not unaware, so they never casually distributed their ghost faces; they only handed them over to each other.

Moreover, these two were almost inseparable, acting in tandem, thereby enabling close and rigorous supervision!

The greatest unexpected twist in this battle was that Tian Shuang was counterattacked by the backlash of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, and Buddhist thoughts had once severely restricted his performance.

Therefore, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were both very clear that Buddhist thoughts had an excellent effect on Tian Shuang.

This was also the reason why, upon hearing Sun Lingtong’s proposal, Ning Zhuo -even though he knew it was extremely risky -was willing to try.

He seized the deep hint hidden within the appearance, a reminder from fate- that in this fierce battle where the enemy was strong and we were weak, with both sides’ strength extremely mismatched, this might be the only chance for victory.

Buddhist thoughts also surged once again in the divine sea of Tian Shuang’s main body!

Buddha Heart Demon Seal!!!

Ning Zhuo had never, in his life, invoked this magical treasure so fervently and frenziedly.

Thus, Buddha light also shone in Tian Shuang’s divine sea, and Buddha’s thought grew more and more -once unleashed, it was unstoppable!

“I…”

Tian Shuang still wanted to struggle, but his normal thoughts were quickly suppressed by the Buddha light, overwhelmed and drowned by the subsequent Buddha’s thought like a tidal wave.

Di Gui, sensing the unfavorable situation, cast a spell to remotely attack Ning Zhuo.

Boom.

Tian Shuang swung his claw, standing by Ning Zhuo’s side, and blocked Di Gui’s attack.

Tian Shuang, with a face full of compassion, earnestly pleaded to Di Hui, “My comrade, turning back is salvation!”

Di Hui: ?!
