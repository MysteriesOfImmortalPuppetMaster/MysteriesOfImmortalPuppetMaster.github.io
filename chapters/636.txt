Chapter 636: The Painted Skin Rakshasa Storms Immortal City

The Ghostfire Prefecture Lord unleashed three ghost path techniques in rapid succession, each strike fierce and swift, leaving the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God no chance to retaliate and inflicting severe damage.

Yet this apparent victory only deepened the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord's concern.

He had indeed severely wounded the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's projection, but the aura emanating from the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God revealed that its foundation extended beyond its physical form, partially anchored to the surrounding Grand Formation.

This meant that even if the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God were completely annihilated, it would simply regenerate from the Grand Formation, drawing upon the vast reserves of Earth Lung Turbid Qi.

As expected, in the next instant, a massive pillar of turbid qi surged violently into the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's body.

The entity threw its head back, drinking in the qi like a parched land receiving rain.

First, its hollow chest rapidly filled with the turbid qi. Then, its charred outer layer peeled away, revealing a newly formed, more resilient physique beneath. Finally, it roared skyward, its voice shaking the battlefield, radiating an awe-inspiring, terrifying aura.

"As long as the turbid qi persists, the Turbid God shall not perish," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord declared, his voice echoing through the roiling mists of impure energy. With a leisurely, mocking tone, he challenged, "Yin Jiuzhu, can your flame truly consume ten thousand years of accumulated filth beneath the Nine Underworlds?"

Yin Jiuzhu remained silent, seated cross-legged upon his Scorched Bone Lotus Throne, but his hands moved with relentless precision. His ghost path techniques kept the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God at bay, focusing his attacks on the boundless Earth Lung Turbid Qi. His ghost path techniques proved effective, dispersing most of the towering pillars of impure energy. Yet the Earth Lung Turbid Qi proved inexhaustible, replenishing itself as quickly as it was dispersed, even swelling beyond its original extent.

The relentless assaults from the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God forced Yin Jiuzhu to constantly maneuver his Lotus Throne, evading the onslaught. For the first time since the battle began, the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord found himself at a disadvantage.

"The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God lacks profound cultivation; it has yet to master the Divine Domain."

"However, this Grand Formation is deeply bound to it. To defeat the Turbid God, we must either dismantle the entire formation or at least disrupt it enough to limit the Turbid Qi's replenishment."

"What exactly is this Grand Formation? I must examine it thoroughly..."

The Ghostfire Prefecture Lord, having grasped the situation, intensified his efforts to activate the Yin Crow Ghost Eye Candle.

The candle was jet-black and glossy, its flame shaped like a crow's head. The main body of the flame was pitch-black, but two points of purple fire burned where the eyes should have been, like embedded violet orbs.

This Strange Fire could pierce through illusions, revealing the hidden truths to the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord.

He had already begun activating the candle earlier, but only now, with increased focus, did he finally complete the observation, unraveling the truth.

The revealed truth startled even the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord.

"This is the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Two-Phase Formation!"

"The Heavenly Aspect is the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual, specifically designed to refine Heavenly Ghost Skulls through blood sacrifice of living beings, thereby gaining the favor of the Underworld Celestial Heavens and greatly increasing one's Qi Luck."

"The Earthly Aspect is the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier, which continuously extracts Earth Qi in an unending, ceaseless flow, making it highly effective at repelling enemies."

It's worth noting that the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual is a Confucian technique, while the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier is an Earth Element magic treasure. Neither is a Formation.

The only formation present was the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Two-Phase Formation. One of its distinctive features was its ability to incorporate spells, magic treasures, and other non-formation elements as its two phases, allowing for the creation of various configurations of the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Two-Phase Formation.

The flame of the Yin Crow Ghost Eye Candle flickered, casting shifting shadows. Within the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord's divine sea, the candle's glow revealed distant, hazy scenes - scenes not of the battlefield before him, but of a sharp-pointed Immortal City, its towered spires rising above the surface of the Forgetful River.

It was none other than the Forgetful River Immortal City!

Deep within the Immortal City, within the City Lord's Mansion, stood a massive screen.

This screen was an enormous slab of stone, ten zhang thick and nearly a hundred feet long, resembling the fossilized spine of some ancient creature. Its surface was encrusted with layers of mud, lava, plant roots, and spiral-shaped, twisted cavities. The colossal stone was deeply embedded in the earth, drawing Earth Lung Qi with terrifying intensity.

Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier!

The flame of the Yin Crow Ghost Eye Candle intensified slightly, causing the stone screen's surface to blur and distort, revealing more of its hidden truth.

The Ghostfire Prefecture Lord immediately saw: within the stone screen were seventy-two Earth Lung Nodules.

Each Earth Lung Nodule was roughly the size of an adult human head, irregularly shaped like an ellipsoid, and pulsed faintly like a living organ.

Ghostfire Prefecture Lord was momentarily speechless.

Well, well!

Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had prepared too thoroughly.

The Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier, an Earthly Aspect formation, wasn't deployed on the battlefield but hidden far away within the Forgetful River Immortal City.

Normally, such a crucial magic treasure, serving as the heart of an Earth Aspect Formation, couldn't be separated from the formation itself.

But the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Two-Phase Formation was special.

This Grand Formation's scope was vast, truly deserving of its name. Moreover, Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was currently manipulating the Heavenly Aspect while activating the power of the Earthly Aspect Formation, in line with the principles of Heaven and Earth's correspondence. By leveraging the Earthly Aspect, he could amplify the Heavenly Aspect!

Ghostfire Prefecture Lord calculated:

"The Cultivators controlling the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Grand Formation have suffered significant casualties, causing the formation's operation to slow."

"Moreover, within the Heavenly Aspect Formation are the Void Return Finger, Soundless Ghost Monk's Lifebound Buddha Wheel, and the Lord's Seal of the Forgetful River Prefecture. These are major obstacles hindering the formation's operation."

"But these only impede the Heavenly Aspect, not the Earthly Aspect."

"To dismantle the Earthly Aspect, we must target the Forgetful River Immortal City!"

Realizing this, Ghostfire Prefecture Lord immediately understood that whether he could obstruct the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's path, and ultimately defeat him, did not depend on himself alone.

But rather on - 

"The Painted Skin Rakshasa!" Ghostfire Prefecture Lord exclaimed, suddenly enlightened. His previous divinations had been correct. The placement of the Painted Skin Rakshasa within the Forgetful River Immortal Mansion was the crucial strategic move.

He channeled all his power into a spell, attempting to contact the Painted Skin Rakshasa and explain the situation.

At that moment, the Painted Skin Rakshasa was patrolling the outskirts of the Forgetful River Immortal City, using a spell to discreetly observe the city gates.

Above the city gates hung a circular mirror.

It was an ancient bronze mirror, its surface encrusted with a dark gray patina that seeped through with shades of azure and crimson. The mirror's surface resembled murky mercury, within which swirling gray sand slowly churned, emitting a ghastly, phosphorescent glow. The back of the mirror was engraved with a blindfolded Judge of the Underworld holding a scroll, radiating an aura of sin.

"This is the Karmic Mirror," the Painted Skin Rakshasa murmured. "Entering this city will be troublesome."

All because of this Karmic Mirror. In its normal state, it reflected images so poorly that it was inferior to an ordinary mirror, its surface utterly muddled. Its true function, however, was to reveal the sins of living beings.

The Azure Flame Burning Mirror illuminated the skin, causing it to blur and fade, revealing the skeleton and soul. Any sin would be marked by dark crimson scars, wisps of black blood mist, and curse-infused barbs.

The Painted Skin Rakshasa was a true Demonic Cultivator, responsible for countless murders and known for peeling skins to create paintings. Naturally, she carried a profound burden of sin.

Ordinary disguise techniques would never suffice; the mirror would undoubtedly reveal her true nature.

However, as one of the greatest adversaries of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, the Painted Skin Rakshasa possessed extraordinary methods.

After observing for a moment, she devised three techniques that would allow her to secretly infiltrate the Immortal City.

"Hmm?!" Just as she was about to activate the technique and disguise herself, her heart trembled. A faint scent of incense mingled with the flickering candlelight, carrying a message from the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord.

The Painted Skin Rakshasa's expression changed abruptly.

"So that's how it is!"

"It seems I've become the linchpin."

"Heh heh heh, intriguing."

Time was of the essence. Abandoning her previous cautious approach, the Painted Skin Rakshasa charged straight toward the city gates.

The Karmic Mirror suddenly erupted with blinding light!

A pillar of ghastly green light illuminated the Painted Skin Rakshasa. In the span of a few breaths, countless visages flashed across her face - men and women, young and old, joyous and sorrowful, every expression imaginable.

"A demon!" the Ghost General roared, angrily barking orders. He activated his command authority, directing the city's giant ballistae to fire their terrifying bolts.

"Heh heh heh..." The Painted Skin Rakshasa giggled, her laughter sending shivers down the spines of all who heard it.

Her figure exploded, transforming into thousands of paper-thin, wing-like membranes, each painted with a face - men, women, children, demons, spirits, and monsters. The membranes swirled into motion, coming to life as they surged forward and overwhelmed the city gates.

Thud, thud, thud...

A hail of arrows erupted from the ramparts, piercing countless membranes. But the Painted Skin Rakshasa's true form had already leaped onto the wall, appearing behind the Ghost General.

Soul-Stripping Claw!

The Painted Skin Rakshasa extended her right hand, transforming it into a scarlet bone claw. Its tips glimmered with a venomous, icy light as it silently pressed against the Ghost General's back.

Unaware, the Ghost General was instantly gutted, collapsing to the ground in a pool of blood.

With their commander slain, the city gate's defenses crumbled.

The Painted Skin Rakshasa let out a cold laugh, then shook her body, unleashing thousands of painted skins. Concealing her true form among them, she charged into Forgetful River Immortal City.

"Enemy attack!"

"A Nascent Soul Ghost General has already fallen!"

"Release the Three Paths Bewildering Miasma immediately! Activate the Three Paths Bewildering Heart Grand Formation!"

The alarm bells rang throughout the city.

To prepare for a grand strategy spanning centuries, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had stripped the Immortal City of nearly all its elite forces, leaving it historically vulnerable. The city's defenders had been on high alert for days.

The Painted Skin Rakshasa made no attempt to conceal her assault. Though her initial breach succeeded, it immediately triggered a full-scale response from Forgetful River Immortal City.

Three-colored miasma erupted from the ground, rapidly spreading to fill the entire city.

The Painted Skin Rakshasa's true form waded through the miasma, the swirling, ankle-deep mist shifting colors constantly.

Holding her breath, she felt the mere contact with the miasma affecting her, her Divine Soul growing unstable.

Buzz...

The entire Immortal City resonated with a low hum as countless Forgotten Thought Stones embedded in walls, eaves, and floor tiles lit up simultaneously.

The Three Paths Bewildering Heart Grand Formation had officially activated.

The Painted Skin Rakshasa secretly maintained her defensive measures, but as she walked, she began to sense something amiss.

"Where am I?"

"Which direction did I just come from?"

"What... what am I supposed to be doing?!"

She suddenly awoke, her heart turning to ice as she realized this formation could swiftly erase her memories, making her lose important recollections and gradually corrupt her will.

She hurriedly activated various magic treasures, but they proved ineffective.

With no other choice, she had to activate her primary cultivation technique. Radiant light flowed around her, and layer after layer of painted skins peeled away, using her own energy to counter the terrifying power of the Three Paths Bewildering Heart Grand Formation.

The streets of Immortal City twisted and stretched through the Bewildering Mist, seemingly endless. The Painted Skin Rakshasa, her resolve unshaken, endured the relentless drain on her reserves until she finally emerged from the thickest part of the mist. Through the swirling haze, the majestic City Lord's Mansion loomed faintly into view.

Without hesitation, she charged across the bridge straight toward the mansion.

"Foreigner, wait! Let this old one ferry you across, hm?" An elderly man piloted a black-roofed boat through the mist, blocking her path.

In his hand, he held a paper lantern that emitted a ghastly pale light.

Without hesitation, the Painted Skin Rakshasa charged toward the old man.

The old man sighed deeply and waved his sleeve, unleashing a torrent of paper scraps into the air.

The scraps expanded, transforming into human figures, horses, boats, and more. In an instant, a massive fleet had materialized, blocking all avenues of the Painted Skin Rakshasa's advance.

"A Papercraft Artisan?" The Painted Skin Rakshasa raised an eyebrow, sneering as she summoned thousands of faces to charge toward the fleet.

The clash erupted, the air reverberating with battle cries.

The Painted Skin Rakshasa and the Old Ferryman settled into a stalemate.

At the Offering of Calamity Altar, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God clashed with the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord. Though repeatedly battered and mostly on the defensive, the god's boundless reserves of Earth Lung Turbid Qi kept the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord occupied.

Hidden within a tributary of the Forgetful River, the true form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord suddenly stirred.

He had received intelligence of an attack on the Forgetful River Immortal City, detailing the Painted Skin Rakshasa's breach of the city walls and her confrontation with the Paper Boat Elder.

"Troubling."

"The Painted Skin Rakshasa is indeed within our Immortal City."

"Though the Immortal City Formation suppresses her, given her combat prowess, the Paper Boat Elder can only hold her back temporarily. Eventually, he won't be able to stop her."

The defense of Forgetful River Immortal City was woefully inadequate, leaving the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord with little confidence.

This desperate situation forced him to make a decisive move: he retrieved a treasured magic treasure!

The artifact was a pair of scissors, only three feet long, crafted entirely from an enigmatic, light-swallowing ancient jade. The handles depicted two Nether Dragons with gaping maws, their fangs clamping down on the blade roots. The curved blades, patterned with intricate scales resembling dragon spines, emitted a concentrated dark blue radiance from their edges.

The Nether Dragon Scissors!

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord would never have resorted to this magic treasure if not driven to desperation. But now, he had no choice but to rely on this precious artifact to break the deadlock.

"The Nine Nether Candleflame will eventually burn out. Go forth."

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord hurled the Nether Dragon Scissors into the battlefield.

As the scissors soared above the battlefield, they sent a violent tremor through the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord's heart!

With a flash of their eerie radiance, the scissors locked onto the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord and gently closed.

Click.

With a soft sound, the Soul-Hooking Spirit-Guiding Candle was severed at its midpoint, releasing countless snow-white sparks. The candle flame flickered and swiftly extinguished, and the wailing cries that filled the battlefield were abruptly silenced.

The Ghostfire Prefecture Lord flickered into motion.

The Nether Dragon Scissors, aimed at the Heart-Rending Bloodshed Candle, made another gentle snip.

The candle, dark crimson like tainted blood, shattered like a blood crystal. Its flame was instantly extinguished.

Yin Jiuzhu let out a muffled groan, suffering a recoil. His aura plummeted as he stared in disbelief at the Nether Dragon Scissors, inwardly roaring, "Is this supposed to be a national treasure?!"

Plunged into grave danger, he hastily grabbed the Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle and hurled it away.

The candle vanished, reappearing as an ice coffin that engulfed the Nether Dragon Scissors, freezing and suppressing it with all its might.

The scissors' movements slowed dramatically, now slicing toward Yin Jiuzhu.

A deathly crisis rang in Yin Jiuzhu's mind. The Yellow Springs Pathfinding Candle!

His composure shattered, he poured all his remaining strength into igniting the other treasured candle, summoning its dull yellow flame.

The firelight carved a narrow path through the air.

Without hesitation, the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord leaped onto the Scorched Bone Lotus Throne and fled down the flickering corridor, battered and defeated.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord exerted all his strength. His face was deathly pale, and he had nearly lost connection with the Nether Dragon Scissors, leaving the magic treasure sealed within the ice coffin.

Activating this treasured artifact consumed an utterly terrifying amount of energy!

Even as a Soul Transformation-level existence, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was on the verge of exhaustion and collapse.

With great effort, he gathered the waters of the Forgetful River around his body, then immediately fell into a deep slumber.
