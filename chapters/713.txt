Chapter 713: Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking!

The cultivators each chose a meditation cushion and settled into a seated posture.

Old Confucian Song Taosheng began by instructing them in the methods of Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking.

Both techniques required specific Magic Artifacts: hemp ropes for the former and wooden cones for the latter.

Kong Ran's face grew increasingly pale as he glanced around nervously, unable to remain still.

He desperately hoped someone would voluntarily withdraw, but his hopes were dashed as he saw the other cultivators either wearing solemn expressions or remaining completely expressionless, showing no intention of leaving.

Song Taosheng spoke slowly, "Each of you may select a classic text and employ these two methods to aid your studies. This Literary Temple has been specially prepared. Any attempt to cheat will be severely punished!"

This stern warning sent a chill through the crowd.

Without further delay, Song Taosheng abruptly declared the Rising Cloud Minor Trial officially underway.

Ning Zhuo didn't rush to act. Instead, he fell into deep thought.

He was inwardly conflicted: "I certainly have classic texts, but... which one should I choose to study?"

"Should I pick one I've already mastered?"

"Or a partially understood text that I haven't fully grasped?"

"Or perhaps a completely unfamiliar one?"

Ning Zhuo's dilemma wasn't unique to him; other Confucian cultivators faced the same quandary.

The main issue was that the selection criteria for the Rising Cloud Minor Trial had not been publicly announced. Without knowing the rules, everyone felt uncertain about how to proceed.

In the next moment, Bai Jiyun rose to his feet and bowed respectfully to Song Taosheng, asking for clarification.

Song Taosheng, his face impassive, shook his head. "This is part of the trial itself. Most of you are Confucian cultivators. If you were taking the Huawen Kingdom's national examination, would you ask the proctor for help with the questions?"

Bai Jiyun had no choice but to sit down.

The cultivators frowned, nearly all lowering their heads in thought, trying to decipher the evaluation criteria for the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

Only Ning Zhuo felt confident, realizing this rule favored him perfectly!

Liu Fushu gritted his teeth, resolving, "It seems I have no choice but to give it my all."

Kong Ran, however, clung to a sliver of hope. "Do we really have to do this? What if the trial is testing our wisdom in knowing when to abandon a hopeless task?"

Kong Ran knew this was just wishful thinking.

He truly didn't want to resort to the "Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking" method.

His childhood had been scarred by his father, Kong Zhaoming, during his early education.

Kong Ran's hopeful gaze swept across the room. "If anyone leaves, I'm going too! I'm getting out of here!"

"Ugh, if I'd known it was going to be like this, I wouldn't have come."

"Even sleeping in would be better than this," Kong Ran muttered.

At such a young age, Kong Ran was already bound by duty.

Bearing the title of child prodigy, he was one of the Kong Clan's public faces. His father served as one of the Flying Cloud Kingdom's current prime ministers, making Kong Ran's performance a reflection of Kong Zhaoming's reputation.

Burdened by fame, indeed!

Realizing that the Rising Cloud Minor Trial was subtly favoring him, Ning Zhuo set aside his earlier reservations.

He extended his divine sense into his Storage Belt, actively selecting the scriptures he would study next.

The Storage Belt contained a vast collection of texts:

The Ice Sculpture Secret Manual gifted by Ning Jiufan. The Serpentine Springing Array Collection from Elder Chen. The Blood Demon Dissection Minor Art, Dead Moon's Requiem, and Great Celestial Burial Canon that Ning Zhuo had purchased himself. Several Jiao Clan cultivation arts and a treasure map stored in their Jade Slip. The Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment chapters of the Myriad Phenomena Sutra. 

Old Chef's legacy Jade Slip, which recorded cultivation arts, recipes, and cultivation insights from the Dark Cuisine school. This served as both proof of his identity and an admission ticket to the Hundred Kingdoms Culinary Grand Competition. The Frost-Treading and Snow-Proud Enlightenment Diagrams, one of the Ning Clan's foundational treasures. Though merely illustrations, they could still be studied and contemplated. The invaluable military manual, Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings. The peculiar Netherworld Penal Code.

Ning Zhuo possessed a vast collection of texts on soul cultivation, including the Yin Bone Manual, Netherworld Heart Sutra, and Detailed Explanation of Soul Guiding Techniques. Most of these were thanks to the contributions of Tianshuang, one of the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts.

He had also recently mastered the Primordial Sound Reed Book.

After some deliberation, Ning Zhuo decided that revealing the soul cultivation techniques might have undesirable consequences. Therefore, he ultimately chose the Ice Sculpture Secret Manual.

Ning Zhuo had reviewed this manual several times before and was acutely aware of his own shortcomings - his carving skills, particularly the Inner Carving Technique, which required manipulating tools like brushes within the ice layer, were his greatest weakness. His constant travels and lack of time had led him to dismiss this technique as a minor detail, temporarily setting it aside as mere reference material for broadening his horizons.

During his most recent study session, Ning Zhuo used the Comprehension Brush to transcribe the book, gaining deeper, ineffable insights.

This time, he employed the Confucian technique of "Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking" to further comprehend the text.

Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged, his back straight as a pine tree. He channeled his spiritual energy, activated his divine sense, and manipulated the Magic Artifact rope.

The cinnabar-red rope stirred to life, coiling itself around Ning Zhuo's hair bun. The other end looped over a protruding beam at the top of the stone chamber behind him, dangling down and tightening with precisely calibrated force.

The hemp rope, tightly binding Ning Zhuo's hair at the roots, exerted a continuous, subtle pull, causing a faint, persistent ache as his scalp stretched taut.

Simultaneously, Ning Zhuo gripped a wooden awl and, with deliberate force, drove it into the outer side of his left thigh.

The boxwood awl pierced steadily through skin and flesh, sinking about an inch deep.

A sharp, direct pain surged through Ning Zhuo, relentlessly stimulating his senses.

Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking!

As one of the first cultivators to act, Ning Zhuo inevitably drew the attention of many.

His youthful face remained serene, as calm as a gentle breeze, not even a flicker of a frown crossing his brow.

Some cultivators were secretly astonished. Kong Ran's mouth hung slightly open, his thoughts a mix of panic and resistance: You're starting already?

Song Taosheng had been observing Ning Zhuo from the beginning.

Seeing Ning Zhuo's composure, he nodded inwardly, yet maintained his watchful stance: The Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking techniques I taught are ancient versions, so even non-Confucian cultivators can use them.

The key lies in whether the cultivator can overcome the pain and focus their mind on learning.

"If you suffer pain without gaining any scholarly progress, you'll have achieved nothing but needless suffering. It's a poor exchange."

Ning Zhuo fell into deep contemplation.

His mind focused on a passage from the Ice Sculpture Secret Manual that described how to construct a Formation within the intricate, intersecting ice ridges of an inner wall using the Micro-Sculpting Technique.

Previously, this passage had been like a layer of thin ice - seemingly transparent yet ultimately opaque.

How could the Formation Patterns intertwine and connect without compromising the structural integrity of the ice wall? How could Spiritual Energy maintain a balanced and smooth flow through the serpentine, circuitous pathways? He had pondered these questions repeatedly, yet always remained shrouded in a veil of confusion, unable to grasp the core principles.

But now, with the aid of Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking, everything had changed.

The scalp-stretching pain acted like an invisible hand, constantly clearing away the distractions and mental fog that arose during his contemplation.

The sharp pain in his thigh, meanwhile, was like a cold, clear spring, repeatedly washing over his thoughts, maintaining him in a state of near-frenzied, heightened acuity.

"So that's it!" Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with insight. "The key is 'layer without breaking, guide without obstructing'! It's not just about intersecting lines, but about using the ice wall's natural grain as a foundation, allowing the Formation Patterns to grow as naturally as ice crystals. Each carved line's depth and angle must align perfectly with the ice's internal structure - not forced into it!"

Like thin ice melting under sunlight, the long-standing puzzle that had plagued him finally dissolved into clarity.

"Effective!"

"These two Confucian cultivator Spells are working well."

Ning Zhuo cleared his mind of distractions, suppressed his excitement, and continued studying.

He could clearly feel his learning capacity had dramatically increased.

The refinement and shaping control of the Ice Soul, the precise manipulation of Spiritual Energy in the Inner Carving Technique, how to stably carve talismans in extreme cold, even how to enhance Formation Pattern effects by leveraging the ice's refractive properties - previously daunting concepts he had only superficially grasped were now being dissected, analyzed, and fully comprehended.

Layer after layer of thin ice shattered.

"Hmm? Interesting." Seeing Ning Zhuo immersed in his studies, undisturbed by pain and even showing a hint of enjoyment, Song Taosheng couldn't help but feel a grudging admiration.

Pain?

Ning Zhuo's resolve had been tempered long ago in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

The constant, scalp-tugging pain felt like a bell, dispelling fatigue and reminding him to stay focused.

The sharp, burning sensation on his outer thigh - like being pierced by red-hot needles - was as a gentle breeze, barely causing a ripple in his concentration. Though objectively present, his indomitable willpower effortlessly isolated and ignored it.

This level of "suffering" was no longer an obstacle but a tool, tamed by his will and forged into a weapon to sharpen his mind and pierce through illusions.

"My memory has improved dramatically - this is the power of the Head-Hanging Spell. My thoughts are like a drill, gaining piercing force that shatters previous learning barriers. This is the strength of the Cone Pricking Thighs Technique!"

Having finished the entire Ice Sculpture Secret Manual, Ning Zhuo felt a lingering sense of satisfaction.

His eyes gleaming, he quickly scanned the room and noticed nearly every cultivator was practicing Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking.

Occasional gasps of cold air punctuated the silence.

Only then did Ning Zhuo realize he hadn't noticed them before, completely immersed in his studies, his mind utterly focused and concentrated.

"What should I study next?"

A spiritual light flashed through Ning Zhuo's divine sea and vanished as quickly as it appeared.

Why not directly research the Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking methods?

Ning Zhuo began practicing Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking while simultaneously studying them.

His enhanced learning ability allowed him to make rapid progress.

"Awaken from indolence, reflect thrice upon oneself!"

"This constant, unavoidable, and subtle pain acts like a disciplinary ruler, striking the mind at every moment, leaving no room for complacency. It forcibly focuses attention on the present, perfectly embodying the Confucian principle of 'Solitary Prudence.'"

"Even without supervision, one must constantly reflect on oneself and maintain vigilance. The mind is forced into a state of extreme concentration, preventing distracting thoughts from arising. With unwavering focus, memory becomes profound and understanding becomes crystal clear."

Next came the Cone Pricking Thighs Technique.

"Through enduring pain, one gains insight!"

"Each sharp, piercing pain is like a thunderclap shattering the tranquil lake of the heart, instantly shattering all ingrained laziness. The mind surges into a state of extreme concentration, granting unparalleled mental clarity!"

As Ning Zhuo stabbed himself with the wooden cone, he focused his attention on the Upper Dantian within his divine sea.

With each thrust of the wooden cone, the Cone Pricking Thighs Technique triggered a torrent of thoughts to erupt from his divine sea.

These thoughts, refined like the tip of a sharpened cone, shed all superficiality and hesitation, becoming exceptionally sharp, direct, and focused. Using them to contemplate problems yielded penetrating insights.

The rope suspending him tightened with each pull, and the wooden cone pierced his thigh again and again.

Ning Zhuo gradually slipped into a state of selfless absorption.

Old Confucian Song Taosheng's gaze lingered increasingly on Ning Zhuo.

In the arena, few endured self-torture for such an extended period.

Many were forced to pause mid-attempt, tending to their wounds while observing their competitors. Consequently, many eyes converged on the few cultivators who persisted.

Among them was Ning Zhuo.

Kong Ran's pale face tightened as he gripped his wooden cone, staring at Ning Zhuo with wide-eyed astonishment.

In Kong Ran's mind, Ning Zhuo was a scion of a noble clan. He never imagined the latter capable of such endurance and self-discipline.

As his understanding deepened, Ning Zhuo's accumulated insights finally broke through the clouds, revealing the clear sky.

"The Confucian school values self-restraint. These two techniques - Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking - are the very embodiment of self-restraint."

Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking were methods of self-discipline. Head-Hanging involved enduring constant, mild discomfort to overcome laziness and self-indulgence. Thigh-Pricking, on the other hand, required enduring intense, sharp pain to overcome complacency, fear of difficulty, and mental fog.

"The sea of learning is boundless; diligence is the boat!"

"Pain is not the goal, but the raft to cross the river, the bell that sounds the alarm, the whetstone that sharpens the mind!"

"Therefore, pain is merely a tool - a means to temper the will, purify the spirit, focus the mind, and shatter illusions!"

"Thus, these methods don't enhance one's innate intelligence, but rather catalyze the cultivator's latent potential - willpower, focus, comprehension, and insight - through pain, pushing them far beyond their ordinary limits!"

On the surface, these techniques appear to be mere learning aids, but at their core lies the principle of "mind over matter: tempering the heart through suffering, achieving clarity through pain."

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and slowly opened his eyes.

He had finished studying.

He now possessed a deeper understanding and mastery of Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking.

Taking a rare moment to survey his surroundings, Ning Zhuo noticed that most of the other cultivators had already stopped studying, unable to endure the strain any longer.

Less than thirty percent of the cultivators remained, still persevering.

"It's time to use them to learn even more!" Ning Zhuo thought, a hint of excitement in his voice as he delved into another ancient text.

This time, he chose the Serpentine Springing Array Collection.

To his shame, Ning Zhuo had acquired this text long ago but had never found the time to study it in depth, leaving it to gather dust at the bottom of his storage box.

The book's author was the White Scale Hermit, a male snake demon who had been crippled and forced to rely on mechanical prosthetics.

The Jade Slip recorded various formations designed for both mechanical and flesh-and-blood serpentine bodies.

Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking!

Ning Zhuo threw himself into his studies with all his might, making remarkable progress.

The rope binding his hair tightened, gradually emitting faint creaking sounds. The blood-soaked holes in his thighs multiplied, crimson liquid trickling down his legs.

More and more cultivators gave up.

Liu Fushu, drenched in cold sweat from the pain, was forced to stop.

Bai Jiyun, ever pragmatic, was among the first to withdraw. Had Song Taosheng not sealed the temple doors, he would have left long ago.

"Are the rope and wooden cones he's using really the same as mine?" Kong Ran murmured, his mouth slightly agape in bewilderment and shock.

Song Taosheng's gaze, now completely unreserved, fixed directly on Ning Zhuo, his eyes brimming with undisguised admiration. "I never expected this kid to endure such grueling study! Wen Ruanyu's recommendation was spot-on."

"Even without our support, a youth like this would inevitably rise to prominence!"

Ning Zhuo had lost himself entirely, completely immersed in the sheer joy of learning.

"This is exhilarating! This pace is truly addictive!"

"When I return to Greenstone Cave Mansion and combine the Comprehension Brush with the Luoshu Pages, what wonders will unfold then?"

At this thought, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but smile, his face radiating anticipation for the future.

"Is this guy some kind of freak?!" It was this very smile that finally broke the last competitor, who had been stubbornly clinging on.

In the end, only Ning Zhuo remained.

Song Taosheng nodded and murmured, "Excellent."

With such a clear outcome, there was no need for any further manipulation.

He immediately announced, "This big-headed youth, you are the victor of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial!"

No one objected.

However, Ning Zhuo, completely absorbed in his studies, didn't even hear Song Taosheng's words.

Thwack, thwack. His arm moved relentlessly, repeatedly stabbing his thigh with the needle, making Song Taosheng's eye twitch slightly.
