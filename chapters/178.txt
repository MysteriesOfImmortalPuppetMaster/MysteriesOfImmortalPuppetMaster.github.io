Chapter 178: How Arrogant Can a Branch Family Be?

In the combined team of three families, the five Qi Refining Stage geniuses were the undisputed leaders and the core figures in battle.

Any combat plan essentially revolved around these five individuals.

Ning Zhuo's ability to conceal his true strength proved advantageous at this moment.

He resolved to listen carefully, remember everything, and then devise countermeasures.

Ning Zhuo and the other four entered a secret chamber.

The chamber was arranged like a classroom, with a middle-aged cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Stage standing at the front.

The five found their seats.

"I am Zheng Hua," the middle-aged cultivator introduced himself. "Today, I will explain the general strategy for this joint operation." Ning Zhuo immediately recalled Zheng Hua's background information.

Zheng Hua was a mid-Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator who had already become an elder of the Zheng family despite his relatively young age.

This was mainly due to his innate talent—Golden Stone Opening—which allowed him to handle many difficult-to-refine materials.

Moreover, Zheng Hua was highly skilled in artifact crafting, having reached the level of a grandmaster.

He was one of the top artifact refiners in the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Zheng Hua released his magical power, which condensed in mid-air to form the lifelike image of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

"This mechanical ape should be familiar to everyone, or more accurately, it should leave a deep impression," Zheng Hua said.

Zhou Zeshen, Zhou Zhu, Zheng Di, and others all wore solemn expressions.

Ning Xiaohui's face was even more grim, while Ning Zhuo furrowed his brows.

Zheng Hua continued, "Based on the current intelligence, this mechanical ape is primarily a close-combat construct. Its body is likely made of Vermilion Fire Glazed Glass, a material refined from Vermilion Flame Stone. Ice techniques are the best countermeasure against this material."

"Its skeleton likely contains Crimson Gold Black Iron, with defensive inscriptions on its surface. Judging by the inscriptions and its combat performance, it probably employs the Vajra Body Protection Technique. Therefore, using lightning techniques to erode these inscriptions is also a viable tactic."

"The mechanical ape's head likely houses a specialized computational component. If we can destroy this, it would greatly impact its combat effectiveness. The ape's combat prowess mainly stems from its sophisticated martial techniques, which require high computational capabilities."

"If we can't destroy its head, then its hands are the next target. Its palms likely conceal multiple martial arts talismans. Destroying these talismans would also weaken its combat abilities." Zheng Hua's analysis eased the tension among the five.

Next, Zheng Hua's magical power condensed again, transforming from Yuan Dasheng into the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai.

"This mechanical puppet, although it appears less frequently, is even more threatening than the mechanical ape," Zheng Hua said, his expression growing more serious.

"Its skeleton is made of Nether Blue Dark Iron, and parts of its bones are replaced with Soul Wood. While we can't determine the exact age of the Soul Wood, it should be at least a hundred years old, judging by the mechanical ape's specifications."

"However, these materials alone wouldn't allow the puppet to control so many ghosts. It must have other crucial components aiding in ghost manipulation. This puppet can weaken souls with its attacks, resembling the Soul Devouring Technique based on its magical power fluctuations."

"Its neck contains a component that can emit sound waves, causing severe soul tremors. Once activated, it's difficult to defend against with just our own abilities. Its eyes are a critical design element, made of mixed materials with unknown powers. I suspect they hide some kind of trump card."

"The puppet's body has numerous ejection ports that can rapidly spray Yin-attributed silk. This silk can instantly form a protective black robe with excellent defensive capabilities. To counter this, we might use mud techniques to block these ejection ports."

"Lastly, this ghost puppet has at least two arrays and eighteen talismans, making it a long-range combat construct. Close-quarters combat is strongly recommended." The five's expressions grew serious again, realizing the limited intelligence on the ghost puppet made it a formidable opponent.

Ning Zhuo's brows furrowed further as he thought, "Too much information has been leaked. Zheng Hua's analysis is almost spot-on, truly worthy of being one of the Zheng family's top artifact refiners."

Regarding the Soul Devouring Technique, although it was identified, no one linked it to the Soul Devouring Sect.

Due to the existence of various modified versions, the technique wasn't exclusive to the sect, though its disciples wielded it more powerfully.

In fact, the Soul Devouring Technique existed long before the sect's founding, rumored to originate from one of the ten ancient beasts, the Ghost Devouring Soul Swallowing Beast.

The Ghost Devouring Soul Swallowing Beast was thirty zhang long, resembling a lion-tiger hybrid with a massive, muscular body.

Its limbs were powerful, and its claws sharp as blades.

Its body was covered in dark scales that emitted a faint glow at night.

The beast had three eyes, with the central one capable of seeing ghosts.

Its wide mouth and sharp teeth could easily tear apart any soul.

Its tail was snake-like, ending in a head that held a blue-glowing pearl, capable of storing endless soul power.

The beast's back had large black wings, resembling bat wings, allowing it to fly swiftly and easily catch fleeing ghosts.

Zheng Hua dispersed his magical power and looked seriously at the five. "These are just our current intelligence estimates. We can't rule out the possibility that our full mobilization might increase the difficulty, making these constructs even stronger. We also can't rule out the appearance of a third or even fourth construct. Any questions?"

Zhou Zeshen was the first to ask, "These are mechanical constructs. Why not target this aspect? Have we discovered the control methods for these constructs?" Zheng Hua shook his head. "No."

"Classic control methods like strings, rods, or divine sense don't fit these constructs' situations. We suspect they are controlled by spiritual means."

"The Lava Immortal Palace has the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, capable of controlling mechanical puppets. Previously, during a demonic beast siege, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit allegedly deployed a humanoid puppet to control the battlefield. Here is the related battle footage for everyone to review." Zheng Hua handed a jade slip to the five.

When it reached Ning Zhuo, he pressed it to his forehead, seeing the defensive battle at the volcano's peak and the deployment of a Golden Core Stage puppet master.

"This must be when Brother Sun and I fought Cheng Bai. Who recorded this footage? To operate under Meng Kui's nose is impressive! This angle seems to be from a distant view?" Ning Zhuo immediately thought of Zhu Xuanji.

He guessed correctly.

Zhu Xuanji had indeed provided the jade slip to the three families' Golden Core ancestors, who then copied and distributed it to their respective families.

While the others reviewed the jade slip, Zheng Hua continued, "If these constructs are indeed spiritually controlled, then the mechanical ape and ghost puppet can be considered spiritual treasures."

"Spiritual treasures?!" Zheng Jin couldn't help but exclaim.

From talismans to magical artifacts, to spiritual treasures, the latter were the highest quality.

The ultimate treasures of super sects, families, and cultivation nations were invariably spiritual treasures.

"This person seems to be my family's Golden Core ancestor?" Ning Zhuo saw the scene of the Ning family ancestor being forced to retreat by a walnut, but he remained expressionless as he passed the jade slip to the next person.

"The three families' understanding of Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai is already quite deep. They even guessed the truth of spiritual control! As expected, families that can become major forces in an Immortal City have deep foundations and strength, not to be underestimated. However, they only guessed part of it; they are still some distance from the truth." This wasn't their fault; they simply lacked crucial intelligence.

Once they had it, they could quickly piece together the truth.

"If they had reached the coffin chamber and learned the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra, they would soon suspect Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai's true identities. But I've already raised all the stone walls of the Buddhist and Demonic Gates." Previously, Ning Zhuo had a flaw.

In the second transfer hall, the Buddhist and Demonic Gates were still visible.

However, with the Life Thread Divine Ability nearing perfection and Ning Zhuo's significant progress in cultivation and soul power, he finally managed to fully block the Buddhist and Demonic Gates with stone walls.

Ning Zhuo deliberately said, "With only this intelligence, I don't think we have a high chance of defeating the mechanical ape and ghost puppet. I suggest postponing the action, continuing our investigation, and gathering more comprehensive intelligence. Once fully prepared, we can then explore the Lava Immortal Palace in force."

Zhou Zeshen immediately looked at Ning Zhuo with admiration, thinking, "Ning Zhuo shares my thoughts; we're both thinkers."

Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly, "Ning Zhuo, why are you so cowardly before the battle? You want to gather intelligence? We can use this opportunity to fight the damned mechanical ape properly! By dismantling it, we can gather crucial information!"

Ning Zhuo retorted, "Ning Xiaohui, I know you've often been defeated by the mechanical ape and are eager for revenge. But that doesn't mean you can fight recklessly. Your rashness will only lead to more failures!"

"You!" Ning Xiaohui glared, filled with anger and disbelief.

No one, especially not a peer, had ever spoken to her so rudely before.

Ning Zhuo was the first, and he did so in front of outsiders, directly mocking her.

"You, a mere branch family member..." Ning Xiaohui gritted her teeth, her eyes practically spitting fire.

Ning Zhuo interrupted mercilessly, "You, a main family member, can't even achieve half of my accomplishments. What does that make you?" Ning Xiaohui stood up abruptly, her body emanating cold air.

A ghostly figure, as white and cold as snow, rose from her body, glaring at Ning Zhuo with a sinister expression. "When did the Ning family branch become so arrogant?"

Ning Zhuo's pupils contracted as he quickly leaped back, maintaining distance and keeping a close eye on the ghost. "What are you?!"

The ghost trembled with rage, "I am also of the Ning family main branch!!"
