Chapter 371: Inviting the Ancestor to Leave Seclusion! (Special Holiday Update!):

Han Zhou couldn't help but size up Ning Zhuo from head to toe. "The 'Enlightenment Diagrams' are far more valuable than the bit of bitter water I gave you. That bitter water—well, I can refine more of it now, so losing some isn't a big deal."

"But you and I have only met twice before, and this is just our third meeting. You're lending me these two diagrams so easily?"

"Aren't you worried I might take these two diagrams and leave the Myriad Medicine Sect for good?"

"You should know that any 'Enlightenment Diagram' is a priceless heirloom."

Han Zhou's bitter water is incredibly difficult to ingest. If someone unqualified drinks it, they could suffer dire consequences. However, the 'Enlightenment Diagrams' don't have such severe drawbacks.

The bitter water contains the true essence of the Bitter Cold Sutra. Absorbing too much of it can sway a cultivator's heart, inclining them towards the Bitter Cold Sutra, potentially causing them to abandon their current cultivation method and start anew.

The 'Enlightenment Diagrams', on the other hand, are simply spells and don’t involve changing one's cultivation method, making them much more versatile.

Ning Zhuo smiled quietly, thinking to himself, "Of course I'm not afraid. I’ve already planted the 'Life Thread' on you. I can sense your location at any time."

Outwardly, he waved it off. "The value of the 'Enlightenment Diagrams' only manifests when they're in the hands of someone who can use them."

"Brother Han, you generously gifted me your bitter water, from which I’ve gained great benefit. I should repay the favor."

"The ancients said, 'A drop of water should be repaid with a spring of gratitude.' I may not live up to that ideal, but lending you two 'Enlightenment Diagrams' is the least I can do."

"Just return them to me before I leave Little Contention Peak and continue my travels. After all, these are Ning family treasures, not my personal belongings."

Han Zhou, seeing that Ning Zhuo wasn't just making a show but was genuinely lending them, was momentarily stunned.

"This kid—no, this young man really does carry himself like a member of a great family."

"Then again, this could also be the result of intentional training by a noble family, a social tactic..."

Buddha Heart Demon Seal!

"To be honest, I've met countless people, and with my beggar-like appearance, very few treat me with any respect."

"Even those who ask for my help, like Li Jingqing and the like—although they're much weaker than me, they still boss me around."

"To lend two 'Enlightenment Diagrams' after just the third meeting... Ning Zhuo, you're indeed magnanimous!"

Han Zhou’s respect quickly overshadowed his doubts.

He thought again about his own scheme.

"I haven’t been entirely sincere with Ning Zhuo. Secretly, I’ve been plotting to convert him, to make him switch to cultivating the Bitter Cold Sutra."

"No, no, no—he has such a natural affinity for the Bitter Cold Sutra. Is his current cultivation really suitable for him? By pushing him in this direction, I’m actually helping him, aren’t I?"

Buddha Heart Demon Seal!

"Even so, I’ve been calculating against him, haven’t I?"

"But Ning Zhuo treats me with such genuine kindness!"

"Sigh, I’ve handled this poorly, and now I feel guilty..."

Han Zhou felt both admiration and guilt.

Ning Zhuo had spent sixteen years in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, studying human nature. He could subtly activate a trace of the 'Buddha Heart Demon Seal', influencing others.

Now, he had mastered the divine ability 'Life Thread'. Once the thread was planted, as long as they were within a few paces of each other, Ning Zhuo could, using a combination of the 'Life Thread' and the 'Buddha Heart Demon Seal', sense the faintest thoughts and emotions of others.

Though the impressions were vague, they were enough for Ning Zhuo to make educated guesses based on his understanding of human nature. This allowed him to tailor his responses accordingly, amplifying or diminishing their thoughts.

With the 'Life Thread' and 'Buddha Heart Demon Seal' working together, Ning Zhuo had a significant advantage in interpersonal interactions.

Han Zhou’s favorable impression of him grew, and the key was that it felt completely natural, like a gentle rain soaking into the earth. He never suspected anything was amiss. He only believed that these were his own thoughts.

Han Zhou thought he was converting Ning Zhuo, but in reality, he was the one being subtly guided by Ning Zhuo.

In order to ease his own guilt, Han Zhou was even more dedicated during their sparring sessions.

When the two parted, Han Zhou took the initiative to suggest, "Friend Ning Zhuo, if you're struggling with executing the martial arts from the Bitter Cold Sutra, I happen to know a technique that might help."

Ning Zhuo replied, "Oh? What method?"

Han Zhou smiled, "It's nothing extraordinary, really—it's just Mechanism Arts."

"I noticed that when you use the Five Elements spells, you sometimes employ mechanical arms for assistance in battle."

"So I thought, perhaps you could use mechanisms to overcome the obstacles in executing those martial arts!"

Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up, and he sincerely thanked Han Zhou.

After they parted ways, Ning Zhuo reflected deeply, "I was careless."

"I got so caught up in the excitement of my gains that I overlooked something so simple. I’m skilled in Mechanism Arts, so why didn’t I think of this earlier?"

"Is it because I have the Demonic Bloodline Conversion Art that allows me to adapt, so I didn’t think beyond that?"

"Or is it because I’ve been relying too much on myself in combat and temporarily set aside the Mechanism Arts?"

"No, these aren't valid excuses."

"It’s because I’ve grown arrogant. Since entering the Myriad Medicine Sect, I’ve realized that the combination of the 'Buddha Heart Demon Seal' and 'Life Thread' gives me such a huge advantage in social interactions. I can easily gain significant benefits without the need for conflict or long-term trust-building."

"Ning Zhuo, you still have a long way to go."

"Your cultivation is only at the early Foundation Establishment Stage stage. You’ve barely begun working on the mechanism designs for the Dark Night Tiger. Your knowledge of cultivation is shallow, and while you've improved in Wood-based spells, the other four elements are lacking."

"Your resources are heavily depleted, and you haven’t resolved these issues yet."

"Plus, the Spirit Plant Chamber of the Ten Thousand Mile Wandering Dragon is barely set up. The Spirit Concealing Willow is consuming a lot, and the mechanism dragon itself demands fire..."

"And most importantly, your mother’s injuries are still being treated, but you haven’t found a permanent cure yet!"

As Ning Zhuo pondered these things, his mind calmed, and a steady, humble aura settled over him.

He returned to the Yuanlai Mountain and, as expected, was blocked from entry once more.

When he inquired about Lin Shanshan’s whereabouts, he was scolded for asking about things he shouldn't.

From this, Ning Zhuo realized that the Myriad Medicine Sect's envoys sent to Fire Persimmon Immortal City hadn’t returned yet. If they had, the negotiations would have advanced, and their attitude wouldn't be so cold.

"These Myriad Medicine Sect people are moving too slowly, aren't they?"

"By my calculations, my letter should have already reached Fire Persimmon Immortal City."

Given the distance between Myriad Medicine Valley and Fire Persimmon Mountain, Ning Zhuo’s own flying message technique could only travel five or six miles before losing accuracy, and ten miles before his magic power would run out.

His message had been sent through the courier system.

In cultivation nations like South Bean Country, there are official couriers set up to deliver messages, transport goods, and provide lodging, food, and training environments.

These stations are guarded by troops.

The troops at large stations, when mobilized, could even wipe out local sects or factions.

Ning Zhuo’s letter had been passed along through these stations, eventually reaching its destination—Fire Persimmon Mountain.

At the mountain's peak.

Lava Immortal Palace.

After much effort, Meng Kui had finally pieced together the missing parts of the palace and restored a small portion of its power.

Many cultivators worked around the restored parts, busy setting up arrays and formations like diligent bees.

Meng Kui hadn’t taken on all the detailed work himself. Instead, he had hired talent through the Meng family’s connections, recruiting skilled cultivators from all over South Bean Country’s immortal cities.

Even the city lord's office of Fire Persimmon Immortal City had covered a portion of the costs.

This financial contribution was the reason Fei Si had been gloomy all day, feeling immense pressure on the city's budget.

Ning Jiufan and Zhou Nongying had been invited to the Lava Immortal Palace to discuss important matters with Meng Kui.

Meng Kui displayed a scene of the deep interior of Fire Persimmon Mountain.

In the vast sea of magma, lava surged like rivers. A radiant spirit danced in and out of the molten sea, playing joyfully.

Sometimes it took the form of a fiery demon ape, tearing through the magma with powerful arms and stirring up fierce winds. Other times it became a flame mouse, darting about like lightning. Occasionally, it transformed into a flame serpent, majestic and untamed. And then it would shift into a fire lizard, exuding a commanding presence.

At times, it even took on a human shape, clad in a robe of flames, sitting cross-legged in the sea of fire, mimicking the practice of cultivation!

During these moments, the surrounding flames seemed drawn to it by some invisible force, gathering around but respectfully keeping their distance, as if subjects were paying homage to their king.

Every subtle movement of the fire spirit resonated with the surrounding flames, creating dazzling fire vortices, beautiful and breathtaking.

Meng Kui said, "As you can see, this is a ten-thousand-year fire spirit!"

Zhou Nongying and Ning Jiufan were momentarily speechless, deeply astonished.

A ten-thousand-year fire spirit was a treasure that surpassed the Nascent Soul stage, reaching the Void Refining level!

Meng Kui continued, "The volcanic eruption earlier brought it up from the deep underground. I discovered it by chance while monitoring the Lava Immortal Palace."

"Today, I’ve gathered you both to discuss a way to capture it."

Ning Jiufan, concerned, said, "Given our current strength, capturing it would be extremely difficult. It holds too great an advantage with its control over the terrain, and the Lava Immortal Palace is still far from being battle-ready."

Zhou Nongying sighed, "Though that’s true, this is something we must do, and we can’t delay for long. Look—this fire spirit has already begun to take human form. Although the shape is still rough and retains many beastly features, it's clear that it’s developing."

"I believe it was initially drawn to the volcanic eruption and discovered that it could absorb spiritual energy here, which is why it lingers."

"Many cultivators lost their lives exploring the Lava Immortal Palace."

"It’s this influx of spiritual energy that has accelerated the fire spirit’s evolution. If it fully takes human form, its intelligence will increase dramatically, and the difficulty of capturing it will multiply tenfold!"

Ning Jiufan remained silent.

A fire spirit with human intelligence, unrestrained by any rules and possessing immense natural power, would undoubtedly pose a significant threat to the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Meng Kui decisively stated, "The two of you should make preparations. Once everything is ready, we’ll lure it out and attempt to capture it.

"Friend Ning Jiufan, I know you have a 'Fire Core Pomegranate'. Please lend it to me so we can use it in the trap. You will be fairly compensated."

Ning Jiufan agreed.

Upon returning to his clan, a servant handed him a letter from Ning Zhuo.

As Ning Jiufan read, he muttered, "Hmm? That kid has gone to Myriad Medicine Valley? Back in the day..."

Reading further, his brow furrowed. "What? He’s suggesting I bring along Granny Yuan for this trip?"
