Chapter 800: Undercurrents

After the class, Duanmu Zhang once again gathered the Confucian cultivators of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

"Mind Theory is profound; hearing it today has been truly beneficial," he first praised, before bringing up old matters again.

Having sat in on the second public class and having consulted Zhao Hansheng today, Duanmu Zhang's estimation of Mind Theory had soared. This, in turn, strengthened his resolve regarding how to handle the old matter of Qin De.

Situ Gu was the first to echo the sentiment, believing they should let Zhao Hansheng, as the Academy Head, resolve the issue of Qin De.

"Only by refuting the Sacred Bandit Scripture can our path forward in the Myriad Manifestations Sect be opened once again!"

"And this is something that none of us present can achieve. Only Zhao Hansheng can do it - only using the Mind Theory!"

Situ Gu spoke with powerful resonance, his stance unwavering.

Among the group of Confucian cultivators, he was the first to lean toward the teacher-student pair of Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing. With Zhao Hansheng becoming the Academy Head, Situ Gu stood to benefit the most.

In the past, due to his temperament and other reasons, he had been a peripheral figure within the group. But now, he was being heavily relied upon by Zhao Hansheng, and his entire demeanor had changed.

In the crowd, Chu Xuangui scanned the room and looked toward Song Taosheng, seeing a look of hesitation on the latter's face as well.

Chu Xuangui sighed inwardly and shook his head, saying, "The matter of Qin De must be resolved. However, everyone, I have my doubts."

"You all attended this public class and surely saw the entire process of Ning Zhuo seeking guidance with your own eyes."

As Chu Xuangui spoke, he paced forward, stepping out of the crowd to stand between Duanmu Zhang and the rest of the group.

Stroking his beard, he said, "Ning Zhuo's question was about maintaining the essence of the Unity of Knowledge and Action when delusive thoughts arise... this question strikes directly at a critical juncture of cultivation."

"Yet, Zhao Hansheng’s answer today was filled with classic citations and shrouded in mist. It appeared profound, but was actually hollow."

"Think carefully, everyone. Did Zhao Hansheng say a single word that clearly told Ning Zhuo 'specifically' what to do in that moment? He simply repackaged the question in even more cryptic language and threw it back at him."

The hall fell silent. Even Situ Gu found it difficult to offer a rebuttal. This was an iron-clad fact.

Duanmu Zhang sighed in his heart. How could he not have noticed this scene today? His own doubts were no fewer than Chu Xuangui's.

Chu Xuangui’s gaze swept lightly across the room. Seeing the reaction, he knew his point had landed and decisively continued: "Zhao Hansheng promised to teach us the essentials of Mind Theory. This was the exchange for us supporting him as 'Academy Head.' He ought to be a model teacher, preaching the Dao and imparting knowledge. Yet today’s actions were merely throwing out these difficult and obscure principles. On the surface, he is giving his all; in reality, he is leading the questioner into a deeper maze."

"Everyone, even if Gu Qing and Ning Zhuo have their conflicts, the blame does not lie there."

Chu Xuangui spread his hands. "Young Master Ning Zhuo shares a tacit understanding with us. Now that the third Confucian minor trial is approaching, Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing have intervened. Ning Zhuo is a young genius with a bit of a temper; it is only natural and grounded for him to seek retaliation."

"Gu Qing was schemed against and fell into a difficult situation, triggering a series of trials - this is exactly what he sought by traveling the world."

"But now, Zhao Hansheng is disregarding his own position as a teacher because of his student’s personal feud."

"In that case, his previous claims about wanting to benefit from Master Wang Xinyue and wanting to spread the concepts of Mind Theory - are they perhaps mostly just slogans?"

"Beneath those slogans, does he have unspeakable private motives hidden behind a polished mask?"

No one in the hall answered. This was because Chu Xuangui had spoken exactly what was in everyone's minds. This was precisely what the Confucian cultivators were worried about!

Even if the Confucian group had their moments of naivety or their pure pursuit of knowledge, they were well-read and far from stupid. Judging a person by their actions made more sense to them. Today, Zhao Hansheng’s treatment of Ning Zhuo had deeply disappointed everyone, leaving them all suspicious.

Situ Gu gritted his teeth and said with some effort, "To put it at the very worst, even if Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing do have private motives, I still believe that based solely on what he taught in these two classes, it is worth it."

The Confucian cultivators looked at each other, and some couldn't help but nod. This was also something they all agreed on. Mind Theory was indeed a peerless treasure, especially for Confucian cultivators!

Chu Xuangui agreed with this point as well, so he remained silent, merely looking at Duanmu Zhang.

Although Zhao Hansheng had become the Academy Head, it had been a very short time, and he was an outsider. He had previously declared that he would step down as Academy Head and continue traveling the world. Therefore, for the time being, the leader of the Confucian group within the main gates of the Myriad Manifestations Sect was still Duanmu Zhang. This old scholar’s influence remained paramount.

Duanmu Zhang remained silent for a long while before slowly speaking: "Since that is the case, let us not speak of this matter for the time being."

He sighed in his heart. Originally, he had gathered everyone to push this matter forward. But following Chu Xuangui’s opposition, Duanmu Zhang also discovered the hesitation in his own heart. In any case, the Qin De matter had been going on for so long; if it was to be resolved, a little more time wouldn't hurt.

As the Confucian cultivators dispersed, Chu Xuangui looked worried. He wasn't against resolving the Qin De issue, but he was against exposing such an old matter to an outsider so hastily. Crucially, this outsider had yet to prove himself.

Although he thought highly of Ning Zhuo and was willing to give him a helping hand, at this moment, he had pushed that excellent junior to the back of his mind. He was seeking his own interests and the interests of the entire Confucian group.

"Lord Wen Ruanyu supports Ning Zhuo more than I do."

"Ning Zhuo and Gu Qing have a falling out, and after today's class, Ning Zhuo's impression of Zhao Hansheng won't be good either."

"Perhaps his side can be utilized as well."

Thinking of this, Chu Xuangui immediately decided to write another letter to Wen Ruanyu to explain the details. Wen Ruanyu held a status similar to his own, possessed outstanding painting skills, and was one of the pillars of the Confucian group. Wen Ruanyu had a lot of influence. Furthermore, Wen Ruanyu’s views aligned with his, as did his stance - he was perhaps even more opposed than Chu Xuangui.

They were natural allies.

The previous discussions, as well as today's, had made Chu Xuangui realize that his former ally, Song Taosheng, was gradually shifting away and would be hard to rely on. Therefore, he could only look for more steadfast, like-minded individuals.

The seemingly simple second public class had actually triggered more undercurrents behind the scenes. The gambits and clashes within the Righteous Path were playing out in every corner.

It was true for the Confucian group, and it was also true between Zhao Hansheng and Zhu Guizhi.

-----
Zhao Hansheng personally brewed tea, the steam rising in misty swirls.

Zhu Guizhi sat directly across from Zhao Hansheng. "Senior Zhao, I am overwhelmed by the honor of your personal invitation."

Zhu Guizhi only had a Golden Core cultivation, while Zhao Hansheng was at the Nascent Soul stage. It was only proper for her to refer to herself as a junior.

Zhao Hansheng’s expression was peaceful. "Madam is being too polite. Regarding the previous incident at the martial arts arena, although Gu Qing was defeated, he also benefited greatly. I should actually thank that child, Fenxiang, for showing him that there is always someone better."

Since Zhu Fenxiang had gone all out to defeat Gu Qing at the arena, Zhao Hansheng, as his teacher, had done many things in the shadows to help Gu Qing identify and fix his weaknesses. One of those actions was establishing secret communication with Zhu Fenxiang.

This move had brought an unexpected pleasant surprise - Zhu Guizhi.

Zhu Guizhi had been staying by her daughter’s side and learned immediately when Zhao Hansheng sent someone to visit. She was currently having a massive headache over Zhu Fenxiang’s stubbornness, feeling that making an enemy of Gu Qing’s side was truly unwise. Now that Zhao Hansheng had proactively extended an olive branch, she was naturally only too happy to accept. Thus, today’s secret meeting took place.

"Fenxiang has been competitive since she was a child," Zhu Guizhi sighed softly, a delicate teacup turning slightly between her fingertips. "This time, she is determined to fight for a top-tier position. She is set on winning every match in the martial arts arena."

Zhu Guizhi offered a slight explanation for why Zhu Fenxiang had fought with all her strength. She kept the most critical secret to herself, not breathing a word about her daughter's feelings for Ning Zhuo.

Hearing this, Zhao Hansheng nodded slowly. "I see that Little Friend Fenxiang has extraordinary talent and superlative strength. That top-tier genius position is well within her reach."

He changed the subject. "Precisely because of this, this old man wants to lend her a hand. For instance, the upcoming Confucian Rising Cloud Minor Trial - I sincerely invite her to participate."

Zhao Hansheng did not simply gloss over the previous battle at the martial arts hall; he displayed the sophistication and style of a person of the Righteous Path. Instead, he wanted to "help" Zhu Fenxiang.

Zhu Guizhi’s eyes flickered slightly. She naturally knew that the three Confucian tests were no small matter. They were large in scale, and Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng had already recruited many Confucian cultivators. Speaking of which, the Confucian group of the Myriad Manifestations Sect had been quite active from the start of this Flying Cloud Assembly, and the Rising Cloud Minor Trials they held were becoming larger and larger.

Zhu Guizhi immediately said tentatively, "Fenxiang is very selective about the tests she participates in now, trying her best to secure first place."

Zhao Hansheng chuckled. "Then, Little Friend Fenxiang can certainly show off her skills in this Confucian minor test and aim for the top spot. However, I will be blunt: the competition involves paper-making, which involves many Confucian resources, such as Literary Qi and Literary Heart."

"Looking at the entire main sect, I'm afraid my student, Gu Qing, is more specialized in this area."

Zhao Hansheng’s meaning was clear - he believed his student, Gu Qing, should take the top spot in this minor trial.

Zhu Guizhi understood perfectly. She didn't speak for the moment, waiting for Zhao Hansheng’s following words.

Sure enough, Zhao Hansheng said, "If Little Friend Fenxiang can participate, she will naturally receive benefits that others cannot."

"This minor test will be themed around paper-making," Zhao Hansheng explained unhurriedly. "There are five types of paper: Noble, Starry, Mountain and River, Heartfire, and... Dao-Bearing Jade Pages."

Upon hearing the words "Dao-Bearing Jade Pages," Zhu Guizhi’s hand holding the teacup stiffened imperceptibly.

Zhao Hansheng took in her reaction and continued, "Although the top spot is out of reach, the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages are a genuine opportunity. Besides that - "

He paused deliberately. "During the minor trial, I will publicly express my high regard for Little Friend Fenxiang and give her a generous personal reward."

The conditions had been set. Zhao Hansheng began to drink his tea, waiting for Zhu Guizhi’s reaction.

Zhu Guizhi fully understood Zhao Hansheng's intentions. Gu Qing had suffered a string of setbacks recently - first being publicly defeated by Ning Zhuo at the martial arts arena, losing all face; then being suppressed by Zhu Fenxiang’s full-strength attack, causing his reputation to plummet again. He desperately needed a victory to restore his prestige.

The trade Zhao Hansheng wanted to create was this: Zhu Fenxiang would win against Gu Qing in the arena, but then "lose" to him in the Confucian minor trial. This way, Gu Qing could reclaim his reputation, while Zhu Fenxiang would gain tangible benefits.

Zhu Guizhi’s mind raced. The temptation of the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages was truly great. According to what Zhao Hansheng said, the cultivators participating in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial would very likely learn how to make them. If they could obtain this method, it would be of immense benefit to the entire clan! And bringing the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages back to the family would surely be a massive merit for her!

Furthermore, this move could greatly ease the relationship with Zhao Hansheng’s side, turning an enemy into a friend, which had a hundred benefits and not a single drawback.

Zhu Guizhi set down her teacup, her voice firm. She first expressed her gratitude, then said, "As her mother, I will take the liberty of deciding this for her."

"Please forgive me, I must take my leave now to bring this good news to my daughter."

Zhao Hansheng nodded slightly. "Very well."

Watching Zhu Guizhi’s departing figure, he was also quite satisfied. If the Zhu family could be turned from an enemy into a friend, wouldn't he, Zhao Hansheng, also benefit significantly? Publicly showing favor to Zhu Fenxiang and giving her a heavy reward was both a gesture of goodwill and a way to use the Zhu family - a local super power in the Flying Cloud Kingdom - as a bargaining chip to stabilize his own footing.

As for the personal reward coming out of his own pocket, while it was precious, once it was given, it was gone; it was nothing to be regretful about.

Only... he suddenly remembered the situation in the classroom during the day, and his brow furrowed almost imperceptibly.

Zhao Hansheng subconsciously touched the warm jade pendant at his waist.

At that moment, just as he was prepared to seriously answer Ning Zhuo’s question, this precious pendant had suddenly vibrated. Zhao Hansheng understood immediately - it was a Qi Luck warning!

An intuition from the depths told him that if he had responded clearly to Ning Zhuo then, it would have triggered extremely adverse consequences for his side. Out of sheer necessity, he could only resort to quoting classics and speaking in riddles to brush Ning Zhuo off.

Thinking about it now, his performance must have disappointed many people. But there was no other way.

-----
In the Blue Stone Grotto-Manor.

Ning Zhuo had been sitting cross-legged on a prayer mat, studying the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art for quite some time.

He opened his eyes, his face full of exhaustion.

Among the Three Sects' Supreme Methods, the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art was the most extensive and profound. Studying this cultivation art was definitely a massive undertaking. Ning Zhuo had limited time now, but to advance his own cultivation, he set aside an hour every day to study it.

"The Unity of Knowledge and Action..." Ning Zhuo put back the demonic art jade slip, but what he was thinking about was a Confucian technique.

Ning Zhuo now possessed his original talent and the Soul-Ferrying Incineration Art, which allowed him to take all of another person’s lifelong memories and experiences. But digesting all of that took time.

For example, the Eternal Silent Profound Ice Body-Forging Demonic Art was like that. Ning Zhuo had obtained the memories and experiences and had a very deep memory of the cultivation art, including various explanations and realizations, but to truly understand it, he still had to study it himself.

However, if he had the Unity of Knowledge and Action Confucian technique, he could use that cultivation art to operate automatically according to those memories and experiences. Ning Zhuo would be able to directly use the Eternal Silent Profound Ice Body-Forging Demonic Art, and his proficiency would be at the same level Ling Mo had when he was alive.

This would be a massive help to Ning Zhuo in digesting memories and experiences!

"I was originally pinning my hopes on Zhao Hansheng’s class, but even when I asked proactively, he brushed me off. If I could obtain the Unity of Knowledge and Action technique, that would be fantastic!"

"But he also paid an invisible price for that."

"Hmm?"

Ning Zhuo suddenly sensed something; a divine statue in his Storage Belt was behaving strangely.
