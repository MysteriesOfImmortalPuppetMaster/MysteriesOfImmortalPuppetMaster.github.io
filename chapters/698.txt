Chapter 698: Snow-Colored Spirit

Pi Fujie, though the Pi Clan's most promising talent, was only at the Foundation Establishment stage.

Ning Zhuo, also at Foundation Establishment and even weaker in cultivation, had already slain Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators, and even faced Soul Formation-level opponents head-on!

Pi Fujie's eyelid twitched, sensing Ning Zhuo's overwhelming confidence. He grew increasingly hesitant to accept the challenge.

For a moment, he felt utterly lost, regretting his earlier greetings to Shen Xi and the others, which now prevented him from backing down.

If he retreated without a fight, the news would reach his clan, and Pi Fujie's life would become unbearable - he'd be skinned alive.

"Hahahaha!" Just then, the Tiger Demon beside Pi Fujie burst into thunderous laughter.

"A mere child with such a boastful tongue! Let this lord teach you a lesson!"

This Tiger Demon possessed exceptional strength and had recently been recruited by Pi Fujie.

Much like Shen Xi's initial approach to Ning Zhuo, Pi Fujie had deliberately cultivated a relationship with the Tiger Demon. Their initial motives were identical. However, as they interacted, Ning Zhuo revealed his true capabilities, prompting Shen Xi to wisely adjust his attitude and treat him as an equal.

Pi Fujie's eyes lit up at the Tiger Demon's laughter.

The Tiger Demon clasped his fist in a formal salute and addressed Pi Fujie solemnly: "Young Master Pi, though we've only met a few times, you gifted me a Soul Spirit Tattoo. It's only right that I repay your kindness by helping you reclaim your honor!"

Pi Fujie breathed a sigh of relief, his heart filled with joy. This was undoubtedly the best outcome - he wouldn't have to fight himself, and he could still satisfy his family's expectations.

Pi Fujie immediately promised, "This is your first time fighting for us. Win or lose, you'll be rewarded!"

Ning Zhuo sneered. "No matter how generous the reward, a dead cultivator can't claim it, can they?"

The Tiger Demon glared at Ning Zhuo. "Little whelp, you talk big! After I defeat you, I won't kill you right away. I'll swallow you whole. Then let's see if you're still so arrogant!"

Ning Zhuo sheathed the Five Elements Life and Death Fan, his face twisted with disdain. "You're just a lowly Demon Cultivator. What right do you have to fight me?"

"If I were to fight anyone, it would be more fitting to strike down Pi Fujie himself."

The Tiger Demon burst into laughter, jabbing a finger at Ning Zhuo's nose. "You're scared! A cowardly, death-fearing weakling who won't accept my life-or-death Martial Arena challenge!"

"You can refuse, but I'll spread word everywhere that you're a coward!"

"I know how much the Righteous Path values reputation. Just wait and see."

Ning Zhuo sighed. "Very well. If you're so eager to die, I won't stop you."

"If you can defeat the Mechanical Puppet in my possession, I'll step into the arena myself and personally grant you your death."

Shen Xi glanced sideways, thinking, Mechanical Puppet?

The two groups entered the Martial Arena. Since the Tiger Demon had initiated the challenge, he would, according to established custom, pay the Spirit Stone fee.

Ning Zhuo selected a room.

A Formation was inscribed within the room. As the group crossed the threshold, they entered the Formation Space.

While waiting for the match to begin, Shen Xi urgently transmitted a mental message: "Brother Ning, you might not be aware, but the Pi Clan specializes in the Seven Talisman Demonic Skin Sutra. They use paper-cutting and talisman-crafting techniques, employing souls as their primary material, to imprint talismans directly onto their skin."

"At their peak, they can simultaneously inscribe seven talismans, each unique."

"These talismans activate with lightning speed, almost as fast as innate spells. Moreover, the talismans often resonate with each other, forming synergistic combinations."

"Although the Tiger Demon only recently joined their ranks, Pi Fujie is capable of imprinting Demonic Talismans on him."

"Judging by the Tiger Demon's earlier remarks, Pi Fujie had already imprinted one talisman to recruit him. Their delayed arrival now likely means they're inscribing a second one."

"In the upcoming battle, exercise extreme caution. Using the Mechanical Puppet to probe the Tiger Demon's capabilities and the nature of his talismans would be a prudent move."

Shen Xi knew that Ning Zhuo's understanding of the Five Elements far surpassed that of ordinary cultivators. He hadn't yet determined the full extent of Ning Zhuo's mastery.

In Shen Xi's eyes, Ning Zhuo was roughly his age, perhaps slightly older. For someone so young to possess such profound mastery of the Five Elements was truly remarkable. Ning Zhuo must have dedicated vast amounts of time and energy to cultivating this domain.

As for the Mechanism Art, Ning Zhuo was certainly not an expert.

Therefore, he had already anticipated the course of the upcoming battle: Ning Zhuo would use his Mechanical Puppet to probe the Tiger Demon's weaknesses.

If things went well, he might even weaken the Tiger Demon's combat power. Afterward, Ning Zhuo would unleash the Five Elements Life and Death Fan, employing Five Elements Spells to defeat the Tiger Demon and claim victory.

Ning Zhuo waved dismissively. "Brother Shen, no need to worry. It's just a little cat."

Shen Xi praised, "Brother Ning, you're truly bold."

Su Lingkou secretly curled her lip, thinking, My cousin offered sincere advice, but you brushed it off. If you're so overconfident and lose, you'll lose even more face.

Sigh, I hope you can win.

But can you really win?

Having never witnessed Ning Zhuo's combat skills firsthand, Su Lingkou lacked confidence in him.

A moment later, Pi Fujie and the Tiger Demon entered the room.

The Tiger Demon strode into the Martial Arena, while Pi Fujie, Shen Xi, and Su Lingkou stood outside the arena as spectators.

The Tiger Demon's eyes gleamed with excitement.

Challenging him was the right move! To ensure my victory, the Young Master gifted me another Demonic Talisman, greatly enhancing my strength!

I'll definitely win this battle. Boy, consider yourself my ascension gift!

He crooked a finger at Ning Zhuo, his provocation dripping with arrogance.

Ning Zhuo, his expression impassive, gently waved his hand, releasing a Mechanical Puppet from his Storage Belt.

The puppet stood six feet three inches tall, its feminine form graceful and elegant, with six arms. Its body was clad in Tri-Colored Enamel Armor, its face concealed behind a Snow Porcelain Mask, and its long, flowing hair woven from Ice Silk.

This was Snow-Colored Maiden Hui!

Her dazzling appearance immediately captivated the crowd.

Su Lingkou gasped softly, "A Golden Core-level Mechanical Puppet?"

Pi Fujie's brow furrowed deeply.

By now, Ning Zhuo's elite Mechanical Puppets all started at the Golden Core level.

The materials used to construct Snow-Colored Maiden Hui were almost entirely Golden Core-level treasures. At the core of her spiritual energy supply mechanism lay a Ghost Path Golden Core. The Golden Core's spiritual energy surged through a Formation, converting it into ice attribute spiritual energy. This conversion process inevitably resulted in energy loss and delays.

Yet Ning Zhuo had achieved the best possible outcome under the circumstances.

He simply lacked a suitable ice attribute Golden Core.

The Tiger Demon, seeing Ning Zhuo unleash a Golden Core-level Mechanical Puppet, cursed inwardly, "That cunning Human brat! This must be his trump card. He made it sound so casual, but he's been going all out from the start just to deal with me!"

The Tiger Demon's expression turned grave, unwilling to underestimate his opponent.

With his extensive combat experience, he recognized the dazzling Mechanical Puppet as a long-range combat model.

Roaring fiercely, he unleashed the Windwalk Spell, his speed surging to astonishing levels.

The Tiger Demon lunged at Snow Maiden Hui, his claws tearing through the air like blades, swift and ferocious.

"Good, I've closed the distance!" The Tiger Demon's heart surged with triumph as Snow Maiden Hui remained motionless, rooted to the spot.

Hui. His two tiger claws struck Snow Maiden Hui almost simultaneously.

Snow Maiden Hui extended a pair of auxiliary arms, crossing them defensively before her.

Clang!

The ear-splitting clash of metal against metal erupted, piercing the eardrums.

"What?!" The Tiger Demon's pupils constricted, disbelief flashing across his face.

After the collision, the expected sight of shattered mechanical limbs never materialized. The Tricolor Enamel Armor encasing her arms shimmered with flowing light, withstanding the earth-shattering blow without even a hairline crack.

Instead, the Tiger Demon felt a searing pain in his own claws.

Snow Maiden Hui's Snow Porcelain Mask remained expressionless. Her other pair of auxiliary arms darted out like venomous snakes, striking precisely at the vulnerable gap between the Tiger Demon's ribs.

"Ugh!" The Tiger Demon recoiled, his heart pounding with renewed alarm. "Such speed!"

He staggered back several steps, then ducked low, lashing out with his thick, powerful tail.

The tail struck like a steel whip, aimed at the Mechanical Puppet's lower body.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui glided forward, her movements fluid yet lightning-fast, effortlessly evading the blow.

Closing the distance, her six arms blurred into a phantom flurry. Fists, palms, and fingers struck with pinpoint accuracy at the Tiger Demon's joints, waist, and other weak points, driving him back step by step.

Shen Xi, Pi Fujie, and the others watched in stunned silence.

None of them had anticipated the Mechanical Puppet's formidable close-combat prowess or its astonishing agility.

Shen Xi glanced at Ning Zhuo, whose fingers danced across his hands, manipulating the Snow-Colored Maiden Hui with threads of spiritual energy. The puppet moved with both martial precision and artistic grace.

The Tiger Demon roared in fury, claws slashing wildly in a desperate attempt to regain the upper hand.

But Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's Enamel Armor proved remarkably resilient. Her six arms moved in seamless coordination, never tiring, never flinching from pain.

Under Ning Zhuo's control, she parried, blocked, and suppressed the Tiger Demon's savage attacks with unwavering precision.

Beside the Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, the Tiger Demon's massive frame seemed clumsy and powerless.

Unable to mount a counterattack, the Tiger Demon was left battered and bruised, his heart pounding with terror. "This Mechanical Puppet is too strong! It must be a close-combat model! I shouldn't have attacked its strength!"

With a roar, he unleashed his Demon Art, Tiger's Might, momentarily stunning the Mechanical Puppet.

Seizing the opportunity, the Tiger Demon retreated explosively, creating distance between them.

Ning Zhuo smiled. "You've made a grave mistake."

The Tiger Demon's heart skipped a beat. "Could it be?"

In the next instant, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's six arms rose, her slender jade fingers pointing directly at the Tiger Demon.

Within her core, the Warm Jade Wheel began to spin at high speed! The Tri-Colored Enamel flowed faster, converting her Golden Core-level spiritual energy into ice attribute energy that surged to her fingertips.

Ice-type spells erupted forth, forming a barrage of razor-sharp ice spikes and spears. Simultaneously, a biting gale howled outward, creating a formidable long-range assault.

Pi Fujie's expression darkened considerably.

Even Shen Xi and Su Lingkou grew solemn. Placing themselves in the Tiger Demon's position, they realized that their only option would be to evade, unable to withstand such an onslaught head-on.

The Tiger Demon chose to evade as well.

But Snow-Colored Maiden Hui began to move, her movements as light as willow catkins drifting on the wind, effortlessly gliding dozens of feet with each step.

The Tiger Demon was relentlessly pursued and quickly overwhelmed by a barrage of ice-type spells.

Pi Fujie, Shen Xi, and Su Lingkou watched with mounting anxiety.

The defensive magic artifacts the Tiger Demon relied on crumbled one after another under the relentless assault.

"What kind of mechanism is this?! It's a long-range model?!" the Tiger Demon roared, his eyes blazing with crimson fury. "You want me dead? I'll kill you first!"

Cornered and desperate, the Tiger Demon's primal instincts surged. He slammed his fist against his chest, instantly activating the two Demonic Talismans Pi Fujie had bestowed upon him.

A tattoo materialized on his left shoulder - the Thousand-Layered Scale Skin Talisman. The talisman emitted a gray-green light that rapidly spread across his body, coalescing into a layer of gray-green scale armor that drastically enhanced his defenses.

Another talisman appeared on his right chest - the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman.

In an instant, the Tiger Demon's blood Qi surged, his speed multiplying severalfold. He left behind a fleeting afterimage as his true form vanished like a ghost.

Though the ice-type spells rained down relentlessly, gaps inevitably appeared in the barrage.

Exploiting these fleeting openings with minimal risk, the Tiger Demon closed the distance to Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.

This works out well, Ning Zhuo thought.

He had been planning to use this opportunity to have Snow-Colored Maiden Hui engage in close combat, nurturing her spiritual energy. But then her spiritual energy suddenly trembled violently.

A surge of intense longing and impulse surged through the spiritual energy tether, reaching Ning Zhuo.

Snow Maiden - Hui, seeking autonomy, was attempting to seize control from Ning Zhuo!

Ning Zhuo froze for a moment, leaving an opening.

The Tiger Demon, fueled by the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman, swiftly exploited this weakness, launching a ferocious assault.

His speed and defense surged, causing his combat prowess to skyrocket.

Yet at this critical moment, Ning Zhuo secretly relinquished all control, leaving Snow Maiden - Hui a defenseless punching bag as the Tiger Demon mercilessly pummeled her.

"Excellent!" Pi Fujie clenched his fist, roaring with unrestrained glee, his face radiating triumphant delight.

Shen Xi and Su Lingkou's expressions darkened dramatically.

Shen Xi thought, As expected! Brother Ning excels in the Five Elements, while Mechanism Art is merely a secondary pursuit.

Thud.

Snow Maiden - Hui crashed to the ground.

The Tiger Demon's successful strike ignited his ferocity, erupting in a maniacal laugh. "Break for me, you piece of junk!"

He seized this opportunity to dismantle the puppet in one fell swoop.

Ning Zhuo's divine sense had already receded like the tide, leaving only the Five Elements spiritual energy threads as a superficial facade, devoid of any actual control.

Just as the Tiger Demon's claws were about to strike, Snow Maiden - Hui's eyes suddenly blazed to life.

A chilling dread pierced the Tiger Demon's heart. For an instant, he entertained the absurd notion that the mechanical puppet had come alive!

Within Snow Maiden - Hui's core, the Warm Jade Wheel erupted with unprecedented brilliance! Three hundred and sixty apertures spewed forth frigid ice mist.

Six palms slammed directly onto the Tiger Demon's body.

A torrent of frigid Qi erupted, transforming into an icy current that enveloped the demon.

Crack... crack... crack...

The Thousand-Layered Scale Skin Talisman on the Tiger Demon's body flashed wildly, its illusory scales rapidly spiderwebbing with cracks and encrusted with thick layers of frost.

The blood Qi accelerated by the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman was instantly frozen and consumed by the overwhelming cold.

The Tiger Demon realized with horror that its speed was plummeting, its strength waning, and its demonic power flowing with excruciating difficulty. It tried to retreat, but the icy storm held it trapped like quicksand.

The Tiger Demon let out a desperate roar.

It struggled frantically, burning its vital essence and channeling its demonic power, but nothing could break through the ever-thickening ice and the bone-chilling cold.

After a dozen breaths, the Tiger Demon's roar faded into a final, anguished whimper filled with resentment and terror.

It was completely frozen in place, transformed into a massive ice sculpture, lifelike yet frozen in a terrifying expression of horror.

Its life force had been extinguished.

Snow-Colored Maiden Hui slowly ceased her technique, rising gracefully as her six arms lowered. The Warm Jade Wheel's radiance dimmed, and the Tri-Colored Enamel Armor shimmered with a cold, ethereal glow amidst the icy mist.

She stood silently before the ice sculpture, her head tilted slightly upward. The Snow Porcelain Mask revealed no expression, yet the onlookers sensed an air of pride emanating from Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.
