Chapter 787: Crisis

Zhu Fenxiang was not raised by her parents, but by her grandmother.

There was no practical point in dwelling on past reasons; the reality facing Zhu Guizhi now was that the relationship between mother and daughter was extremely tense. If Zhu Guizhi forcefully intervened, she was almost certain to fail.

"In fact, it might even cause Fenxiang to rebel, making her even more determined to choose Ning Zhuo just to spite me!" This was a possibility that Zhu Guizhi deeply feared.

Therefore, from the moment she first learned of this shocking news, she had been working hard to suppress the matter while forcing herself to remain calm and find a more certain way to resolve the current problem.

However, after the news leaked from the source at the Internal Affairs Office, many people within the family were paying attention. Zhu Guizhi knew then that this matter had to be resolved quickly!

Political pressure forced her hand.

Otherwise, if this joke grew too large, it would be even harder to clean up, causing significant losses for her personally and for her faction.

Because Zhu Fenxiang had violated the rules and committed a mistake. Of course, she might not fully understand it, thinking it was no big deal.

But this matter was truly different!

Zhu Fenxiang was the Foundation Establishment face pushed forward by the Zhu family; her every move represented the honor of the Zhu clan. Her sudden teaching of the family’s Divine Summoning Art to an outsider signified her intent to be bound to this person.

This was potentially one of the most significant events in a person's life.

If they were childhood friends or if there had been previous groundwork, and the whole family had expectations, it would be one thing.

But now, Zhu Fenxiang’s sudden move indicated to everyone that her emotions were too intense and that she had easily fallen for an outsider. It was a very immature display. The Foundation Establishment face of the family should not be so immature!

If she had been coerced by an outsider, it was even less appropriate to hand over the family’s Divine Summoning Art.

Because the Zhu family’s Divine Summoning Art was the very foundation of their standing!

Of course, Zhu Fenxiang had only taught the first layer. Even if it were broadcast to the world, it wouldn't shake the Zhu family's foundation in the slightest.

But when politics were involved, such matters could be treated as either "big" or "small."

On a small scale, it was just a young person being moved by temporary passion. On a large scale, it was disregarding the family for personal feelings or interests!

It was precisely because this matter could be "big or small" that Zhu Guizhi had to act fast.

If she handled it effectively, it would remain small. If she failed and let it escalate, it would become a major issue.

By then, not only would Zhu Fenxiang be removed from her position, but even Zhu Guizhi’s lineage would suffer!

Zhu Guizhi paced back and forth, her brow furrowed in deep thought. She imagined many solutions and discarded most of them. Finally, she let out a long sigh and settled on her final plan of action.

She knew she could not immediately send a flying message to question her daughter.

Impulse and anger would not solve the problem.

"I must handle this personally!" She made a swift decision, setting aside the tasks at hand, pushing open the door, and taking flight via a streak of light to leave the area.

A moment later, Zhu Guizhi appeared outside a side hall of the sect's storehouse.

Stepping inside, she saw He Yong.

He Yong was on duty here, guarding the family's treasury.

He wore simple green robes and had a mild, somewhat timid expression. He was carefully checking Jade Slips in front of a bookshelf.

Sensing someone's arrival, he immediately turned around with a slightly awkward smile. "Guizhi, why are you here?"

He was Zhu Guizhi’s husband and Zhu Fenxiang’s father.

Once, he had been among the first batch of genius cultivators to emerge from the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Cloud-Rising Trial. However, his nature was gentle; he disliked conflict and lacked the drive to advance aggressively.

After over a hundred years, his cultivation had stagnated at the early Golden Core stage with no further progress. He was content to manage trivialities in the storehouse. In Zhu Guizhi's eyes, he was the definition of "incompetent" and "mediocre."

Zhu Guizhi didn't bother with pleasantries and stated her purpose: "I've come to collect some treasures from the treasury, preferably Magic Artifacts or Medicinal Pills that can nourish the Divine Soul and stabilize one's foundation. Fenxiang has found... a good match. According to family rules, as her mother, I must show some courtesy and go see this future 'son-in-law'!"

Hearing this, the awkward smile on He Yong’s face faded. He looked closely at Zhu Guizhi’s expression, hesitated, and then spoke softly. "Guizhi, I... I also heard the news. As for that Ning Zhuo, though I haven't met him, I hear he is a talented youth who has recently emerged in the sect. He took the top spot in the Profound Armor Cave trial and passed the three heart-questioning riddles of the Demon Subjugation Hall. His character seems upright."

"Should we... perhaps trust Fenxiang a bit more? She is stubborn, but her judgment has always been excellent. The young man she chose must be a dragon among men."

"A dragon among men?" Zhu Guizhi sneered as if hearing a hilarious joke, cutting him off directly.

She then pointed at He Yong's nose, her voice filled with long-accumulated disdain and resentment. "Wasn't I blind back then too? I thought you were part of the first batch of genius cultivators in the Myriad Manifestations Sect with a limitless future. And what happened?"

"Your temperament failed you; you lacked responsibility. On this path of cultivation, no matter how much talent one has, they will only become a mediocre fool! How much have I been dragged down by you over the years? How many cold looks have I endured?"

The more she spoke, the angrier she became, her voice rising. "Some people are shiny on the outside and look like they have a great future, but they are just gold and jade on the surface while being rotten wood inside!"

"Choosing a husband is a life-long matter; how can it be treated as child's play? I already had arrangements for Fenxiang. The candidates I scouted for her are of equal social standing and are geniuses from established families who have stood the test of time!"

"Who is this Ning Zhuo? An outsider! His roots are unclear, his background is unknown, and he has no power to lean on within this country! Can he even be worthy of Fenxiang? What is his character? Is he sincere or does he have other motives? All of this requires my personal and strict investigation!"

He Yong was left speechless by his wife's barrage of criticism, not daring to argue further.

Seeing his submissive appearance, Zhu Guizhi became even more annoyed. She snorted coldly. "I have my own plans for this. You just focus on allocating the resources according to the rules. I will never let my daughter follow in my footsteps and jump into a fire pit that looks beautiful but is full of endless trouble!"

The Ban Clan

Deep within the ancestral hall of the Ban family.

Dense spiritual-pivot sliders moved along complex tracks, making fine, rhythmic clicking sounds. Spiritual light rippled like water between the nodes of the chains.

Hanging secret-pattern bronze bells released ripples of invisible energy, attempting to peer into the tracks of fate.

Many Grand Elders held their breath, surrounding the Ancestral Fate Mechanism Chain, observing the rising scene of Ning Zhuo’s luck.

It was still that luck-manifested arm, flickering between reality and illusion.

But compared to last time, the sense of crisis permeating the scene was much heavier.

The vermillion thorny vines wrapped around the arm had grown thicker and more hideous. The thorns were buried deep into the arm, and the ring finger was squeezed nearly out of shape.

The book pages floating above the arm no longer dripped ink like rain; instead, the ink had almost formed solid lines, constantly eroding the arm.

Most of the "flesh" on the arm had been eroded into pages, showing a dangerous trend of peeling away from the bone.

"The crisis has intensified, and Ning Zhuo is still completely unaware!"

"It seems we don't even need to act. By just watching, we can witness him fall into a predicament and walk toward ruin?"

"No, there are always healing herbs near a venomous snake. Ning Zhuo has stumbled into the right path; what he is doing now is exactly the answer to resolving these two crises."

Amidst the discussion, the Grand Elders observed closely and saw that the luck-arm was still constantly grasping frost energy and integrating it into itself.

At this moment, a thin, translucent layer of ice armor had quietly condensed on the surface of the arm. Though it looked fragile, it showed a slight defensive power when the ink droplets fell, effectively slowing the penetration of the black ink.

At the same time, the chill of the ice armor was working to slow the constricting force of the thorny vines.

"The book pages and ink droplets—their luck-form highly matches Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing. Zhao Hansheng has already secured the position of Mountain Master, which is baffling. Gu Qing is no ordinary person either, but why are they so hostile toward Ning Zhuo?"

"But what about these thorny vines? Where do they originate?"

"And what exactly is Ning Zhuo doing that happens to be the correct solution to this crisis? Should we go and sabotage it?"

The Ban family had naturally done plenty of intelligence work regarding Ning Zhuo.

They had detected that Ning Zhuo had been staying indoors lately, seemingly in seclusion. However, they could not discover exactly what he was doing.

After further discussion, the suggestion to intervene and sabotage him was ultimately rejected.

As the Great Grand Elder put it: "Our Ban family's luck is already closely linked to Ban Ji's Royal Mandate. If we directly intervene to oppose Ning Zhuo, it is equivalent to the Royal Mandate itself launching a counterattack."

"Previously, we fully activated the Ancestral Fate Mechanism Chain and drew upon the help of the Royal Mandate, which had already stimulated Ning Zhuo's luck."

"This boy's luck is currently at its peak. Forceful interference might backfire; instead of stopping him, it might help him break through the predicament faster! Our family history is full of such cases of cleverness turning into blunder. How can we repeat the same mistake?"

This statement drew wide agreement.

Another Elder added: "Moreover, when breaking a Human Tribulation and stimulating a Royal Mandate, it is best for the bearer of that mandate to act personally. Only then can the potential of the Royal Mandate be maximized and its edge sharpened. Acting on someone else's behalf is a lesser path and offers no benefit to Ban Ji's growth."

Breaking a Human Tribulation and stimulating a Royal Mandate were never two separate things, but one and the same!

The group reached a consensus and turned their gaze back to the luck-manifestation.

The arm was still grabbing frost energy, and the ice armor was slowly thickening, but the constriction of the thorns and the erosion of the ink droplets were clearly faster than the ice's condensation and defense.

"Even with such flourishing luck, Ning Zhuo is still being strangled by these two crises. It shows the ferocity of the opponents and the depth of their foundation."

"That is natural. If the faction behind Ning Zhuo has a luck-suppressing treasure, wouldn't Gu Qing have one too? He was already famous throughout the Huazhang Kingdom. If he were in this Cloud-Rising Trial of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he would definitely be among the first batch of top-tier talents!"

"Whether he is 'top-tier' remains to be seen. Only by truly establishing oneself in the Cloud-Rising Trial of the Martial Arts Hall can one be called 'top-tier.' Right now, including Ban Ji, they all lack verification and lack public recognition!"

One after another, the Grand Elders stopped their infusion of spiritual energy.

The truth of the luck revealed by the Ancestral Fate Mechanism Chain also quickly dissipated.

The Mountain Pavilion

A cool breeze blew past, making the bamboo shadows sway.

Bai Jiyun leaned against the railing, the bamboo slips in his poem cylinder clinking softly in the mountain wind, creating a pleasant, light sound.

Sitting across from him, Gu Qing was composed, his fingertip lightly tapping a poem manuscript spread out on the stone table. "I feel deeply moved reading your manuscript, Brother Bai. I cannot help but think of a line: 'Snow falls on plum tips, turning them white; spring comes, and the grass naturally turns green.' The heart for the Dao and the interest of nature can be one. A dead end is not the finish; it is often a new beginning. Is this the meaning behind the poems you wrote while traveling the four corners?"

A sharp light flashed in Bai Jiyun's eyes. He was used to observing scenery, but he had rarely had his internal feelings pierced so accurately by a single remark.

Bai Jiyun clapped his hands and sighed. "Brother Gu's words are truly the voice of my heart! What a line! Compared to those overly-refined works that lose their true essence, such natural and meaningful lines are the top-grade of poetry. They speak of the leisure of wild cranes while secretly aligning with the cycle of the Heavenly Dao... I am impressed, truly impressed!"

Gu Qing understands me!

An exciting sense of resonance welled up in Bai Jiyun's heart.

In the calligraphy room, only the scent of ink lingered.

Liu Fushu, tall and thin as a bamboo pole, stood straight as he concentrated on watching Gu Qing wield his brush.

Gu Qing’s writing did not pursue structural perfection alone; rather, it emphasized "intent" and "momentum." As the brush tip flowed, it was sometimes as steep as a lonely peak and sometimes as surging as a great river.

Gu Qing set down the brush. "Brother Fushu, your characters already have bone and muscle, but the 'Qi' is slightly stagnant. For instance, this stroke—it shouldn't be pushed out with sheer force. It needs the 'intent of the axe,' like a blade carving through wood, with sharp edges restrained yet unstoppable momentum."

Liu Fushu watched the entire process without blinking and immediately cupped his hands in sincere admiration. "Brother Gu’s insight is profound! Listening to you is better than ten years of study! All my previous practice seems as though I hadn't even truly entered the door..."

Around the Discourse Platform, there were scattered listeners.

Ten-year-old Kong Ran, wearing an apricot-yellow short jacket, had his small face tensed up, trying hard to maintain a composure that didn't match his age while sitting across from Gu Qing.

The two had been discussing the contents of the Classic of Rites for nearly an hour.

Now, a conclusion had been reached.

Kong Ran stood up and bowed very solemnly to Gu Qing. "Mr. Gu's discourse has cleared my ignorance and opened my mind."

Gu Qing immediately expressed with humility that besides being steady and heavy, the Classic of Rites also had aspects of "enlightenment" and "change." It was not a collection of rigid dogmas but a way of life and cultivation full of agility and wisdom.

Furthermore, he added that this was merely his own shallow opinion.

Kong Ran sighed. "I really should introduce Mr. Gu to my father to discuss the Classic of Rites!"

At the same time, in his study, Gu Qing's main body was reading the classics.

He smiled slightly. He had split into over a dozen clones simultaneously to socialize, using his own Confucian background to directly overawe others—it was a simple task!

Blue Stone Grotto

Gongsun Yan was fully focused, immersed in the world of artifact refining. The heart-fire he was fueling flickered slightly.

"Take a break for now." Observing this, Ning Zhuo decisively called for a stop.

"Ah?" Gongsun Yan was initially reluctant, but after obeying the order and stopping, he immediately sensed that his state was indeed poor.

He looked at Ning Zhuo with a surge of surprise and admiration in his heart. Young Master Ning Zhuo actually understands my real condition better than I do?!

The upgraded Snow Pivot Guard Xie was already more than half-finished.
