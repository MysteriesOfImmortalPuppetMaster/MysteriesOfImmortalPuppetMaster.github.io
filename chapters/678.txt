Chapter 678: Brilliant! Brilliantly Deadly!

Inside Boulder Cave, Yu Heye sat regally on the main seat, while Ning Zhuo stood before him.

Although Ning Zhuo had defeated Yu Heye's subordinates with the aid of numerous Foundation Establishment cultivators, Yu Heye remained convinced that Ning Zhuo merely had a hidden force backing him.

Yu Heye's perception of Ning Zhuo remained limited to the level of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Undeterred, Ning Zhuo took the initiative. "Senior Yu, I've been studying the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art and have several questions. The first is: 'Draw three parts of blood with Heart Fire, transforming it into Crimson Qi like liquid.' Though I haven't practiced this art myself, even from reading it, I can deduce that following this method would inevitably cause the heart meridians to become scorched and the blood to flow too rapidly. How do you typically mitigate these risks during your cultivation?"

Ning Zhuo's understanding of the Five Elements was profound, yet he had never cultivated the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art. His knowledge remained theoretical, confined to the pages of the manual. Thus, despite grasping the essence of the art, many questions lingered.

Yu Heye scoffed. "Mitigate? Mitigate what? Just draw the blood directly."

As he spoke, Yu Heye spread the fingers of his right hand, palm upward, and drew forth a stream of Essence Blood.

The Essence Blood was a dark crimson, pulsating and writhing like a living thing.

Yu Heye continued, "Once drawn, it's like a commoner gripping a red-hot iron - it must be used immediately. Its fiery nature cannot be suppressed!"

He clenched his fist abruptly, causing the Essence Blood to collapse and solidify into a crimson flame that enveloped his hand, burning fiercely.

"The heart meridian's urgency and the accelerated blood flow aren't hindrances, but rather the very source of our overwhelming power in battle."

"Our thoughts must burn like wildfire sweeping across a plain. The moment a thought arises, the blood transforms into Qi, blazing with heat."

"What harmony? The slightest hesitation means burning through your heart meridian!"

Ning Zhuo paused, then nodded slightly.

"I see now. Using fire to control fire, speed to counter violence... But what about the phrase 'Liver Palace stores wood essence, flowing through Ququan to Zhangmen'? How do you interpret 'flowing through Ququan,' Senior Brother? Practicing this technique there might cause meridian stagnation, like vines strangling a withered tree. The more you repeat it, the deeper the lingering damage will be."

Yu Heye nodded. "Indeed, stagnation is inevitable."

"Look," he said, bending his left arm. The loose sleeve of his robe slid down, revealing an old, deep scar on the inner side of his arm, its dark, bluish-black hue tinged with the aura of Wood Qi.

The muscles around the scar were twisted and knotted, radiating an eerie vitality, as if tiny roots were writhing beneath the skin.

"See this?"

"This is what remains after each time I circulate Qi through the Ququan Gate!"

"The Liver Palace's generative Qi is domineering and stubborn, like the gnarled roots of an ancient tree. Because I've circulated Qi through this gate too many times, it's now almost completely blocked. But I've devised a solution."

With that, he formed his fingers into a blade and made several slicing motions near his Zhangmen Acupoint on his left side. Wisps of azure Qi trailed from his fingertips, coiling in the air like a serpentine path.

"Ququan is like a knot in an old tree, nearly a dead end."

"So I follow the nature of wood, like a vine clinging to its grain, flowing along its natural patterns. During cultivation, I focus my intent on Zhangmen, using the acupoint as a 'root' to guide the Wood Essence like a spring vine sending out tendrils. Part of the Qi seeps through Ququan, while the larger portion bypasses it entirely."

"Though this detour consumes considerable Qi, it prevents the complete stagnation of Wood Qi and the catastrophic backlash against the Liver Palace!"

As he spoke, a flicker of mingled fear and triumph flashed in his eyes.

This trick had been a desperate epiphany, born from the agony of a near-fatal qi deviation.

Ning Zhuo understood immediately.

He gazed at Yu Heye, a hint of pity in his eyes.

"Practicing cultivation like this will lead to frequent qi deviations."

"These tricks are likely the result of countless qi deviations, accumulated experience, and lessons learned through blood and tears."

"He probably possesses other such techniques as well."

Such methods were undoubtedly shortsighted.

But what choice did Yu Heye have, given his limited Five Elements realm?

Ning Zhuo, with his keen insight, deduced Yu Heye's Five Elements realm from this single, minor technique.

"With his capabilities, inventing these tricks is indeed the most efficient way to maintain his cultivation and preserve his strength at minimal cost."

"Accumulating enough of these techniques could trigger a qualitative shift, gradually refining the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art."

Many cultivation arts had evolved through such continuous refinement and improvement.

For a moment, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion.

He thought of his own Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual.

Compared to the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art, it was like comparing pebbles to pearls.

Yu Heye's cultivation of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art was a constant torment to his body. The deeper his cultivation, the more flaws and hidden dangers accumulated within him.

This was because its greatest strength - the conversion of essence and Qi - was crude and rudimentary. Even simply circulating the energy caused damage to the cultivator's physical body.

In contrast, the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual focused on cultivating the Qi Sea within the Middle Dantian, allowing for seamless conversion between the Five Elements. Because the transformations were confined to the Qi Sea, any backlash from the elemental shifts was absorbed by the Qi Sea itself, effectively neutralizing it.

The Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art presented a far more complex problem. While it could convert essence blood into spiritual energy, the cultivator's physical body was not an empty vessel but a dense, tightly packed structure.

"The Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual alone is a top-tier cultivation art, and it's only one of the Three Sects' Supreme Methods."

"Compared to Yu Heye, I'm fortunate."

"Once I rescue my mother, the Lava Immortal Palace will undoubtedly fall into my hands."

Ning Zhuo had obtained only the Foundation Establishment chapters of the Three Sects' Supreme Methods, lacking the Golden Core chapters. He needed to seek these from the Doctrine Bell within the Lava Immortal Palace.

During his travels to the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Ning Zhuo's cultivation progress had been modest, but his combat prowess had surged dramatically.

"When I face Meng Kui again, I will never be as passive and humiliated as before."

Gathering his scattered thoughts, Ning Zhuo addressed Yu Heye: "Senior Yu's techniques - releasing stagnant Wood Qi and opening new pathways to facilitate cultivation - are indeed masterful. However..."

"As Senior Yu mentioned earlier, the Heart Fire's ferocity must be countered with swiftness, and the Liver Wood's entanglements must be unraveled with gentleness. These are merely isolated solutions, like dredging a single channel to manage a flood. When viewed holistically through the Five Elements Cycle, they reveal significant flaws."

"For example, how should we handle extracting Essence Blood to generate Metal Element Dharma Power?"

"This is both the source of sharp, piercing Qi and requires suppressing its murderous nature. Overabundant Metal Qi can harm the body's meridians. It must also draw upon the Earth Element's transformative power from the Spleen Palace to enhance its resilience and channel Kidney Water (Gui Water) to temper its dryness."

"How can we achieve balance in this process?"

Ning Zhuo immediately recognized the flaw.

The Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art was inherently self-consistent, but Yu Heye's added techniques had severely disrupted its overall integrity.

If Yu Heye focused solely on the Fire and Wood Elements, it would severely disrupt his cultivation of the Metal, Water, and Earth Elements.

Yu Heye's face darkened like a stormy sea.

He primarily cultivated the Fire and Wood Elements, supplementing them with the Water Element. The Fire Element provided explosive power, while Wood fueled Fire, extending its duration. The Water Element, in turn, tempered the destructive force, maintaining his composure.

Yu Heye barely maintained this fragile triangular balance of power.

The Metal and Earth Elements, to him, felt more like burdensome baggage he was forced to carry.

Balance?

Yu Heye had already exhausted every ounce of his effort mastering the Wood and Fire Elements. Adding the Water Element had completely drained his learning potential.

How could he possibly spare any attention for the Metal and Earth Elements?

Yu Heye's eyes widened as he glared at Ning Zhuo. "Junior, you must understand that Demonic Arts are a life-or-death gamble! Hesitation, caution, and harmony are antithetical to the very spirit of Demonic Arts."

Seeing Yu Heye's loss of composure, Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "Senior, I've devised a method that might harmonize the Five Elements, allowing them to cycle naturally."

"The principle is simple: choose one of the Five Elements as the central axis. The remaining four elements then generate and follow each other in a cyclical pattern, like a rotating wheel."

Yu Heye scoffed. "Easy to say! But how would you actually implement it?"

Ning Zhuo nodded. "That's not difficult at all."

He channeled his spiritual energy, gesturing with his fingers in the air. The energy solidified into a three-dimensional diagram, resembling both a talisman and a formation.

"This is the prototype of the Wheel of Reincarnation. Based on Senior Yu's actual condition, if we adopt the Fire Element as the central axis..."

"Exactly."

Ning Zhuo touched a point at the center of the diagram with his finger, igniting a ball of flame. The flame propelled the diagram, causing it to slowly rotate.

"Heart Fire as the hub, the wheel begins to turn!" Ning Zhuo declared.

The diagram's rotation accelerated, its overall shape gradually resembling a wheel.

Yu Heye scoffed, already envisioning the entire diagram spinning until it collapsed under its own momentum.

If left unchecked, that would indeed be the outcome.

But in the next moment, Ning Zhuo lightly touched the wheel's edge with his fingertip. Instantly, a pale blue water trace spread outward, forming an inner ring like a cool dam against the raging fire.

"By channeling the Water Element's nourishing essence," Ning Zhuo explained, "we envelop the wheel's outer rim, like a cold lid on a boiling cauldron. This restrains the fire, preventing it from consuming the wheel while still harnessing its driving force!"

Yu Heye's expression flickered, but he remained dismissive.

Water Element suppressing Fire Element was a valid technique, but it was unsustainable. The diagram remained unstable, merely prolonging its lifespan like drinking poison to quench thirst - a temporary reprieve before inevitable collapse.

Moreover, water and fire were fundamentally incompatible. The consequences of their collision would be far more catastrophic than before.

Ning Zhuo's fingers moved swiftly, channeling Wood Element Dharma Power to conjure deep green lines. These lines radiated outward from the water ring at the wheel's edge, connecting to the central fire core.

"Water nourishes Wood, and Wood fuels Fire! The Wood Element, with its vigorous nature, easily loses its balance. Yet by linking them in this sequence, we harness the principle of mutual generation among the Five Elements, naturally allowing the Wood Element to serve as the spokes of the wheel."

At that moment, Yu Heye's expression shifted dramatically.

Ingenious! Ning Zhuo's design was remarkably clever, achieving two goals with a single stroke.

It not only mitigated the inherent conflict between Water and Fire but also greatly stabilized the overall structure. The broad strokes of the improved Cultivation Art were now becoming clear!

Could this actually work?

No, we still need to consider the Metal and Earth Elements.

Even if we can't complete the derivation, this structure alone is immensely beneficial to me. Perhaps with further contemplation, I can truly achieve enlightenment!

With a flick of his finger, Ning Zhuo swiftly channeled Metal Element Dharma Power into a circle, forming a second wheel.

The Metal Element wheel was the same size as the Water Element wheel, both whirling around the Fire core with a resonant hum.

When the two wheels collided, a subtle transformation occurred. The Metal, nourished by Water, tempered its sharpness and gained greater resilience. Meanwhile, the Water Element, spreading outward, received vital replenishment from the Metal.

Yu Heye had unconsciously risen to his feet, no longer seated.

He stared intently at the diagram.

By now, the spiritual energy diagram had coalesced into a sphere. At its core blazed the Fire orb, surrounded by Wood Element spokes and a Water Element rim. A Metal Element rim, lacking spokes, spun around the Fire core like a hollow ring, frequently colliding with the Water Element rim.

Yu Heye instinctively exclaimed, "Brilliant! Before, Water nourished Wood, and Wood fueled Fire, with the Water Element supporting everything, leading to severe depletion. But now, with Metal generating Water, the system is greatly replenished, allowing for much longer operation."

"But... it's still unstable."

"The Metal Element is still countered by the Fire Element. Once either the Metal or Water Element is exhausted, the entire structure will collapse!"

Yu Heye felt deeply disappointed.

He had never imagined Ning Zhuo would deduce the system to such an advanced stage. He was now completely captivated by the diagram!

"What a pity, such a waste."

"Just one step away, yet as difficult as ascending to heaven!"

"No, it's fundamentally impossible."

Ning Zhuo observed Yu Heye's expression intently, then laughed heartily. "Senior Yu, have no worries. Just watch."

Ning Zhuo curled his index finger, conjuring a seed-like Earth Element Dharma Power, and tossed it directly into the heart of the fire.

"Witness Metal Qi entering Fire!" Ning Zhuo roared, channeling his divine sense to activate the Golden Wheel.

The Golden Wheel suddenly contracted.

Metal counters Wood. As it shrank, the Wood Element wheels shattered one after another, then were drawn into the fire's core by the Golden Wheel.

Fire counters Metal, and Wood fuels Fire.

The flames surged, consuming the Wood Element and extinguishing the Metal Element, adding their essence to the Earth Element.

This was the principle of Fire nourishing Earth.

The Earth Element seed rapidly expanded, then suddenly exploded.

Most of the Earth Element dissipated, forming a golden ring that expanded outward with tremendous force.

In an instant, the Golden Wheel materialized, returning to its original size and position.

The spiritual energy diagram continued to evolve. Water nourished Wood, Wood fueled Fire - following this fundamental principle of the Five Elements, countless Wood Element spokes naturally emerged.

At that moment, every hair on Yu Heye's body stood on end!

As if struck by lightning, he froze in place, his eyes fixed on the Five Elements Cycle Diagram before him.

"Beautiful! Utterly breathtaking!"

"Sublime! Beyond words!"

He roared inwardly.

Overwhelmed by joy, he felt as if he were dreaming.

Heavens! What a magnificent dream!

Ning Zhuo's eyes reflected the five-colored radiance as he calmly explained, "The Fire Element explodes, but the Metal Qi enters the flames. This isn't to harm oneself, but to temper the spirit, severing chaotic thoughts within the fire and cultivating pure, focused intent. As the saying goes, 'Fire tempered by Metal burns with pure, unwavering light.'"

"Afterward, the embers return to nourish the Abundant Earth. Earth Virtue sustains all things, and the Golden Wheel is reborn."

"Thus, the Five Elements cycle endlessly, generating life without end."

Ning Zhuo's voice remained calm as his words struck Yu Heye like thunder.

The late-stage Golden Core cultivator stared intently at the Five Elements Cycle Diagram before him, his eyes gleaming brighter with each passing moment. A flush of intense excitement rose on his face as he murmured to himself, "Balance in motion... Five-speed rotation... Fire hub propulsion... Metal whetstone for the mind... Earth as the foundation... Marvelous! Utterly marvelous!"

So engrossed was he that he unconsciously began circulating his spiritual energy, attempting to align his internal flow with the dynamic pattern displayed in the diagram.

This change proved catastrophic.

Yu Heye's preparations were woefully inadequate, and his attention was divided. Altering the flow of spiritual energy is no simple matter.

The old order collapsed, but a new one failed to materialize in time.

Boom!

The nascent fireball exploded violently.

A searing pain instantly engulfed his entire body.

Yu Heye's pupils constricted sharply, revealing utter terror.

"I'm going to die!"
