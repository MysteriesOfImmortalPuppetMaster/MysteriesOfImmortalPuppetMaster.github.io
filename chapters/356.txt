Chapter 356: Fame Spreads Throughout the Valley

If it weren't for Ning Zhuo’s innocent and earnest expression, with his clear and unclouded eyes, Lin Shanshan might have scolded him for behaving like a flirt.

Lin Shanshan was about to refuse when Ning Zhuo patted his waist and took out the mechanical arms again.

"Miss Lin, I’ll give you these two floating mechanical arms. How about you control them to instruct me in martial arts?"

Lin Shanshan was taken aback. Most of her previous misgivings melted away as she hesitated, “These floating mechanical arms could be considered your trump card, and you’re just going to give them to me?”

This was no trump card at all! But Ning Zhuo still pretended to hesitate slightly.

Then, with sincerity, he said, “First, I trust your character, Miss Lin. Even if I expose the intricacies of these mechanical arms in front of you, I have no concerns. Second, I recognize my shortcomings in martial arts. Whether facing Han Zhou now or other opponents in the future, I’ll encounter these challenges repeatedly. So, why not start addressing this issue now?”

Such determination earned Lin Shanshan even more admiration for him.

Without further hesitation, Lin Shanshan accepted the floating mechanical arms. “In that case, let’s begin our special training.”

The training focused on actual combat, with Lin Shanshan mimicking Han Zhou’s fighting style as she sparred with Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo was only in the early stages of Foundation Establishment, while Lin Shanshan had reached the late stage. On top of that, Ning Zhuo deliberately restrained his spell power, focusing on how to counter an enemy in close combat and create distance.

Lin Shanshan's repeated attacks left Ning Zhuo struggling to keep up, soon dripping with sweat.

An hour and a half passed quickly.

Seeing Ning Zhuo’s movements becoming sluggish and his strength depleted, Lin Shanshan took the initiative to stop, “Today’s training ends here.”

Exhausted, Ning Zhuo gasped for breath, his clothes soaked through. “Th-thank you, Miss Lin…”

“Today’s sparring has been immensely beneficial to me!”

Lin Shanshan had also worked up a slight sweat, but with a sweep of her magical power, she was dry again.

She said, “Young Master Ning Zhuo, I can tell you usually focus on spell training. You haven’t engaged in this type of sparring very often, have you?”

Ning Zhuo nodded, “You’re perceptive, Miss Lin. Please excuse my lack of experience.”

Lin Shanshan shook her head, her expression serious. “You may not realize it, but your progress during today’s sparring was significant, a testament to your talent.”

“You have a natural aptitude. You only need to think carefully, understand your shortcomings, and continually adjust, which has led to today’s improvement.”

“Your main weakness is your lack of combat experience. That’s why Little Contention Peak will be the perfect place for you, Young Master Ning Zhuo.”

“Even if you lose to Han Zhou this time, please don’t be discouraged. If you stay on Little Contention Peak for just a few months, you’ll undoubtedly undergo a transformative improvement!”

Lin Shanshan praised Ning Zhuo’s talent and intuition while also giving him honest advice and comfort.

“Even if you lose now, the future belongs to you.”

Ning Zhuo nodded, staring intently at Lin Shanshan. “Without your guidance, Miss Lin, I couldn’t have achieved this on my own.”

“When shall we meet here again tomorrow?”

Lin Shanshan was taken aback.

She hadn’t planned on continuing to mentor him. In her mind, one session of instruction had been enough.

But under the lingering influence of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, the words of refusal she had prepared came out as agreement: “Alright, tomorrow, same time and place?”

“Thank you, Miss Lin!” Ning Zhuo bowed deeply and took out four mist rust orchids. “This is a small token of appreciation from me.”

Lin Shanshan laughed, “I’ve already told you that Han Zhou’s challenge is partly my responsibility. I’m merely following my conscience by helping. If I accept your gift, that changes things for me.”

“Do you understand?”

Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, “I understand. Miss Lin, your noble character is truly admirable, befitting the pride of the Myriad Medicine Sect! I have never met anyone with such grace!”

Lin Shanshan had been praised countless times, but to be praised so directly, so earnestly, and so intensely by Ning Zhuo, it was a first.

As she walked out of the martial arts arena, her steps quickened slightly.

“An hour and a half... They spent the whole time together in the martial arts arena…” Many of the disciples had been paying attention.

Seeing Lin Shanshan and Ning Zhuo exit together, they discreetly glanced at them.

They saw Ning Zhuo drenched in sweat, his steps unsteady, while Lin Shanshan, walking ahead, appeared slightly tense.

Various speculations arose in their minds.

As Lin Shanshan passed by the disciples, she suddenly paused. “By the way,” she instructed, “keep one of the martial arts arenas available for me in the coming days.”

“Understood,” the disciple quickly agreed, shocked. From Lin Shanshan’s words, it sounded like she planned to meet this young man multiple times!

“Who exactly is this young man?” This question lingered in the minds of many.

As Ning Zhuo and Lin Shanshan bid farewell and left, many people approached Ning Zhuo, greeting him warmly and indirectly probing for information about his background.

Ning Zhuo didn’t hide anything, explaining his identity and the fact that Han Zhou had challenged him. He also praised Lin Shanshan as the pride of the Myriad Medicine Sect, full of kindness and grace, who had taken the initiative to help him prepare.

“Our young lady is really this kind hearted?”

“She’s indeed helpful, but assisting a stranger to this extent is a first.”

“How come Han Zhou hasn’t challenged me? This Ning Zhuo fellow is truly lucky in misfortune!”

News about Ning Zhuo and Lin Shanshan quickly spread.

When Li Jingqing heard the news, his face turned pale!

“If Lin Shanshan looks into this matter, she’ll easily uncover the truth. The fact that she’s taking sides shows her stance toward me…”

“I was supposed to build good relations with the Myriad Medicine Sect, but now I’ve angered the sect leader’s beloved daughter. What have I done?”

Li Jingqing regretted his actions, feeling as if he had backfired spectacularly.

That night, he tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. By dawn, he had made up his mind. After carefully grooming himself, he set out from his cave and made his way to Cave No. 281.

He channeled his magical power into the formation at the entrance, sending his letter of apology through the array.

The next moment, the letter was transported into Ning Zhuo’s hands.

Upon opening it, Ning Zhuo saw thousands of characters, but the only ones that stood out were "apology."

“Interesting.”

He put the letter away, notified Sun Lingtong, who controlled the Ten Thousand Miles Traversing Dragon, to stand guard nearby as a precaution, and then opened the formation, calmly inviting Li Jingqing inside.

Li Jingqing came bearing gifts, seeking to make amends.

However, Ning Zhuo accepted none of the gifts. “I already learned the truth from Sister Lin Shanshan. I understand you, but I also despise you.”

“Still, since you’ve come to apologize sincerely, we can consider this matter settled.”

“But I won’t accept these gifts.”

“I’ll be honest with you. Being able to fight Han Zhou is an honor, and I’m looking forward to it.”

Li Jingqing pointed to one of the jade slips among his gifts. “This contains the latest information I’ve gathered on Han Zhou. I guarantee it’s accurate.”

Ning Zhuo glanced at the jade slip and then looked away. “I trust your apology is genuine, but I won’t use something like this.”

“I’ll rely on my own strength to face this challenge.”

“I’ll mention your apology to Sister Lin Shanshan.”

Seeing Li Jingqing about to offer more gifts, Ning Zhuo raised his hand to stop him. “Don’t even think about asking me to speak well of you! I’ll just tell her the truth.”

“You can leave now.”

Li Jingqing, seeing Ning Zhuo’s serious expression, realized he couldn’t rush things. He reluctantly retrieved all his gifts and left the cave.

The next time Ning Zhuo saw Lin Shanshan, he truthfully told her about Li Jingqing’s apology.

“He’s just a merchant, nothing worth bothering about,” Lin Shanshan said dismissively. “I never intended to make things difficult for him.”

“But let him worry for a few more days.”

Lin Shanshan was quite pleased with how Ning Zhuo had handled the situation. This was the behavior of a true man. If Ning Zhuo had accepted Li Jingqing’s apology and withdrawn from Han Zhou’s challenge, she would have understood but looked down on him.

“I’ll be there to watch your battle with Han Zhou,” Lin Shanshan said, feeling even more impressed with Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up, and he clenched his fists. “In that case, I definitely won’t lose!”

Lin Shanshan smiled, her fighting spirit also ignited. “Young Master Ning Zhuo, Han Zhou is indeed stronger than you, but you’re not without a chance. The next few days of special training could be the key to victory!”

Ning Zhuo nodded. “I understand. Let’s continue.”

The two trained intensely for several days, sparking much gossip.

Lin Shanshan had always been the center of attention at the Myriad Medicine Sect. Now, Ning Zhuo’s presence was widely known among the sect’s cultivators. Many male cultivators ground their teeth in frustration when they heard Ning Zhuo’s name.

Some cultivators even approached Han Zhou, offering him artifacts or information about Ning Zhuo.

However, Han Zhou refused them all.

His words were straightforward: “I heard about Li Jingqing. He tried to offer my information to Ning Zhuo as an apology, but Ning Zhuo refused.”

“He carries himself with honor. I may be a beggar, but I am also a man. How could I lose my integrity?”

“Everyone, leave. Let me face him in a fair fight!”

With the efforts of Sun Lingtong, rumors about Ning Zhuo and Han Zhou’s honorable conduct spread rapidly. The upcoming battle between Ning Zhuo and Han Zhou garnered even more attention.

Both their reputations and the buzz around them grew day by day.

Especially for Ning Zhuo, as an outsider who had been on Little Contention Peak for less than half a month, he had already become a widely known name on both Little Contention Peak and the main mountain.
