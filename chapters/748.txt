Chapter 748: Royal Mandate Immortal Talent: Ten Thousand Transformations Demonic Monstrosity!

Mechanism Cave-Abode

Cultivation Chamber

The walls, cast from bronze, revealed a multitude of mechanical components: slowly rotating gears and levers working in perfect synchronization.

The chamber's heavy bronze door was sealed shut, leaving not the slightest gap.

The rhythmic whirring and clicking of the mechanisms filled the chamber, amplifying the oppressive, murderous atmosphere.

Ban Ji sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion at the center of the room, his face expressionless and eyes tightly closed.

The high ridges of his cheekbones cast deep shadows across his face under the overhead light, while beads of sweat glistened on the tip of his aquiline nose.

Suddenly, a faint whisper echoed from the Void.

Ban Ji's heart jolted. "It's here!"

His body reacted instantly. His gaunt back arched sharply, and blue veins bulged on his neck.

The fragmented whispers scraped against his eardrums like grotesque, elongated fingernails scratching inside his skull.

Gritting his teeth, Ban Ji forced his eyes open. Blood vessels rapidly filled his irises, becoming visible to the naked eye.

The whispers coalesced into a continuous stream, growing louder and louder in his ears.

His rationality steadily eroded. Then, without warning, an unbearable, piercing itch erupted in his right foot!

Ban Ji curled his right leg and instinctively began scratching with his fingers.

The itch was unbearable!

He slipped steel hooks over his fingertips and tore into his waist, scratching frantically.

Soon, his right foot was ripped to shreds, exposing the ghastly white bone beneath. Yet the agony felt to Ban Ji like a dying traveler in the desert finding a few precious drops of water.

But almost immediately, the whispering voices swelled like crashing cymbals, pounding relentlessly into his ears.

"Shut up! Shut up!" He slammed his Demonic Light-infused palms against his ears, instantly shattering his eardrums. Yet even deafened, the whispers only diminished slightly, still reverberating within his skull, causing his temples to bulge and veins to bulge on his forehead.

By now, Ban Ji lay writhing on the ground, his body contorting under the dual assault of excruciating pain and maddening itch, like a lone boat struggling against a raging storm.

His head throbbed as if about to split, while the unbearable itch on his right foot felt like a venomous snake coiling up his calf.

Instinctively, he began slamming his heel against the floor tiles, splattering blood and grinding flesh and bone into a pulpy mess that stuck to everything nearby.

The once-white leg bone now pulsed with a turbid, brownish-yellow light, transforming into a series of intricate mechanisms.

Immortal Talent - Ten Thousand Transformations Demonic Monstrosity!

This wasn't a side effect of Ban Ji's cultivation of the demonic art, the Greedy Mechanism Demonic Heart Art, but rather the activation of his Immortal Talent.

Cultivators possessing this talent would continuously receive enlightenment on the principles of Mechanism Art, the Demonic Sect, and the Strange Path.

Chaotic, disorganized runes began to flood Ban Ji's vision.

<p class="glitch-text">機械術ノ理ヲ悟リ続ケル者</p>
<p class="glitch-text">乱レタ符号ガ視界ヲ覆ウ</p>

...

Ban Ji couldn't comprehend these symbols. He closed his eyes tightly, screaming in agony.

The darkness was only temporary.

Soon, the runes, like living maggots, pierced through the darkness and reappeared in Ban Ji's vision.

The flesh of his entire right calf had transformed into a translucent gel, while the leg bone, now a displeased mechanism, emitted a powerful suction force.

Within the Cultivation Chamber stood several brass mechanical constructs. Drawn by the invisible force, they crashed into Ban Ji's mangled remains.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Mechanisms crashed together, drawn by an irresistible force, and fused into a solid mass.

A yellowish-brown, oily sheen rapidly spread, dismantling and reassembling the mechanisms.

After a dozen breaths, Ban Ji's right calf was utterly disfigured. Gears were embedded in his leg bones, chainsaws pierced through his fascia, and gelatinous flesh, like living maggots, enveloped the foreign objects.

Simultaneously, Ban Ji's spiritual energy wove through every corner of his right calf like countless threads forming a net.

His entire right leg had swollen into a massive limb, requiring two adults to encircle it. The outermost skin had transformed into brass, while gears whirred within the leg bones. At the knee, a continuous mist of blood erupted outward.

Ban Ji's throat had grown hoarse from his screams.

His eyes were vacant, his pupils dilated from the torment.

At that moment, the jade pendant around his neck suddenly emitted a three-centimeter-long burst of azure light.

The light pierced his mind, instantly clearing Ban Ji's gradually clouding consciousness.

<p class="glitch-text">機術講話乱道界心夢影霊空音風花夜光魂理道界術心闇波夢幻流刻風霧声影零記想雲刻</p>

<p class="glitch-text">幻乱符号夜響光波霊夢刻</p>

<p class="glitch-text">魂響幻滅界風.......</p>

He forced his eyes open, his vision nearly consumed by countless runes. Through the gaps between them, he saw his right leg, and gel was spreading upward from the knee, creeping along his thigh.

"Sever it!"

Ban Ji roared, his palm slashing down with savage force. Spiritual energy erupted like a blade, slicing through his right thigh and severing it completely.

Blood gushed from the severed limb, causing Ban Ji to gasp and clench his teeth.

His gaze, sharp as a vulture's, fixed on the wound. To his dismay, he saw traces of gel still lingering, burrowing into the flesh.

As gel intensified, the maddening itch returned, piercing his very soul!

The severed lower leg, blasted away by his spiritual energy, crashed into a corner of the Cultivation Chamber.

Now free from restraint, the mangled limb pulsed with a terrifying suction force, drawing the remaining mechanical constructs in the chamber toward it.

Gears ground together like a torrential downpour, levers hammered like iron mallets, and the lower leg began to swell rapidly once more, its chaotic Qi radiating outward with a growing sense of danger.

Ban Ji gasped for breath, drenched in sweat.

The whispers in his ears grew deafening, while the runes before his eyes tightened, threatening to engulf his entire vision. The remaining slivers of clarity were vanishing rapidly.

In his final moment of clarity, Ban Ji formed a hand seal.

Divine Art - Blind Fool!

Thick gray smoke materialized from thin air, descending upon Ban Ji.

The smoke rapidly condensed into a bone-like, grayish-white lattice that pierced through his upper body. Two chains snaked from his eyes into his skull, then emerged through his ear canals.

The Divine Art took effect swiftly.

The bizarre runes in Ban Ji's vision blurred as if smeared with a hundred layers of grime.

The bloodshot veins in his eyes receded by more than half, his pupils dilated and turned gray-white, and drool mixed with blood trickled from his idiotic grin onto the floor tiles.

The unbearable itching that had tormented him subsided like a receding tide, while the suppressed agony, though rising, remained beyond Ban Ji's perception in his altered state.

His wounds remained untreated, yet the bleeding had stopped, the flesh around them transforming into brass-like mechanical armor plates.

Ban Ji lay in a pool of blood, his right leg missing from the knee down. He chuckled mindlessly, his fingers still digging into the floor tiles, fingernails torn and bent backward.

Meanwhile, his severed leg continued to tremble, its form fluctuating like a bubble, expanding and contracting, its surface constantly shifting into grotesque shapes.

The severed leg had ultimately transformed into a colossal, carriage-sized monstrosity, its interior teeming with intricate mechanical components. These parts were jumbled together haphazardly, yet somehow functioned in unison.

Thump.

A soft sound echoed as a humanoid mechanical hand suddenly extended from the side of this grotesque contraption.

The hand was still coated in a viscous, eerie gel. Its five fingers tapped against the floor tiles, probing the surroundings like a venomous snake sensing its prey. Abruptly, it shifted direction and lunged toward Ban Ji's True Form.

But its momentum halted abruptly.

The massive mechanical cannon dragging behind it severely restricted its reach.

Undeterred, the hand persisted, driven by a primal, beast-like hunger rooted in its Origin. It strained against its massive body, desperately inching toward Ban Ji's True Form.

At first, it remained motionless.

But soon, its body began to tremble slightly, shedding fragments of broken mechanical parts that adhered to the hand, gradually enlarging it.

As the hand gained strength, it managed to move bit by bit, drawing closer to Ban Ji's True Form.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn...

The Blind Fool Divine Wood reached its limit. The solidified gray smoke crackled and dissolved back into wisps of smoke, dispersing into the air.

Ban Ji regained his senses, his mouth gaping as he gasped for breath.

The agonizing pain struck his nerves like a sharp iron spike, but the absence of any itching sensation filled the experienced Ban Ji with wild joy.

Enduring the torment, he swiftly examined himself and scanned his surroundings.

A colossal, bizarre mechanical monster loomed over him, its palm as massive as a python, hovering just an arm's length away.

Yet it remained motionless, frozen in place, utterly devoid of any aura.

Ban Ji's heart skipped a beat, but a triumphant smile soon spread across his pale face.

The smile widened rapidly, erupting into a triumphant laugh of survival.

"This time, when my Immortal Talent activated, I successfully weathered it!"

Ten Thousand Transformations Demonic Monstrosity.

This Immortal Talent had set Ban Ji apart from others since childhood.

Initially, the activation intervals of the Ten Thousand Transformations Demonic Monstrosity's Innate Talent were long, and the insights it imparted to Ban Ji were minimal.

As a young child, Ban Ji dismissed these episodes as mere nightmares.

But when he enrolled in school, his aptitude for Mechanism Art cultivation manifested as an almost intuitive understanding.

While Mechanism Art typically involved complex calculations, Ban Ji only needed a glance to instinctively grasp the correct outcome.

Every time he performed the calculations, the results aligned perfectly with his intuition. In fact, his intuition often surpassed the calculations, which were prone to errors.

This exceptional performance immediately caught the attention of Ban Ji's parents.

As the Myriad Li Demon Beast's activation intervals shortened and the principles it imparted increased, Ban Ji began exhibiting symptoms of fainting and convulsions. After each "episode," his "intuition" for the Mechanism Art would surge dramatically.

Ban Ji's parents, unable to resolve his "strange illness," turned to their clan for help.

The clan's in-depth investigation revealed the profound mysteries of this innate talent: it wasn't recorded as any known Innate Talent, yet it was extraordinary. Beyond the Mechanism Art, it also imparted knowledge of the Demonic Sect and Strange Path.

This knowledge directly affected Ban Ji's body, rather than being infused into his divine sea, granting him an almost instinctive "comprehension."

Comprehension was merely the surface manifestation; in truth, Ban Ji's body itself understood the underlying principles.

His fainting spells were also superficial; the reality was that Ban Ji's body couldn't withstand the influx of principles from these three domains. To protect itself, his body would spontaneously shut down, rendering him unconscious and halting the infusion.

However, this protection wasn't absolute. As the Myriad Li Demon Beast activated more frequently, the force of the infusion grew increasingly violent.

Upon realizing this, the Ban Clan began to prioritize Ban Ji completely.

Initially, everyone in the clan assumed it was a flaw in his Innate Talent, a lingering side effect. But after uncovering the truth, they were shocked to realize it wasn't a deficiency at all - Ban Ji simply couldn't keep up.

With his Innate Talent confirmed as Immortal Talent, the Ban Clan secretly tailored a Dao Path for him, revolving around his unique abilities.

The Greedy Mechanism Demonic Heart Art was meticulously chosen, and the Ban Clan paid a heavy price for it.

This specialized technique focused on cultivating the divine sea, aiming to enhance Ban Ji's learning capacity. Rather than passively enduring the influx of knowledge through his body, he could now actively learn.

This proved to be a wise decision. Ban Ji quickly adapted, his strength surged steadily, and his mastery of Mechanism Art and Demonic Path cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds.

After Ban Ji achieved Foundation Establishment, his Immortal Talent underwent another dramatic enhancement!

Ban Ji began to struggle to cope.

The Ban Clan, naturally unwilling to abandon their future hope - a child with Immortal Talent - had to assist with full strength. To alleviate his predicament, they provided assistance from every possible angle.

To completely resolve this flaw, they secretly sought external help while maintaining absolute secrecy.

Through a stroke of chance, they encountered the Escaped One, a wandering immortal renowned throughout the world. This extraordinary figure, whose cultivation had reached the Void Refinement stage, was widely regarded as the most powerful Minor Calculation cultivator of their era.

The Ban Clan's Supreme Elders reverently beseeched him to perform a divination for Ban Ji. The Escaped One's calculations revealed that Ban Ji's unique Immortal Talent was destined for a Royal Mandate!

"Throughout history, Innate Talent has always been a gift from Heaven," the Escaped One declared.

"The Way of Heaven seeks to balance excess and deficiency. Yet, throughout history, no king has ever emerged from the realms of Mechanism Art or the Strange Path."

"Thus, Heaven has placed its wager here. Of course, this is not the only such instance."

"In the future, should Ban Ji succeed, he will become the King of Mechanisms and the Strange Path."

"Your name for this Immortal Talent - the Ten Thousand Transformations Demonic Monstrosity - is fitting."

The Ban Clan's Supreme Elders remained puzzled. "If this is the case," one asked, "why is the Demonic Sect's influence being infused into him?"

The Escaped One sighed deeply. "This is the great calamity that will strike centuries from now. As the demonic forces rise, the righteous path will wane - a cosmic tide between realms. Since the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the world has enjoyed prolonged peace, with righteousness overwhelming all and prosperity reaching its zenith. Yet, extreme prosperity breeds decline, just as tides rise and fall - such is the eternal cycle of Heaven and Earth."

The Supreme Elder asked again, "The golden age of cultivation has lasted nearly a thousand years. This great calamity will surely shake heaven and earth. Will a fourth emperor be born?"

The Escaped One replied, "The Heavenly Secrets are in chaos. How could we possibly calculate such things? But this time, even if it's just a king, he will be the most extraordinary ruler in history."

This answer invigorated the Supreme Elders of the Ban Clan present.

What could be more extraordinary?

A king who masters Mechanism Art and the Strange Path - isn't that the epitome of extraordinary?!

Does this mean our Ban Clan's Ban Ji possesses the Royal Mandate and might very well become the future ruler who unifies the world?!

Could our Ban Clan leap forward by centuries of development and instantly become one of the most powerful Royal Clans in the world?!

The Supreme Elder knelt on the ground, continuing to seek guidance from the Escaped One.

But the Escaped One merely left behind a pile of precious materials. "Our karmic connection has ended. These materials may be used to power the clan's Divine Mechanism Chain and calculate Ban Ji's path to kingship. Simply follow the calculated results step by step, and you will fulfill the Royal Mandate. At the very least, you will achieve regional dominance."
