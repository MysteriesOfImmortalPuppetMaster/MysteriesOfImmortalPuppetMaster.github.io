Chapter 654: Take Her Away—!

The bead string in the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's hand cracked and splintered, but he refused to look down, accelerating his movements instead. His extensive combat experience told him that he couldn't afford to spare any thought for this reserve power. If it was destroyed, so be it. As long as he survived this crisis, the rewards would be immense, elevating his entire cultivation career.

As the Prefecture Lord relentlessly squeezed the power from the bead string, it crumbled further, shedding tiny fragments. In exchange, the whirlpool in the Branch of the Wangchuan River spun faster and grew stronger.

Trapped at the heart of the whirlpool, the Cold Abyss Ice Coffin began shedding fine shards of ice. Within the weakening ice coffin, the Nether Dragon Scissors began to tremble faintly.

A fierce glint flashed in the Prefecture Lord's eyes as he strained to sense the connection. He drew a strand of dark gray qi from the Nether Dragon Scissors, piercing through the ice coffin and surging out into the Branch of the Wangchuan River.

The dark gray qi suddenly expanded and solidified in mid-air, transforming into two dragon-like figures. Their scaled bodies and clawed limbs were clearly defined, their whiskers bristling with fury.

The two dragons clashed in mid-air, their collision releasing a terrifying aura.

Clang!

The metallic clang echoed across the heavens as the dark gray dragon qi instantly condensed into the phantom image of a finely crafted pair of scissors.

The Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom stretched three feet long, its entire form a translucent, dark gray hue.

The handles were shaped like two Nether Dragons, their gaping maws clamping down on the base of the blades. The blades themselves curved like dragon spines, covered in intricate, scale-like patterns. A thin, concentrated line of dark blue light flowed perpetually along their edges.

Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom!

The true form of the Nether Dragon Scissors concealed its immense power completely, appearing utterly ordinary. Yet its terrifying capabilities had allowed the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord to secure victory against his greatest enemy, Yin Jiuzhu.

The phantom's power, likely only a ten-thousandth of the Nether Dragon Scissors' true might, radiated uncontrollably, leaving Ning Zhuo and Luo Si shaken.

Black Iron Han Armor!

Ning Zhuo tossed out a silver token.

The token transformed, instantly enveloping him in a suit of Black Iron Han Armor.

Having previously crafted a new suit for Sun Lingtong, he could now produce more as needed.

Ning Zhuo, steady and cautious by nature, had spent his days in White Paper Immortal City not only cultivating and investigating cases but also refining mechanical constructs. Beyond the Mechanical Golden Swallow, he had stockpiled several spare sets of Black Iron Han Armor.

What had previously limited his production was his scarcity of Golden Cores.

Now, he possessed far more than just a few Golden Cores! With the aid of three Mechanism Platforms, he could manufacture Black Iron Han Armor with relative ease, saving him considerable time and energy.

The Black Iron Han Armor spat out Separation Fire, while the Golden Wings erupted with blinding platinum light. Propelling Ning Zhuo backward like a startled fish, they swiftly distanced themselves from the Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom.

Meanwhile, Luo Si was locked in a desperate battle with the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

The Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom remained motionless, suspended in the void. It was this very stillness that made it all the more menacing.

The aura emanating from the phantom was so overwhelming that Luo Si's scalp felt like it was about to explode. He had to divide his spirit, maintaining constant vigilance and reserving strength to counter any sudden attack.

"Roar!"

Seizing the opportunity, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let out a guttural roar. His iron fist accelerated with terrifying speed, its power surging with enough force to shatter mountains and crush peaks.

At this critical moment, Luo Si's arm blurred into a series of afterimages as he unleashed:

Netherworld Ferrying Line!

Fishing Art - Nine Abyss Water-Draining Net!

A translucent fishing line unfurled in the air, transforming into a vast net. The net expanded rapidly, enveloping the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.

The god's formidable fist struck the net, its power gradually diffused and dispersed as it penetrated the mesh.

The net embedded itself deeply into the god's divine form.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let out a roar, filled with shock and horror. He felt his Divine Power seeping away like water through the countless mesh holes of the fishing net, continuously leaking and dissipating.

With this, Luo Si lost one of his two most relied-upon magic treasures, leaving him with only the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook.

While desperately maintaining the fishing net, he retrieved a replacement fishing rod and line, and reassembled his fishing setup with the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook.

"Hmph!" The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's Divine Power continued to leak away, and his form shrank accordingly.

"This Divided Spirit's methods are too limited," he thought. Having tried various tactics to break free from the fishing net without success, he immediately changed his strategy.

The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God tilted his head back and drew in a massive breath!

In an instant, a torrent of Earth Lung Turbid Qi surged toward him, like billowing smoke, and poured into his body.

His shrunken form rapidly inflated like a balloon, swiftly regaining its previous peak state.

Witnessing this, Luo Si's pupils constricted to pinpoints.

He hadn't witnessed the earlier clashes between the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God and several Transformation God-level experts. This was the first time since the battle began that he had forced the opponent to reveal such a method.

"What terrifying regenerative power!"

"And it can swiftly convert Earth Lung Turbid Qi into Divine Power?"

"Could this be... a Nature God?!"

Gods come in myriad forms, each with their own methods of power.

Many gods require offerings, worship, and emotional devotion to convert into Divine Power.

However, a rare few, known as Nature Gods, can effortlessly transform natural elements into Divine Power.

By all logic, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, being a Soul Cultivator, should have a Divided Spirit akin to an Incense God. Yet, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God is actually a Nature God!

Clearly, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had secured a unique opportunity, crafting a Divided Spirit with superior capabilities.

Luo Si cursed inwardly. His lack of intelligence had cost him dearly. He had intended to wage a war of attrition, but despite sacrificing precious treasures, his efforts had yielded minimal results.

Luo Si extended his hand, attempting to retract the fishing net.

But would the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let him escape?

With a tremor of his divine body, the god released surging waves of Earth Lung Turbid Qi. Like cascading foam, the qi seeped through the net's mesh, enveloping the net and merging it with his divine form.

Luo Si immediately felt the connection between himself and the net weakening. His retrieval failed, overwhelmed by the opposing force!

Just as the roof leaks, it starts raining!

Lord Wangchuan's true form ceased to gather energy, directly activating the Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom.

The Nether Dragon Silhouette abruptly spiraled in mid-air, emitting a piercing shriek! Instead of targeting Ning Zhuo or Luo Si, it followed Lord Wangchuan's gaze, striking directly at the Path of Returning to Silence.

This temporary passage, created by the collaborative efforts of the Path of Returning Stillness Candle Body and the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, now faced a fatal assault.

Lord Wangchuan's gaze turned icy.

Ning Zhuo and Luo Si paled simultaneously.

Lord Wangchuan's combat experience was vast. Though this choice was unexpected, it struck directly at the crux of the battle situation.

Qing Chi, still unconscious, lay within the Curved Path. If the path were destroyed, she would undoubtedly perish!

Moreover, the Qing-Jiao Army had already returned to their previous position on the Black Cloud Battlefield and established a Ceremonial Barracks. With the path destroyed, Luo Si would be cut off from his source of military might, unable to receive continuous reinforcements from the Qing-Jiao Army.

Without their support and having lost the Netherworld Ferrying Line, Luo Si's remaining combat strength would be insufficient to withstand the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God. Defeat would be swift and inevitable.

"Qing Chi!!!" Ning Zhuo shouted, channeling his divine sense to try and rouse her, but it proved futile.

Qing Yan was also speeding through the corridor!

Ning Zhuo threw himself wildly toward Qing Chi.

In that moment, he cast aside all pain and mortal danger.

Qing Chi had helped him so much, and as the commander of the Qing-Jiao Army, though not the linchpin of the operation, she was absolutely indispensable!

The newly equipped Black Iron Han Armor instantly overloaded. The complete Golden Core within the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel began to hum, violently erupting with Golden Core power.

The Sharp Metal Qi of the White Tiger Shattering Army Formation tore through the air, while the propulsive force of the Li Fire Tongue Array was completely unleashed!

Combined with the Military Power Amplification of the Qing-Jiao Army, Ning Zhuo became like a burning meteor hurtling recklessly toward the entrance of the Curved Path.

"Stop!" Ning Zhuo roared, chasing after the Nether Dragon Silhouette!

"Get out of my way!" Luo Si roared as well!

In a tributary of the Wangchuan River, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord smirked with disdain.

Though his condition was dire and his combat strength severely diminished, a single strike of his had completely overturned the battle situation.

This brilliantly precise target choice was like a lethal poisoned blade, aimed to pierce the enemy's heart!

"Don't you dare succeed!" Luo Si roared, his voice splitting the soul at this critical moment.

He couldn't spare a thought for the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's colossal fist bearing down on him.

As a Great General commanding armies, he knew all too well what was most important.

Without hesitation, he disregarded his own safety and threw the fishing rod with all his might!

The rod erupted with a dark radiance, instantly straightening the fishing line and rod. Though a substitute, it remained a magic treasure-grade artifact.

Fishing Art - Soul-Stabilizing Life-Hooking Technique!!

The Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook was viciously cast, streaking through the air like a brilliant meteor, carving a razor-sharp line of light.

This slender beam of light moved with astonishing speed, intercepting the Nether Dragon Silhouette mid-flight—the very force that threatened to destroy the world.

"Hooked!" Luo Si's spirits soared.

He gripped the fishing rod with both hands as a terrifying force surged back through it. Allowing the tug to pull him, he dodged the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's punch.

Having gained a temporary safe distance, he reeled in with all his might.

In an instant, the fishing rod bent into an exaggerated arc, the fishing line whistling as it strained under the brutal strain.

The Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook glimmered brightly, embedded in the interwoven joints of the Nether Dragon Silhouette!

The stalemate lasted for a full three breaths!

Bang!

With a soft bang, the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook instantly exploded, disintegrating into countless fine particles.

The fishing rod shattered into splinters, while the fishing line dissolved into a swirling cloud of dark sparks that scattered across the sky.

Pfft! As if struck by a ten thousand-pound hammer, Luo Si coughed up a mouthful of Primordial Soul Blood. His Qi flickered like a candle flame in a gale, wavering on the brink of extinction.

Yet his desperate, all-out sacrifice was not in vain.

The unstoppable Nether Dragon Silhouette, after annihilating the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook, saw its forward momentum halved, its invincible sharpness visibly dimmed.

Within the Black Iron Han Armor, Ning Zhuo's eyes blazed crimson. Seizing the opportunity created by Luo Si's self-sacrifice, he pushed the armor's capabilities to their absolute limits.

Cracks spiderwebbed across the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel. The Golden Wings, scorched by the intense friction with the air, melted at the tips and warped.

Ning Zhuo transformed into a comet streaking with golden light and crimson flames, surging forward with a speed that transcended his own limits. He charged recklessly into the unstable entrance of the Path of Returning to Silence, arriving ahead of even those closer to the exit!

Though Qing Yan was closer, Ning Zhuo, fueled by his desperate speed, reached Qing Chi first.

"Qing Chi!" Ning Zhuo scooped her up and clutched her tightly to his chest.

The moment he embraced her, the Nether Dragon Silhouette, arriving half a beat too late, unleashed its destructive force right into the entrance of the Path of Returning to Silence!

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, his icy gaze piercing through the turbulent Branch of the Wangchuan River, curled his lips into a cruel smirk as he watched. "I win."

The Nether Dragon Silhouette's dim yet lethal blades, like the fangs of death, parted slightly before snapping shut with deadly precision.

Crack!

Everyone seemed to hear the phantom sound of the scissors snapping.

Instantly, the space at the entrance of the Path of Returning to Silence exploded like fragile ice shattered by a boulder, sending countless pitch-black fragments of the Void, radiating destructive energy, hurtling outward in all directions like razor-sharp shrapnel.

The explosions cascaded along the path, spreading with ear-splitting speed from one end to the other.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ning Zhuo, cradling the girl in his arms as he fled, felt the icy touch of death closing in.

Turning back meant certain annihilation!

He fled for his life!

A violent spatial storm chased relentlessly behind him!

Countless fragments of space whirled past Ning Zhuo—like the reaper's scythe—missing him by hair's breadth, sweeping past his sides, overhead, and beneath his feet!

The back of his Black Iron Han Armor was repeatedly scratched, the wounds rapidly expanding with sparks and arcs of electricity flying!

The surface of his Mechanical Battle Armor tore wider with each desperate flight.

Ning Zhuo's heart plummeted into the abyss of despair.

He couldn't possibly switch to a new Black Iron Han Armor now. Even a moment's pause would mean being swept into the spatial storm, his life and cultivation destroyed.

Even the small act of retrieving the Mechanical Dragon had become a hopeless wish.

"Take her and go!" A resolute figure crossed paths with Ning Zhuo, charging toward the spatial storm.

It was Qing Yan!

The Golden Core cultivator had known from the moment the passage collapsed that he stood no chance of escaping this spatial turbulence.

As they brushed past, there was no trace of fear in his eyes, only boundless love for his daughter and a resolve to protect her!

He positioned himself behind Ning Zhuo, facing the terrifying spatial storm head-on.

In the next instant, an unprecedented golden radiance erupted from his entire body.

Boom!!!

The self-destruction of a Golden Core cultivator, who had burned through his lifetime's cultivation, unleashed a violent wave through the chaotic spatial currents!

The wave collided with the spatial storm, creating an even more chaotic secondary explosion.

The spatial storm's advance was halted.

Qing Yan sacrificed himself, buying Ning Zhuo his last sliver of hope!

"Dad—!!!" A heart-wrenching cry of anguish suddenly tore through the air, coming from Ning Zhuo's arms.

Jolted awake by the violent turbulence and energy shock, Qing Chi opened her eyes just in time to witness her father's heroic self-destruction.

The golden light illuminated her face, but what she saw was not the spectacle before her. She saw the father who had always been quiet but silently protected her—the father who shook his head helplessly when she was willful, who stepped forward to protect her when she was in danger, who sighed and yielded during their arguments when she threw a tantrum...

Her father was gone.

The excruciating pain of losing her closest kin pierced her heart in that instant.

She lost consciousness again.
