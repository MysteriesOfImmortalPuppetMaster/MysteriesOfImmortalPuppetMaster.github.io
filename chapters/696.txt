Chapter 369: Tian Shuang: "Let me go rescue them?"

On the bone altar, Tian Shuang and Di Gui stood in silence for a moment.

Di Gui immediately began calculating their losses.

They relied on missions issued by the Sect, which already offered substantial rewards. But with the entire team of fellow cultivators wiped out, the bulk of the compensation would have to be sought from the mission's issuer.

"Five Golden Core cultivators have fallen in battle. Among the two Foundation Establishment cultivators, one even possessed lower-grade celestial aptitude!"

This team had been renowned within the Soul Devouring Sect, boasting both seasoned veterans and exceptionally promising young talents.

Yet they had been utterly annihilated, with not a single survivor returning.

Di Gui's face paled as he tallied the results.

Over half of his personal wealth had been lost in this venture.

Tian Shuang frowned deeply. "At this rate, we'll likely be unable to take action against the Ning Clan for quite some time."

Both were Nascent Soul-level powerhouses with widespread reputations. If they intervened personally, it would undoubtedly provoke the Southern Bean Kingdom and escalate tensions between major powers.

The Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts' involvement in the Thousand Peaks Forest conflict had been an exceptional circumstance, not a common occurrence.

That was why they had issued a mission, tasking Golden Core cultivators with harassing the Ning Clan.

This level of conflict wasn't enough to warrant the attention of a cultivation nation. From the nation's perspective, Golden Core cultivators were countless, and only a few exceptional individuals warranted special attention.

The Soul Devouring Sect remained unaware of the secret alliance between the Ning Clan and the Zhu Clan, the royal family of the Southern Bean Kingdom. Had the Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts known this, they would never have allowed this team of cultivators to accept their mission and travel to the Southern Bean Kingdom.

"Where did that little thief Ning Zhuo run off to? Damn it! We can't get a grip on the Ning Clan. What do we do now?"

"Forget about our compensation. Even with ample resources, I doubt any Golden Core cultivators in the sect would dare accept a mission against the Ning Clan anytime soon."

As the Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts struggled with this dilemma, a Nascent Soul cultivator suddenly descended from the sky.

"Fellow Daoists, the Sect has an urgent mission!"

"A mission?" Tian Shuang instinctively shook his head. "We're already occupied with..."

The two were the sect's top Nascent Soul cultivators, holding extraordinary status. They didn't accept every mission.

Tian Shuang harbored deep hatred for Ning Zhuo. It wasn't just that Ning Zhuo had taken nearly all his wealth; more importantly, he had completely humiliated him. To this day, Di Gui never missed an opportunity to mock him about the incident.

The mere thought of it made Tian Shuang seethe with rage!

"We must avenge this humiliation!" Tian Shuang seethed, wishing he could stand before Ning Zhuo right now, tear him limb from limb, flay him alive, and torture him a hundred times over.

A dignified Nascent Soul cultivator like himself had been trampled underfoot by a mere Foundation Establishment disciple.

Until this humiliation is avenged, my mind will never be at peace!

Seeing Tian Shuang's refusal, the Nascent Soul cultivator sighed. "Fellow Daoists, the Sect specifically dispatched me to deliver this message due to exceptional circumstances."

"This mission has been personally assigned to you two by the Sect's leadership."

Tian Shuang snorted coldly. "Which high-ranking official is so callous toward their subordinates? Remember, we have our own backing too."

The Nascent Soul cultivator revealed a name: "Mr. Yin Yao."

Tian Shuang and Di Gui's expressions both shifted slightly.

Mr. Yin Yao was a master of divination, a Spirit Transformation realm cultivator, and the custodian of a Sect-wide treasure that governed the Soul Devouring Sect's fortunes. He rarely spoke, but when he did, his predictions were almost always accurate.

Di Gui immediately pressed, "What grave matter could move Mr. Yin Yao to personally intervene?"

The Nascent Soul cultivator replied, "It concerns the White Paper Immortal City."

"The Yin Tide Black Mire Swamp is an ideal blessed land for our Soul Devouring Sect, but unfortunately, it's already occupied."

The Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts nodded slightly. They were well aware of this strategic location and the Sect's long-standing covetousness of it.

The Nascent Soul sect member continued, "Recently, White Paper Immortal City suffered an unprecedented ghost tide attack, orchestrated by the Forgetful River Underworld."

"Our sect discovered this hidden plot and sought to use their own strength against them. We planned to let the Forgetful River Underworld overthrow White Paper Immortal City, then dispatch our elite forces to clean up the aftermath, seizing control of the entire Immortal City and the Yin Tide Black Mire Swamp."

"The mission failed."

"Bone Tomb Daoist, who led the operation, has yet to return."

"He's missing."

"But his soul lamp still burns steadily."

The Nascent Soul sect member paused before continuing, "To uncover the truth behind this incident and retrieve our missing Nascent Soul cultivator, the sect launched a thorough investigation."

"The results were disastrous."

"The fierce battle only allowed the White Paper City Lord to seize the opportunity to purge his enemies."

"The leaders of the former City Overthrow Alliance all lost their lives."

"With no other options, the sect sought the aid of divination experts. Unexpectedly, this matter drew the attention of Mr. Yin Yao, who volunteered to perform a divination."

Tian Shuang and Di Gui listened intently.

The Nascent Soul sect member spoke again, "Mr. Yin Yao's divination revealed that Bone Tomb Daoist has been captured. The sect must pay a substantial ransom for his release."

"This matter is of critical importance to the Soul Devouring Sect."

"Mr. Yin Yao has also calculated that the two of you are the most suitable candidates within the entire sect to redeem the captive."

"Therefore, he hopes you will make the journey and treat the cultivator holding Bone Tomb Daoist with utmost courtesy and respect. Under no circumstances should you act arrogantly or lose your temper."

"If this matter is mishandled, it could jeopardize the sect's overall strategy!"

Upon hearing this, the Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts understood the gravity of the situation. Their faces grew solemn as they solemnly vowed to follow Mr. Yin Yao's instructions, promising to negotiate with the utmost patience and sincerity to secure Bone Tomb Daoist's release.

The Nascent Soul cultivator added, "Remember, your primary objective is to win over the other party, or at least avoid creating further animosity."

"You must prioritize the sect's interests above all else. Don't let petty grievances compromise the greater good."

Di Gui nodded silently.

Tian Shuang thumped his chest confidently. "Rest assured, Sect! Who do you think I am? I've handled missions like this countless times. I know what's at stake!"

"When Di Gui and I represent the sect abroad, we always prioritize the big picture. You can trust us completely!"

Tian Shuang's decisive assurance left no room for doubt.

Seeing their resolute expressions, the Nascent Soul cultivator finally produced a Jade Slip. "Here are the mission details. Please voice any concerns you may have."

The Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts focused their spiritual senses on the slip, examining its contents.

Di Gui raised an eyebrow. "The Flying Cloud Kingdom? Dragon Loach Mountain?"

Tian Shuang: "If we're crossing borders, have the Travel Permits been prepared? After all, our reputations precede us - we're both Nascent Soul-level elites."

Di Gui nodded in agreement. "Without Travel Permits, we risk alerting the Flying Cloud Kingdom and provoking a reaction."

The Nascent Soul cultivator shook his head. "Sirs, you're representing the Sect on a clandestine mission to ransom our people. How could we use Travel Permits? How could you openly cross the border?"

Di Gui nodded again. "I understand."

Tian Shuang burst into laughter. "Rest assured, we'll handle this matter flawlessly!"

Two Note Kingdom.

General Mu's Residence.

Mu Lan had been in seclusion for over a month, now at the critical final stage of her cultivation.

The female general sat cross-legged, her consciousness plunged into her dantian. Within this inner realm, two legions stood in opposition.

The Red Blossom Legion, massive and imposing, resembled a colossal Rafflesia flower. On the other side, the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen's Legion was condensed into a stubborn, tightly knit mass.

"The moment has come." Mu Lan fully immersed her consciousness within the Red Blossom Legion.

In an instant, she found herself within a city. Ten thousand petals, overlapping like armor plates, formed the Flower Armor City. Stem-like veins, as sharp as halberds, pierced through the four cardinal directions. As Mu Lan ascended the city walls, the pistil at the city's heart unfurled like a crimson-gold military banner, fluttering in the wind.

Elsewhere, representing the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen, was a low-lying riverbank.

Behind the embankment, the surging tide roared like an enraged beast. Squads of Blood Armor Crossbow Guards, half-concealed by the waves, their crossbows gleaming like fish scales and bowstrings trembling like rain threads, poised to strike with an aura as solid as iron.

Without a commanding general, no military banner materialized within the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen's ranks.

Mu Lan's expression turned solemn as she slowly raised her hand.

Within her dantian, the colossal Red Flower Dharma Aspect stirred, rising from the earth to envelop the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen.

In Mu Lan's mind's eye, the Red Flower City and the riverbank drew impossibly close, and the two forces clashed in a fierce battle.

The front ranks of the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen knelt, while the rear ranks raised their crossbows. Ten thousand arrows loosed in unison, their mechanical clicks merging into a thunderous roar. Countless bolts transformed into a torrential downpour, their icy tips piercing through flowers and waves, turning the Flower Armor City's walls into a honeycomb.

Even though Mu Lan had spent her secluded cultivation period studying the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen in great detail, she was still slightly shaken by the sheer destructive power unleashed by this military formation.

Behind Mu Lan, the military banner fluttered violently as a brand-new city wall rose into existence. Simultaneously, countless Red Flower Buds sprouted from the blood-soaked embankment, spreading until they completely covered it.

Mu Lan personally commanded the Red Flower Dharma Aspect, while the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen remained without a commander. The qualitative difference between the two was stark.

Over two hours later, the Red Blossom Legion had completely absorbed the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen.

The fierce battle had served as both a crucible and a forge, refining and merging the two forces.

The newly formed Red Blossom Legion emerged even stronger. Its previous pale crimson hue deepened into a profound, solemn crimson, as if baptized in blood and fire.

The tips of each petal sharpened into razor-sharp points, resembling arrowheads.

"I've succeeded!"

Mu Lan's seated body trembled slightly as she slowly opened her eyes.

In that instant, a fleeting crimson glow, as vivid as blood, flashed deep within her eyes.

Mu Lan felt a sudden premonition and instinctively turned her gaze north.

In her perception, far to the north, she sensed two small pockets of Red Blossom Legion power, extremely faint yet faintly resonating with her own legion.

The sensation vanished as quickly as it had appeared, but Mu Lan had already grasped its significance.

"This is the power of the Red Flower Dharma Aspect. It must be the two miniature Dharma Manifestations I captured from Lin You and Wu Hen and handed over to Young Master Ning Zhuo."

"Strange, how have they sustained this for so long? Normally, half a month would have exhausted their reserves."

Mu Lan immediately realized the answer.

"That's it."

"Before entering seclusion to successfully merge with the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen, I used National Power Bricks to strengthen the Red Blossom Legion."

"With its foundation enhanced, the Dharma Manifestation's power outside also grew, becoming more enduring."

"I wonder how Young Master Ningzhuo is faring? Is his journey abroad more exciting than his time in Thousand Peaks Forest?"

"And... has another woman appeared by his side?"

Mu Lan indulged in a moment of reverie before quickly gathering her thoughts.

She was never one for sentimental musings, so she refocused on the matter at hand. "Though the Thousand Peaks Forest campaign ended in defeat, my meritorious service has stabilized the situation at the Grand General's Manor."

"The Meritorious Service points I earned weren't substantial. But... Prince Qiming gifted me the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen."

Prince Qiming, a venerable figure of great prestige in the Two Note Kingdom, rarely involved himself in ordinary political affairs.

His sudden gift of a military unit to Mu Lan sent shockwaves through the entire Two Note Kingdom's political arena.

Mu Lan's military achievements had barely stabilized the situation at General Mu's Residence. Prince Qiming's timely assistance, signaling his confidence in the residence, completely transformed Mu Lan's position.

Now, no faction, high-ranking official, or even the monarch dared to underestimate General Mu's Residence.

Perplexed by Prince Qiming's actions, Mu Lan immediately voiced her questions.

Prince Qiming explained that a sudden flash of insight had led him to this conclusion through divination: supporting General Mu's Residence would benefit the Two Note Kingdom.

While Prince Qiming lacked formal training in divination or the study of fate, he possessed a unique innate talent called "Blind Light at the End of Night."

Born blind, Prince Qiming lived in perpetual darkness. Yet whenever a sudden light pierced that darkness, he would experience a premonition, sensing a critical choice with profound implications for the future.

"In any case, for now, this is a good thing for our Grand General's Manor."

"As for the price we may have to pay later, we'll deal with that when the time comes."

Mu Lan pushed open the stone door of her cultivation chamber.

The Red Blossom Legion's foundation had deepened significantly, and they had gained a brand-new unit. She was itching to begin training her troops immediately, eager to forge the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen and bolster the overall strength of the Red Blossom Camp.

Myriad Manifestations Sect.

The sect was bustling with activity today.

Registration for the Soaring Cloud Assembly had officially begun.

Ning Zhuo arrived at the nearest registration point, surveying the scene from his cloud-borne vantage point. He saw a queue stretching from the mountain peak all the way down to its base.

The registration area at the summit was completely swamped, a sea of heads surging and clamoring.

Servant Disciples, Outer Sect Disciples, Inner Sect Disciples - all flaunting their sect status - cut in line, contributing to the chaos.

The only ones actually waiting in line were cultivators from outside the Myriad Phenomena Sect.

Ning Zhuo didn't join the queue; instead, he waited patiently for a moment.

"Brother Ning!" Shen Xi arrived on time, meeting up with Ning Zhuo.

Behind him, as always, was his cousin Su Lingkou.

"Let's go. I know someone here who can get us registered directly," Shen Xi said. As a member of the Shen Clan from Nine Palaces Immortal City, he had connections.

At the mountain peak, Ning Zhuo nodded and descended with Shen Xi, landing directly at the registration area.

"Make way!" Shen Xi pushed through the crowd.

The cultivator in charge of registration immediately stood up to greet Shen Xi.

Shen Xi's connections were clearly extraordinary. Seeing this, the cultivators who had been grumbling earlier fell silent and tacitly cleared a path for them.

Ning Zhuo, Shen Xi, and Su Lingkou approached the registration booth - a simple thatched shed.

The cultivator sat back down, retrieved a blank wooden plaque, and explained, "According to Sect Rules, all participants in the Soaring Cloud Assembly must register in person and create their identity plaques on the spot. Please forgive any inconvenience."

Shen Xi offered a polite acknowledgment.

"Name?" the cultivator asked.

Instead of answering, Shen Xi gestured to Ning Zhuo, deferring to him to go first.

"Ning Zhuo," Ning Zhuo replied. As he spoke, he channeled his spiritual energy, writing his name in mid-air with condensed energy.

The cultivator glanced at the energy-formed name, immediately carved the characters for "Ning Zhuo" onto the wooden plaque, stood up, and presented it to Ning Zhuo with both hands.

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, registration is complete. Please keep this plaque safe."
