Chapter 722: Ning Zhuo: Shut Up!

"Nearly twenty strands of Golden Core-level Void Spider Silk per day from a single spider? That production rate seems a bit exaggerated," Ning Zhuo thought, even though he wasn't particularly familiar with Void Spiders. Judging solely by market value, the claim still struck him as unbelievable.

Could it be that this spider possesses some innate talent that accelerates its silk production?

Ning Zhuo dismissed the wild speculation, knowing it would be inappropriate to pry further during their first meeting. Asking such a question would be considered rude.

He chose to believe Che Zhuzi. There was no apparent reason for the man to lie, and someone as shrewd as Che Zhuzi, who had thrived in the Myriad Manifestations Sect for so long, must value his business reputation.

"In that case, I'll order sixty strands to start," Ning Zhuo said.

Che Zhuzi hadn't yet grasped the scale of this potential deal, still wearing a smug smile. "What quality are you looking for?"

In his mind, Ning Zhuo was a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator who would naturally use Foundation Establishment-level materials. Of course, if quantity was the priority, it wouldn't be unusual for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to opt for Qi Refining-level materials instead.

"Golden Core-level, naturally," Ning Zhuo replied calmly. "If your spider can produce Nascent Soul-level silk at a reasonable price, I'll buy that too."

Naturally, if higher-grade materials were available, he would use them.

Che Zhuzi's eyes widened in surprise, his expression shifting slightly as he stared at Ning Zhuo. "Sixty Golden Core-level Void Spider Silk strands - are you certain?"

Ning Zhuo nodded. "Absolutely. This is the deposit."

With that, he produced a Ghost Path Golden Core and handed it directly to Che Zhuzi.

"A... a Golden Core?!" Che Zhuzi's eyes widened further.

Ning Zhuo had demonstrated both his wealth and his power!

A Golden Core... Che Zhuzi himself was only a Golden Core cultivator.

Which Foundation Establishment cultivator would offer a Golden Core as a mere deposit?

Chewing on this, Che Zhuzi desperately wanted to ask Ning Zhuo, "Who exactly are you? Where does your family come from?"

His assessment of Ning Zhuo's status skyrocketed.

Forcing himself to remain calm, Che Zhuzi replied with feigned nonchalance, "Sixty Golden Core-grade Void Spider Silk strands? This Golden Core would more than cover the full price."

Ning Zhuo frowned slightly, then apologized, "Ah, Senior Che Zhuzi, my apologies for not being clearer! I meant sixty strands per month."

Che Zhuzi lost his composure, staring at Ning Zhuo in disbelief. "Sixty strands per month? Are you certain? For how long?"

Ning Zhuo shrugged slightly. "Let's start with a year's contract, shall we?"

Che Zhuzi's brow furrowed, his mind racing. Although my production has skyrocketed seventeenfold, I can't sustain this level of output indefinitely.

Producing seventeen strands of Golden Core-level spider silk daily would be utterly exhausting. Over time, it would drain my vital essence, damage my Origin, and even harm my foundation.

To produce sixty strands of Void Spider Silk per month at full capacity would take at least four days. But realistically, I can't operate at full capacity.

At normal production levels, it would take six days.

How many six-day periods are there in a month?

Che Zhuzi felt trapped.

Ning Zhuo wasn't his only client; in fact, Ning Zhuo was a newcomer.

Che Zhuzi had long-standing business relationships with other buyers, his production comfortably meeting their needs.

But now, Ning Zhuo had forcefully inserted himself into the market, outbidding everyone else.

Seeing Che Zhuzi deep in thought, Ning Zhuo decisively raised the stakes. "Senior Che Zhuzi, do you find the deposit insufficient? No problem, I can add more."

With that, he produced another Ghost Path Golden Core.

Che Zhuzi's heart jolted again.

Ning Zhuo produced the Golden Core as casually as if it were an ordinary Medicinal Pill, his demeanor far too relaxed and nonchalant.

"With such deep pockets, he'll definitely be a major client in the future!" Che Zhuzi's heart raced.

Interrupted from his thoughts, Che Zhuzi might have been annoyed before, but now he forced a fawning smile and hastily replied, "Two Golden Cores as a deposit are more than enough - more than enough!"

Ning Zhuo was even more decisive, immediately urging, "Then let's sign the contract first."

Under Lady Spiderweb's watchful gaze, the two smoothly finalized the agreement.

"I'll take my leave now, Senior Che Zhuzi," Ning Zhuo said, turning to depart.

This was a substantial deal with even greater potential.

Che Zhuzi quickly called out, "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, no need to rush. We've hit it off so well - why not let me prepare some fine wine for us to share?"

Ning Zhuo tilted his head. "I have other matters to attend to. Senior Che Zhuzi, we can always catch up another time."

Despite the rejection, Che Zhuzi's smile only widened.

He personally escorted Ning Zhuo out of Azure Stone Cave Mansion. "No need to call me 'Senior' anymore. Let's just treat each other as equals."

"That works too," Ning Zhuo nodded, accepting the suggestion with casual ease.

Che Zhuzi observed this nonchalant attitude and couldn't help but speculate: It seems Ning Zhuo's status is truly extraordinary. Golden Core cultivators are nothing special to him.

Che Zhuzi grew increasingly convinced that befriending Ning Zhuo had been the right decision.

As Ning Zhuo prepared to depart, he suddenly turned to Che Zhuzi and said, "Fellow Daoist Che Zhuzi, I have a proposal for you to consider.

"If Ban Ji seeks to purchase Void Spider Silk from you, refuse him outright.

"I will acquire the corresponding quantity at a fifty percent premium, compensating you for any losses.

"What do you say?"

A sharp glint flashed in Che Zhuzi's eyes.

He understood Ning Zhuo's deeper meaning: he was being asked to choose a side.

"This certainly requires consideration," Che Zhuzi replied, not immediately rejecting the offer.

In a short time, Ning Zhuo had demonstrated his strength, completely altering Che Zhuzi's initial perception of him.

Upon returning to Azure Stone Cave Mansion, Ning Zhuo immediately interrogated Lady Spiderweb.

Lady Spiderweb collapsed to the ground, weeping and pleading. She began by praising Ning Zhuo as a paragon of the Righteous Path, a model of Virtue, and a peerless figure. Then she questioned how it could be right to enslave a weak woman. If he spared her, she vowed to reform and repay him later.

Ning Zhuo nodded, a faint smile playing on his lips, and commended her willingness to admit her wrongs. He then inquired about Ban Ji's plans to deal with him.

Lady Spiderweb's expression grew desperate, her voice trembling. She swore that if Ning Zhuo spared her, she would reveal everything she knew.

Ning Zhuo's smile widened. "Do you think I'm a naive child, Woman?"

Lady Spiderweb had previously observed Ning Zhuo's verbal sparring with Che Zhuzi. Now, tears streaming down her face, she declared her unwavering resolve to die rather than lose her freedom. She also offered to lead Ning Zhuo to hidden treasure troves if he spared her.

"Wouldn't I find out anyway if I searched your soul?" Ning Zhuo asked.

Lady Spiderweb shook her head vehemently, tears welling in her eyes. "Young Master Ning Zhuo, you're a rising star of the Righteous Path! How could you possibly use the Soul-Searching Art - a demonic technique?"

"What kind of Demonic Path methods are these?"

"If this were exposed, it would tarnish your reputation."

"You are kind and compassionate, merely trying to frighten me and guide me toward righteousness. I would gladly let you guide me..."

Lady Spiderweb cast a coquettish glance at Ning Zhuo before taking a few steps forward, her intention clear: to press against his calf.

Ning Zhuo immediately snorted coldly, his patience with Lady Spiderweb's evasiveness wearing thin.

With a swift kick, he sent Lady Spiderweb sprawling to the ground, his face radiating righteous indignation. "You heinous Demonic Cultivator! What use is there in discussing morality with someone like you? Isn't that utterly absurd?"

"I ask you this: when you plotted to harm me, did you hold yourself to such moral standards?"

Lady Spiderweb quickly began to sob, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, I was merely manipulated by others! Ban Ji's gang paid me handsomely, I..."

Ning Zhuo waved his hand dismissively. "Silence."

Lady Spiderweb immediately fell silent, whimpering but unable to utter another word.

Ning Zhuo sneered. "See? You've run out of excuses, haven't you?"

Lady Spiderweb's pupils constricted sharply as she glared at Ning Zhuo, her face flushed with anger. If you have the guts, don't use the Slave Contract to control me! Let me speak! Ahhh!

How can a young prodigy of the Righteous Path be so shameless?!

Ning Zhuo issued his final warning: "I won't waste any more time with you. This is your last chance. Confess honestly and spare yourself the pain."

Lady Spiderweb finally abandoned her menacing facade and sneered at Ning Zhuo. "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, you hold the Slave Contract. Why not use it to force me to reveal the truth?"

Before Ning Zhuo could answer, she answered her own question: "Yes, your suspicions are correct."

"After accepting Ban Ji's commission, we signed a contract. Any breach of its terms would result in severe consequences."

"Even if you use the Soul-Searching Art, you won't find what you seek."

"Don't forget, I am a Demonic Cultivator!"

"As a Demonic Cultivator, how could I not prepare defenses against Soul-Searching Arts?"

"I might as well tell you - I've long cultivated my soul to resist such techniques. In a critical moment, my soul will self-destruct, leaving you with nothing!"

"Even if my soul shatters and scatters, I will never let my enemies gain the upper hand!" Lady Spiderweb declared, her eyes flashing with ruthless determination, finally revealing the true nature of a Demonic Cultivator.

Ning Zhuo fell silent, his gaze fixed on Lady Spiderweb. After a few breaths, he spoke calmly, "You claim to resist Soul-Searching Arts? Which specific techniques are you referring to?

"For example, Soul-Binding Silken Threads, Three Souls' Spinning Wheel, Soul-Inquiry Demon-Feeding? Or perhaps Spirit Embryo, Soul Cicada Compensation, Human Candle Sacrifice?

"Or could it be Soul-Adornment Mirror Observation, Drowning Soul Sutra, Dream-Draining Soul Ointment?" Ning Zhuo rattled off the techniques as if listing precious treasures.

"If none of those work, there's also Nine-Fee Bone-Inquiry Bell, Affection-Tugging Buddha Detection Guide, Flea-Heart Ghost Comfort, Resentful Puppet Sympathetic Movement, and so on...

"All these methods possess the wondrous ability to search souls.

"Which ones can you resist?"

Lady Spiderweb listened in stunned silence. Her throat bobbed as she unconsciously swallowed. Her eyes, fixed on Ning Zhuo, were filled with shock and suspicion.

Why are you so familiar with these Soul-Searching Arts?

Are you the Demonic Cultivator here, or am I?

From Ning Zhuo's smile, Lady Spiderweb felt a chilling dread.

Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo silently thanked Tian Shuang, one of the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts, for his invaluable contribution.

A heavy silence settled between them.

Lady Spiderweb could only gamble that Ning Zhuo was bluffing.

And indeed, he was.

Though he knew the Soul-Searching Arts, he hadn't truly mastered them, leaving him unable to use them against her.

I could use the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability in conjunction with the Slave Contract... but the real key is the potential existence of a Secret-Keeping Covenant.

I need to find the full text of this covenant, then identify any loopholes or weaknesses before choosing which Soul-Searching Art to use.

It's like picking a lock - avoiding backlash while opening the gates to her memory vaults for my perusal.

As this thought crystallized, Ning Zhuo's mind and body jolted.

So that's it!

A spiritual light flashed in his divine sea, the weight of recent events finally allowing him to grasp a crucial insight.

Earlier, when this same light had appeared, Ning Zhuo's unsettling encounter with Ban Ji had disrupted his focus, preventing him from fully capturing the inspiration.

Now, having captured Lady Spiderweb and contemplating the Soul-Searching Arts, the same inspiration resurfaced.

The Soul-Searching Arts - they're the key!

Ning Zhuo trembled with barely suppressed excitement.

According to his theory, mastering these arts could trigger a profound qualitative transformation in his cultivation.

Ning Zhuo immediately put the matters of Ban Ji and Lady Spiderweb out of his mind.

I must focus all my efforts on mastering the Soul-Searching Art!

Cloud Soul Valley.

Tian Shuang stood at the edge of a precipice, his tattered robes whipping in the fierce wind.

A fierce battle had just concluded, with Tian Shuang defeated and Di Hui victorious.

Di Hui cast a spell and shouted, "Tian Shuang, awaken!"

As if struck by lightning, Tian Shuang snapped to awareness. He grabbed his face and tore the mask away with a violent tug.

After a few breaths, he ripped a ghost mask from his face.

I am Tian Shuang! I am Tian Shuang!

(I am not a ghost!)

With the ghost mask removed, Tian Shuang's mind cleared significantly, allowing him to remember his true identity.

Seeing his consciousness restored, Di Hui sighed in relief and slowly approached. "Tian Shuang, why did you maintain the Hetero-Soul Sympathy Technique for so long?"

Tian Shuang, drenched in cold sweat, shook his head weakly and sighed deeply. "I was too impatient for results."

Di Hui sighed as well.

Since their disastrous battle in the Thousand Peaks Forest, Tian Shuang had been unable to find peace. He had become restless and impatient in all aspects, desperate for quick success.

"The Hetero-Soul Sympathy Technique is one thing. If you misuse it, I can still cover for you."

"But you must never use the Dream Boat Soul-Crossing Technique!" Di Hui warned sternly.

Tian Shuang nodded. "Of course I understand that. I'm not that ignorant or reckless."

Di Hui sighed, gazing down at the fathomless abyss below County Cliff.

Perpetual mists swirled within the abyss, their gray-white wisps twisting into fleeting, indistinct human faces that vanished as quickly as they appeared in the dense fog.

"This is a rare place for Soul Cultivation," Di Hui said. "The Cloud Souls produced here are unique. Tian Shuang, you've nearly exhausted your family's fortune. Gather as many as you can while you're here."

Tian Shuang's face was utterly lifeless. "Can you please stop bringing that up?!"

Di Hui burst into hearty laughter.

Myriad Manifestations Sect, Azure Stone Cave Mansion.

Ning Zhuo stared intently at the Jade Slip. "I've decided - I'll learn the Tung Boat Soul Crossing Technique!"

This technique was a type of Soul-Searching Art, but its effects were extreme and domineering.

Once activated, it would ignite the target's soul, transforming it into a burning soul-boat.

The caster would then extract their own soul and board this fiery vessel, embarking on a self-propelled journey.

During this process, the soul-boat would burn fiercely, unleashing a torrent of memories.

The caster would passively absorb these memories, experiencing them as if they were their own, reliving the target's life firsthand!

Through this method, the caster could acquire any skill or knowledge the target possessed.

However, the risks were immense.

The overwhelming power of the Soul-Searching Art, combined with its effectiveness, meant that after experiencing another's entire life, the caster might completely forget their own identity.
