Chapter 543: Treasure Inspection

In an unmanned cave the mechanical Dragon silently laid on the mountain rock.

Inside the mechanism chamber, Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes.

He exhaled a long breath of turbid air, full of vigor, and all his injuries had healed.

Firstly, Ning Zhuo’s own injuries were not severe.

After all, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth were trying to capture him alive, so in many places they held back.

Secondly, one must also thank Lin Bufan. The Myriad Medicine Sect itself was full of physicians, and Lin Bufan, as its leader, was the most outstanding physician. For him to personally heal Ning Zhuo’s injuries was naturally far more effective than Ning Zhuo taking elixirs.

After his divine sense scanned his entire body and confirmed that everything was in order, Ning Zhuo stood up and opened the cabin door.

He went to the Dragon Head Chamber and met up with Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong, bored out of his mind, was fiddling with the mechanisms inside the Dragon Head Chamber, and from time to time he looked toward the storage bag placed on the table.

Upon seeing Ning Zhuo arrive, Sun Lingtong happily sprang up: “Hahaha, Little Zhuo, you have come, that’s great. Let’s quickly open the storage bag and have a look.”

A warm feeling arose in Ning Zhuo’s heart.

In the dozen-plus years in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, similar situations had occurred many times.

The things that Sun Lingtong stole were never inspected alone, but instead, he shared the loot with Ning Zhuo, enjoying the pleasure of the unknown.

The two sat cross-legged together, with the storage bag placed in front of them.

Sun Lingtong began to rub his hands.

Ning Zhuo also returned his anticipation. No wonder, this was the lifetime accumulation of the Heavenly Ghost; a formidable Nascent Soul level expert -what exactly did his wealth consist of?

Of course, before leaving, Tian Shuang had taken all the battle-worthy magical treasures and such with him.

Even so, this was enough to be worth the anticipation.

Just the storage bag itself had Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo studying it for a short while.

This was a Nascent Soul level storage bag, with a surface of pure snow white, made of silk, emitting a cold, eerie glow, and its appearance was evidently excellent.

By the way, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo had previously also seized a Nascent Soul level storage bag.

But it was locked, coming from the transport team of Twin Rivers Nation, and Sun Lingtong’s repeated attempts all ended in failure.

Tian Shuang’s storage bag, because it was voluntarily gifted by its original owner, was naturally in an open state.

The two opened the mouth of the bag and together infused their divine sense, and then saw that the bag was completely filled, brimming with all kinds of treasures.

The largest one was spirit stone.

So many spirit stones - so many that Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo, when they used their divine sense to inspect, for a moment could not count them.

Then came various treasure materials.

For example, Xuan Yin Cold Jade, Ice Silk Mushroom, Frost Spirit Vine, Extreme Cold Snow Dot, Yin Soul Flower, Ghost Soul Grass, Grudge Stone, etc.

There were also Snow Xiao and Ice Wolf sealed and detained within a token, as well as Cold Prison Crying Soul, Snow Bone Rakshasa, Ice Crystal Ghost, etc.

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo widened their eyes and then carefully examined them one by one.

The fine wine of the underworld, Huangquan Liquor; the Ghostly Pathway Guide Pill used for directing the way; the Yin Silkworm Soul-Shedding Pill used for Ghost Dao cultivation; the Mingling Soul-Recovery Pill for repairing the soul body and increasing spirituality...

Also, there were talismans that could teleport one to a relay station within a certain range - the Yin Courier Route Guide; the Crying Wall Talisman used to confine people; and the talisman that increased the absorption of the netherworld’s dark qi...

A comb made of white bones, known as the Yin Vein Comb, specifically used to comb out the congested and chaotic yin qi within the soul body.

The Wangchuan Boat that could ferry across the underworld’s River of the Dead.

The Soul Nurturing Box used for soul cultivation, which could enhance the foundation of one’s soul.

The chess pieces were a Yin Chess Board made from condensed skulls.

A large quantity of paper money - Du Yin Money, used for traveling to and from the Ghost Market.

The Soul-Shaking Bell used to control a large number of ghosts.

A funeral sedan specifically for ghosts to seize a host, with the possibility of rebirth...

Although Tian Shuang had taken away the magical treasures used for battle, he still left behind a large amount of treasures. These treasures were all for daily cultivation or everyday needs.

“Tian Shuang is truly something - in order to prevent us from getting confused about the functions of these items, he thoughtfully provided brief explanations in the Jade Tablet,” Sun Lingtong exclaimed.

Ning Zhuo said, “We should first count the spirit stones.”

Regarding this point, Tian Shuang had not clarified it in the Jade Tablet.

Tian Shuang was a top expert among Nascent Soul cultivators, and had a large reserve of spirit stones. They were basically mostly mid-grade spirit stones, with only a few high-grade and low-grade ones.

Generally speaking, Qi Refinement-level and Foundation Establishment-level cultivators used mainly low-grade spirit stones, while Golden Core-level and Nascent Soul level cultivators used mid-grade spirit stones.

When one reached the Soul Formation-level and the Void Refinement-level, the quality of spirit stones reached high grade, which yielded the highest usage efficiency.

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo roughly estimated and found that the spirit stones in Tian Shuang’s storage bag, when converted to mid-grade, had already exceeded one hundred million.

Over one hundred million mid-grade spirit stones!

“It was the first time I had seen so many spirit stones.”

“Truly befitting the wealth of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth.”

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were filled with amazement.

The two looked at each other, and both saw the look of surprise in each other’s eyes.

Originally, when participating in the pacification battle of Twin Rivers Nation, Ning Zhuo had intended to seize an opportunity to reclaim his mother’s relics, but unexpectedly, in the process of participating, he gained far more than he anticipated!

“Previously when we raided the battlefield, we acquired mid-grade spirit stones valued at over ten million; we did not expect this time to be even more!”

“But on second thought, one hundred million is not that many. At most, it is just the number of times we played the role of the Old Stone Monster to scoop up loot before, plus nine more times.”

Sun Lingtong, though nonchalant in his tone, had his hands already on his waist, revealing a hint of his smug little mood.

Ning Zhuo, however, was even more composed: “In fact, our chances of playing the Old Stone Monster and seizing loot are not many.”

“After that, we never encountered such opportunities again. In fact, playing the Old Stone Monster had become a very dangerous matter, which would incur the suppression of two Soul Formation-level beings.”

“Tian Shuang giving gifts so proactively was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that could not be sought after.”

“Because even if I, in the future, were to use Buddha Thoughts to flood others’ divine seas, others would not necessarily, like Tian Shuang, fight with a single-minded determination and, on the eve of battle, bestow their family inheritance.”

“Moreover, this time, I was also being clever. First, by using the divine technique of Live Hanging by a Thread, I managed to connect with Tian Shuang’s Ghost Mask, and then, through the connection between the Ghost Mask and his body, indirectly influenced Tian Shuang.”

Sun Lingtong nodded, agreeing with Ning Zhuo’s analysis, and the look of joy on his face diminished considerably.

The two then continued to examine further.

What remained were the Jade Tablets, Jade Disks, and such items.

These items recorded a large amount of intelligence, cultivation methods, spells, and even divine techniques, etc.

For example, many internal documents regarding the Soul-Devouring Sect, records on the improvement of the Soul-Devouring Technique, the method of refining the treasure “Ghost Gate”, Snow Bone Rakshasa, Earth-Melting Ghost, Ice Corpse Breeding, etc.

Also, for instance, Tian Shuang’s main cultivation method was “The Record of Nine Hells Cold Soul”, while the Earth Ghost’s main cultivation method was “The Sutra of Fiery Annihilation and Soul Melting”, and their Heaven and Earth Combined Attack technique.

“It’s a pity, as they are all focused on Soul Dao cultivation, which is not very relevant to us; at most, it will increase our understanding of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth and such, broadening our horizons,” Sun Lingtong said with a look of regret.

Ning Zhuo then reminded him: “Boss, don’t forget, there are also other people’s spoils.”

The Heaven and Earth Combined Attack executed in unison by Tian Shuang and Di Hui was of unparalleled might, causing the space to tremble and become chaotic, and on the spot it killed nearly ten Nascent Soul level cultivators.

Only three managed to escape, while the rest lost their lives.

And the treasures left behind by those people on the battlefield were not picked up by the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, and eventually fell into the hands of the Three Generals Camp.

This time, when the Three Generals Camp returned to report, they took some of them, and the rest were handed over to Ning Zhuo.

On one hand, the Three Generals Camp and Ning Zhuo had an agreement that Ning Zhuo himself would receive thirty percent of the spoils; on the other hand, in the battle against the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, Ning Zhuo had played the major role, so the vast majority of the spoils belonged to him.

From the Liev Yang Zhenren came the Dairi Xun Tian Banner.

This treasured banner was only half left; on the banner was painted a picture of a yellow sun soaring in the sky, and by shaking the long banner, it could invoke sunlight and blazing flames.

From the Yin Yang Scholar came the Taiji Yin Yang Cloak.

The black and white two-tone great cloak secretly contained the universe; the white side depicted the celestial bodies of the heavens, while the black side embroidered the nine springs of the Yellow Springs. Unfortunately, only thirty percent remained.

From the Empty Valley Zither Immortal came the Yun Guang Heart-Guarding Mirror.

It was a magical treasure-level mechanism, with twelve Lu resonant plates built inside; once it sustained an attack, it could emit sound waves to counteract the damage.

But it was also badly broken.

All these spoils of war picked up on the battlefield had one thing in common, and that was that they were damaged.

After all, if they were intact, their owners would have long been the victors, rather than dead or injured.

Even so, these damaged treasures still had considerable value.

Firstly, any treasures that survived the Heaven and Earth Combined Attack were already extraordinary. Secondly, their current broken state did not necessarily mean they would remain so in the future; if one found a suitable master of refining artifacts and the proper refinement techniques, they could be revitalized. Third, even without being repaired, they could be sold. Damaged magical treasures also helped stabilize the market.

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo examined these spoils one by one, without delving deeply into them.

“If only their storage bags, storage belts, and the like could be preserved, how wonderful that would be!” Ning Zhuo lamented.

“Hehe, wishful thinking. Under the Heaven and Earth Combined Attack, most cultivators would be reduced to nothing - not even bone fragments would remain, let alone these items,” Sun Lingtong said with an eye-roll.

Then he continued, “This time, the Three Generals Camp, upon returning to the main camp, brought some spoils, and also, this time we defeated the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth. This battle merit is something to look forward to.”

The penultimate acquisition was Tian Shuang’s Ghost Mask.

This ghost mask was specially gifted by Tian Shuang to Ning Zhuo,

and lastly, there was the Wood-in-Fire.

After Lin Bufan and Ning Zhuo met up, he briefly explained his own ordeal to him. In the end, he handed over Wood-in-Fire to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo initially examined Wood-in-Fire and then stored it away.

This was the first time in his life that he had obtained such a precious fire seed.

Under normal circumstances, he would have definitely studied it carefully.

But now, it was not a good time for research. He had to quickly replenish his mechanism puppets and restore his combat power!

“The battle with the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth might very well be a situation where the Heavenly Ghost recovers, the two reconcile, and then come to cause me trouble again.”

“After all, although there were many Buddha Thoughts, they had already become water without a source. Without my timely replenishment, once normal thoughts in Tian Shuang’s divine sea reached a certain scale, he would be able to think normally.”

“Di Hui was well aware of his situation, and therefore only needed to restrain and wear him down, engaging in a prolonged battle, to delay until Tian Shuang regained his former state.”

Ning Zhuo had never been optimistic about Tian Shuang’s pursuit of Di Hui.

But he could not dissuade him.

In Tian Shuang’s divine sea, it was all Buddha Thoughts, and he was determined to atone for his sins; Ning Zhuo simply could not stop him.

Once Tian Shuang had some normal thoughts, the risk for Ning Zhuo would be too great.

Tian Shuang was resolute in pursuing Di Hui to atone for his sins, and Ning Zhuo, unable to persuade him otherwise, could only let things take their natural course.

Thus, Ning Zhuo had to fully enhance himself before the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth returned to kill.

“I cannot predict the time when the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth will come back to kill me.”

“Therefore, the longer I remain on this battlefield, the more perilous it becomes.”

“Sigh, when will the opportunity to attack the Six Caves Sect finally appear?”
