Chapter 451: Wusheng Fire

The cover of Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings was made of metal.

On the cover, four large characters were written vertically ———— Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings. The brushstrokes were vigorous and forceful. At first glance, it was as if a violent storm blew right into one’s face, inducing an indescribable sense of oppression.

Ning Zhuo could not discern what kind of metal it was. He guessed it was likely a result of some kind of metal refining mixture.

When Sun Lingtong performed a thieving technique called “Real Copying Hand,” he felt as if his palm were being pierced by countless golden needles. The intense pain made him grimace fiercely.

But regardless of the pain, he gritted his teeth and persisted, both eyes red, incomparably excited!

“Gao Sheng’s military strategies —these are the personal writings of a great power at the Void Refinement stage. What an immensely precious relic!”

Ning Zhuo, however, tried various methods in turn, yet he had no good way to handle Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings.

Right then, Ning Zhuo took out a formation disk and arranged a sealing formation around this military book.

His cultivation in the art of war was too weak.

Fortunately, they had made many preparations for this operation.

The formation activated, and the embedded top-grade spirit stones were consumed rapidly. Its might gradually rose, step by step sealing the military book.

“It’s damaged, so Shuang Jing is qualified to use it?” Ning Zhuo pondered.

“This military book is like a dead object. That’s very strange.”

“Luckily it’s damaged. If it truly possessed sentience, it wouldn’t be so easy to snatch!” Sun Lingtong’s face was deathly pale, covered in sweat, in an extremely weakened state.

He had paid a hefty price.

A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, attempting to seize a handwritten text from a Void Refinement great power.

“No! My clan’s Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings!” Shuang Jing cried out.

He watched helplessly as the Old Stone Monster swallowed the military book. His vision went dark, and he nearly fainted from anger.

Lord Long also witnessed this scene and was extremely furious.

He had fought desperately, and in the end, all the benefits were taken by the Old Stone Monster.

How could he not be enraged?!

He immediately sent a divine sense transmission: “Old Stone Monster, temporarily keep the military book in your care, and hand it over after the battle.”

Sun and Ning — these two simply ignored him, controlling the Old Stone Monster to drill underground again.

The Earth-Escape Technique could indeed travel through soil, but its escaping light was obvious and its aura startling.

The Earth-Walking Technique!

This technique was not the same as the Earth-Escape Technique.

There was a difference between the two.

The Earth-Walking Technique’s casting requirements were much higher than those of the Earth-Escape Technique. It allowed for much faster travel underground and truly merged one’s body with the earth.

Therefore, casting the Earth-Walking Technique often imposed requirements on the cultivator’s physique and cultivation method.

The Old Stone Monster himself was born from ten-thousand-year earth essence, and this body was entirely composed of earth-element treasures, so physically he met the requirements.

Ning Zhuo’s Earth-Walking Spleen Temple mainly relied on the Five-Viscera-Temple Spiritual Divine Art. Even if it was an ancient method, it was still quite excellent. Ning Zhuo, at least, reached the realm of a Five-Element Grandmaster. With him exerting full control, the cultivation method also passed the test.

Only by this could the “Old Stone Monster” be driven to utilize the Earth-Walking Technique.

Sun and Ning —these two, originally like fish in water underground, found themselves encountering numerous obstacles this time.

As it turned out, countless ginseng-like roots were taking root underground, twisting and tangling in a thick web.

Traveling through soil with the Earth-Walking Technique was as easy as breathing. But encountering these wooden ginseng roots felt like crashing into walls.

As a result, Sun Ning and his partner could only keep taking detours underground, avoiding countless ginseng roots, weaving through the gaps.

More and more ginseng roots emerged from the position of Lord Long, continuously breaking through the mountainous terrain, shooting upward, and slaughtering all enemies.

The routed soldiers of the White Jade Battalion were massacred in large numbers as they fled.

Shuang Jing and the others were desperately trying to escape.

Mulan’s face was ashen. The very thing she didn’t want to see was happening right before her eyes.

This time, she no longer hoped to rescue the White Jade Battalion. She glanced at the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect overhead and saw that inside the aspect many enemy cultivators, including Chi Tengyi, were trapped.

“If we don’t retreat now, it will be too late!”

However, the Red Flower Battalion, having formed a formation and fought for a long time, was already in a state of extreme fatigue.

They struggled to maintain the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect, as if shouldering a thousand-jin burden, making it fundamentally difficult to march normally.

Their marching speed was too slow, not to mention trying to retreat.

Previously, when the Three-Generals Battalion was nearby, the Red Flower Battalion could still use “Not Sharing a Flower” to offload the burden onto allied troops. But now, the White Jade Battalion had already collapsed and could not bear it at all.

Sun and Ning —these two also noticed this scene and were rushing underground toward the Red Flower Battalion.

“Zhang Zhongyi isn’t bad. He’s worth extending a helping hand to.”

“Although the Red Flower Battalion isn’t wealthy, even a broken ship still has three pounds of nails. They should have some good stuff.”

“Exactly!” Sun Lingtong nodded. “Just now, Mulan’s astonishing shot —without some treasure as support, how could it have such terrifying power?”

Inside the Light Mountain Heavy Fog Diagram:

The latest military developments were conveyed into the hands of Lu Hongtu, the Cave Master of the Mo Yuan Cave.

He laughed heartily and transmitted the jade slip to the other three Nascent Soul Cave Masters.

“Lord Long is mighty indeed!”

“This time’s ambush, we shall achieve a grand victory!”

“Hahaha, splendid, splendid.”

The Demon Heart, Blood Shadow, and Poison Scorpion Cave Masters were all delighted.

Lu Hongtu said, “Next, we just wait for Lord Long’s side to rout the enemy forces and come join us, and then we’ll swallow up this Golden Halberd Army as well!”

At this thought, he suddenly felt something odd.

Carefully savoring this emotion, Lu Hongtu became increasingly certain: “Something seems not quite right.”

At this time, a sentence from the Demon Heart Cave Master suddenly awakened him: “Great Cave Master, although victory is at hand, we must still be careful.”

“The Golden Halberd Army is one of the Forbidden Armies. The soldiers of Two Note Kingdom’s Forbidden Army all cultivate the ‘Guardian Aerial Escape Art’.”

“We must guard against them going mad with desperation!”

Lu Hongtu’s heart was shaken: “The Guardian Aerial Escape Art? Indeed, if Sun Gan truly became desperate, why wouldn’t he use this military art?!”

“Since he obtained the previous intelligence, so much time has passed. Why hasn’t he used it?”

He immediately waved his sleeve, commanding the other three to manipulate the formation map and make some adjustments.

“He appears to be extremely anxious, but in fact, maybe not!”

“Or… he does not truly wish to exert all efforts to rescue the White Jade Battalion?”

Doubts sprouted swiftly in Lu Hongtu’s mind, but he could not be certain.

From Sun Gan’s perspective, he saw that the heavy mountains and drifting mists returned to normal, like interlocked clasps that slightly loosened, creating a small gap.

Yet Sun Gan did not rush to break out. Instead, he controlled the Golden Dragon Dharmic Aspect, continually maneuvering.

“Not good!” Seeing this, Lu Hongtu exclaimed softly.

The three cultivators were baffled.

Lu Hongtu’s face was somber. He no longer explained, only said: “All of you, obey! Quickly cooperate with me to withdraw the formation, break away from the enemy, and get out swiftly.”

Demon Heart and the others: ?!

A hundred zhang high in the sky:

A huge white cloud was drifting.

Inside the white cloud, a battalion was hidden.

This battalion displayed red flags, the troops in perfect order, having formed their battle formation. Their military strength was at its peak state.

It was precisely the Fire Cloud Battalion!

“Sun Gan ordered us to secretly march, and it actually achieved the desired effect.” The Fire Cloud Battalion’s main general, Lu Chi, sighed leisurely.

The next moment, the battle formation dharmic aspect of the Fire Cloud Battalion shot out abruptly, directly flying toward the battlefield below.

He stared at the mirror before him. Within it were scenes of fierce battles at various fronts.

“Now is the moment—attack!” Lu Chi’s tongue erupted like spring thunder as he decisively issued the order.

This dharmic aspect resembled a thread of fire, very thin, incredibly fast, and precisely struck Lord Long’s body.

Boom!!!

In the next moment, flames roared and blazed, rising to a height of six zhang.

Lord Long’s entire body was shrouded in fire, his size and life force plummeting!

Lord Long’s heart shook violently, crying out in alarm: “Wusheng Fire?!”

Wusheng Fire danced with crimson clouds in flight, Blazing radiance pierced the sky, the world in might. Red flames burned life with no dust to remain, Bleached bones looked on, smiling at ashes’ refrain.

A fire-element treasure of sinful origin — Wusheng Fire.

It only burned the living. It had no effect on dead objects or ghosts.

The richer one’s vitality, the more fuel there was. The fire’s power only grew stronger!

Before long, Lord Long could no longer hold out and was burned unconscious.
