Chapter 630: Colossus Ning Zhuo

"I feel completely empowered!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed, his heart racing with excitement.

This marked his first official attempt at controlling the Paper Giant. After reaching an agreement with the White Paper Immortal City Lord, the colossal figure had become his property. Following the transaction, the White Paper City Lord had instructed him in the methods of its operation.

In the days since, Ning Zhuo had secretly practiced a few times, though his attempts had been cautious and brief.

When crisis erupted at the South City Gate, Ning Zhuo rushed to the scene. Instead of joining the battle immediately, he dove into the Paper Giant and activated it.

As the mechanism engaged, Ning Zhuo felt as if he were inflating a balloon. Within moments, he had grown to colossal proportions, his body now encased in a layer of paper armor.

At first, he could still perceive the difference between his flesh and the paper construct. But soon, this distinction vanished entirely, merging his consciousness completely with the Paper Giant.

Ning Zhuo's spirit soared to unprecedented heights. His soul and physical body receded from awareness, leaving only the sensation of being the Paper Giant itself.

From the outside, the Paper Giant appeared to have transformed rapidly after kicking away the Golden Core Ghost General.

Its face turned green with fangs, taking on a ghostly appearance. Yin Qi, dark as ink, surged from its white paper body. The malevolent energy solidified into a layer of black iron armor, fully arming the Paper Giant.

Ning Zhuo's kick had sent the Golden Core Ghost General flying like a man would send a mouse scurrying. Seizing the momentum, he took a giant step forward and brought his foot down with devastating force.

Thud!

The power of his kick carved a deep footprint into the White Paper Immortal City's paving stones. The resulting shockwave swept the Scarlet Ghost General away like a gust of wind.

The Scarlet Ghost General shuddered, staring at the cratered footprint. "If that had hit me, I'd be critically injured and near death!"

Yang Sanyan's divine sense reached out to Ning Zhuo. "Ning Zhuo! Don't recklessly pursue them. Leave the Golden Core Ghost Generals to me! You should focus on the main threat!"

"Understood," Ning Zhuo replied without hesitation.

His previous flying kick had indeed struck the Long Axe Ghost General, but it had been a lucky strike catching the enemy off guard.

When truly attacking, the Paper Giant's power was astonishing, but its speed was slow, making each move easily predictable.

Thus, the Scarlet Ghost General effortlessly evaded the subsequent stomping.

"Dealing with these small fry is indeed quite inconvenient."

"Unfortunately, the Paper Giant truly lacks such capabilities."

Having experienced the war against the Two Note Kingdom, Ning Zhuo naturally possessed sufficient combat expertise.

He knew Yang Sanyan's words were entirely correct. Without hesitation, he abandoned the pursuit of the Ghost Generals and charged toward the Dead Bone Giant.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The Colossus Ning Zhuo ran, each footstep carving deep pits into the ground tiles and sending tremors through the earth.

Boom!

With another deafening crash, Ning Zhuo slammed into the Dead Bone Giant, knocking it to the ground.

The buildings beneath the two colossal figures were instantly crushed and flattened.

Tie Guzheng's eyelids twitched violently as he urgently transmitted through divine sense: "Don't fight here! Move away from the city gate!"

The Colossus Ning Zhuo rose first, followed closely by the Dead Bone Giant.

The latter swung its massive arm in a sweeping arc, aiming a punch from left to right at Ning Zhuo's head.

The Colossus Ning Zhuo ducked to avoid the counterattack, then seized the Dead Bone Giant and executed a perfect shoulder throw.

Thud!

The Dead Bone Giant crashed to the ground with a deafening impact, sending up a cloud of dust. A dozen more buildings collapsed, their paper walls disintegrating into a flurry of debris.

Ning Zhuo was about to press his advantage when a sudden shout of warning rang out: "Look out!"

A blast of wind struck from behind.

Instinctively, Ning Zhuo crouched and rolled, narrowly avoiding the heavy strike aimed at his back.

It was a second Dead Bone Giant!

The creature's fist, as massive as a siege hammer, swept through the air and smashed into a three-story paper building that hadn't yet fully collapsed.

Boom!

The paper structure exploded like a detonated barrel of gunpowder. It violently deformed, expanded, then collapsed in a thunderous explosion, disintegrating into countless fragments of paper.

These debris hurtled outward like a meteor shower, smashing into distant low-lying houses and causing secondary destruction.

Ning Zhuo rolled across the ground for some distance before crouching down, turning to look back.

Seeing the two Dead Bone Giants standing together, he felt his heart sink. "How am I supposed to fight these?"

His gaze instinctively shifted to another direction, focusing on the Ghost Cultivator.

It was Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.

Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was still maintaining her Return to Silence Path Candle.

The candle was burning fiercely, already reduced by twenty percent.

"We must eliminate her!"

"Otherwise, more Dead Bone Giants will keep appearing!"

Ning Zhuo's gaze swept across the battlefield. Yang Sanyan and the Bone Tomb Daoist were locked in intense combat with Golden Core Ghost Generals, unable to break through for the moment.

Ning Zhuo resolved to take action himself.

But as he rose, two Dead Bone Giants immediately surrounded him.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Three colossal figures clashed in brutal close combat.

"Even with their increased size, they're still cumbersome!"

Lacking practical combat experience, Ning Zhuo found himself initially overwhelmed by the two Dead Bone Giants.

Turn, punch, retreat, dodge, counter-force... Though outnumbered, Ning Zhuo swiftly gained control and took the upper hand.

Though the Dead Bone Giants possessed formidable strength and deep defenses, their intelligence was limited - they lacked even basic martial skills. This deficiency gave Ning Zhuo numerous advantages in close combat.

The good times didn't last. The third Dead Bone Giant's arrival completely changed the situation.

The Colossus Ning Zhuo began retreating under pressure.

He withdrew into a cluster of buildings, each step crushing a civilian dwelling beneath his feet.

"Time to activate martial arts!"

The Paper Giant contained hidden capabilities.

Martial Art - Long-Arm Python Constriction.

The Colossus Ning Zhuo's arms suddenly elongated, attacking in unison like two living, pale serpents!

The serpent-like arms directly ensnared the Dead Bone Giant.

Crunch... Crunch...

The Dead Bone Giant's body was forcibly torn apart, the cracking sounds merging into a continuous cacophony.

To Ning Zhuo, it felt like he was snapping dry wood.

Under the Colossus Ning Zhuo's strength, the Dead Bone Giant's bones truly shattered like decaying branches!

The upper body of one Dead Bone Giant was reduced to nothing but its spine and head.

Just as it was about to be completely destroyed, the remaining two Dead Bone Giants reacted. Their bodies erupted with bone spurs, completely enveloping the Colossus Ning Zhuo.

Many sharp, thick bone spurs pierced through the armor, deeply stabbing into the Colossus Ning Zhuo's body.

Intense pain immediately shot through him.

Ning Zhuo let out a muffled groan but stubbornly maintained the Long-Arm Python Constriction Martial Art. After finally severing one Dead Bone Giant, he pushed with both palms, coordinating his legs to kick backward, creating distance between himself and the two remaining Dead Bone Giants.

The Colossus Ning Zhuo's armor and body were now riddled with numerous holes.

Two Golden Core Ghost Generals seized the opportunity, slipping through the large openings to enter the Paper Giant.

Ning Zhuo detected this, feeling both shock and anger. "What's happening? What is Yang Sanyan doing? He failed to block these Ghost Generals?"

Ning Zhuo had always recognized and looked forward to Yang Sanyan's combat prowess.

Yet at this critical moment, he'd dropped the ball.

When Ning Zhuo's gaze swept across the battlefield and landed on Yang Sanyan, his heart sank. He immediately understood the man's predicament.

Blood trickled from the corner of Yang Sanyan's mouth, his chest caved in where a deep rod imprint marred his flesh. His eyes locked onto the enemy who'd ambushed him. "What do you Soul Devouring Sect want?"

The attacker was none other than Bone Tomb Daoist, a Golden Core True Disciple from the Soul Devouring Sect. He caressed his bone staff with deliberate calm. "The Soul Devouring Sect wants more, of course."

"Yet the White Paper City Lord values her independence above all."

"Even if we offered better terms, she'd still refuse to abandon the Myriad Manifestations Sect and elevate us as the foremost power here."

"Given that, our alliance with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord becomes both reasonable and necessary."

The City Lord's plea for aid had inadvertently invited wolves into the fold.

Yang Sanyan's voice cut through the chaos. "The Myriad Manifestations Sect has poured our blood and sweat into this White Paper Immortal City. Our position as the foremost sect is rightfully earned!"

"Bone Tomb Daoist, you'll pay for this mistake!"

Boom!

Yang Sanyan and Bone Tomb Daoist clashed in a deadly dance, their battle becoming an unbreakable stalemate.

This left Ning Zhuo in a precarious position.

His energy was barely enough to control the Paper Giant and fend off the two Dead Bone Giants outside.

As a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, it was already remarkable that he could activate and manipulate a Nascent Soul-level Paper Giant.

At that moment, Ning Zhuo had no strength left to deal with enemies who had infiltrated the giant's body, let alone interfere with Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.

So long as Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer remained, she would continue to teleport more Dead Bone Giants!

Time was on the Underworld Army's side.

Boom!

Ning Zhuo rolled on the ground, narrowly avoiding the Dead Bone Giants' pincer attack. At the same time, he used this movement to shake off the other Golden Core Ghost Generals trying to burrow in.

As he rolled, all buildings in his path were flattened and exploded.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The two Dead Bone Giants pursued relentlessly.

Ning Zhuo tried to stand up, but his knees suddenly gave way.

The Long Axe Ghost General had reached his knees and destroyed most of the Formation nodes inside.

"Bad!" Ning Zhuo's fusion with the Paper Giant was broken.

He suddenly felt utterly burdened, each movement carrying the weight of a mountain.

Meanwhile, another Ghost General advanced along his left arm toward his chest.

As it progressed, the armor on Ning Zhuo's left arm rapidly deteriorated, showing signs of imminent collapse and disintegration.

A tearing pain erupted from Ning Zhuo's left arm.

Boom!

The Dead Bone Giant's massive strike knocked Ning Zhuo to the ground.

The heavy impact struck at his very soul, causing intense agony.

He could only curl up, focusing all his energy on defense.

Thud, thud, thud...

The Dead Bone Giant's relentless attacks battered Ning Zhuo's soul like a hammer.

In an instant, Ning Zhuo's ears rang with a continuous hum, his vision darkened at the edges, and crimson specks of light began dancing at the periphery.

He found himself besieged by internal and external threats.

Even if he wanted to disengage now, he'd have to sever the tight connection between himself and the Paper Giant.

Any careless separation would trigger a terrifying backlash!

The Underworld.

The Great Tribulation Sacrifice Altar.

The Void Return Black Sphere of the Soundless Ghost Monk clashed against the Myriad Souls Torrent of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord in a desperate struggle.

The Silent Nirvana Zen Sound emanating from the monk threatened to annihilate the Prefecture Lord's forces.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord made his decision!

He formed hand seals and shifted his offensive strategy.

The waters of the Forgetful River surged forth, transforming into multiple Profound Nether Water Dragons!

These monstrous serpents roared with terrifying force, forged from thousands of tons of river water, boundless yin qi, colossal spiritual energy, and countless Wailing Souls.

Carrying a miasma of Death Qi, they circled around the Void Return Black Sphere and lunged at the Soundless Ghost Monk.

The Soundless Ghost Monk had been ruthlessly slaughtering the Prefecture Lord's forces. Now facing the encroaching water dragons, his murky eyes finally showed emotion.

A single dragon could tear apart ordinary Transformation Body cultivators, yet seven now surrounded him!

The Soundless Ghost Monk unleashed his Lifebound Treasure - a Buddhist Wheel.

The Buddhist Wheel ascended, radiating a terrifying aura that amplified the monk's own power to its zenith!

Spinning rapidly, the wheel's Buddhist Light carved out a battlefield, warping space to form an enormous, indistinct image of a Withered Silent Buddha that stretched from heaven to earth!

The Nirvana Buddha!

The seven Profound Nether Water Dragons were halted in their charge, unable to advance a single inch against the Buddha's presence.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's face paled.

He knew they had reached the critical moment of their confrontation.

He couldn't retreat, nor could he afford to.

At this critical moment!

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord summoned the Lord of Forgetful River Seal.

The seal was entirely pitch-black, neither metal nor jade, its ancient and solemn design exuding authority. Its seal ring bore a coiled netherworld dragon, while four sides of the seal were engraved with countless flowing netherworld runes—the supreme symbol of power ruling the Forgetful River Underworld and controlling the Forgetful River River—the Lord of Fogetful River Seal!

This was a national treasure!

The Prefecture Lord poured his entire lifetime's cultivation into the seal and hurled it at the Buddha's phantom form!

The national treasure struck the Buddha's phantom head-on, causing it to abruptly shrink.

The national treasure hovered in mid-air, suppressing the battlefield.

The seven Profound Nether Water Dragons regained their might, climbing up the Buddha's phantom and entangling it tightly.

The water dragons emitted dragon cries, their forces resonating in harmony. Finally, their heads and tails connected, forming a lock that sealed the Buddha's phantom layer by layer.

The Lord of Forgetful River Seal was also enveloped within.

Ultimately, a massive silver-gray sphere formed. Its surface bore raised carvings of seven Profound Nether Water Dragons.

The Soundless Ghost Monk gazed steadily at the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. His tattered monk robes billowed without wind, his emaciated body becoming translucent and fading like a mirage.

Finally, he took a step back. The space beneath his feet rippled like water, and his figure merged into the dark void, vanishing completely.

"Decisive, if nothing else," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord snorted coldly.

Though victorious and having sealed the enemy's Lifebound Buddha Wheel, his mood remained heavy. The reason lay in his own Lord's Seal, which had been forced inside alongside the enemy's artifact.

Without this sacrifice, how could he have suppressed the enemy's Nirvana Buddha Wheel?

"This might be a deliberate scheme to further weaken my combat strength!" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord detected the stench of conspiracy.

Yet he had no choice but to adapt to each forced move.

His losses extended beyond the Lord's Seal. Three of his five Nascent Soul cultivators had fallen, and sixty percent of his thirty thousand Imperial Guards had perished in the annihilation.

"Go," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord commanded with a light shout. His palms pushed forward, channeling the Forgetful Rover Soul Stream to propel both the Void Return Black Sphere and Profound Nether Silver Orb away from the sacrificial altar, where they vanished into the thick layers of dark clouds.

"Go!" Within the Paper Giant, Ning Zhuo found himself compelled to produce his Mechanical Puppet.

Faced with the enemy's ferocity, he prudently unleashed his most formidable forces:

Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng.

Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu.

Netherworld Envoy - Qi Bai.

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin!

The Buddha Physician materialized, scythe in hand. As soon as she appeared, her expression shifted, and she unexpectedly raised her head to survey the surroundings.

Ning Zhuo: "Mother?!"
