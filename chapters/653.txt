Chapter 653: Breaking the Formation?

In response to Sun Lingtong's proposal, Zeng Jide slowly shook his head.

"Inadvisable," he said.

"My mission here is merely to pilfer some rare materials from the Forgetful River—a opportunistic strike to gain a small advantage."

"The Painted Skin Rakshasa, however, aims to obstruct the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Dao Path."

"Even if we helped her escape to cover our own tracks, it would still be unwise. The Prefecture Lord would likely see us as accomplices."

"Interfering with his Dao Path would undoubtedly incur his undying enmity—a grudge he might never relinquish in this lifetime!"

Zeng Jide transmitted his thoughts telepathically, his words carrying weight. "As the Void Sect, a major sect that primarily engages in theft, we're not afraid of offending a prefecture or even a nation. But such actions must promise substantial gains."

"Based solely on what we stand to gain, is it worth provoking the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord to the point of mortal enmity? It's too great a risk for such a meager reward."

Sun Lingtong thought to himself, As expected.

Zeng Jide's reaction was exactly as he had anticipated. Had he pressed the matter earlier, they likely would have parted ways by now.

"But..."

"Little Zhuo is the Son of Destiny nurtured by the Living Realm's Heaven—the greatest Human Tribulation the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord will ever face."

"Old Zeng, by helping me, you're also helping Little Zhuo. Whether we succeed or fail, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord will see you as one of us."

Zeng Jide remained blissfully unaware, reluctant to offend the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord—yet he had already crossed him!

This wasn't entirely his fault.

Sun Lingtong was merely at the Foundation Establishment stage. Zeng Jide never imagined two fledgling Foundation Establishment cultivators would be audacious enough to obstruct the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Dao Path.

It was like ants provoking an elephant—what difference did it make?

Sun Lingtong frowned deeply, deliberately feigning difficulty. "But if we don't use the Painted Skin Rakshasa, how will we escape this place?"

Zeng Jide assumed Sun Lingtong was worried about his own life. Through his divine sense, he teased, "Kid, are you scared now? Where's the reckless courage you had when you stormed the Forgetful Crossing without a clue?"

"I won't help the Painted Skin Rakshasa."

"That woman is a cruel Demonic Cultivator who delights in torturing innocents and harvesting their skins for treasures. Especially when she uses human skin to create her Painted Skin, she inflicts every possible torment, saturating the skin with terror and resentment to make her creations lifelike."

"I despise that woman!"

"Come to think of it, Forgetful River Immortal City actually encourages virtue, giving Soul and Ghost Cultivators a chance to start anew and reinvent themselves."

"Compared to the Painted Skin Rakshasa, I have a much greater fondness for Forgetful River Immortal City."

The Void Sect wasn't a Demonic Path sect, but a Heretical Sect.

Members of Heretical Sects often straddle the line between right and wrong, existing somewhere between the Righteous Path and the Demonic Path, unbound by conventional constraints.

"Let nature take its course... let nature take its course..." Sun Lingtong reminded himself inwardly, while outwardly feigning realization. "So that's how it is. This Demonic Cultivator is so cruel—what if we rescue her and she repays our kindness with betrayal, attacking us first?"

Zeng Jide, who continued to meditate with his eyes closed, reassured him, "Don't worry. Since I brought you here undetected, I can get us out the same way!"

"I was merely grazed by that Golden Token earlier, sustaining a serious injury."

"Once I've recovered and regained my strength, leaving here safely will be no problem!"

Sun Lingtong's curiosity piqued. "Golden Token? What's that?"

Zeng Jide patiently explained, "It's one of the National Artifacts—a consumable item, used once and gone. Clearly, we triggered a trap set by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, causing one of these Golden Tokens to fly out."

"The national power contained within this is extraordinary. Fortunately, no one was here to oversee it... If the True Form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had been here and acted personally, I fear I would have been struck dead in an instant!"

Zeng Jide spoke with lingering fear, showing no hesitation in revealing his distress before his junior.

"Alright, let's discuss any issues after we leave this place and reach safety."

Zeng Jide focused entirely on recuperating.

Sun Lingtong secretly fretted but could do nothing but "let nature take its course" and obediently follow orders.

After resting for half an incense stick's time, Zeng Jide slowly opened his eyes.

His injuries had largely healed.

"Sigh, I still had to use a Transformation God-level Medicinal Pill." Zeng Jide was only at the Nascent Soul stage; without access to higher-level healing elixirs, such rapid recovery would have been impossible.

During this time, countless thoughts had raced through Sun Lingtong's mind.

Several times, he nearly couldn't resist the urge to act himself, to destroy the Formation and release the Painted Skin Rakshasa.

But in the end, he held back, choosing to trust the words of Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, who had cared for him: Let nature take its course!

Zeng Jide rose from his seated position, once again lifting Sun Lingtong with one hand.

Theft Path Method: Shadow Escape.

The old man and the youth transformed into a black shadow, flowing out of the Formation Space like water and returning to the City Lord's Mansion.

The City Lord's Mansion remained heavily guarded.

But Zeng Jide had recovered much of his strength and was no longer as vulnerable as before.

True to his word, moments later, he successfully led Sun Lingtong out of the City Lord's Mansion.

The two appeared in an alleyway.

Sun Lingtong had already stopped pinning his hopes on Zeng Jide. "Perhaps I'll need to act alone from now on. Old Zeng isn't crucial to our next steps."

Naturally unaware of Sun Lingtong's true thoughts, Zeng Jide said smugly, "Well? Young man, I didn't deceive you, did I?"

Sun Lingtong immediately gave Zeng Jide a thumbs-up and showered him with flattery.

Zeng Jide laughed heartily, his eyes gleaming shrewdly. "You're not being entirely sincere, boy. Your praise is superficial and a bit perfunctory."

Sun Lingtong chuckled. "I truly admire your methods, Senior. But..."

"But what?" Zeng Jide pressed.

Sun Lingtong scratched his head. "But... I can't help feeling this theft wasn't satisfying."

He spoke only his genuine feelings, but this offhand remark froze Zeng Jide in place.

Sun Lingtong, puzzled, called out, "Senior? Senior?"

Zeng Jide's expression darkened, his brows furrowed as he glared toward the City Lord's Mansion, a mixture of anger and humiliation on his face. "Very well, you Forgetful River Prefecture Lord," he muttered. "Very well."

He clapped Sun Lingtong on the shoulder. "Kid, it's been a good thing traveling with you. Thanks to your warning, I nearly fell into the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's trap!"

Sun Lingtong was even more confused. "Huh?"

Zeng Jide gritted his teeth and snorted in the direction of the City Lord's Mansion. "Kid, how about we go back inside the City Lord's Mansion and plunder it clean?"

Sun Lingtong hadn't expected such a sudden change in Zeng Jide's attitude. He quickly nodded. "That would be fantastic!"

Zeng Jide laughed heartily. "You Foundation Establishment brat, you've got more guts than I do!"

Sun Lingtong quickly clasped his hands in respect. "It's all because you're here, Old Zeng! If I were alone, I'd have fled far away by now."

Being trusted by a junior he admired brought immense satisfaction to Zeng Jide. He laughed again, grabbed Sun Lingtong's arm, and used Shadow Escape to slip back into the City Lord's Mansion.

At the Altar Battlefield, Luo Si was locked in a desperate struggle with the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, while Ning Zhuo hovered before a tributary of the Wangchuan River, too afraid to advance even half a step.

Ning Zhuo strained every ounce of his strength to push the Ice Coffin into the Branch of the Wangchuan River, initially freezing the surface of the water.

But the awakening of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form shattered Ning Zhuo's plan completely.

The Prefecture Lord held a strand of beads, continuously twirling them between his fingers, controlling the movement of the Wangchuan River's branch through this method.

If Sun Lingtong were there, he would have immediately recognized that many of the beads were River of Oblivion Vortex Eyes. Each one was a fully potent Magic Artifact!

These natural Magic Artifacts often had a single, highly targeted function. No man-made magic treasure could possibly affect the Wangchuan River to this extent, but these Vortex Eyes could achieve it effortlessly.

Fundamentally, they were born from the Wangchuan River itself, one with it.

The Prefecture Lord's aura surged violently as he maintained the spell, manipulating the branch to swallow the Ice Coffin deep within its center.

There, a whirlpool formed, trapping the Ice Coffin.

The Ice Coffin's cold energy seeped outward, freezing the branch. But the whirlpool relentlessly flung ice chunks outward while drawing water inward.

The expelled ice was quickly transformed back into water by the Prefecture Lord's spell.

Through this method, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord completely enveloped the Ice Coffin, isolating it from Ning Zhuo.

Facing two Transformation God-level opponents simultaneously, Ning Zhuo felt as if he had plunged into an ice cavern.

How could he possibly fight this?

The gap between them was simply too vast!

But his initial panic quickly dissipated, and a glint of realization flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes. "The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form... seems surprisingly weak."

If it weren't, the Prefecture Lord would have flown out of the Branch of the Wangchuan River long ago to slay Ning Zhuo. Instead, he remained stationed within the tributary, even employing a gradual wear-down strategy to deal with the Ice Coffin. For the moment, Ning Zhuo, trapped outside the tributary, was unable to make another move.

"If the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is so weak, could I seize the opportunity to force my way across the tributary?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head, dismissing the bold idea.

The interior of the tributary was constantly freezing over, while its exterior churned violently, its waves towering. If he tried to force a crossing, he would be instantly swept into the torrent. At that moment, the Prefecture Lord would likely strike, drowning him in the river!

"But the Ice Coffin is lost. How can I solve the river-crossing problem now?"

Ning Zhuo frowned deeply, feeling utterly stumped.

He had nearly solved this problem. But the critical key—the Ice Coffin—had been lost, and the Prefecture Lord's timely awakening had rendered his efforts futile!

Gritting his teeth, Ning Zhuo rapidly pondered but couldn't devise a countermeasure.

He subconsciously touched his Mechanism Ring, but it remained silent.

Ning Zhuo's heart sank further, his earlier suspicion resurfacing.

He immediately changed his thoughts, silently willing himself to forcefully cross the Branch of the Wangchuan River, then turn back to assist Luo Si in the close-quarters battle against the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God...

The Mechanism Ring remained utterly silent.

"So, the Innate Talent bound to the ring has been suppressed."

"Did this suppression begin the moment I set foot on the Black Cloud Battlefield?"

With the Ice Coffin falling into enemy hands, the Mechanism Ring could no longer provide Ning Zhuo with any guidance.

The ring had been such a valuable ally to Ning Zhuo that the burly youth couldn't help but feel panic rising. He thought, "Is this situation hopeless? Should I retreat?"

He wavered.

But in that fleeting moment, he ruthlessly quelled his wavering resolve!

"My mother and the boss are still on another route. They're counting on me. How could I falter here?"

"The Living Realm's Destiny delivered me to this stage. It couldn't possibly be to send me to my death."

"If the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord can temporarily detain the Ice Coffin and suppress the Living Realm's Heavenly Mandate's retribution against him, then I can surely make a difference and create more opportunities."

"This is a formidable challenge!"

Despite these thoughts, a faint smile curved Ning Zhuo's lips as his fighting spirit, having hit rock bottom, rebounded and surged upward.

This kind of adversity was nothing new to him.

Wasn't it just like this back at Fire Persimmon Immortal City and Lava Immortal Palace?

Ning Zhuo's unshakable resolve steadied him once more, and he began to ponder how to break through the impasse.

"The Ghost Tide surges, threatening the White Paper Peril; a Lone Goose carries a candle to pierce the Heavenly Veil. A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot; when myriad lamps illuminate, the calamity will crumble on its own." He silently recited the prophetic poem again.

"A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot..."

He chewed over this line.

Following the sequence of the verses, the previous line—"A Lone Goose carries a candle to pierce the Heavenly Veil"—had already been fulfilled. Therefore, the next line—"A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot"—must hold the key to breaking the deadlock.

Ning Zhuo had long since grasped the implications of this verse.

Back in White Paper Immortal City, he had specifically asked Wen Ruanyu, a Confucian cultivator, to interpret the Sacrificial Text of the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual.

Not only had Ning Zhuo obtained the interpretation, but he had also received substantial support from Wen Ruanyu!

"This poem points the way to breaking the formation."

"In other words, the true path lies in dismantling this Grand Formation?"

"What kind of formation is this? Where are the formation's foundation, eye, and core?"

Ning Zhuo was utterly clueless.

He gazed at the sacrificial altar, speculating inwardly: "The altar is clearly the core. It must be the formation's core."

But even if his conjecture was correct, it was useless.

To destroy the altar, he would first have to cross the Branch of the Wangchuan River, creating an insoluble deadlock.

He looked around again.

The pitch-black battlefield was enveloped in a thick layer of Earthly Fiend Qi, forming a formidable barrier in all directions.

A spiritual light flashed in Ning Zhuo's divine sea. "Could it be that we should retreat and confront the Grand Formation on the Black Cloud Battlefield once more?"

He felt this answer was likely correct, but as he gazed in Luo Si's direction, he couldn't help but hesitate.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was surrounded by the roaring sound of water.

"The Yin Jiuzhu is my greatest enemy!" the Prefecture Lord lamented inwardly.

The Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle sealed the Nether Dragon Scissors. Even when the Prefecture Lord unleashed his True Form, he could only gradually erode the seal, remaining far from breaking it.

This was because the Candle wasn't a simple ice elemental artifact. It combined the inverted fire element with water, then infused it with yin attributes to achieve its icy nature.

This was one of the Yin Jiuzhu's signature techniques. If it were easily broken, he wouldn't have earned the title of Prefecture Lord.

"Regain the Nether Dragon Scissors, and everything will fall into place!" The Prefecture Lord continuously twirled his bead strand.

Crack... Crack...

Amidst the faint sounds, cracks began to appear on the surface of the River of Oblivion Vortex Eyes.

The Prefecture Lord displayed great strength, but in truth, his condition was dire. Even when manipulating the Branch of the Wangchuan River, he relied almost entirely on the bead strand, barely able to provide any spiritual energy support. As a result, the strand was rapidly depleting his own reserves.

Ning Zhuo's assessment was accurate. In this state, the Prefecture Lord's combat capabilities were deeply concerning, and remaining stationed within the Branch of the Wangchuan River was the wisest course of action.
