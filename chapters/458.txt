Chapter 458: Regretting Not Having Formed a Sworn Brotherhood Back Then

The Three Generals’ Camp.

Liu Er was revising military affairs, his brows furrowed in worry.

He finished handling the last piece of military business, placed it on the corner of the table, and could not help letting out a long sigh.

After calling in a subordinate to convey these orders, Liu Er lifted the door curtain, looked toward the camp’s main gate, then lowered the curtain again. With his hands behind his back, he paced inside the tent.

He continued this until a subordinate came to report that Ning Zhuo had returned, whereupon Liu Er finally revealed a smile.

“Why has he not returned yet?” Liu Er murmured to himself.

Before departing to attend Shuang Jing’s banquet this time, Ning Zhuo had already informed Liu Er.

Because of this, from early morning onward, Liu Er had been on edge, unable to focus.

He immediately lifted the door curtain and ran toward the camp gate.

When he encountered Ning Zhuo, he burst into hearty laughter, his smile as passionate as fire: “Strategist, you are back! It’s good that you’re back!”

While welcoming him, Liu Er secretly observed Ning Zhuo’s expression.

Seeing Ning Zhuo’s furrowed brow and evident worry, Liu Er’s heart sank. He hurriedly asked, “Strategist, did Shuang Jing make things difficult for you? Rest assured, we three brothers will support you.”

Liu Er’s smile froze. His heart instantly turned cold. The thing he feared most had indeed happened.

Ning Zhuo shook his head: “That’s not it.”

“It’s that Shuang Jing invited me, wishing to recruit me as his retainer.”

He still forced a smile: “This matter needs careful consideration.”

“Though Shuang Jing’s birth is noble, Strategist, your own background is actually not too different.”

“And if you become a retainer, you lose your freedom…”

“Oh, that won’t happen. He spoke plainly: I may leave at any time, and he will not restrict my freedom.” Ning Zhuo waved his hand.

Liu Er’s smile froze once again, his heart sinking to the bottom. He still cupped his hands to congratulate him: “This… in that case, it’s indeed very good. After all, Shuang Jing’s lineage is truly extraordinary. I must congratulate the Strategist. Depending on Shuang Jing, you will be even more capable of avenging your family.”

Ning Zhuo shook his head: “I did not promise him on the spot.”

Liu Er’s eyes suddenly lit up: “Could it be, Strategist, you…”

Ning Zhuo nodded: “I am still considering it.”

Liu Er’s expression dimmed again.

Ning Zhuo glanced at the training ground inside the camp: “Why do I not see Generals Guan Hong and Zhang Hei drilling the troops?”

“Our army was only recently founded. After this victory, we captured a Nascent Soul cultivator alive, and morale is strong. We should seize every moment to keep drilling and prepare thoroughly for the great battle on the future battlefield.”

Liu Er heaved a deep sigh: “I was just about to consult you, Strategist. The soldiers are making a commotion, quite dissatisfied. They demand compensation and want to change the previous agreement. Third Brother volunteered to handle it.”

“As for Second Brother, he is in the tent absorbing national power to enhance his cultivation.”

Apart from promotions, the rewards for Liu, Guan, and Zhang included ten units of national power.

Ning Zhuo became interested: “How is General Guan’s injury?”

Before, Wu Hen’s sneak attack had injured Guan Hong’s right arm.

Just as he spoke, a surge of divine sense was transmitted: “Thank you, Strategist, for your concern. My injury on the right arm is far more troublesome than imagined. I have tried all possible methods in turn, yet without much effect.”

It was Guan Hong.

Clearly, he had finished his cultivation session.

Liu Er frowned and entered the tent with Ning Zhuo to visit Guan Hong.

Inside the tent, it was dimly lit, with a few candles burning. The candlelight was bright red, emanating a blood-like glow.

Guan Hong wore a dark green robe, but his right arm was exposed. The wound there was visibly swollen, and the flesh bore a blackish-purple hue.

“How strange!” Liu Er’s expression turned grim.

“How strange!” Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up.

Liu Er suddenly cupped his hands toward Ning Zhuo in salute: “Strategist, do you also have knowledge of the strange arts? I have seen that you possess a sickle weapon, surely an outstanding piece among the Night Rain Devil Weapons. In the previous ambush, the sickle easily repelled Wu Hen, displaying formidable power! Please, Strategist, help us.”

Ning Zhuo nodded: “I have not studied the strange arts much; I merely had good fortune in obtaining a Night Rain Devil Weapon.”

Ning Zhuo examined the wound, letting his divine sense seep inside. He found that the blackish-purple discoloration was spreading.

“General Guan, may I take a closer look at the wound?”

Guan Hong nodded: “Please, Strategist.”

Not only was it spreading through the flesh, it was also eroding the surface of the bone.

“Though the wound is not large, if left untreated for a long time, the erosion will cause far more serious injuries.” Liu Er also projected his divine sense, worried and heavy-hearted.

He and Guan Hong looked to Ning Zhuo, their gazes carrying unspoken hope.

Ning Zhuo shook his head: “I have a Night Rain Devil Weapon and am skilled only in killing, not in healing such injuries.”

“However, though the strange arts are hard to cure, the damage is still limited to the right arm at present. Perhaps General Guan can rely on national power to rapidly increase cultivation and suppress, then crush it in one go?”

Guan Hong sighed: “That would be a last resort.”

Liu Er spoke immediately: “Second Brother, use all ten units of national power. As for Third Brother’s share, I will make the decision! I will compensate him.”

Guan Hong was moved.

Ning Zhuo felt curious and could not help asking: “The ten units of national power rewarded by the capital —can it be that they can be given to just one among you?”

Liu Er nodded: “The imperial decree only stated that these ten units of national power were granted to the three of us. It did not specify who gets how many, nor did it distribute them precisely, so it should be permissible.”

“But the four units of national power rewarded to you, Strategist, may only be used by you.”

At this point, Liu Er hesitated slightly, then still advised: “Strategist, perhaps you should save them for future use. If you become Shuang Jing’s retainer and then absorb national power, you will surely gain even more from it.”

Guan Hong froze, then fixed Ning Zhuo with a sharp gaze.

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly: “I appreciate your concern, General Liu. Indeed, Lord Shuang Jing told me that if I became his retainer, I would gain triple the effect.”

Guan Hong could not help but speak: “A true man acts between Heaven and Earth. How could he become someone’s retainer for petty gain?”

“Strategist, if you want effectiveness, why not earn merit on the battlefield?”

“We three brothers rose from guerrilla generals to captor generals, and absorbing national power now yields twice the effect compared to before!”

“With your abilities, Strategist, it’s not hard to establish merits on the battlefield. By accumulating achievements and rising in the ranks, you would maintain your freedom!”

“Otherwise, becoming a retainer and taking orders from another—would that not be stifling?”

Liu Er cheered silently in his heart, but outwardly he raised his hand to stop: “Second Brother, say no more.”

Ning Zhuo smiled: “Thank you, General Guan, for your advice.”

“It’s just that Lord Shuang Jing’s offered terms are indeed generous, allowing me to leave at any time. In my view, this retainer identity he offers me is more of a nominal title, with no intent to humiliate.”

The same unit of national power granted differing yields depending on the person’s status in that country.

Here, “status” referred to a cultivator’s identity within the corresponding nation.

There were both real and nominal titles.

Real titles included the miscellaneous generals for the three, as well as the position of strategist for Ning Zhuo. Nominal titles included many more types; certain titles without fiefdoms belonged to this category.

Shuang Jing’s retainer identity was just such a nominal title. But because Shuang Jing’s own status was so exalted, if Ning Zhuo held that identity, he would gain triple the results.

Hearing that Shuang Jing did not restrict Ning Zhuo’s freedom, Guan Hong stroked his beard, his face slightly cold: “If I were the Strategist, I would never agree to become Shuang Jing’s retainer!”

“Second Brother, hold your tongue. Everyone has their own ambitions —how can we force them?” Liu Er’s face was solemn.

Guan Hong said no more.

Ning Zhuo showed a hint of embarrassment.

Liu Er spoke warmly: “Strategist, my second brother speaks bluntly. Please do not take it to heart. A fine bird chooses a fine tree to nest in, a worthy minister chooses a worthy lord to serve —this is the proper way.”

“Ah!”

“I only regret that my luck is poor and my abilities meager, that I could not achieve more merit to help you gain greater feats, Strategist.”

Ning Zhuo shook his head: “You speak as if I am about to leave the camp. General Liu, do not worry. Without even mentioning that I will surely travel far and leave the Twin Rivers Kingdom after this war, let’s just say I agreed to Lord Shuang Jing’s offer to become his retainer and broaden my horizons —I would never forget to support the Three Generals’ Camp.”

“As soon as my family’s reply arrives, permitting me to allocate the treasures in my hands, I will certainly lend the three generals a helping hand!”

Ning Zhuo again made a promise. Seeing the atmosphere turn tense, he took his leave and exited the tent.

Liu Er watched the door curtain and let out a deep sigh.

He spoke with heartfelt emotion: “Second Brother, it’s my fault!”

“Back then at the Pear Garden, Third Brother once invited the Strategist and us to become sworn brothers. If I had insisted then, the Strategist would be our Fourth Brother now. How could he leave us at this moment?”

Guan Hong was silent for several breaths before speaking: “Elder Brother, if anyone is to blame, it’s me. I was the one who refused at the time.”

“I saw that he was so young, and only at the Foundation Establishment stage, and thus I grew arrogant.”

“Who would have thought that the Strategist’s talents were astonishing enough to make us all look at him with new eyes. Ah, I, Guan, was blind!”

Liu Er hurriedly tried to console Guan Hong again.

Seeing that Liu Er still appeared worried, Guan Hong frowned: “Elder Brother, if you are concerned about the Strategist, how could I, your younger brother, not share your worries?”

Liu Er was shocked and clutched Guan Hong’s arm: “Second Brother, you must not act rashly.”

“How about I bear the rod and plead forgiveness, kneeling before the Strategist’s tent, begging him to stay!”

“Though the Strategist is talented, you and I are brothers, close as limbs. Wouldn’t humiliating you be the same as humiliating me?”

“We met and knew each other, fought side by side —how can I let you, a dignified Golden Core, kneel before a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, suffering such indignity?”

“Ah, I can only blame my lowly status and the Strategist’s noble family background for failing to win his loyalty.”

Guan Hong’s eyes reddened: “Elder Brother.”

Liu Er gazed deeply at Guan Hong: “Second Brother!”

“Elder Brother!”

“Second Brother!!”

At this moment, Zhang Hei lifted the door curtain and walked in.

Seeing this scene, he widened his eyes: “What good things are you two brothers discussing, not including me?”

Guan Hong said nothing.

Liu Er sighed deeply and explained to Zhang Hei.

Zhang Hei’s eyes widened again: “What? The Strategist wants to leave?!”

“Not allowed!”

“I will go talk to him!! We built this army together, and now he wants to quit halfway?!”

Liu Er quickly grabbed Zhang Hei’s arm: “Third Brother, do not be so rash. Everyone has their own ambitions, how can we force them?”

“Ah, I can only blame my lowly status for not winning his heart.”

“Elder Brother!!” Zhang Hei’s face was stubborn.

“Third Brother, listen to Elder Brother,” said Guan Hong.

Zhang Hei glanced at Liu Er, then at Guan Hong, then swung a fist into the air and turned to stare at the ground: “Ah!!!”
