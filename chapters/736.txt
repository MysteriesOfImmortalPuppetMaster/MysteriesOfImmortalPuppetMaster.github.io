Chapter 736: Making a Name for Himself

In another cave dwelling, Che Zhuzi held the intelligence report in his hand. The light in the room illuminated half his face, leaving the other half in shadow.

Che Zhuzi's expression was complex and conflicted. "I never imagined Ning Zhuo's talent would be so extraordinary - a first-rate genius!"

"If only I had known he had already secured first place twice among the Confucian cultivators..."

His thoughts shifted. "No, I must maintain neutrality. That's what benefits me most."

"Although Ning Zhuo has taken the initiative to propose a larger deal, the Ban Clan remains a force to be reckoned with."

"Ban Ji's talent should have earned him a Stone Token in the first round. But Ning Zhuo thwarted his plans at every turn."

"It doesn't matter that he didn't stand out in the first round. He'll undoubtedly secure a spot in the second."

As a merchant, Che Zhuzi naturally preferred to play both sides.

As a Demon Cultivator who wasn't yet desperate, he was already living comfortably by trading Void Spider Silk. Why should he commit to one side and place a premature, high-stakes bet?

In his current position, Che Zhuzi instinctively avoided risk.

"Still, I should send a congratulatory letter to Ning Zhuo for obtaining the Stone Token."

"And include some customary gifts."

Ning Zhuo's acquisition of the Stone Token dramatically increased his value and status in Che Zhuzi's eyes.

The Confucian cultivators were gathered for a meeting.

"Hahaha! As expected, a tiger father begets no dog son. Meng Yaoyin's son is truly remarkable!" The Confucian cultivators were discussing Ning Zhuo.

Upon learning of Ning Zhuo's achievement, they were universally delighted.

"We should write to Wen Ruanyu and share this good news."

"Indeed. Imprisonment must be unbearable. Since he cares so deeply for Ning Zhuo's lineage, this news will surely dispel the gloom in his heart and bring him immense joy."

"No wonder Wen Ruanyu has been so attentive to Ning Zhuo. The boy is a first-rate cultivation prodigy!"

Song Taosheng stroked his beard. "While his cultivation aptitude is impressive, I'm even more impressed by his performance during the Three Questions of the Heart."

The Demon Subduing Hall's Rising Cloud Trial was far more rigorous than most trials, carrying significant weight.

Ning Zhuo's performance during the Three Questions of the Heart had been exceptional. Moreover, the audience included not only high-ranking cultivators from the Demon Subduing Hall but also many other cultivators participating in the Rising Cloud Trial. As a result, news of his achievement spread rapidly.

Now, with Ning Zhuo's acquisition of the Stone Token and his rising fame, these remarkable feats were widely circulated and became common knowledge.

Song Taosheng's words resonated with most of the Confucian cultivators present.

Chu Xuangui, among them, recalled Ning Zhuo's performance during the Rising Cloud Trial.

At the time, Ning Zhuo had seemed deeply versed in the rules, displaying remarkable synergy despite their first meeting. Though they hadn't exchanged a single word in secret, their collaboration had been seamless.

I never imagined this young man, with his nimble skills, possessed such unwavering integrity. Such individuals are truly rare.

Ning Zhuo's innate sense of justice naturally endeared him to the Confucian cultivators.

One cultivator suddenly asked, "Now that Ning Zhuo has obtained the Stone Token and gained renown, do we still need to continue supporting him?"

The Confucian cultivators exchanged varied glances at this question.

Some began to ponder.

Others expressed concern. "Indeed. Others are unaware of the troubles surrounding Ning Zhuo, which we learned in advance through Wen Ruanyu."

"Given Ning Zhuo's current reputation, the sect's higher-ups will have to think twice before moving against him."

"Judging by the outcome, our initial objectives have already been achieved."

"If we continue to support him further, it might arouse suspicion."

At this point, Song Taosheng couldn't contain himself. He snorted coldly, cutting them off. "Suspicion? Are you all so afraid?"

A Confucian cultivator spoke with a grave expression: "Old Master Song, there's no need to speak so harshly. We're not worried about our personal safety, but rather about the consequences if our secret support for Ning Zhuo is exposed. It would severely damage the reputation of all Confucian cultivators."

"Nearly every Confucian cultivator in the Sect is gathered here."

"We need new members and must grow stronger. But how can we attract talented Confucian cultivators if we're burdened with a tarnished reputation?"

His words carried weight.

By deliberately downplaying his personal concerns and focusing on the collective interests of the Confucian cultivators, he compelled many to reconsider their stance.

Sensing the shift in the atmosphere, Chu Xuangui decisively countered: "That's a flawed argument!"

"How often does a prodigy like Ning Zhuo emerge?"

"He's not just a genius who excelled in the first round; he also passed the Three Questions of the Heart. A young man with such character is invaluable!"

"Since he's proven himself so capable and is practically one of our own, why shouldn't we increase our support and provide him with even greater resources?"

Chu Xuangui voiced his own conviction, not only rejecting the proposal to withdraw support but also advocating for increased assistance to Ning Zhuo.

The cultivators exchanged glances before one spoke up.

Soon, everyone was sharing their opinions, each clinging to their own perspective.

As Song Taosheng listened, he sensed the situation was deteriorating, his brow gradually furrowing.

Confucian cultivators were adept at self-preservation. Having achieved their objectives ahead of schedule, withdrawing promptly had become the consensus among an increasing number of them.

Song Taosheng's Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he pondered. He first turned his gaze toward Chu Xuangui.

To his surprise, Chu Xuangui had already fixed his gaze on him.

Their eyes met for only an instant, yet they instantly understood each other's intentions.

Unlike the other Confucian cultivators, both Song Taosheng and Chu Xuangui had taken the initiative to support Ning Zhuo from the start. Having met and interacted with him, they held a favorable impression of him.

The others' impressions of Ning Zhuo were vague, based solely on intelligence reports - objective but lacking personal connection.

Having already invested in Ning Zhuo, Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng naturally wanted him to go further and reach greater heights.

Song Taosheng closed his eyes slightly and leaned back in his chair.

Chu Xuangui immediately understood: Song Taosheng intended to play the long game, leaving him to lead the charge.

A faint smile played on Chu Xuangui's lips as he slowly rose to his feet.

With all the other Confucian cultivators seated, Chu Xuangui's movement immediately drew their attention. They realized he had something to say.

Chu Xuangui surveyed the room with a smile. "Actually, there's no need to debate whether we should continue supporting that Ning Zhuo kid."

"If you believe in the young man, go ahead and lend him a hand."

"Those who have concerns are perfectly justified in observing from the sidelines."

"Heh heh heh." Chu Xuangui chuckled. "My greatest feeling right now might differ from yours, fellow Daoists. I feel relieved."

Someone, puzzled, immediately asked, "Why relieved?"

Chu Xuangui clasped his hands in a respectful bow to the assembly. "Fellow Daoists, I won't hide it from you. My greatest worry all along has been Senior Ning Zhuozhang."

"If Senior Ning Zhuozhang were to discover your secret support for Ning Zhuo..."

"Given his temperament, he would likely give you all a severe scolding!"

This statement immediately resonated with many Confucian cultivators.

"Indeed, indeed."

"That's exactly right."

"Fellow Daoist Chu and I share the same concerns."

Chu Xuangui shifted his tone. "But now, everything has changed. Based on Ning Zhuo's current performance, both his strength and character are impeccable."

"Even if Senior Ning Zhuozhang were to learn of this, he wouldn't criticize us. He would simply see it as us nurturing the younger generation."

As these words were spoken, smiles, subtle or overt, spread across the faces of the Confucian cultivators.

Some, however, fell into thoughtful contemplation.

Song Taosheng couldn't resist narrowing his eyes slightly, glancing at Chu Xuangui.

He had initially expected to collaborate with Chu Xuangui on this matter, but the latter's performance had far exceeded his expectations!

On the surface, Chu Xuangui appeared concerned about how Senior Ning Zhuozhang might react. In reality, he was subtly reminding everyone of Senior Ning Zhuozhang's likely opinion of Ning Zhuo!

Within the Confucian cultivator community of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Chu Xuangui, Song Taosheng, and Wen Ruanyu were considered the pillars of the group.

But Senior Ning Zhuozhang was the soul of the sect, the core of the core, their ultimate trump card!

His attitude influenced nearly every Confucian cultivator.

What would Senior Ning Zhuozhang think of Ning Zhuo?

Even those who had never personally met Ning Zhuo could answer with absolute certainty: "Of course, he would admire him!"

Thus, as the Confucian cultivators realized Senior Ning Zhuozhang would likely admire Ning Zhuo, their own perceptions began to shift accordingly.

This shift in attitude was remarkably natural.

Except for a few exceptions, most Confucian cultivators remained oblivious to the change.

The conversation soon circled back to the original topic.

"Speaking of which, Ning Zhuo isn't even a Confucian cultivator. Helping him would be like assisting an outsider. Even if this matter comes to light in the future, it will only showcase the noble character and integrity of our Confucian cultivator community."

"We must continue supporting Ning Zhuo. How else could we face Wen Ruanyu? We promised him at least a second Rising Cloud Trial for Ning Zhuo and pledged our full support!"

"How can we abandon our word?"

The Confucian cultivators tacitly avoided mentioning Senior Ning Zhuozhang, instead devising other reasons to justify their continued support for Ning Zhuo.

Everyone agreed: they would continue supporting Ning Zhuo!

"Then you should organize a third Rising Cloud Trial next."

"How should we proceed?"

"The crucial question is: how can we make it most beneficial for Ning Zhuo?"

"Simple. First, spread the word. Then, I suspect Ning Zhuo will likely send us some signals." Chu Xuangui finally spoke up at this point.

Song Taosheng smiled faintly. "This old one concurs."

Qing Huangzi had just finished writing a letter. By the candlelight, he silently reread it.

"Qing Huangzi bows respectfully, presenting this letter to Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo:..."

"...Knowing my frail body is like decaying wood, with little life remaining, I fear betraying the Late Master's trust and failing myself. Thus, I dare to send this letter, pouring out my heart."

"When the Late Master passed, his withered hand still clutched the reed, his spiritual energy as faint as a wisp of smoke. His final words were but one request..."

"At that time, I wept bitterly, raising my hand to the heavens and swearing to never betray his trust! Yet, alas, my innate talent is dull. Despite dedicating my entire life to the Mechanical Arts..."

"Now, as my life dwindles, I fear the Late Master's lifeblood will be buried with this decaying body!"

"Recently, I learned Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo obtained the Stone Token and faced the Three Questions of the Heart in the Demon Subduing Hall. Your conduct was dignified and righteous, your resolve unmatched..."

"The Rising Cloud Trial is merely a hurdle for mediocrity, unfit for a True Dragon's soaring flight. To cling to such trivial rules would be to tarnish a radiant pearl, a sin I dare not commit! Therefore, I boldly use my frail body and meager reputation to break convention! I waive all petty trials and entrust the legacy of this lineage directly to you! This is no impulsive act, but the culmination of observing your talent and virtue, recalling the Late Master's dying wish, and sensing the urgency of the times. These three forces converge, overwhelming my restraint!"...

After reading the entire letter, Qing Huangzi sighed deeply. With a subtle movement of his divine sense, he opened the seclusion window.

He infused the flying letter with spiritual energy, mimicking its flight through the Void.

Green Stone Cave Dwelling.

Within the Martial Arts Formation.

Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, a Magic Artifact-grade zither floating three inches above the ground before him.

The Big-Headed Youth's eyes were half-closed, his ten fingers blurring into afterimages as they danced across the strings.

Sound waves swept across the ground, activating over a dozen bamboo figurines no larger than an adult's palm.

These weren't directly controlled by Divine Sense, but rather animated by specific musical notes.

As more bamboo figures awakened, their movements grew increasingly fluid and lifelike.

One figure crouched low and lunged forward, its arms crossed like mantis blades, slicing through the air with a sharp hiss. Another spun into a flying kick, its leg blurring like a whip. A third adopted a horse stance, hands clasped in a simple yet powerful Black Tiger Heart Strike. Still others moved with eerie fluidity, their ghostly forms stirring up chilling yin winds...

Ning Zhuo's hands glided across the zither, sometimes plucking with precision, other times strumming with fierce abandon.

The bamboo figurines began to pair off and engage in combat. Their movements were swift and precise, each strike accompanied by a crisp "snap" from their joints.

Ning Zhuo's fingerwork shifted again!

A series of clear, resonant notes flowed forth, like pearls cascading onto a jade plate, yet imbued with a strange, vibrating energy.

The remaining bamboo figurines responded to the sound, abandoning their individual duels to coordinate and form various battle formations.

Three figures stood back-to-back in a triangular formation, each acting as a corner of the triangle, their positions balanced for both offense and defense - the fundamental Small Three Talents Battle Formation.

Four figures formed a square, each guarding a cardinal direction, while a fifth figure stood at the center, directing and supporting the others. Their spiritual energy flowed in harmony, creating the Four Symbols Plum Blossom Battle Formation.

Seven figures aligned like the Big Dipper, their movements synchronized, their spiritual energy subtly connected in a single line, forming the Big Dipper Seven Stars Battle Formation.

Even Ning Zhuo, who had participated in the great wars of the Two Note Kingdom, had never witnessed such mastery of battle formations. This knowledge had been acquired from the Soul-Burning Ferry.

As the final note faded, the dueling bamboo figurines froze mid-strike, while those in battle formations maintained their rigid formations. All stood motionless, awaiting their commander's next command.

Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp and clear, his heart filled with serene joy.

His zither skills had reached a state of perfect mastery, the result of nearly a century of relentless practice.

The profound mysteries of the Vowel Reed Book had been fully revealed during his recent practice, leaving no secrets unrevealed.

Moreover, Ning Zhuo had deciphered the subsequent consonant principles and even created corresponding bamboo figurines. These figurines had also performed flawlessly during his practice.

"I should be able to win Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Trial now."

"Hmm?"

Shortly after, Ning Zhuo read Qing Huangzi's letter, his expression complex.

"I've invested so much effort into this, and now Qing Huangzi wants to give me the inheritance willingly?"

Ning Zhuo deeply appreciated the positive impact of his recent high-profile actions, which had rapidly enhanced his reputation.

"Very well."

"This will save me considerable time."

"With that time, I can study even more things."

Ning Zhuo lowered his gaze slightly, his expression turning profound.
