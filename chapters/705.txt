Chapter 705: Borrowing the Brush

"What's going on here?" Bai Liu, Kong, and the others were stunned, their gazes fixed on the Golden Core in Ning Zhuo's hand as if glued to it.

With difficulty, they shifted their attention from the Golden Core to Ning Zhuo himself. Their expressions were now different from before.

Ning Zhuo had revealed his true strength!

After all, this was their first meeting. Respect was earned through appearance first, then through character.

Ning Zhuo observed their changing expressions, knowing his strategy had succeeded.

"I won first place in the Flying Cloud Minor Trial and obtained the Intent Comprehension Brush, yet I am not a Confucian cultivator but an outsider."

"This situation could easily incite jealousy, envy, and resentment among the Confucian cultivators toward me."

"Therefore, I needed to demonstrate extraordinary strength, making them realize that even as an outsider, I am a formidable power. My victory was natural and unsurprising."

This was Ning Zhuo's calculated plan.

Of course, he genuinely intended to propose a trade as well.

Innate Talent Art!

This method used one's innate talent as a foundation, supplemented by specific techniques, to unlock even greater or more profound powers.

Casting spells didn't rely solely on spiritual energy; many precious materials could also be used.

Ning Zhuo's Weather Orb: Ice Crystal Snow, for example, could consume his Soul to summon a freezing blizzard.

During the Flying Cloud Minor Trial organized by Chu Xuangui, Ning Zhuo personally witnessed Kong Ran using his Early Wisdom Talent to cast spells.

Until then, Ning Zhuo had only used his Early Wisdom Talent in its most basic form.

He had always wanted to develop his Early Wisdom Talent further, believing that with proper refinement, it could eventually evolve into a Divine Art.

"Every Innate Talent requires development, and there are techniques for doing so. Once developed, it becomes a Divine Art, greatly benefiting cultivators!"

Ning Zhuo had long understood this principle.

However, in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he lacked the resources and qualifications to develop his Early Wisdom Talent. Moreover, doing so carried significant risks, as he needed to maintain his disguise, constantly suppress his true nature, and bide his time for the opportunity to seize the Lava Immortal Palace.

After the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace temporarily subsided, Ning Zhuo left Fire Persimmon Immortal City to travel the world. His primary goal was to revive his mother, leaving him with no time to focus on developing his Innate Talent. He even neglected his cultivation somewhat.

The Confucian cultivator's Minor Trial yielded four significant gains for Ning Zhuo: the Intent Comprehension Brush, the elevation of his reputation, making a dazzling debut within Confucian cultivator circles, his observation of Chu Xuangui's righteous methods, which he eagerly studied, and the revelation that Kong Ran possessed not only the Innate Talent for Early Wisdom but also the corresponding Innate Talent Art.

Kong Ran withdrew his gaze and slowly shook his head.

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, the Myriad Manifestations Cradle is no simple matter!"

Ning Zhuo raised an eyebrow, secretly memorizing the name of this spell.

Kong Ran continued, "After using the Myriad Manifestations Cradle, I perceive all things in the world as if I were a newborn infant. It's like experiencing everything for the first time, allowing me to gain deeper insights and guidance."

"As the saying goes: 'Man follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows itself.'"

"All things contain the Dao and Principle, offering guidance to cultivators."

"This is why some cultivators can observe landscapes and comprehend the Dao, even deriving world-shaking spells from a single mountain stone!"

Kong Ran shifted his focus back to his original point. "The true purpose of the Myriad Manifestations Cradle is to treat the universe as my cradle, with all things serving as sources of enlightenment."

"I often use it to study the Confucian Classics, gaining fresh perspectives and profound insights each time."

"It's an invaluable tool for learning!"

Kong Ran shook his head thoughtfully. "In truth, my family possesses more than just this Innate Talent Art. We have other methods developed around the Innate Talent for Early Wisdom."

After this lengthy preamble, Kong Ran finally revealed his true intention. "If you sell me the Intent Comprehension Brush, I'll agree to trade you the Myriad Manifestations Cradle."

"Let's talk!" "Of course, we can discuss the specific details of the transaction."

Ning Zhuo shook his head without hesitation. "The Intent Comprehension Brush is not for sale."

"Mr. Chu Xuangui has high expectations of me. How could I possibly let him down?"

"Absolutely not."

Liu Fushu chimed in, "If you ask me, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, you've already cultivated other methods. Unless you practice them concurrently..."

"Otherwise, you'll never possess a Literary Heart, Literary Palace, or Literary Qi. Without these, you can't truly be considered a Confucian cultivator."

"As for Mr. Chu Xuangui's expectations, I privately believe they're merely part of his own experiment. You shouldn't take them so seriously."

Seeing Liu Fushu speak on his behalf, Kong Ran immediately cast him a grateful glance.

Ning Zhuo sighed deeply.

He often lamented why cultivators couldn't practice more cultivation arts. Someone like him, who had cultivated only three, was already an extreme exception.

Ning Zhuo was a diligent learner and genuinely wanted to experience what it felt like to become a Confucian cultivator.

In truth, he also wanted to learn the Myriad Phenomena Sutra.

Unfortunately, all three of his dantian were already occupied by cultivation arts. Back in White Paper Immortal City, he had to have Sun Lingtong cultivate it concurrently on his behalf.

Snapping out of his thoughts, Ning Zhuo saw Kong Ran looking at him with anticipation. He shook his head again.

Neither Liu Fushu nor Kong Ran knew the full story.

Currently, the Confucian cultivators of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, entrusted by Wen Ruanyu and acting in their own self-interest, were fully committed to supporting Ning Zhuo.

Chu Xuangui had already succeeded, at least in the Flying Cloud Minor Trial.

Under these circumstances, if Ning Zhuo were to falter now, how could he explain himself to the Confucian cultivators? How could he face Wen Ruanyu?

Although Ning Zhuo hadn't secretly communicated with Chu Xuangui through divine sense transmission during the entire process, he had personally witnessed Chu Xuangui's meticulous efforts. In response, Ning Zhuo felt compelled to demonstrate his utmost sincerity.

Ning Zhuo said, "Fellow Daoists, I, Ning Zhuo, intend to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect and dedicate myself to cultivation."

"If I were to rashly sell the Intent Comprehension Brush to someone else, what would Mr. Chu Xuangui think? What would the other Confucian cultivators of the sect think of me? Would they believe that an outsider like me disregards their sacred treasures?"

"I wish to cultivate good karma, not antagonize the Confucian cultivators of the Myriad Manifestations Sect before even formally joining."

Kong Ran couldn't hide his disappointment.

Ning Zhuo's tone shifted again. "Though I cannot sell it to Fellow Daoist Kongran, I can lend it."

"Lending you the brush could also aid your cultivation, wouldn't it?"

Before Kongran could reply, Liu Fushu interjected, "That won't work."

"The Intent Comprehension Brush isn't like ordinary magic treasures. It requires personal refinement to effectively emulate and comprehend its intent."

Ning Zhuo smiled. "That's a minor issue."

"Each time I lend it, I'll voluntarily step back and assist Fellow Daoist Kongran in fully refining the treasure. Problem solved, right?"

Liu Fushu paused, slightly taken aback.

Kongran stared at Ning Zhuo, blurting out, "Aren't you afraid I'll refine it and never return it?"

Ning Zhuo replied, "With ordinary cultivators, I'd be concerned, but Fellow Daoist Kongran is no ordinary person."

"Firstly, you're renowned as a prodigy and about to join the Confucian Sect - a true gentleman."

"Secondly, you're the son of the Prime Minister. If you defaulted, I wouldn't even need to confront your father. Simply spreading the news would suffice."

"Thirdly, we can sign a contract. An extra layer of security never hurts."

Kong Ran paused, slightly taken aback.

Logically, Ning Zhuo's proposal made perfect sense.

But refining the brush after each use would be such a hassle... The thought surfaced in Kong Ran's mind, only to quickly dissipate.

He realized, If I could actually borrow the Intent Comprehension Brush, I'd gladly endure ten times the trouble.

Bai Jiyun spoke up from the side, "There's something I must remind you both."

"Though the Intent Comprehension Brush is a magic treasure, it isn't particularly durable."

"The Scholar's Four Treasures - brush, ink, paper, and inkstone - are all inherently consumable. It's just that brushes and inkstones withstand wear better than paper and ink."

"If you two share this brush, its lifespan will inevitably be shortened, preventing it from lasting long in this world."

Kong Ran immediately shot Bai Jiyun a sidelong glance.

He had known this all along but had deliberately kept it to himself, fearing Ning Zhuo might change his mind.

Kong Ran felt a surge of resentment toward Bai Jiyun, feeling betrayed that his friend was prioritizing the interests of an outsider.

Ning Zhuo, however, reacted with delight rather than dismay. "Consuming a treasured brush to achieve success is a price worth paying."

"From another perspective, it's precisely this limitation that makes the Intent Comprehension Brush even more valuable, and why Fellow Daoist Kongran desires to trade for it even more."

Ning Zhuo turned to Kong Ran. "I'll lend you the brush. In return, you'll teach me the Innate Talent Method. What do you say?"

Kong Ran's heart stirred. He was about to agree when Bai Jiyun interjected, "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, wouldn't lending out the Intent Comprehension Brush be a betrayal of Mr. Chu Xuangui's trust?"

"What if you fail to meet the required standards and Mr. Chu Xuangui can't recommend you to attempt the Primordial Seal Stele?"

For the first time, Bai Jiyun displayed a sharpness he had never shown before.

Ning Zhuo smiled nonchalantly. "Thank you for your concern, Fellow Daoist Bai. It's simple: I'll just meet the standards."

"While I currently have few clues about meeting Mr. Chu Xuangui's standards, I refuse to believe that using the Intent Comprehension Brush a few fewer times will disqualify me."

"Cultivation encompasses ten thousand methods, a thousand schools, a hundred arts, ten Daos, and one self!"

"Even relying solely on my innate talent and comprehension, I can still meet Mr. Chu Xuangui's standards."

"The Intent Comprehension Brush, though important, has never been the key to success."

Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran were all stunned.

Their gazes fixed on Ning Zhuo, they couldn't help but scrutinize him again. When they first met him, their strongest impression had been that he was an "outsider," and they had looked down on him for not knowing his place, for daring to participate in the Confucian Flying Cloud Minor Trial and trying to gain an unfair advantage.

Later, when Ning Zhuo truly demonstrated exceptional talent, all three of them were quite surprised. By the time he ultimately won, their emotions had become complex: shock, resentment, doubt, admiration, recognition... a mix of everything.

Just moments ago, after accepting Ning Zhuo's invitation and engaging in conversation, their goodwill toward him had grown, and they had all assumed he was a scion of a great clan. But when Ning Zhuo produced the Ghost Path Golden Core, their hearts trembled, and they speculated that his current endeavor must be receiving the full backing of his family!

Now, Ning Zhuo exuded extraordinary confidence.

Had they met him for the first time under these circumstances, all three would have scoffed: Who do you think you are? You're not even a Confucian cultivator, yet you're confident you can meet the standard and then try your luck at the Primordial Seal Stele?

But now, they were filled with admiration and speculation: Ning Zhuo's unparalleled confidence must stem from the meticulous cultivation he's received since childhood. He's clearly a genius from a great clan, having faced few setbacks, making him believe anything is possible.

"Even if my father is the Prime Minister, the support I receive at home would never be enough to reach the Golden Core level." At that moment, even Kong Ran felt inferior to Ning Zhuo.

Not to mention Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu.

Born into poverty, Liu Fushu disliked Ning Zhuo's overflowing confidence. His pupils narrowed, and a secret anticipation of witnessing Ning Zhuo's downfall stirred within him, though he still offered a few flattering words.

Bai Jiyun couldn't bring himself to say such things. He simply raised his head and took a few gulps of wine.

"This young man is brimming with confidence. On one hand, he must possess exceptional talent. On the other, his family's unwavering support has undoubtedly given him boundless assurance."

"To casually offer a Golden Core as a deposit, his family's influence must be immense."

"Moreover, his proactive offer to lend Kong Ran the Intent Comprehension Brush carries deeper meaning - he's trying to cultivate connections with Kong Ran and establish ties with the Prime Minister's network."

Bai Jiyun saw through Ning Zhuo's intentions.

If Ning Zhuo's confidence had stung Liu Fushu, his ulterior motives left Bai Jiyun with a deep sense of unease.

Bai Jiyun was also renowned as a genius, brimming with self-assurance. Yet, he preferred the life of a wandering recluse, indulging in the beauty of nature.

After realizing that Ning Zhuo and he were not kindred spirits, Bai Jiyun's enthusiasm for deepening their acquaintance waned.

Throughout the rest of the banquet, Kong Ran engaged Ning Zhuo in extensive discussions about pricing, showing genuine interest in the Intent Comprehension Brush transaction.

Liu Fushu and Bai Jiyun spent most of their time conversing with each other, occasionally interjecting to exchange remarks with Ning Zhuo and Kong Ran.

Ning Zhuo keenly sensed the shift in Liu Fushu and Bai Jiyun's attitudes, but he remained unfazed.

I can't befriend everyone I meet.

There will always be trade-offs.

Right now, engaging with Kong Ran is in my best interest.

His life-and-death experiences on the battlefield had profoundly transformed Ning Zhuo, instilling in him a direct and efficient approach to interpersonal interactions.

Of course, he hadn't forgotten his goal of securing transactions with Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu.

"Thank you, Fellow Daoists, for your insights. I now understand that using the Intent Comprehension Brush effectively requires more demanding requirements for the calligraphy models."

"Do any of you possess rare and precious original works?"

"If so, would you consider lending them to me for copying? I'm willing to negotiate fair compensation."

As Ning Zhuo spoke, he produced a second Ghost Path Golden Core and placed it on the table, startling the trio once more.

Bai Jiyun smiled faintly, indicating that he indeed possessed calligraphy by a renowned Confucian scholar, available for trade.

Liu Fushu secretly envied them, lamenting his own lack of possessions as he could only drink and eat.

Kong Ran puffed out his chest, proudly declaring that while he personally had nothing, his father's study was overflowing with such treasures. "We can discuss terms!"

Ning Zhuo then made simple agreements with Bai Jiyun and Kong Ran.

The banquet concluded with the host and guests in high spirits.

Just as Kong Ran was about to leave, he suddenly stopped and turned to face Ning Zhuo. "Almost forgot - here, use this for now."

He pulled a brush case from his robes.

Opening the case, he removed his favorite writing brush and handed the empty case to Ning Zhuo.

"This is my Cloud Han Resting Brush Case."

"I'm lending it to you for now. Use it to nurture the Intent Comprehension Brush. Take good care of it!"

Though they hadn't yet finalized the brush-lending agreement, Kong Ran already seemed more concerned about the Intent Comprehension Brush than Ning Zhuo himself.
