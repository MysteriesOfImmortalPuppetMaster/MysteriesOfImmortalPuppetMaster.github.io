Chapter 755: Martial Artisan

Cultivator Hao didn't immediately agree. Instead, he observed the situation first.

Ao Pan, hunched over like an old ape, moved forward at a leisurely pace.

Despite his relaxed demeanor, he maintained his first-place lead, having already acquired five Bronze Artifacts.

However, his favored Bronze Whip had become too worn to use, forcing him to rely primarily on a Bronze Staff.

Ao Pan's martial arts foundation was exceptionally solid, allowing him to wield all eighteen types of weapons with proficiency.

In second place was Tie Zheng, a Golden Core-level Martial Cultivator, currently claiming his fifth Bronze Artifact.

Surrounding him were four weapons: a Bronze Saber, Sword, Spear, and Scythe.

These weapons moved in perfect coordination, advancing and retreating with ease, occasionally executing combination attacks or synchronized maneuvers.

Wearing a Bronze Beast Mask, Tie Zheng's mastery of divine sense control rivaled that of Mechanism Cultivators at the same cultivation level!

Lu Zeng held third place.

Wielding a Bronze Spear, he had just begun his battle for a fifth Bronze Saber.

He rotated through his four weapons, including a Bronze Hammer.

The Bronze Saber's swordsmanship had reached the realm of "no technique is the best technique." Its seemingly ordinary strikes suddenly exposed Lu Zeng's weakness.

With a sigh, Lu Zeng released his Bronze Spear, rolled aside to evade the blade, and then clenched his hands into empty fists, slamming them toward the Bronze Saber.

In an instant, the Bronze Hammer, which had been hovering beside him, flew into his hand.

Bang!

He missed his strike, but the force of the blow forced the Bronze Blade back.

Cultivator Hao, observing the scene, found it intriguing. "Tie Zheng, a Golden Core-level Martial Cultivator, wields the Profound Armament Armor like a Mechanical Cultivator. Conversely, Lu Zeng, a Mechanical Cultivator, fights with the ferocity of a Martial Cultivator in close combat."

"Their roles seem mismatched, but in truth, both are consciously training themselves, honing their weaknesses."

"They're both preparing for the third trial."

The top three positions were dominated by Golden Core-level cultivators, underscoring the paramount importance of cultivation realm.

Achieving the Golden Core realm represents a qualitative transformation, granting cultivators comprehensive enhancements in all aspects.

The fourth position was claimed by a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Zhang Wangxing smiled confidently, his eyes gleaming with anticipation. "Come, let's see what the fourth Bronze Artifact is?"

Relying on the Flesh Transformation Sutra, Zhang Wangxing bypassed conventional combat. Instead, he exploited his bizarrely adaptable physical body to directly restrain the Bronze Artifact.

This tactic perfectly countered the Profound Armament Armor's strengths.

After all, the early iterations of the Profound Armament Armor primarily relied on close-quarters combat.

Only from the sixth artifact onward would the armor begin employing spell-like offensive techniques.

Zhang Wangxing capitalized on his strengths, securing three consecutive victories through cunning tactics, which greatly boosted his confidence.

"I can handle the first five Profound Armament Armor pieces. The real challenge lies in the sixth one!" he declared confidently.

Zhang Wangxing was well-informed about the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's trial.

His strategy was to quickly refine the first five pieces, drastically boosting his strength, and then focus all his efforts on battling the sixth.

So far, everything had unfolded exactly as he had planned since entering the Rising Cloud Trial.

Now, he faced the fourth piece:

A massive bronze mace, studded with wolf's teeth, loomed before him.

"That's... awfully large..." Zhang Wangxing's eye twitched, a hint of unease crossing his face.

Sensing his presence, the bronze mace slowly advanced, its weight pressing down on him.

Zhang Wangxing gritted his teeth, straightened his posture, and bared his chest. "Come on! Hit me!"

In the next instant, the bronze mace slammed into him with tremendous force.

Blood splattered everywhere as flesh and muscle deformed like mud, rapidly surging upward in a desperate attempt to engulf the weapon.

With a violent jerk, the mace withdrew, dragging countless fragments of mangled flesh with it.

The searing pain contorted Zhang Wangxing's face into a grimace, sweat pouring down his body.

Forcing himself to endure, he spread his arms wide and threw himself onto the mace.

"Become one with me!" he roared.

The mace resisted fiercely, thrashing and smashing against him, inflicting a relentless barrage of devastating blows.

"I..."

"You..."

"So... even the wolf-tooth mace can suppress me!"

Zhang Wangxing writhed in agony, hissing as he gasped for air, but he forced himself to endure.

Below Zhang Wangxing, in fifth place, was not Ban Ji, but the Rust Disaster Artisan.

He was surrounded by bronze swords, blades, and other weapons, each piece of Profound Armament Armor showing signs of corrosion.

Cultivator Hao frowned unconsciously as he observed the Rust Disaster Artisan.

He loathed the man to his core. In truth, this wasn't just his personal bias; nearly all the cultivators of Profound Armor Cave despised the Rust Disaster Artisan.

"This man possesses low-grade Innate Talent, allowing him to corrode objects."

"The cave's Formation cannot suppress the full expression of Innate Talent, granting him a shortcut - by corroding Bronze Artifacts, he greatly reduced the difficulty of subduing them."

"Hence, his high ranking."

The Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's Rising Cloud Trial was designed to promote the Profound Armament Armor, encourage wider adoption, and forge closer ties between genius cultivators and Profound Armor Cave.

But the Rust Disaster Artisan's corrosion of the Profound Armament Armor directly undermined the cave's purpose. This was why the crowd harbored a deep-seated resentment toward him.

Finally, it was Ban Ji's turn in sixth place.

Cultivator Hao watched Ban Ji, armed with a mace, chain hammer, and occasional throwing knives, battling against a pair of nunchaku.

After a few glances, he chuckled softly.

"Ban Ji's movements with these weapons clearly mimic sword and saber techniques."

"Now I understand."

"Why I was instructed to secretly arrange for him to receive bronze swords and sabers."

Cultivator Hao glanced back, a peculiar expression crossing his face.

He noticed that the top five cultivators all wielded swords or sabers, yet Ban Ji hadn't received a single one.

"These bronze artifacts are randomly assigned by the Formation."

"Swords and sabers are the most common, so there should be plenty."

"Ban Ji has diligently trained in sword and saber techniques, yet he hasn't encountered a single one. Worse still, none of the bronze artifacts he's obtained are even remotely suitable for mimicking those techniques."

"Even a bronze axe or hammer would have allowed him to adapt his sword and saber skills. But he hasn't gotten any of those either. How could his luck be this bad?"

Cultivator Hao continued observing the battle.

As he watched Ban Ji wield throwing knives, the chain hammer, and the mace against the nunchaku, the peculiar expression on his face deepened.

"Let's see what his fifth bronze artifact will be."

Cultivator Hao activated his authority to secretly check the upcoming selection.

"Uh... it's a shield."

And still no sword or blade!

"What kind of heaven-defying, wrath-inducing thing did this kid do?" Cultivator Hao felt a pang of sympathy for Ban Ji.

Ban Ji activated his weapon, yet his movements were clearly sword and blade techniques. This incongruous fighting style made him look utterly out of place, each strike seeming to cry out, "I want a sword! I want a blade!"

Ban Ji had practiced other weapons, but the problem was that he had devoted nearly all his martial arts training time to swords and blades.

In the heat of battle, he didn't have time to think. His body instinctively executed sword and blade techniques.

It couldn't be helped - he was just too well-trained in those methods!

Cultivator Hao mused, "Still, Ban Ji only needs to wait a while to enter the third trial."

"In the third trial, he'll at least obtain a blank Profound Armament Armor."

"Since he primarily cultivates his Upper Dantian, his divine sense is abundant. With his foundation, he has a high chance of acquiring two armors. This means he'll eventually get his sword and blade."

"The Ban Clan wants me to secretly assist him, likely to ensure he performs well in the second trial."

"The more Bronze Artifacts he obtains in the second trial, the better his final performance in the third trial will likely be."

"Only by collecting nine pieces can one qualify for the top spot in the Profound Armor Cave."

"I see. The Ban Clan wants Ban Ji to secure first place, helping him catch up to the first wave of geniuses and join their ranks."

Thinking of geniuses, Cultivator Hao instinctively skipped over seventh and eighth place, his gaze leaping across the arena to land on Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo was currently locked in a fierce battle with the Bronze Gauntlets, wielding a sword and blade.

Cultivator Hao immediately recognized that Ning Zhuo was at a disadvantage. 

"Our Rising Cloud Trial's second stage operates on a quota of five", he thought. Once a certain number of cultivators have collected five sets of Profound Armament Armor, the third stage will automatically activate, eliminating those with fewer than five sets.

At Ning Zhuo's current pace, he likely won't make it in time.

To learn while undergoing the trial - he certainly has a bold spirit.

Cultivator Hao's thoughts shifted. However, if he truly intends to intercept Ban Ji, given his strength, this might be his only option. After all, in the third stage, the Formation still prohibits cultivators from using external methods, restricting them to the Profound Armament Armor and their physical abilities.

In other words, Ning Zhuo is remarkably confident. He believes he can sharpen his skills on the fly, master the armor, and ultimately stop Ban Ji.

"Such confidence... perhaps this is the difference between a genius cultivator and ordinary people like us."

Cultivator Hao suppressed his thoughts and secretly transmitted his agreement with divine sense: "Very well. I can help with this."

"However..." A peculiar expression crossed his face.

He had just reviewed the records and discovered that nearly all cultivators possessed either a sword or a saber, or both. The remaining weapons were few and all possessed unique properties to varying degrees.

The Profound Armament Armor stored within the Profound Armor Cave originated from two sources: some were forged by the cave itself, while others were contributions from countless cultivators.

When cultivators donated particularly valuable Profound Armament Armor, the Profound Armor Cave would compensate them with other treasures.

During each Rising Cloud Trial, the Profound Armor Cave distributed many Profound Armament Armor. Yet every year, cultivators would return to fulfill their promises, returning the Profound Armament Armor they had forged to the cave.

The Grand Formation would randomly select some Profound Armament Armor from the Martial Treasury and deploy them as opponents for the cultivators participating in the trial.

The remaining Profound Armament Armor were generally special and not freely available for deployment.

"These swords and sabers are universally powerful, even posing a challenge to Golden Core cultivators. If we assign one to Ban Ji, can he withstand it?"

"Actually, the bronze shield he's about to face is of exceptional quality. It's the only shield in the second stage of the Rising Cloud Trial. Profound Armament Armor of the shield type can be extremely helpful in the third stage."

Cultivator Hao considered it and decided there was no need to inform Ban Jie, as it would only prolong the trial and introduce unnecessary complications.

He immediately acted covertly, using his authority to manipulate the Grand Formation. He quietly inserted two bronze swords into the original sequence, simultaneously scrambling the order of all the Bronze Artifacts the participants were supposed to face.

Cultivator Hao wasn't worried.

This level of intervention fell within the tacitly approved boundaries set by the higher-ups.

After all, the higher-ups were human too, with descendants and friends they needed to look after. This degree of favoritism was just right; even if exposed, the consequences for Cultivator Hao wouldn't be too severe.

Ning Zhuo slashed diagonally with his blade, the sword tip stabbing straight forward. Left and right, hard and soft, his dual attacks converged on the Bronze Gauntlets.

The Bronze Gauntlets moved with surprising speed. The left gauntlet traced a precise, short arc, narrowly avoiding the blade.

Ning Zhuo immediately adjusted his technique, switching from a diagonal slash to a downward chop. But the Bronze Gauntlet struck with pinpoint accuracy, landing on the blade's power transfer point.

A dull clang echoed as Ning Zhuo's momentum vanished.

When Ning Zhuo's right sword struck, the other Bronze Gauntlet brushed against the blade, using a clever twist to deflect the bronze sword outward, sending its tip sliding through the Void.

The Bronze Gauntlets combined brute force with subtle deflections and redirections, alternating between hard and soft, heavy and light, to keep Ning Zhuo on the defensive.

Ning Zhuo frowned, finding the situation increasingly challenging.

He had already varied his attacks multiple times, but the Bronze Gauntlets initially seemed "flustered and disoriented" before quickly "adapting" and regaining the upper hand.

This gave Ning Zhuo the eerie impression that the gauntlets were sentient, their master invisible to the naked eye.

Yet he knew this was merely an illusion.

"This is a higher realm of martial arts!"

"The previous Bronze Sword and Blade were merely at the apprentice level. The sword only had basic techniques, while the blade was slightly more advanced, with basic moves, combos, and short routines."

"But with the Bronze Gauntlets, the martial arts have transcended the apprentice stage and reached the artisan level."

"The gauntlets not only master various combinations of techniques but also adapt their tactics in real-time based on my movements."

"Martial apprentices focus on solitary practice, striving to perfect each technique and combine them seamlessly."

"Martial artisans, however, incorporate tactical thinking, sensing their opponents and engaging in strategic combat."

"I understand now. This is how it works."

Ning Zhuo drew upon the vast tactical experience he had acquired through the Burning Boat Soul Crossing Technique, which had granted him access to countless lifetimes of strategic combat.

Ning Zhuo revisited old knowledge and gained profound new insights.

He was already capable of improvising in combat, seamlessly blending the real and the illusory, and demonstrating both flexibility and autonomy. The Bronze Gauntlets served as a hands-on instructor, guiding him step by step.

This wasn't a beginner's lesson; it was more like a revival, a re-learning.

Consequently, he mastered the techniques with astonishing speed.

"Take this! A combined blade strike!" Ning Zhuo wielded a saber in his left hand and a sword in his right, executing the Wave-Breaking Star-Piercing Stance.

The bronze saber unleashed a triple wave-breaking strike, while the bronze sword followed with rapid thrusts, knocking one of the Bronze Gauntlets to the ground.

Ning Zhuo could have pressed his advantage, but he remained rooted in place, allowing the gauntlet to float back and regroup.

After several dozen more exchanges, Ning Zhuo completed his preparations and suddenly unleashed the Silk-Entangling Mountain-Crushing Stance.

The Bronze Gauntlets struggled to defend, their defenses crumbling. One was cleaved to the ground by the bronze sword.

Again, Ning Zhuo showed mercy, halting his attack and allowing the gauntlets to resume their assault.

After another round of attacks and defenses, Ning Zhuo completed his preparations once more.

Combined blade strike - Water-Parting Moon-Teasing!

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The saber and sword struck the Bronze Gauntlets like a tempestuous storm, each blow ringing with a crisp clang and showering sparks.

Unable to withstand the onslaught, both gauntlets were knocked to the ground.

This time, Ning Zhuo showed no restraint. He immediately abandoned his blades, seized the gauntlets with both hands, pressed down on their backs, and rapidly refined them, claiming them for his own use.

The cultivators watching this scene widened their eyes slightly.

The third technique, the combined sword-blade strike - the one they had the least faith in - had proven to be the most powerful in actual combat!

"Time to pick up the pace," Ning Zhuo muttered, estimating the time. He retracted his gauntlets and continued onward.

Soon, he encountered the fourth Profound Armament Armor: a bronze shield.
