Chapter 757: No Form Surpasses Form

Ning Zhuo pointed to his abdomen and slowly sat cross-legged on the ground.

The wound on his abdomen continued to seep blood, sending intermittent waves of pain through his body.

After catching his breath for a moment, his breathing gradually shifted from labored to light.

The Bronze Shield lay motionless on the ground. As he gazed at it, a flicker of regret crossed his eyes.

He had originally intended to continue sparring. Under the pressure of the Bronze Shield, he could learn something new every moment and feel his progress with each passing second.

However, the wound on his abdomen prevented him from fighting for long.

Using his divine sense to manipulate the Bronze Shield, Ning Zhuo instantly transformed its edges into dense, massive serrated blades.

As he observed the cold glint of the blades, he mused, "This shield actually has such an aggressive form. It's truly insidious. I wonder who its original owner was."

Remaining seated, Ning Zhuo's breathing gradually deepened and lengthened.

Trapped within the Formation, he couldn't use healing spells or consume Medicinal Pills. He could only rely on his Physical Body's natural healing abilities.

The bleeding from his wound had stopped, replaced by a tingling sensation.

Ning Zhuo knew this meant his flesh was regenerating, and the wound was rapidly healing.

However, this time, the healing process was noticeably slower than before.

Ning Zhuo keenly sensed this, a grave expression flashing in his eyes. He knew in his heart, "The Physical Body has its limits. After enduring repeated injuries, and now this severe one, it requires a prolonged period of rest and recuperation to return to its Hidden Peak state."

"But I still have many battles ahead!"

Ning Zhuo patiently waited for his injuries to heal before finally standing up.

With a thought, the Bronze Shield flew into his hand.

Holding the shield, Ning Zhuo began practicing his techniques in place, causing the watching cultivators to grow increasingly anxious.

"Is he really not worried at all?"

"He's already fallen far behind. If he keeps this up, he'll likely be eliminated."

Some harbored darker thoughts: "If Ning Zhuo so underestimates our Rising Cloud Minor Trial, then let him fail! It'll teach this genius a humbling lesson."

Seeing Ning Zhuo's exceptional performance, some cultivators couldn't help but feel envious and resentful.

Why should you be so outstanding, possess such extraordinary comprehension, and make such rapid progress in such a short time? What about me? All my painstaking training, accumulation, and years of effort - what does it all amount to?

Compared to Ning Zhuo, many felt utterly inadequate.

But Ning Zhuo's next move dashed the hopes of those secretly wishing for his failure.

To their astonishment, Ning Zhuo merely practiced a few times before continuing his journey.

Not much time left, he thought to himself.

By nature cautious and meticulous, how could he possibly ignore the situation? Before coming here, he had naturally gathered relevant intelligence. In addition to the details of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial itself, he had also researched the performance of participants from previous sessions.

Ning Zhuo was acutely aware of how long it would typically take for the number of cultivators who had obtained their fifth Profound Armament Armor to reach the required threshold.

Once that threshold was met, the third stage would begin, and all remaining cultivators would be automatically eliminated.

I need to pick up the pace.

After all, the difficulty increases with each Profound Armament Armor. The later the armor, the more powerful it becomes.

The Profound Armament Armor cultivators encounter will vary. I need to leave some room for error later on.

Ning Zhuo quickly reviewed his progress: The initial Bronze Sword only required basic sword techniques. The subsequent Bronze Blade demanded not only basic blade techniques but also combo attacks. By the time he reached the Bronze Gauntlets, tactical thinking came into play, with the gauntlets adapting to his strategies as if controlled by a real person.

With the Bronze Shield, the martial prowess of the Profound Armament Armor advanced further, now capable of fully exploiting the terrain.

"The Bronze Sword and Blade represent the Martial Apprentice realm. Cultivators in this realm diligently practice, striving for perfect technique, coordinated power, and seamless combinations. Reaching the peak of this realm leads to Microscopic Insight - the ability to execute techniques with extreme precision."

"The Bronze Gauntlets and Shield represent the Martial Artisan realm. The cultivator's focus expands from themselves to the external world, considering how to engage opponents more effectively. This leads to the deliberate design of feints and even traps."

As Ning Zhuo reflected on this, a scene from the recent battle flashed through his mind. The Bronze Shield, despite being able to quickly withdraw, had feigned being stuck in the wall, luring Ning Zhuo into a reckless assault while patiently waiting for an opening.

"In the Martial Artisan realm, techniques evolve from rigid, standardized forms into more practical and 'free' styles. However, they still retain a craftsman-like predictability, making them easily decipherable."

"My comprehension of the essence of illusion and reality, allowing me to 'predict' my opponent's next move by sensing subtle shifts in their Qi, was only possible because the Bronze Gauntlets' techniques were too predictable."

"But after that, with the fifth Profound Armament Armor, we reach the realm above Martial Artisan - the level of a true master! Techniques become even more fluid, adapting to the current situation with what might seem like casual, childlike scribbles. Yet because they are so precisely tailored to the battlefield, they possess extraordinary sharpness and immense power. This is the essence of transcending form, where formless techniques triumph over structured ones!"

The Rising Cloud Minor Trial of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor has been held for many cycles, making it a classic test. The difficulty of the Profound Armament Armor encountered by cultivators in the second key stage gradually increases, each with its own significance.

"I was already severely injured just dealing with the Bronze Shield."

"For the upcoming fifth Profound Armament Armor, I must strike with full force and resolve the battle swiftly. Any carelessness could lead to defeat!"

By the time Ning Zhuo reached the Bronze Shield, he had already lost his training environment.

Fortunately, he had seized every opportunity for practical combat learning earlier. Had he prioritized speed and efficiency, his weak foundation would likely have led to defeat against the Bronze Shield.

"What am I worth?"

"When it comes to Five Elements Spells, I still have some confidence. But Martial Art and close combat? Those are truly my weaknesses."

"In truth, my mastery of Five Elements Spells merely stands on the shoulders of past sages - it's not my own true skill."

"Only through continuous learning and relentless effort can I hope to overcome my shortcomings."

"Even if I fail to stop Ban Ji this time, I've already learned a great deal and significantly improved my skills. This journey won't be in vain!"

From this perspective, Ning Zhuo could already see the fruits of his practical combat training through the Bronze Shield.

"At the same time, the experiences I gained through the Soul Search Technique have revealed its limitations."

Shields are rarely used by cultivators!

None of the Demonic Cultivators Ning Zhuo had Soul Searched had ever truly mastered or even properly used a shield, let alone studied it in depth.

Without this foundational knowledge, Ning Zhuo struggled to master the shield, unable to progress as quickly as before.

This was one of the reasons he practiced only briefly before moving on to the next challenge.

This inevitably reminded Ning Zhuo of a particular cultivator, whom he genuinely envied:

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord!

"Forgetful, this long river, has existed since the Underworld first formed. Countless years of accumulation have imbued its waters with countless memories."

"If the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord were to master the Forgetful state and immerse himself in the Forgetful River, he could simply plunder its depths at will. What a terrifying transformation!"

"It's fortunate I disrupted his plans... and unfortunate that I had to."

"A tree that stands too tall in the forest will inevitably be felled by the wind. Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, you are simply too exceptional; even the heavens cannot tolerate your brilliance."

While others envied Ning Zhuo's excellence, Ning Zhuo himself envied those who surpassed him.

Unbeknownst to him, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was also "preoccupied" with him.

-----

Forgetful River Royal Palace.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord sat regally on his throne, maintaining the National Art. Wisps of cloud-like mist swirled in his eyes, as if he were gazing down upon the entire Underworld Prefecture from the celestial heights.

Five armies from Ghostfire Prefecture, like five bone-piercing daggers, were tearing through the defensive lines and plunging into the heart of Forgetful.

The eastern route was the Rotten Bone Poison Stream.

Strictly speaking, this wasn't a direct force of Ghostfire Prefecture, but rather a coalition of separatist factions within Forgetful River Prefecture, forming a rebel army.

Their commander was Yin, known as the Strong Soul Poison Marshal. The main force consisted of 100,000 Weapon-Dead Ghosts, their feet adorned with lotus pedestals and bodies entwined with aquatic plants, making them adept at naval warfare. They were supported by 30,000 Poisonous Mist Ghosts, each towering over three meters tall and capable of spewing toxic clouds.

They had departed from the Rotten Poison Marsh, crossed the Shattered Ice Lake, and were now advancing directly toward the strategic hub of the lower Forgetful River - Nethermarsh Immortal City.

The western route was the Acid Bone Raging Tide.

Led by Zhao Haishan, a Great General of Ghostfire Prefecture, this army comprised 150,000 Withered Bone Soldiers and several thousand Bone-Covered War Chariots.

Having already breached the defenses of Buried Bone Hills, they were now rapidly advancing along the Ancient Bloodpool Road, their target Bladehoning Immortal City.

The southern route was commanded by Yan Yan, a Ghost Cultivator renowned alongside Zhao Haishan as one of the Great Generals of Ghostfire Prefecture.

His army comprised eight legions of Burnt Ghosts, nearly ten thousand Soul-Melting Ghost Cavalry, and several hundred Crimson Roar Cannons.

After days of lurking in the Boiling Water Rift Valley of Ghostfire Prefecture, they launched a sudden assault, swiftly conquering three Immortal Cities in succession, making them the most formidable enemy force currently engaged.

The northern route was manned by guest troops from Ghostfire Prefecture, sheltering the Marchioness from the Departed Solitude Underworld.

Marchioness Gongsun Haosha led fifty thousand Frozen Ghosts, forty thousand Snow Vengeance Yin Soldiers, and five hundred Ice Bone Tombstones.

They had bypassed villages and Immortal Cities along their route, their current movements remaining unclear.

The central route was occupied by Wanlijian's main force.

This army consisted of one hundred and thirty thousand Terracotta Warriors, three thousand Ghost Giants, one thousand Soul-Rending Ram Chariots, and five hundred Soul Curse Cultivators.

After days of frontal assaults, they had captured Ghost Gate Immortal City, securing a vital military stronghold on the border of Forgetful River Prefecture. Since then, they had remained stationary, recuperating and regrouping.

From the Forgetful River Prefecture's vantage point, the view extended beyond these five armies to encompass the enemy's National Art enveloping their forces.

Under the influence of this National Art, the five armies served as bridges, relentlessly undermining the morale of both the people and the military throughout Forgetful River Prefecture!

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord slowly closed his eyes, his hands forming an ancient, intricate seal. As he chanted, each syllable resonated with the wrathful roar of the Cultivation Kingdom in the netherworld: "O mighty ones! Savage invaders tear at our lands! Souls weep in unison, burned by blood and fire! By the Royal Seal, I wield Heaven's authority! Let our national decree ring clear - united against our foes!"

In an instant, the nation's power surged forth, pouring into the Royal Seal before him from the Void.

The seal erupted with an unprecedented, searing light.

The light pierced through the roof of the Senluo Hall, transforming into a towering, azure pillar that pierced the heavens and plunged into the depths of the Nine Hells!

Within the Forgetful River Prefecture, the wavering morale of the military and populace swiftly stabilized.

As the light faded, the Royal Seal shattered into countless cracks, then crumbled to ash.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord narrowed his eyes, gritting his teeth in silent fury.

His true Royal Seal was missing, forcing him to use a counterfeit to barely activate the National Art and remotely confront the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord.

But a counterfeit seal was, after all, a counterfeit. Each use would completely destroy it, consuming vast reserves of national resources.

"I must retrieve the true Royal Seal!"

"Otherwise, how can we withstand the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord's repeated use of the National Art?"

"Ning Zhuo!

"You've ruined my Dao Path and stolen my Royal Seal! Death a thousand times over would be too merciful! Even a thousand deaths wouldn't quench my hatred!"

It wasn't just the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord who was muttering about Ning Zhuo; others also had him on their minds.

Ban Ji stared at the Bronze Blade before him, his eyes widening before his lips stretched into a wide grin. He burst into laughter, "I've found it! I've finally found a Bronze Blade! Hahaha, ahahaha..."

His long pursuit and anticipation had finally been realized.

Ban Ji raised his Wolf Tooth Mace high, charging forward with explosive force. His arm muscles bulged as he swung the mace down toward the Bronze Blade.

The Bronze Blade floated silently in mid-air until the Wolf Tooth Mace was about to strike. Then, it suddenly flickered.

It neither hardened nor dodged, but instead rotated with effortless grace, like a willow leaf falling in the wind.

At the precise moment the mace's edge was about to touch the blade, the Bronze Blade flicked the side of the mace head with pinpoint accuracy and lightning speed.

Ban Ji's thunderous strike, fueled by all his might, was thrown off course by this casual flick. The massive Wolf Tooth Mace grazed the Bronze Blade's body and crashed violently into the brick floor.

Immediately afterward, the Bronze Blade lunged toward Ban Ji.

Ban Ji used his divine sense to control his Flying Dagger, Chain Hammer, and Nunchaku for defense, but even this triple layer of protection proved futile. With a few casual twists and turns, the Bronze Blade pierced through the defenses, its tip piercing the vulnerable spot beneath Ban Ji's ribs.

Ban Ji let out a low growl of pain, staggering backward. A deep gash had opened beneath his ribs, the crimson blood quickly staining his clothes.

He immediately grabbed the handles of the three Flying Daggers and hurled them with all his might.

The Bronze Blade casually swayed a few times, effortlessly dodging all the daggers. Its movements were so casual, lacking any semblance of a sword technique, yet this seemingly random swaying had indeed evaded every dagger.

"This is the ultimate technique - formless victory!" Ban Ji's brow furrowed as he recalled the intelligence reports.

He licked his dry lips, a sense of foreboding rising in his heart.

"No matter what! I must obtain this Bronze Blade!" Greed flashed in Ban Ji's eyes as he lunged forward with renewed ferocity.

Thwack!

Clang, clang, clang...

Ugh!

Ughaa!

Hiss, hiss, hiss...

Ban Ji's muffled groans, agonized roars, and sharp intakes of breath echoed in quick succession.

His eyes remained fixed on the Bronze Blade before him, his mind reeling with confusion.

"I knew the intelligence reports. I knew the realm of the fifth Bronze Artifact."

"But... but this Bronze Blade clearly defies all expectations! Its power is far too overwhelming!"

"Who sent it back? It couldn't have been some nobody!"
