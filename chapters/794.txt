Chapter 794: Meeting Madam Today, My Hands Are Itching for a Fight

Bluestone Grotto-mansion.

Tea smoke curled in the air.

Zhu Guizhi sat cross-legged, her bluish-purple skirt spreading across the prayer mat like flowing water.

The two had been conversing for some time now.

Zhu Guizhi’s mood, however, was not particularly good.

Her main purpose in visiting Ning Zhuo so quietly this time was to probe him. Yet, after several rounds of conversation, she had failed to pry any valuable intelligence from his mouth.

Zhu Guizhi had long since made arrangements for her daughter Zhu Fenxiang’s marriage. She did not want Zhu Fenxiang and Ning Zhuo to end up together.

However, Ning Zhuo had displayed his own Innate Talent, and his actions hinted at the formidable power of the faction backing him.

Before coming here, Zhu Guizhi had meticulously studied Ning Zhuo’s performance during the trials in the Profound Armor Cave, as well as his battle with Gu Qing.

The more she studied, the more she didn't dare to be careless.

She worried that her actions might provoke Ning Zhuo and sour relations with a Super Sect.

As a mature Righteous Path cultivator, Zhu Guizhi naturally would not commit such a foolish act.

But the initial results of their negotiation showed Ning Zhuo to be quite impenetrable, leaving Zhu Guizhi with no certainty. She was even somewhat annoyed, almost wondering if Ning Zhuo was an old cultivator who had reincarnated or performed a soul-possession.

She shook her head inwardly; she knew very well that Ning Zhuo was a young man.

He lacked any air of decay; his clear eyes alone radiated the beauty of youth.

Zhu Guizhi raised her hand to pour tea, the green jade bracelet on her wrist lightly clinking against the porcelain cup with a crisp, clear sound.

She would not give up easily.

In the next moment, she took the initiative to change the subject, mentioning the previous battle and praising Ning Zhuo’s rhetoric when he publicly framed Gu Qing after the fight ended.

"A casual remark from Young Master Ning Zhuo threw Gu Qing into immense trouble."

"However, I am somewhat puzzled."

"With the Young Master's intelligence, wouldn't befriending Gu Qing be better than making an enemy of him?"

Hearing this, Ning Zhuo’s lips curled slightly, but he did not answer. He merely leaned back - a simple gesture that immediately created an extraordinary presence.

"Madam Zhu, don't you think the sparring between painted avatars proposed by Gu Qing was too tepid and boring?"

In an instant, Zhu Guizhi keenly sensed a sharp light flashing in Ning Zhuo’s eyes.

It was like a sudden bolt of lightning amidst the clouds; though it lasted only a moment, it made Zhu Guizhi’s heart skip a beat.

"Young Master Ning is indeed no ordinary person." Zhu Guizhi lowered her eyes and smiled faintly, though her hands tucked in her sleeves involuntarily tightened.

She thought of her husband, He Yong - that eternally mild and polite Righteous Path cultivator. In his entire life, he would likely never be so unrestrained.

This lack of restraint was, in fact, the spark of ambition.

This trait displayed by Ning Zhuo added a great deal of admiration to Zhu Guizhi's view of him.

It was something her husband, He Yong, lacked.

From this perspective alone, her daughter’s judgment was superior to her own. However, Ning Zhuo displaying only this was far from enough.

Since she hadn't probed the true result, she had to remain skeptical.

As a mature person of the Righteous Path, she also needed to be responsible for her subordinates and her faction; she needed a concrete fact. Then, based on that fact, she would make judgments, choices, and changes.

"Young Master Ning Zhuo, why not take a look at this?"

Zhu Guizhi took out a gift list and informed Ning Zhuo of the relevant Zhu family policy: the Divine Summoning Art taught by Zhu Fenxiang meant that he, Ning Zhuo, would have to become a matrilocal son-in-law and join the Zhu family. This matter was already circulating within the Zhu family. The various precious materials, Magic Artifacts, and magic treasures on the gift list were part of the resources for marrying in, with more to come in the future.

Ning Zhuo didn't even glance at the gift list, immediately waving it away. He stated that he had already learned of this from Zhu Fenxiang. But it was a misunderstanding! There was no secret romance between him and Zhu Fenxiang; it was merely a coincidence that Zhu Fenxiang had taken the initiative to teach him.

Zhu Guizhi was not particularly surprised by this answer.

An excellent politician usually has suspicions, or even the answer, before asking many questions.

Her asking this question was merely a setup.

She sighed softly: "When a young woman's heart first awakens, it is easy for her eyes to be clouded by temporary emotions. I remember when I first met her father; it was the same."

"Fenxiang is my own flesh and blood. If she did something that affected her whole life out of a momentary impulse... that is possible."

"Hearing the Young Master's answer now, I can breathe a sigh of relief."

Ning Zhuo remained silent.

Zhu Guizhi’s concern did not match the image of Zhu Fenxiang in his mind.

Ning Zhuo had already collected much intelligence on Zhu Fenxiang, and he did not believe she was someone who would let emotions ruin things.

Zhu Fenxiang had received elite training since childhood, putting in hard work and patience, tempering her mind and nature. She deeply understood human and divine nature, which allowed her to serve the gods, manage relationships well, and achieve results in the Divine Summoning Art.

This was precisely what Ning Zhuo admired about Zhu Fenxiang.

Ning Zhuo was indifferent in his heart, but on the surface, he expressed admiration: Zhu Guizhi was acting as a mother, planning for her child. Such benevolence was moving.

As he spoke, a gentle expression appeared on his face as he couldn't help but think of his own mother.

Ning Zhuo: "Since the misunderstanding is resolved, please take back this gift list, Madam."

"It's just a misunderstanding; it’s better not to deepen it."

Zhu Guizhi sighed, praising Ning Zhuo’s upright character as admirable. He was indeed someone who had passed the Three Questions of the Heart. He walked a straight path and sat tall.

Her tone shifted slightly, "However, the Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art is, after all, no small matter. Fenxiang’s current situation..."

After listening, Ning Zhuo’s brow furrowed slightly.

He asked Zhu Guizhi how she intended to handle it.

Zhu Guizhi then threw out a solution: first, use a Divine Art to erase part of Ning Zhuo’s memory. Afterward, have Ning Zhuo publicly announce that he and Zhu Fenxiang were friends, not lovers.

Zhu Guizhi observed his expression and added at the end: "Please rest assured, Young Master Ning. A Divine Contract will be signed beforehand to ensure safety throughout the process."

Ning Zhuo’s frown deepened.

Ensure what safety? Could a Divine Contract truly ensure his safety?

What if the Zhu family had malicious intentions?

A Divine Contract was not one hundred percent reliable.

As a contract, there were bound to be loopholes to exploit. There was absolutely no need for him to take this risk.

Ning Zhuo’s nature dictated that he would not easily take such a gamble.

He was proficient in soul-searching and had recently frequently used the Burning Boat Soul-Ferrying Art. He knew all too well that the room for manipulation in such things was actually massive.

Once he agreed, his situation would be like fish on a chopping block.

If he encountered someone with ill intent, Ning Zhuo would surely pay a heavy price, perhaps even falling into a bottomless abyss.

This was not the act of a wise man!

Furthermore, he did not want to publicly announce their relationship.

An official announcement would only arouse more suspicion. It would be a significant blow to his Righteous Path reputation. Simultaneously, it would signal to the public that his relationship with the Zhu family was average or even negative.

This would also have an adverse effect on his current situation.

He was currently facing the issue with Gu Qing. If he revealed such a flaw now, Gu Qing’s group would surely pounce, seizing the opportunity to strike.

The pressure he faced from Gu Qing and Zhao Hansheng was already quite high.

Ning Zhuo was inherently in a weaker position. His previous framing of Gu Qing was a matter of using the opponent's strength against them and riding the momentum. Ultimately, he had only taken advantage of a sneak attack to catch Gu Qing off guard.

Ning Zhuo absolutely did not accept the handling method proposed by Zhu Guizhi.

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and immediately stated that he was quite interested in the Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art and wished to learn it. Furthermore, the version he held was only the basic first level. Since the Zhu family could bring this up, it meant the matter was negotiable.

Ning Zhuo: "Madam Zhu, what do you think of these?"

As he spoke, Ning Zhuo took out a handful of Ghost Path Golden Cores from his storage bag.

The Golden Cores spilled onto the table, spreading out. For a moment, golden light flickered alongside a dense ghostly aura.

Zhu Guizhi’s expression changed slightly.

She was a Golden Core-level cultivator herself and immediately sensed Ning Zhuo’s dominance from this single action.

Ning Zhuo: "If that’s not enough, there are more here."

Ning Zhuo pulled out two more handfuls.

Over a dozen Ghost Path Golden Cores were spread across the table, making the entire room glow.

Zhu Guizhi’s breath hitched.

Such immense wealth held in the hands of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Moreover, the young man before her was only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment!

This forced her to re-evaluate Ning Zhuo’s strength and his status within his faction.

The value of these dozen or so Ghost Path Golden Cores far exceeded the gift list Zhu Guizhi had presented.

The strength she had tried to demonstrate with her list now seemed fragile.

Ning Zhuo’s shocking financial power also caused many thoughts to swirl in Zhu Guizhi’s mind. For a moment, her throat felt dry.

Zhu Guizhi had arranged the marriage for Zhu Fenxiang solely to fully utilize her value and gain the maximum political benefit. Now, she saw another possibility in Ning Zhuo.

As long as Zhu Guizhi confirmed that a union between Zhu Fenxiang and Ning Zhuo would bring her more political profit, then why not? Changing the original plan was not impossible.

Zhu Guizhi pondered for a moment, then suddenly smiled: "The Young Master's generosity makes me unsure of what to do. Could it be... these Golden Cores are a betrothal gift?"

She covered her lips with her sleeve, her eyes shimmering with a probing light: "Hehehe, but if we are to arrange a marriage, the elders of both sides must meet and discuss in detail."

She naturally followed up: "I still don't know much about the Young Master’s family situation."

The smile on Ning Zhuo’s face gradually faded.

Zhu Guizhi still didn't want to give up, but Ning Zhuo could not tell her the truth.

The Ning Clan was not powerful. If Ning Zhuo spoke the truth, the outcome would not be good.

But he wouldn't deliberately lie either, because such a lie would be too easy to expose. If it were verified later, what would happen to his image and reputation?

The best situation was actually the current one. The public subconsciously believed that Ning Zhuo’s background was very extraordinary. This was almost a consensus.

How should he handle this?

Ning Zhuo had been evasive and perfunctory many times before; if he tried the same trick again, it would show weakness and suggest he was feeling guilty.

In just an instant, Ning Zhuo came up with a countermeasure.

"Madam Zhu." He smiled slightly, showing a clear sense of arrogance, "Regarding the Divine Summoning Art, your daughter personally told me it wasn't a major issue. Only then did I accept it, and it was only the first level."

"Yet you come here now with a different story. You may have the love of a mother for her child, but what does that have to do with me? You've come to trouble me and place me in danger."

"And you persistently probe into my family background. Are you trying to confirm something?"

"If my background weren't high, would you have resorted to other schemes against me?"

Zhu Guizhi’s expression shifted instantly, and she opened her mouth to speak.

Ning Zhuo reached out to stop her and continued: "During this trial, I intentionally concealed my background to give myself an advantage."

"If you wish to know, it is not impossible."

"But at least..."

Zhu Guizhi felt a sense of relief and smiled: "I am willing to pay the price for such precious intelligence."

Ning Zhuo chuckled: "Madam, you underestimate me."

"If you want to know, first see if you have the qualifications."

"As for Golden Cores ..." Ning Zhuo glanced down at the dozen or so Ghost Path Golden Cores on the table, "I have cut down quite a few of them myself."

Zhu Guizhi’s pupils constricted violently. Her expression stiffened, her previous composure vanishing as she felt a strong sense of offense!

Ning Zhuo’s words were quite blunt, but they were actually very logical.

Everything had to be decided by strength.

Strength was the greatest logic!

The fundamental logic of how the world operated had never changed since ancient times - the winner is king!

No matter the opinion, conflict, or contradiction, if both sides started cutting each other down, the one who died was definitely the one in the wrong.

Once you are victorious, there will naturally be Renowned Masters to interpret the classics in your favor.

The logic held, but Zhu Guizhi still felt a wave of humiliation.

She was, after all, Zhu Fenxiang’s mother and an elder. Besides that, she was a Golden Core-level cultivator. By cultivation rank, she was Ning Zhuo’s senior.

Ning Zhuo lacked basic respect for her!

Zhu Guizhi suppressed her anger, stating that she did not wish to bully the young as an elder.

Ning Zhuo chuckled: "Madam Zhu, you’ve been probing my background repeatedly; you were already bullying the young."

His sharp words left Zhu Guizhi speechless for a moment.

Ning Zhuo’s voice was clear: "The Zhu family’s name is like thunder in my ears."

"The Divine Summoning Art displayed by Fellow Daoist Zhu Fenxiang in her battle against Situ Xing was indeed exquisite. Her extraordinary grace was truly captivating."

"I am untalented, but watching that battle made my hands itch for a fight. Seeing the Madam today, I feel it even more."

"As the saying goes, a tiger daughter comes from a dragon mother. I ask Madam Zhu to please grant me your guidance."

Seeing Ning Zhuo pressing her repeatedly, Zhu Guizhi was so angry she laughed. It seemed this young junior before her had mistaken her for an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.

"Since Young Master Ning insists, very well."

"I accept this challenge."

Zhu Guizhi had secretly made up her mind. She had to take this fight seriously and give Ning Zhuo a proper lesson to solidify her status as a senior and establish the hierarchy between them!
