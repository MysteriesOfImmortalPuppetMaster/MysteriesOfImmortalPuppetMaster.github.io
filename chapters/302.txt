Chapter 302: The Secret Pavilion of Opportunities

Suddenly drawn into the grand hall's entrance, Ning Zhuo's vision transformed into a swirl of five colors.

A strong sense of weightlessness and dizziness overwhelmed him, a sensation Ning Zhuo was familiar with. Previously, when Sun Lingtong used the Void Traversing Technique to teleport him, it felt just like this.

Ning Zhuo's feet suddenly touched the ground, and the colorful scene before him vanished abruptly.

He immediately went on full alert, scanning his surroundings.

The red steel walls, the warm temperature, and the golden ceiling were all familiar, making him mistakenly think he had once again entered the Immortal Palace.

However, unlike entering the Immortal Palace, this time Ning Zhuo's soul was not extracted by the Life-Hanging Thread; both his body and soul entered together.

New information was transmitted to his mind-

"Lava Immortal Palace's Third Test Palace Trial!"

"Cultivators will explore the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, facing unique challenges in each mechanical room to earn corresponding rewards." "Ultimately, the one who finds the correct path, exits the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, and sits on the throne in the main hall will become the master of the Lava Immortal Palace!" "Please note: the difficulty of the mechanical rooms varies."

"Please note: during the exploration of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities and the journey to the main hall, cultivators' cultivation will be suppressed to the Qi Refining Stage." "Please note: any magical artifacts, pills, etc., carried by cultivators will be prohibited from use, and violators will be disqualified." "Please note: cultivators are allowed to use various tools provided in the Secret Pavilion and are allowed to use spells. Spell power will be suppressed to the Qi Refining level." "Please note: mechanical constructs in the trial checkpoints can be used unconditionally during exploration."

"Please note: every accumulation of thirty-six explorations in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities will trigger a minor opportunity shift. Every accumulation of one hundred and eight explorations will trigger a major opportunity shift." "Please note: cultivators can inquire about the list at any time and can choose to concede. Once conceded, they will be immediately teleported out." "Please note: any changes to the trial list will be promptly communicated to all participants."

......

A long string of information made Ning Zhuo pause in place. After carefully savoring it, he began to take action.

He scanned around and found himself in the first mechanical room, which seemed quite ordinary, with only a platform in the center.

The platform was enveloped by a pillar of light, and on it was placed a mechanical tool.

It was a wooden circle. The circle was rather thick, with eighteen diamond-shaped water crystals embedded on it. The water crystals emitted a faint blue-purple glow. As the angle of observation slightly changed, the blue-purple glow also shifted, appearing quite exquisite.

"Hanging Ring." For a moment, Ning Zhuo felt a sense of déjà vu.

He cautiously, with utmost vigilance, examined it using various spells. After detecting no mechanical traps, he reached out and took the Hanging Ring.

The light pillar enveloping the platform dissipated immediately, and the entire platform slowly sank until it was completely submerged into the floor.

Finally, the floor on both sides closed tightly in the middle, leaving not even a seam.

Ning Zhuo stood in place, scanning left and right, remaining on guard for a while, but nothing happened.

"Is that it?" Ning Zhuo felt puzzled.

Elsewhere in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities...

"Ahhh!" Sun Lingtong was sprinting wildly.

Behind him, a Foundation Establishment-level flame lizard charged like a raging bull, relentlessly pursuing him.

The room's limited space forced Sun Lingtong to leap and dodge, sometimes even running along the walls.

His legs moved like wheels.

The flame lizard suddenly opened its mouth, spitting out a line of fire.

The tip of the fire line touched Sun Lingtong's rear, immediately setting his pants ablaze.

Sun Lingtong had no choice but to run with all his might while slapping his flaming rear.

In another part of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities...

Ning Jiufan was pierced by over a dozen long spears, pinned to a wall.

With a grimace, Ning Jiufan endured the intense pain, pulling out the spears one by one.

Unable to retrieve the pills from his storage belt, he had to use the Ning family's ice technique to freeze himself, urgently healing his wounds.

Ning Zhuo cautiously stepped into the second Secret Pavilion.

The setup was identical to before, with a platform in the room.

A beam of light shone down, making the mechanical construct on the platform very clear and conspicuous.

Ning Zhuo approached cautiously and took the mechanical construct, which turned out to be a blood transformation pool.

"This mechanical component can dissolve living beings with blood into countless blood droplets. Paired with a blood oil bottle, it can allow mechanical puppets to sustain themselves through battle."

"However, my Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng is intricately designed, with no space left to incorporate such a large blood transformation pool component." Currently, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was still in Sun Lingtong's possession.

Ning Zhuo needed to meet with Sun Lingtong to retrieve Yuan Dasheng.

"Sigh, I hope to encounter Boss Sun soon."

Unable to use the storage belt, Ning Zhuo had to carry the large blood transformation pool.

Doors for departure were present in all directions, even on the ceiling and floor.

Ning Zhuo randomly chose a door and pushed it open.

......

In the Secret Pavilion of the Book Master, there was only one door.

A massive door.

The door was covered with numerous wooden blocks, which interlocked with each other, all constrained within the doorframe.

The Book Master held the door handle, needing to expend magical power and mental energy to rearrange these wooden blocks so that the characters on each block were sequentially aligned. The final overall text would form the correct "Demonic Blood Vein Technique."

But the problem was...

"I have no idea what the 'Demonic Blood Vein Technique' is!"

The Book Master roared in his heart with frustration.

At this moment, he deeply regretted not participating in the Golden Core battle in Fire Persimmon Immortal City to seize the Demonic Dao Scripture.

Even if it was a fake scripture, it still contained some genuine insights.

"Or, if someone had sold me some content of the demonic scripture during the second test of the palace trial, I could have deduced a lot from it, not getting stuck here." This was the second Secret Pavilion the Book Master had entered.

The massive door blocked his progress.

After struggling for a while, the Book Master, with a slightly pale face, chose to give up.

"My power is suppressed to the Qi Refining Stage."

"Not only the total amount of magical power and mental energy but even the recovery ability is limited to the Qi Refining Stage." "I can't afford to waste too much in front of this door."

"I must always be on guard in case someone else enters this Secret Pavilion, leading to a confrontation." Before leaving, the Book Master took one last longing look at the door.

He had a feeling that the room behind the door must hold great benefits.

"Unfortunately, I'm not a trial disciple."

"The first and second tests of the palace trial clearly showed that the Sage of the Three Sects is quite generous to their disciples." This Secret Pavilion had two external passages.

One was the large door, and the other was a small door.

The small door was the path the Book Master had entered.

He sighed, opened the small door, and returned to the first Secret Pavilion he had entered.

This time, he chose another small door and left.

He was still unwilling, silently memorizing the route in his heart.

......

Ning Zhuo had just left his third Secret Pavilion.

From this Secret Pavilion, he obtained a pill that, when consumed, could quickly restore magical power.

As he pushed open the door and entered the fourth Secret Pavilion, the entire room suddenly began to shake.

The shaking was not intense, and a series of mechanical sounds echoed throughout the room.

The mechanical sounds lasted for several breaths before abruptly stopping. During this time, the room continued to tremble. As the mechanical sounds ceased, the room also calmed down.

"Ha!" A Qi Refining-level kung fu puppet assumed a stance, ready to face Ning Zhuo.

"Finally, something different." Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up as he stepped forward.

The kung fu puppet charged at him.

Ning Zhuo, knowing his limits, immediately retreated, using spells to kite the attack.

The kung fu puppet was gradually bound by rapidly growing vines.

"Demonic Blood Vein!" Ning Zhuo leisurely approached it, using his own essence blood to perform the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, forcibly subduing the puppet.

"Until I retrieve the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, I'll make do with this." Ning Zhuo left his fourth Secret Pavilion, with the Demonic Blood Vein Kung Fu Puppet following closely behind.

This time, he chose to return the way he came.

However, upon pushing open the small door he had entered, he found himself in an unfamiliar room.

This confirmed one of his suspicions.

The information had mentioned: every accumulation of thirty-six explorations in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities would trigger a minor opportunity shift. Every accumulation of one hundred and eight explorations would trigger a major opportunity shift.

"So this is the so-called 'minor opportunity shift,' disrupting the connections between the Secret Pavilions, rendering previous route memories useless."

"I've explored up to the fourth Secret Pavilion, and there are thirteen cultivators participating in the third test of the palace trial. Some have explored fewer Secret Pavilions than I have, so the total number of Secret Pavilions explored by everyone just reached thirty-six." "Reaching this number triggered the mechanism, causing a minor opportunity shift." "If a minor opportunity shift is like this, what about a major opportunity shift?"

Ning Zhuo pondered, continuously thinking. It would take some time to truly understand the rules of the third test of the palace trial.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit closely monitored the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.

This was a meticulously structured mechanical building, the final line of defense for the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace.

The trial checkpoints arranged by the Sage of the Three Sects were realized through the unique functions of this mechanical building.

And the various trial checkpoints only utilized a fraction of the Secret Pavilion's power.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was the sole spectator, overseeing the entire situation. After the first minor opportunity shift was triggered, it immediately summarized the encounters of each cultivator.

Some were fortunate, some were not, some racked their brains, while others were still being pursued.

"The ones with the most gains are Meng Chong and Ning Zhuo."

"Both of them have made gains in every Secret Pavilion. Currently, their accumulation of mechanical constructs is neck and neck, firmly occupying the top tier." The top tier consisted only of Meng Chong and Ning Zhuo.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's expression was solemn: "The route choices in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities are actually a test of a cultivator's fate energy." "The more abundant the fate energy, the better the route chosen by the cultivator, offering more benefits. The opposite is also true." "Meng Chong possesses Immortal Talent, with naturally strong fate energy. Is Ning Zhuo showing the same performance?" "Could it be that his unmeasured innate talent is also Immortal Talent?" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but speculate.

"But that doesn't make sense."

"If he had Immortal Talent, how could he have lived such an oppressed and unlucky life in Fire Persimmon Immortal City for sixteen years?"

"That definitely doesn't match the fate energy of innate talent!"
