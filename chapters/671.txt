Chapter 671: Renting a Cave Residence

Moments later, Ning Zhuo, Shen Xi, and Su Lingkou parted ways outside the main hall.

As Ning Zhuo's figure receded into the distance, Su Lingkou stood beside her cousin, Shen Xi, and asked, puzzled, "Cousin, you are the genius and hope of our clan. Your goal in joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect is to become a True Inheritance Disciple."

"What merits does this person possess that would compel you to lower yourself to befriend him?"

Shen Xi replied, "Didn't you notice? Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo traveled with another cultivator, arriving together via the teleportation array. Although that person concealed their Qi, revealing only faint traces of a Confucian cultivator, they didn't pay the teleportation fee."

"This reminds me of a sect policy: any cultivator with the status of True Inheritance Disciple is exempt from paying upon returning to the Main Mountain Gate."

Su Lingkou nodded. "I see."

"But True Inheritance Disciples aren't the only ones exempt from paying, are they?"

"Besides, even if his companion is a True Inheritor, they might not be closely connected. Perhaps they simply met along the way."

"Cousin, think about it. If he truly had elders in the Myriad Manifestations Sect, why would he need to purchase such expensive intelligence?"

Shen Xi nodded. "You're right. That's certainly possible."

A hint of annoyance flashed across Su Lingkou's face. "Ning Zhuo is so ungrateful! You proactively invited him to rent a Cave Residence together and travel with us, yet he refused. If this were in Nine Palaces Immortal City, countless cultivators would have swarmed to you, showering you with gratitude!"

Shen Xi's brow furrowed slightly, his expression turning serious. "Cousin, such arrogance is unwarranted."

"While my talent and strength may be among the best in Nine Palaces Immortal City, this is the Myriad Manifestations Sect!"

"Every Flying Cloud Assembly gathers the most brilliant minds and showcases extraordinary talents. Cultivators with similar backgrounds to mine, or even greater strength, will come here, displaying their utmost prowess to secure a high-ranking position within the sect."

Su Lingkou stuck out her tongue and looped her arm through Shen Xi's, gently swaying him. Her voice filled with admiration, she said, "Even so, I still believe you'll shine brightest among all these geniuses, Cousin."

"You," Shen Xi said, shaking his head slightly and sighing indulgently, no longer scolding his cousin.

He gazed at Ning Zhuo's figure disappearing into the clouds, a clear light flashing in his eyes. "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo may dress plainly, but he carries himself with natural grace, conversing with us with ease and composure."

"Even if he isn't from a super-elite family, he certainly isn't from some small, insignificant clan."

Su Lingkou thought back for a moment, this time not arguing. "Indeed, that's true."

Ning Zhuo rode a flying cloud, drifting slowly through the high skies.

This cloud-riding technique was something he had improvised on the spot, inspired by the surrounding scenery.

Clouds are closely related to the Water Element, and with Ning Zhuo's profound mastery of the Five Elements, achieving this was no difficult feat.

Initially, he moved slowly, focusing more on observing his surroundings.

Within the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main headquarters, countless peaks and halls dotted the landscape. Countless figures traversed the skies, their movements seemingly chaotic yet governed by unspoken, customary traffic rules.

Using the information from the Jade Slip in his hand as a reference, Ning Zhuo quickly adapted.

He occasionally veered off onto side paths, traveling alone, and at other times merged into the flow of people, following the main routes.

In a moment, he dispersed the cloud beneath him and landed atop a severed mountain peak.

The summit had been flattened into a level platform, upon which stood a palace.

The palace was constructed of dark stone, its surface etched with faintly glowing spiritual patterns. Golden talismans sealed the entrance, radiating solemn majesty.

Though modest in scale compared to the bustling commercial branch he had just left, the palace teemed with activity, a constant stream of people flowing in and out.

This was a branch of the Inner Affairs Hall.

Ning Zhuo entered the palace and was soon led away by a middle-aged cultivator.

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, do you have a mount?" the cultivator asked as they reached the cliff's edge.

Ning Zhuo shook his head, performed a hand seal, and conjured a wisp of cloud beneath his feet.

The middle-aged cultivator immediately opened his beast-taming pouch and summoned a four-winged Flying Centipede. Several rows of seats were arranged along the centipede's back.

He waved Ning Zhuo over. "Your cloud is too slow. Come ride my Flying Centipede."

Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in a respectful bow. "Then I thank you, Senior."

The middle-aged cultivator quickly demurred. "We are both Foundation Establishment cultivators. I hardly qualify as your senior."

Ning Zhuo chose a seat, and the cultivator stomped his foot. The Flying Centipede spread its wings and soared into the sky with remarkable speed.

The middle-aged cultivator stomped his foot again, activating array patterns on the seat that formed a luminous barrier, blocking the mountain wind and swirling mist.

He explained, "Before each Flying Cloud Assembly, the Main Mountain Gate is flooded with cultivators seeking to rent Cave Residences."

"I've been swamped with work these past few days, yet the tasks keep piling up."

"That's why we need to save as much travel time as possible."

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, if you find a place you like, you should rent it quickly. Someone else might snatch it up in the next moment. Not everyone conducts on-site inspections; some make their decisions by reviewing Jade Slips in the hall."

Ning Zhuo quickly thanked him for the reminder and slipped ten mid-grade spirit stones into his hand.

The middle-aged cultivator's demeanor instantly warmed, his smile now noticeably more sincere.

Moments later, the Flying Centipede landed, and they arrived at their first Cave Residence.

"This is Spirit Wind Slope, with eight Cave Residences in total. The one we're viewing is the most luxurious of the eight."

The middle-aged cultivator pointed to the uppermost cave and activated his token, opening the entrance barrier.

The cave entrance was wide and unobstructed, allowing sunlight to pour in, bathing the interior stone walls in a warm, jade-like glow.

The two entered the cave.

Inside, the cave was dry and clean, furnished with a stone table and benches. Shallow natural niches in the walls served as shelves for books and other items.

At the rear of the cave, a stone well held icy, heart-piercingly cold water.

The middle-aged cultivator said, "This Cave Residence isn't large, but it's more than enough for one person."

"Look at this view - it's magnificent."

The two stood at the entrance, gazing out at the vista.

The view was indeed expansive, stretching across a gentle slope covered in lush green grass, dotted with star-like clusters of butter-yellow wildflowers.

The white clouds drifting high above were sparse and serene, allowing brilliant sunlight to stream through in occasional radiant pillars, bright yet not blinding.

A mighty mountain wind surged from the horizon, whipping their robes into a frenzy and filling their minds with invigorating clarity.

The middle-aged cultivator smiled. "The layout is open and airy, the view is unparalleled, and the sunlight is abundant - ideal for cultivating a vast and righteous Qi within one's heart. At dawn, you can witness the sun rising through swirling clouds and vibrant mists; at night, you can reach out and pluck the stars from the sky."

"The monthly rent is fifty mid-grade spirit stones, which is slightly higher than average. However, the extra cost covers the artificial spirit well. Overall, it's quite a reasonable price."

Ning Zhuo nodded calmly, his expression serene. "Spirit Wind Slope inherently lacks spiritual veins, hence the construction of the Spirit Well to generate additional Qi."

"While the scenery here is indeed expansive, the relentless mountain winds act like a sieve, constantly dispersing the Qi that gathers here."

The middle-aged cultivator's expression stiffened. "Fellow Daoist Ning's assessment is insightful."

Ning Zhuo turned to him with a smile. "Examining just this one Cave Residence confirms that choosing to inspect the sites in person was the right decision. Please lead the way."

The cultivator's demeanor softened, and he forced a smile. "Fellow Daoist Ning, this way."

The two departed on a Flying Centipede, landing next at a mountain valley.

The crimson cliffs glowed as if forged in flames. Even before approaching, a wave of warmth washed over them. Within the valley, several slender Fire Veins flowed visibly between the rocks, distorting the air with their heat and casting a ruby-like glow.

"This is Cave Dwelling A-D in Cracked Fire Valley," the cultivator announced, opening the protective barrier and gesturing for Ning Zhuo to enter.

The cave was carved into a massive red cliff face.

Though the entrance was narrow, the interior revealed a hidden world divided into two chambers.

The outer stone chamber was dry and warm, its walls faintly radiating spiritual light - all Fire Spirit Stones.

The inner chamber was a natural fire chamber extending deep into the earth's veins. At its center, a perfectly circular fire pit had been carved, from which the muffled pulse of subterranean fire emanated, radiating astonishing heat.

Formation patterns and talismans adorned the walls. The former guided the fire's flow, while the latter controlled its intensity, proving invaluable for refining medicinal pills and forging magic artifacts.

The middle-aged cultivator pointed at the fire pit, his face glowing in the crimson light. "Fellow Daoist Ning, observe this Fire Vein. Though not top-tier, its stability and controllability are unmatched. The Formation at the pit's mouth is both stable and intricate, allowing precise mastery of the flames with minimal practice."

"With this subterranean fire at your disposal, refining ordinary Medicinal Pills and tempering entry-level Magic Artifacts becomes twice as efficient! The monthly fee is eighty mid-grade spirit stones, but its value justifies the cost."

Compared to his earlier exaggerated claims, his tone now carried a practical, matter-of-fact sincerity.

Ning Zhuo circled the inner chamber, his expression impassive. "Yet there are no Formations on these walls. The Formation at the fire pit merely guides the flow, while the talismans control the flames, but neither can contain the pervasive heat."

"Therefore, this Cave Residence is suitable only for fire-attribute cultivators or those with exceptionally resilient constitutions. Ordinary cultivators residing here would inevitably suffer from mental agitation due to the oppressive heat. Moreover, being deep within the earth's veins, the Qi is stifling. Without a genuine dedication to refining pills or forging artifacts, this place would become a torment."

"Uh," the middle-aged cultivator muttered, speechless. He had to admit Ning Zhuo's words held merit.

The two resumed their journey, mounting the Flying Centipede and soaring to a secluded peak.

The area was cool and tranquil, with ancient trees reaching for the sky and vines hanging like curtains. The towering mountain blocked the sun, leaving only crisp, filtered light to pierce through the foliage, casting dappled shadows across the ground.

The humid air carried the distinctive fragrance of vegetation and damp earth, along with a refreshing coolness that quickly dispelled the lingering heat from their time in Cracked Fire Valley.

The middle-aged cultivator shook his waist token, causing the emerald vines to rise like a rolled-up curtain, revealing the Cave Residence.

Inside, the light was dim but not gloomy, instead evoking a profound sense of tranquility.

The cave was deep, its cool, smooth stone walls cold to the touch.

Above, clear mountain spring water seeped through natural fissures in the rock, dripping steadily into a small, mirror-smooth stone pool below. The rhythmic drip-drip-drip echoed like the tinkling of jade pendants.

A ring of moss grew around the pool's edge, clearly cultivated with spiritual intelligence, emitting a faint glow and a subtle aura of Qi.

At the cave's deepest point lay a spacious chamber containing a flat, jade-like stone bed.

The middle-aged cultivator knew Ning Zhuo was approachable but firm in his decisions, so he kept the introduction brief: "Fellow Daoist Ning, as you can see, this Cave Residence is secluded and tranquil, with a refreshing coolness. The arrangement of the dripping spring and stone pool is tailored to the environment, and the clear, rhythmic drips aid in meditation and focus. The monthly rent is thirty mid-grade spirit stones - quite reasonable."

He had braced himself for rejection, but to his surprise, Ning Zhuo took a liking to this ordinary Cave Residence for some reason and declared, "This will do."

Startled, the cultivator quickly retrieved a Jade Slip to register the agreement and drafted a contract, requesting three months' rent upfront. "Any overpayment will be refunded, and any shortfall will be settled later, Fellow Daoist Ning. I'll take my leave now."

"Farewell," Ning Zhuo replied, escorting the cultivator to the cave entrance before stopping.

As the cultivator flew away from the small peak, Ning Zhuo remained standing at the entrance, gazing into the distance.

Across from the small peak stood a taller, more majestic mountain.

On the sunlit side of the mountain, a small lake lay still and serene, its surface like a jade mirror. Ning Zhuo knew this lake was called Jade Lake. Beneath its waters lay a Cave Residence named Jade Rinse Retreat, which had once belonged to his late mother, Meng Yaoyin.

After Meng Yaoyin's death, her soul lamp at the Myriad Manifestations Sect had extinguished. According to sect rules, her possessions, including the Cave Residence, were to be sealed for a hundred years, reserved for her blood descendants or a specially recruited successor.

Once the hundred years had passed, the Myriad Manifestations Sect reclaimed the Cave Residence.

Of course, this privilege was reserved for Golden Core True Disciples.

In her Jade Slip, Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin stated that most of her belongings were stored in her Cave Residence, the Jade Rinse Retreat.

However, she had also rented another Cave Residence on the opposite mountain peak under a different name. Using clever methods, she had secretly carved through the mountain rock to create a hidden teleportation array. This array provided direct access to the Jade Rinse Retreat.

The information Jade Slip Ning Zhuo had acquired clearly outlined the procedure. As a successor, inheriting a predecessor's Cave Residence and belongings required strict review by the Hall of Internal Affairs.

This review process was notoriously complex and time-consuming.

The successor first had to prove their identity. The Hall of Internal Affairs would then delegate the investigation to the Hall of External Affairs. The Hall of External Affairs would dispatch cultivators to conduct the investigation, who would travel long distances to gather evidence and return their findings. The Hall of External Affairs would then forward the results to the Hall of Internal Affairs.

Only after the Hall of Internal Affairs confirmed the findings as accurate would they initiate the process of transferring the assets.

This entire procedure often took at least half a year. And that didn't even account for the delays caused by the external investigation itself, which could be further prolonged by unexpected events.

Realizing this, Ning Zhuo decided to sneak in first and secure the assets.

To prevent the Great Serpent Scythe from acting up, he was instructed to immediately burn the relics. However, Ning Zhuo was still waiting for the Hall of External Affairs' investigation report.

Ning Zhuo activated the protective barrier and lowered the vine curtain, completely concealing the entrance to his Cave Residence.

He ventured deep into the cave, lifted his robes, and revealed the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon at his waist. He released Sun Lingtong, Qing Chi, and Old Chef.

Sun Lingtong, who had grown restless from confinement, leaped excitedly onto solid ground.

Old Chef, ever composed, sought Ning Zhuo's permission before heading to another chamber to begin preparing a meal.

Qing Chi, however, remained by Ning Zhuo's side, her gaze fixed on him.

"Miss Qing Chi," Ning Zhuo asked, "why are you staring at me like that?"

A flicker of light crossed her eyes. "We've been apart for so long, Young Master. I've missed you dearly and simply want to look at you."

Though she had lost her memories, Qing Chi retained her straightforward and candid manner.

Ning Zhuo sighed deeply. "Miss Qing Chi, I've already told you the truth. Your feelings are based on a misunderstanding."
