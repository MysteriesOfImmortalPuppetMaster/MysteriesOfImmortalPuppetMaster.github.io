Chapter 632: Cloud Net Demonic Garment

"What?!" The Scarlet Ghost General, who had arrived moments later, could hardly believe her eyes.

Among the six Ghost Generals who had breached the Immortal City, the Long Axe Ghost General was considered one of the strongest. Yet he had been slain without even blocking a single strike!

Terrifying!

Just moments ago, the Scarlet Ghost General had shared the same murderous intent and grand ambitions as the fallen Long Axe Ghost General.

Now, her heart filled with terror, her Wailing Soul trembling, she turned tail and fled.

In the next instant, she truly did turn tail.

The Scarlet Ghost General perished.

"Mother!" Ning Zhuo cried out urgently.

He grasped Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's free hand, his face etched with worry.

He knew all too well that Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's condition was precarious. This "awakened" state came at a severe cost to her spiritual energy.

Ning Zhuo would rather endure the bitterest of battles himself than see his mother's spiritual energy damaged.

As if reading his thoughts, Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin smiled reassuringly. "This Paper Giant was my creation," she explained. "I'd laid preparations here, so when activated, it 'awakened' me."

"This state won't last. I must return to 'slumber' to immerse myself in Strange Path cultivation."

Ning Zhuo's curiosity got the better of him. "Mother, you're cultivating Strange Path?"

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin nodded. "Exactly. Only by mastering this path can one cure Dao injuries. The spiritual energy within me now far surpasses what I remembered in my past life."

"I suspect it must be the Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra, isn't it? Did you learn it from the Lava Immortal Palace?"

Ning Zhuo nodded. "Mother, you guessed correctly! Though I haven't fully become the mastere of the Lava Immortal Palace yet, I've devised a plan. I haven't brought shame upon you!"

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin smiled warmly. "My dear child, we owe everything to you."

"As a mother, I too have never abandoned my efforts."

Ning Zhuo's eyes reddened, his voice thick with emotion as he choked back tears. "Mother, I'm doing well. For you, I'd do anything!"

The Buddha Doctor nodded again. "I've just used the scythe, which counts as practical application of Strange Path."

"This path is indeed extremely difficult to cultivate, but I've made some progress."

"My son, I truly need you to gather spiritual energy for me. The main area I operated in during my lifetime was the Flying Cloud Kingdom."

"The Myriad Manifestations Sect was my sect. If you could join them, that would be ideal."

Ning Zhuo suddenly remembered something crucial. His brow furrowed as a murderous intent surfaced. "Mother, I encountered the Chaos Fate Sect! Were they the ones who harmed you? I'll avenge you!"

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin said, "Indeed, there are my enemies within the Chaos Fate Sect. I perished due to one of their schemes."

"I cannot reveal this person's name yet. The time is not right. With your current Foundation Establishment cultivation, you're still too weak."

"Early knowledge would alert them - highly inadvisable!"

"Moreover, you must avoid all matters related to the Chaos Fate Sect. Keep your distance."

"Mother," Ning Zhuo asked, "when will I be strong enough to avenge you? When can I actively confront Chaos Fate Sect affairs?"

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin first furrowed her brow, then counted on her fingers. A mysterious smile appeared. "This moment will arrive sooner than you imagine."

"It will refine you further, granting you profound breakthroughs in temperament."

Ning Zhuo's eyes widened. "Mother! You understand Destiny Dao? How come I didn't know? Can you teach me?"

He tilted his head, his black-and-white eyes brimming with scholarly curiosity.

Seeing Ning Zhuo's eager anticipation, Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin chuckled. "Not everyone can grasp Destiny Dao, you know."

"Little Zhuo, your life is exceptionally unique. Destiny Dao itself shies away from you."

Ning Zhuo, not understanding, asked, "Shies away? Destiny shies away from me?"

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin gently stroked Ning Zhuo's large head once more. "To be precise, it's Destiny Dao that's avoiding you. The destiny of Heaven and Earth has its own arrangements. It won't let you learn about Destiny Dao, lest it bring terrifying consequences."

Ning Zhuo's eyes widened. "Huh?!"

He quickly reconsidered. "But I really want to learn! Why can't I? Hmph, I'll just follow the example of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. What's wrong with defying fate occasionally? Every bit of knowledge gained is worth it!"

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin laughed heartily. "What ambition! You truly live up to being my child. You're right - even if life goes smoothly, it would become boringly predictable."

"Go ahead and try. I believe that through persistent effort, you'll eventually achieve your goal."

Ning Zhuo nodded vigorously. "Right!"

His mind was bursting with things he wanted to tell his mother, but when the moment came, his thoughts tangled like a knotted rope. Overwhelmed by joy, he even forgot they were on a battlefield!

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, however, remained vigilant. "Little Zhuo, this isn't the time for mother-son chatter."

"This incident concerns the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme. If he succeeds, it will bring calamity upon all living beings. The entire Ghostly Black Marshlands would fall."

"Let me take the main formation position. I'll deal with the two obstructive Dead Bone Giant Spirits outside first."

Ning Zhuo immediately stepped aside. "Alright, Mother, I'll stand guard for you!"

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin sighed. "You've truly grown up. Now your mother can rely on you. However, while you're standing guard, prepare the Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra. When the time comes, you must burn this Paper Giant."

Ning Zhuo: "Huh?"

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin didn't explain further. With a solemn expression, she slowly closed her eyes, focusing completely on controlling the Paper Giant.

From within the Paper Giant emerged numerous Paper Puppets.

Under Meng Yaoyin's manipulation, these puppets began working together to repair the Formation inside.

Ning Zhuo's divine sense detected this scene, causing his heart to pound violently.

This was far too difficult!

Even if Ning Zhuo himself tried with full effort, he couldn't understand the Formation, let alone repair it.

Of course, this Paper Giant had been set up by Meng Yaoyin during her lifetime, so she naturally understood these Formations. But she was actually controlling over a hundred Paper Puppets simultaneously while repairing the Formation.

The difficulty of such operation, the mental energy consumed, and the depth of Formation mastery required were all incredibly massive!

"Even if I understood the profound principles of these Formations, I could only control two Paper Puppets for repairs at most!"

"Mother's mechanism control skills are actually this high? It's almost terrifying."

Ning Zhuo was awestruck.

At the same time, new worries flooded his mind—such astonishing manipulation by Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin must be draining her spiritual energy to catastrophic levels!

"Mother, is this truly worth it?" he asked from the heart, unwilling to see his mother exhaust herself so.

The Formation within the Paper Giant was swiftly restored.

On one hand, this demonstrated Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's astonishing mastery of mechanisms and Formations. On the other, it benefited from the Long Axe and Scarlet Ghost Generals' single-minded focus on breaking through from within—by capturing the king first, they had neglected to destroy the Formation.

The Formation hummed to life, its power coalescing.

On the battlefield, the Paper Giant strained to rise, its chest heaving as it regained its footing!

A faint white glow enveloped its body, the previous breaches rapidly mending until it stood flawless once more.

This spectacle immediately drew the Underworld Army's attention!

In Luo Si's command tent:

"Disaster!" Xie Sichao's face paled. "The names of the Long Axe and Scarlet Ghost Generals have been crossed out in the military roster."

The two generals had fallen in battle.

Luo Si barked orders: "Deploy the remaining Dead Bone Giant Spirits against the Paper Giant. Have the Vanguard General and others concentrate their full strength on it!"

The remaining two Dead Bone Giant Spirits continued their destructive rampage, waiting for the Long Axe and Scarlet Ghost Generals to collapse the Paper Giant from within.

The sudden demise of the two generals caught the Underworld Army completely off guard.

After all, they had assumed that even if the Paper Giant's defenses proved exceptional, once the Long Axe and Scarlet generals fell into disadvantage, reinforcements would be ready to assist.

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's sudden awakening unleashed devastating combat prowess, instantly eliminating the two generals and plunging the Underworld Army into strategic disarray at this critical point.

Luo Si's command was flawless and impeccably timed.

The two Dead Bone Giant Spirits lumbered forward, their footsteps shaking the earth with thunderous booms as they closed in on the Paper Giant from either flank.

Simultaneously, Nascent Soul-level enemies led by the Vanguard General launched their assault.

"Disaster!" Tie Guzheng's eyes blazed with fury, but there were no troops left to deploy.

The City Lord's Paper Puppet Avatar had been driving the Four Ghost Generals into retreat. Glancing back at the endangered Paper Giant, she whirled around and poured all her strength into a desperate strike against the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.

Qing Chi, leading the Qing-Jiao Army, was locked in a bitter struggle with the Headless Ghost Riders. When she spotted the Paper Giant's peril, panic and fury surged through her as she raced to the rescue. But the saying held true - distant waters cannot quench immediate fires.

As the Paper Giant teetered on the brink of destruction, Ning Zhuo involuntarily held his breath.

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's divine sense transmitted a thought: "Little Zhuo, observe carefully now. This technique is called the Cloud Net Demonic Garment."

In the next instant, the Paper Giant's body erupted with blinding white radiance. The luminous beams pierced the heavens, triggering celestial phenomena.

Clouds materialized from nothingness, swirling and surging toward the colossal figure. They rapidly coalesced into a Cloud Net Demonic Garment - a celestial attire that defied classification. Neither mist nor gauze, it shimmered like ice silk yet harbored needle-like prisms within its fabric.

As the Paper Giant moved, the cloud garment flowed in tandem - embodying both the softness of drifting clouds and the sharpness of piercing needles!

The Paper Giant's aura surged violently, its combat prowess exponentially increasing!

Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin secretly instructed Ning Zhuo, "This is the Cloud Net Demonic Garment. Its white clouds serve as fabric, while Profound Needles form its essence. When gentle, it cascades like the Milky Way's silver stream; when enraged, it blankets the heavens with demonic energy!

"To cultivate this technique, two key principles must be mastered:

"First, the Nine Transformations of the Cloud Sea: Gathering, Dispersing, Surging, Falling, Flowing, Condensing, Rupturing, Burning, and Annihilating. By channeling cloud intent into your meridians, the demonic garment can breathe life into the heavens. When struck, it absorbs massive forces like cotton; when counterattacking, it crushes enemies like a raging river.

"Second, manipulating demonic energy. By infusing any type of demonic energy into the cloud network, each strand can condense into a Profound Needle - razor-sharp and barbed like a hedgehog's quills, achieving perfect unity between offense and defense.

"Little Zhuo, once you enter the Myriad Manifestations Sect, you may study the Cloud Chapter and Condensing Garment Art, then apply these principles with demonic energy.

"The Cloud Chapter states: 'Ride the righteous currents of the Nine Heavens' drifting clouds, let the ever-changing clouds manifest three thousand forms...'

"The Condensing Garment Art contains a verse that says:

"With soul as shuttle, I draw the heavenly wind,
Extracting thunder fiends to weave my pattern.
A single thought summons clouds to veil golden halls,
A thousand calamities guard the spiritual core."

"So, the Cloud Net Demonic Garment is fundamentally not a spell, but a divine art! It merely employs fiendish energy, making it appear like a spell on the surface."

"The most crucial part is the Cloud Net Grand Canon, left behind by the ancient sage of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Cloud Demonic Daoist. He said: 'The Cloud Net is no net, but the manifestation of Heavenly Dao's compassion. The Demonic Garment is no garment, but the transformation of Heaven and Earth's inverted scales!' This single statement already reveals the core secret of the Cloud Net Demonic Garment!"

Ning Zhuo unconsciously pricked up his ears, listening intently and committing every word to memory without missing a beat.

As the teachings continued, the Dead Bone Giant Spirit had already closed in.

Under Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's control, the Paper Giant first met the attack by moving to the left.

It didn't dodge at all, countering attack with attack!

When the Dead Bone Giant Spirit's massive fist struck the Cloud Net Demonic Garment, it immediately triggered the flowing cloud layers to stretch and contract, guiding, diverting, and absorbing the enemy's tremendous force. In the end, only ten percent of the original power reached the Paper Giant's True Form, which then distributed the impact across its entire body.

On the Paper Giant's fists, the Cloud Net Demonic Garment had concentrated a large amount of fiendish energy Profound Needles.

Two fists struck the Dead Bone Giant Spirit, shattering its skeletal frame like dry reeds. The Profound Needles pierced through the giant's bones effortlessly, followed by immense force that crushed the entire skeleton.

Both fists tore completely through the Dead Bone Giant Spirit's body, sending it staggering to the ground in critical condition.

A fierce wind whipped at their backs.

The Paper Giant Colossus turned to evade, then seized the opportunity to counterattack.

With a sweeping arm motion, the Demonic Needle shifted instantly to its forearm, slicing through the Dead Bone Giant Spirit's torso like a guillotine blade.

The Vanguard General and other Nascent Soul cultivators stared in disbelief at this sight!

The Paper Giant Colossus's combat capabilities had undergone an astonishing transformation!

What exactly was happening here?

The Paper Giant Colossus planted its foot on the Dead Bone Giant Spirit's head, grinding it into dust.

The Cloud Net Demonic Garment billowed around the colossus, white clouds swirling like a ceaseless river.

Both sides of the battlefield turned to stare in awe.

"Excellent!" Tie Guzheng exclaimed, delighted.

Yang Sanyan also let out a sigh of relief.

"Truly worthy of Little Zhuo!"

"My Jiao Ma is the best!"

Sun Lingtong and Qing Chi's faces lit up with joy, all traces of worry vanished.

The Paper Doll Clone's eyes flashed with lethal intent, forcing the four Golden Core Ghost Generals into a desperate struggle, their backs drenched in cold sweat as they narrowly avoided destruction.

The Paper Doll Clone seized the opening, repelling one of the generals and finally charging in to strike down the immobile Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.

A Nascent Soul-level Ghost General intervened at the critical moment, blocking the Paper Doll Clone's path.

The Paper Doll Clone burned with fury!

She knew that had been a high-grade opportunity. Missed now, it would likely never come again.

As expected, the Vanguard General also reacted, immediately dispatching reinforcements to support the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.

Ning Zhuo's gaze turned toward the situation. "Mother, we should swiftly eliminate that Ghost Cultivator controlling the candle. Cut off their teleportation route!"

Ning Zhuo wanted to provide support, but Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin said, "I need to conserve my strength, Little Zhuo."

"We've already suppressed the enemy."

"If I exert myself too much, my remaining conscious time will drastically shorten."

"Don't worry about that. The City Lord's True Form will inevitably act!"

"You can begin preparing your spell to burn down this Paper Giant."

"Already?" Ning Zhuo exclaimed in surprise.

In the next moment, the entire city shook as a flood surged forth. The Ink River roared, and the Yin Tide surged violently!

The South City Gate suddenly closed, and the White Paper Immortal City began to ascend!
