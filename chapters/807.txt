Chapter 807: Heart Fire Element

The competition venue for the Heart Fire Element was set up in a valley at the bottom of a cliff.

Twilight closed in from all sides, the fading sunlight sinking behind a thousand peaks.

Seventy-two Glazed Lamps reflected gold upon the cold pool, where hidden orchids wept dew.

Li Guanyu, dressed in green robes, leaned against a pine branch, his jade ruler gently tapping a bronze bell held in his sleeve.

The sound of the bell settled the atmosphere, and Li Guanyu spoke: "Gentlemen, you have passed the first three trials for spiritual paper. You should know that the method of manufacturing spiritual paper lies in rectifying one's nature and understanding the Heavenly Dao. However, the Heart Fire Element to be refined today requires introducing exotic materials of the Strange Path into orthodox painting and calligraphy."

"Exotic materials devour the heart, much like holding a double-edged blade. If your divine sense wavers, your physical body may produce anomalies. You should follow the wisdom of the ancient sages who severed their arms..."

Rarely using such a solemn tone, Li Guanyu informed everyone in advance of the areas requiring special attention.

Unlike the previous spiritual papers, the Heart Fire Element employed materials from the Strange Path. The more these materials were used, the more negative effects they would have on a cultivator's body and mind.

Li Guanyu continued to explain the method for making the Heart Fire Element: "The Heart Fire Element is the essence soul of the Li Palace and the strange substance of Bing and Ding. It has no constant form, and its nature is impermanent. It is the wandering dust of the Great Void formed by the clash of Yin and Yang..."

The cultivators pricked up their ears, focusing their entire attention on listening carefully.

Gu Qing stood with downcast eyes. While listening to the refining method of the Heart Fire Element and comparing it with the knowledge in his heart to check for discrepancies, he also used his divine sense to observe the various materials before him.

The materials were divided into three categories, placed distinctly apart.

The first category was Confucian cultivator materials.

There was an Asking Heart Lotus with seven petals. This type of spiritual material grew in the waters of the Literary Qi Pool, bathed in the chanting of Confucian scholars, taking three hundred years to bloom seven petals. The petals appeared jade-like; under the sun, they revealed the micro-seal scripts of Confucian classics, and under the moon and dew, one could hear the chanting of sages.

There was a handful of Clarity Grid Grass. No more than three inches high, with nine leaves growing in a ring. The leaf veins formed a silver chessboard grid, and characters could be written inside each grid. It was a natural treasure for making spiritual paper.

There was also a bottle of Literary Heart Tears. This was no ordinary dew, but essence tears produced from the Literary Heart of a Confucian cultivator when their emotions reached their peak. Shaped like amber and containing a rainbow glow, shaking it would reveal flowing phantoms of classics like the Classic of Poetry and the Book of Documents.

The second category was exotic materials of the Strange Path.

There were several Chaotic Ink Stones. They were as large as sparrow eggs. At the Yin hour (3-5 AM), they were as soft as taffy; at the Wu hour (11 AM-1 PM), they were harder than Profound Iron; at the You hour (5-7 PM), they oozed bloody ink; and at the Zi hour (11 PM-1 AM), they suddenly sprouted bone spikes.

There was Delusional Spider Silk, so fine it was imperceptible. Only at the Zi hour, when a cultivator's pupils dilated, could it be seen drifting like a wandering soul. It felt ice-cold to the touch, but after three breaths, it would generate a burning pain.

There was also Inverted Cinnabar, colored like a coagulated blood scab. It looked normal to the naked eye, but reflected in water or a mirror, it revealed its true form: the reflection in water writhed like a living creature, while the reflection in a mirror emitted a confusing seven-colored smoke.

The last category was conventional auxiliary materials.

There was a bowl of Rootless Water. The alms bowl was pure silver, engraved with the map of the Twenty-Eight Mansions. When the water swayed, thunder patterns faintly appeared. It could be stored for three years without spoiling.

There was Jade Marrow Powder. The powder revealed gold specks and starlight when exposed to light, and if scattered into the wind, it would rise in the shape of a phoenix.

There was also Five-Colored Spirit Soil, already roughly proportioned according to the numerology of East-Three, South-Four, West-Six, North-One, and Central-Nine, suitable for harmonizing Yin and Yang and the Five Elements.

The pine branch trembled slightly. Li Guanyu tapped his jade ruler, and the seventy-two Glazed Lamps suddenly brightened three degrees. "Begin."

As his voice fell, Gu Qing immediately set to work.

Confucian Technique - Investigation of Things to Extend Knowledge!

In an instant, his eyes burst with brilliance, and literary Qi surged, billowing his robes.

In his Upper Dantian, the Divine Sea, a Literary Palace stood tall. The phantom image of the Asking Heart Lotus formed rapidly, becoming detailed and concrete at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Immediately after, the nine-leaf chessboard grid of the Clarity Grid Grass unfolded layer by layer, and the phantom of the Literary Heart Tears was dissected into seven-colored rainbow light.

Gu Qing was a genuine Confucian cultivator and a genius known throughout the country. In his eyes, these orthodox Confucian materials were like disassembled fine-brush line drawings; every stroke and flow of ink was clearly distinguishable.

He understood them too well.

As for the conventional auxiliary ingredients, he also finished inspecting them quickly, like a master butcher dissecting an ox: "The Rootless Water has complete thunder patterns of the Zhen trigram, the gold specks in the Jade Marrow Powder are top quality, and the Five-Colored Spirit Soil implicitly matches the numbers of the River Map. All excellent."

However, when his divine sense touched the Strange Path materials and attempted to analyze them...

In Gu Qing's Literary Palace, the condensation speed of the material phantoms plummeted immediately.

Crack. A pillar inside the Literary Palace suddenly twisted into a spiral shape.

First was the Chaotic Ink Stone.

As soon as its phantom appeared, it exuded a murderous intent as thick as smoke. Shortly after, it suddenly turned into a madness as hard as Profound Iron.

Then came the Delusional Spider Silk.

Countless thoughts rose and fell, manifesting in the Divine Sea of Gu Qing's Upper Dantian, then recklessly washing around, shaking his towering Literary Palace until it tottered.

Finally, the Inverted Cinnabar.

Layers of phantom illusions appeared before Gu Qing's eyes. His five senses were inverted and chaotic; although he was standing still on stone ground, it felt as if he were falling into an abyss, his whole body freezing cold.

Gu Qing lowered his head and couldn't help but let out a muffled grunt, a few traces of blood bursting from the corners of his eyes.

Many of these phantoms of the Strange Path materials had solidified, but there was ultimately still some distance from the actual objects.

Gu Qing knew this well: it was always like this when involving treasures of the Strange Path. Unless one was a cultivator specializing in the Strange Path, no one from any other school could fully analyze Strange Path materials thoroughly.

Gu Qing began to process the materials.

This time, he was more prepared, and three magic artifacts flew out from his sleeves.

A Green Jade Roller hung over the Asking Heart Lotus. As the roller turned, the petals peeled off on their own, their jade-like quality turning into a milky white slurry.

A Silver Wire Sieve covered the Clarity Grid Grass. Amidst the vibration of the sieve, the nine leaves turned into silver powder.

Gu Qing chanted incantations, and the Literary Heart Tears cracked upon hearing the sound. Rainbow light flowed like a stream into the slurry of the first two materials, instantly emitting the sound of clear reading.

He continued to process the auxiliary materials: flicking the rim of the bowl, the Twenty-Eight Mansions map lit up in sequence, and thunder-patterned water droplets fell like a pearl curtain into the Jade Marrow Powder. The peach wood pestle flew up on its own to pound...

The entire movement was smooth and flowing.

But upon touching the Strange Path exotic materials, Gu Qing's movements stagnated, losing his previous demeanor.

While processing the Chaotic Ink Stone, it suddenly oozed bloody ink. The ink traces crawled like a centipede along Gu Qing's arm toward his heart.

Gu Qing dared not be careless and hurriedly pinched finger seals to suppress it. An absurd thought inexplicably floated in his Divine Sea: "If I cut off my left little toe and throw it into the paper-making, perhaps I can refine a rare treasure?"

He suppressed the thought, finished processing the Ink Stone, and started on the Delusional Spider Silk.

His nerves were plucked fiercely like lute strings, bringing a burning pain deep in his mind. Every burn generated a false memory - for instance, being drugged by his brothers and ruthlessly exploited while unconscious, or being a wild boar fighting for food in a stone trough, grunting loudly...

After processing the three Strange Path exotic materials, Gu Qing gritted his teeth, his body covered in sweat, his expression twisted.

He had to stop, sitting down cross-legged on the spot to circulate his main cultivation method.

Soon, spiritual energy surged within him, and his body rapidly relaxed.

After three cycles, he opened his eyes again. The bloodshot redness in his eyes had faded, and his body had almost returned to its former state, but a faint gray line had appeared on his forehead.

Gu Qing's divine sense enveloped his whole body, pausing on the faint gray line.

He knew the secret behind this well: "I am not a Strange Path cultivator. When processing such materials, both body and mind suffer the erosion of Strange Path principles."

"This erosion of principles is temporary. As long as I circulate my main cultivation method in time, I can replace these principles."

"However, some Strange Path principles still remain and need more time to be cleared and replaced."

"This is water-grinding work, consuming time and effort. It is not something that can be done right now."

With great difficulty, all the materials in Gu Qing's hands turned into a pool of seven-colored paper pulp. The refining of the Heart Fire Element spiritual paper had finally reached the last pass.

The Literary Heart in Gu Qing's Lower Dantian Essence Sea trembled, shooting out a stream of essence blood.

The essence blood spread out in mid-air, turning into a cloud of blood mist.

The moment the blood mist fell into the paper pulp, the slurry suddenly boiled!

The boiling slurry went completely out of control. First, it condensed into a crying face, then collapsed into a funnel shape, and then a three-legged ink crow actually crawled out, flapping its wings as if to fly.

Finally, this batch of paper pulp turned pitch black and solidified. It looked like something forcibly pieced together from a crying face, a funnel, and a crow - extremely strange and ugly.

Gu Qing's heart inevitably sank.

He had failed his first wave of paper-making today.

"I have done everything in place where I can control it."

"But regarding the Strange Path aspect, I can only leave it to Qi Luck."

When designing with Strange Path materials, the success rate never reaches one hundred percent. Even if Zhao Hansheng were to operate it personally, it would be the same. It’s just that his failure probability would be much lower than Gu Qing's.

"So, how is Ning Zhuo doing?" In Gu Qing's heart, Ning Zhuo was already his greatest enemy.

His divine sense scanned the rear and saw that Ning Zhuo was still processing materials.

Gu Qing observed for a while and found that Ning Zhuo's techniques were simple and his movements unskilled; clearly, it was his first time refining.

Seeing this, Gu Qing dared not be careless in the slightest.

"It's like this again," he murmured in his heart.

This similar scene was all too familiar. He had seen it in the previous trials for the Mountain River Page, Star Note Paper, and Righteous Xuan Paper.

Gu Qing adjusted his breathing for a moment before starting the second wave of paper-making.

He succeeded on the second attempt. The spiritual paper was of medium quality.

The third attempt failed again; the paper pulp turned into a puddle of writhing eyeballs, which then disintegrated one by one.

Fourth time, fifth time...

He was getting better.

Before long, more than twenty sheets of Heart Fire Element were stacked beside Gu Qing. The lowest was mid-grade, and there were even three sheets revealing red cloud patterns - verging on high-grade.

"How is Ning Zhuo doing?" Gu Qing looked up again, his pupils shrinking suddenly.

In front of Ning Zhuo, more than thirty sheets of Heart Fire Element were neatly stacked!

"This?!" Gu Qing's heart shook violently.

Having experienced the shocking turn of events with the Righteous Xuan Paper, Gu Qing quickly accepted this fact, while a strong doubt arose in his heart: "How did he do it?"

Gu Qing focused his gaze and immediately discovered that Ning Zhuo's technique was much smoother than the first time he observed. But even so, many details still revealed the unskillfulness of a first contact.

Ning Zhuo's refining speed was not fast, and he had to stop constantly to adjust his breathing midway.

Gu Qing observed for a while but felt that Ning Zhuo was unremarkable, gaining nothing from it.

He had to suppress his doubts and continue making paper.

On the high platform's pine branch, Li Guanyu tapped his knee lightly with the jade ruler, the figures of Gu Qing and Ning Zhuo reflected in his eyes.

"Gu Qing wins in his Confucian foundation. His Literary Heart Blood has a natural affinity for orthodox materials, leading in processing speed by thirty percent."

"Ning Zhuo is obviously refining the Heart Fire Element for the first time. He improves very quickly, and his technique is becoming more practiced, proving that his attainments in artifact refining are quite deep and his basic skills are solid. Therefore, to a considerable extent, he makes up for his lack of experience."

"But the most crucial part is the final step!"

"In 'Essence Blood Form Fixation,' Ning Zhuo's success rate is astonishingly high! He fails at most twice out of ten times, and among the failures, grotesque products of complete alienation rarely appear."

"But how long can this luck of his last?"

Although Ning Zhuo was leading now, Li Guanyu still could not be certain of the final winner of this level.

"Once Strange Path materials are involved, the manufacture of the Heart Fire Element becomes uncontrollable. Especially the last step; even I have to rely on luck."

"Although Ning Zhuo has suppressed Gu Qing for now, this spiritual paper refining competition is actually a different kind of endurance race."

"The degree of Strange Path erosion accumulates constantly."

Thinking of this, other cultivators in the field were already unable to hold on.

In the southeast corner, a cultivator in a yellow shirt suddenly stuffed a Chaotic Ink Stone into his mouth and chewed. He laughed while chewing, bloody ink oozing from between his teeth, then danced, sang, and laughed.

A female cultivator on the west side, while processing Strange Path exotic materials, violently tore open the lapel of her clothes over her left chest, dug her fingertips into her own flesh, and shrieked shrilly.

And an elderly cultivator in the north made a mistake while processing materials; his whole person softened like wax, and his facial features slowly flowed to the back of his head, leaving his original face completely blank.

"Here it comes." Li Guanyu sighed lightly, and the wine gourd in his sleeve flew into the air.

Li Guanyu chanted in a low voice: "Drunkenness holds a vast universe; days and months are long within the pot."

Liquor sprayed from the gourd. The liquor turned into a mist of azure rain in mid-air.

The misty rain split on its own in the air, falling precisely into the mouths of every cultivator showing anomalies. The rain melted upon touching lips, carrying the richness of aged wine mixed with the charm of Confucian scriptures.

The stone-swallowing cultivator fell backward to the ground, snoring like thunder.

The female cultivator was permeated by the alcohol qi, collapsing to the ground, dead drunk and giggling foolishly.

The back of the old cultivator's head gave a drunken hiccup. Awakening as if from a dream, he frantically used his hands to push his facial features, exerting all his strength in a panic, and finally managed to move his features back to their original positions.

More and more people were experiencing issues. Everyone had their own strange state, almost none of them alike.

Many cultivators realized the bad situation. Recalling Li Guanyu's painstaking advice before the start, those who were rational or fearful stopped one after another.

Ning Zhuo also noticed these circumstances.

He gained a deeper understanding of this paper-making competition: "On the surface, it tests manufacturing techniques, but in reality, it is a greater test of the cultivator's physical body and soul foundation."

Ning Zhuo's physical body had been constantly cultivating, giving him a deep foundation. And his soul, with the "Million Human Soul," had a vigorous accumulation.

These were supporting Ning Zhuo, bringing him powerful assistance.

"There is also the cultivator's technique. The higher the quality of the technique, the more principles it derives, and the better it can replace and wash away the temporary Strange Path principles."

Ning Zhuo once again enjoyed the benefits of the Three Sects' Supreme Methods.

Of course, Gu Qing's technique was not bad either.

Gu Qing kept biting at his heels.

Some time had passed, but Ning Zhuo had not widened the gap with Gu Qing.

Gu Qing was forty or fifty years old. The advantage of age allowed his accumulation of body and soul to surpass Ning Zhuo's somewhat.

Gu Qing also had the advantage of being a Confucian cultivator, and after realizing Ning Zhuo was in the lead, he began taking out medicine bottles and constantly popping pills.

"Do I have to use the other two techniques?" Ning Zhuo hesitated slightly.

If he did that, the secret of his concurrent cultivation of the Three Dantians would very likely be exposed. This would be disadvantageous for him.

Of course, he also knew that this secret could only be maintained for a certain period.

The Myriad Manifestations Sect's investigation into him would definitely trace back to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

"Ideally, before exposure, I can use this information advantage in the martial arena to defeat some genius cultivators."

Just as Ning Zhuo hesitated, a sudden change occurred.

From his storage belt, an invisible suction force was generated.

The suction force only targeted Ning Zhuo's body and mind, specifically the relatively stubborn Strange Path principles that had eroded in.

Almost in the blink of an eye, these Strange Path principles were swept clean!
