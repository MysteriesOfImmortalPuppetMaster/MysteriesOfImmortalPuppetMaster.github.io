Chapter 679: Give Me a Chance to Repay Your Kindness

Qi Deviation!

In an instant, Ning Zhuo sensed Yu Heye's condition.

This was completely unexpected.

He had only intended to gain Yu Heye's attention - or, more precisely, a certain degree of attention.

Yu Heye was a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, and the greatest strength of the Inverted Five Elements Demonic Art lay in combat. This was Yu Heye's most formidable aspect.

If Ning Zhuo were to defeat him in battle, he would inevitably have to reveal some of his trump cards.

Why bother?

Ning Zhuo would never expose his full combat prowess unless absolutely necessary.

There were other ways to gain attention, such as demonstrating his mastery of the Five Elements Realm.

Coincidentally, Yu Heye cultivated the Inverted Five Elements Demonic Art, which naturally fell within the Five Elements domain. Leveraging his superior understanding of the Five Elements Realm to gain Yu Heye's attention would be far more effective than engaging in a martial demonstration.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have been stuck in this predicament. Yu Heye's grasp of the Five Elements Realm was clearly lacking.

From beginning to end, Ning Zhuo had no intention of personally participating in a martial demonstration.

Avoid the enemy's strengths and attack their weaknesses - that is the essence of strategy!

Nor would Ning Zhuo fully reveal his profound mastery of the Five Elements Realm. There was no need. All he needed was to gain Yu Heye's attention and change his attitude.

Under the guise of seeking guidance, Ning Zhuo first inquired about Yu Heye's specific cultivation situation.

On one hand, Ning Zhuo had only studied the Inverted Five Elements Demonic Art theoretically, lacking practical cultivation experience. On the other hand, he needed a deeper understanding of Yu Heye's actual cultivation state.

Fortunately, Yu Heye was forthcoming and truthful, revealing his strengths and weaknesses.

Ning Zhuo quickly discovered that Yu Heye's mastery of the Fire and Wood Elements was the most profound, followed by the Wood Element. His proficiency in the Metal and Earth Elements, however, was severely lacking.

To demonstrate his superior cultivation realm without provoking resentment and to ensure Yu Heye would listen attentively, the most effective approach was altruism.

By offering Yu Heye precisely tailored suggestions regarding his cultivation, Ning Zhuo could provide tangible benefits while forcing Yu Heye to acknowledge his superior power.

This would be a daunting task for most cultivators, but for Ning Zhuo, it was relatively straightforward.

After all, his understanding of the Five Elements Realm was exceptionally profound.

Of course, even such profound knowledge had its limits. While Ning Zhuo could create spells on the spot, he was not yet qualified to develop entirely new Five Elements-based cultivation arts.

The difficulty between these two endeavors was as vast as the heavens and the earth.

Therefore, Ning Zhuo had prepared in advance by purchasing the Inverted Five Elements Demonic Art.

This demonic art was remarkably simple. Ning Zhuo grasped its principles at a glance.

Moreover, he had cultivated the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual, a top-tier Cultivation Art renowned for its ability to balance and harmonize the Five Elements Spiritual Energy. By leveraging the principles of mutual generation and destruction, this art could continuously transform single-element spiritual energy, achieving either multiplication or reduction effects.

With this foundation, Ning Zhuo, after learning the specifics of Yu Heye's situation, devoted himself to devising an improved solution.

In essence, he was creating a patch tailored to Yu Heye's unique circumstances.

Analyze the specific situation, then solve it specifically.

This patch was only suitable for Yu Heye, lacking universal applicability and thus falling far short of a true refinement of the Inverted Five Elements Demonic Art.

Yet Yu Heye was utterly captivated, his mind reeling with overwhelming joy, inevitably sinking his entire being into this solution.

He was ecstatic!

The problem that had plagued him for so long had finally been resolved.

And this solution was so ingenious, so exquisitely tailored to his needs, so perfectly suited to him!

Of course it was. How could a patch custom-made by Ning Zhuo not fit perfectly?

Although Yu Heye's Five Elements Realm was uneven and far inferior to Ning Zhuo's, he was, after all, a primary cultivator of the Inverted Five Elements Demonic Art, possessing a solid foundation in the Five Elements. Therefore, he clearly understood the principles behind Ning Zhuo's demonstrated improvements, recognizing their validity.

"This is right!"

"It can work! It really can work!"

Overwhelmed by genuine joy, Yu Heye lost himself in the moment and impulsively attempted the technique.

The attempt failed.

To some extent, this patch was equivalent to restructuring the flow of spiritual energy within Yu Heye's body. It required extensive preparation and practice, making his impulsive attempt reckless.

Yet Ning Zhuo understood him perfectly.

He had experienced something very similar himself.

While exploring the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, Ning Zhuo had stumbled upon the Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing. He became so engrossed in comprehending it that he forgot the fundamental principle of Three Seas Concurrent Cultivation: that each cultivator must have a primary Cultivation Art.

This oversight led to a backlash, leaving him severely injured.

At the time, his desire to revive his mother had been too urgent. (The primary cause of his declining fortune remained unknown to him.)

Yu Heye's urgency was equally palpable.

The pressure weighing down on him was as heavy as a mountain, pushing him to the brink of despair. He absolutely had to break through to the Nascent Soul Stage.

This patch would drastically improve his condition, increasing his chances of success by at least thirty percent. How could Yu Heye not be ecstatic?

Overwhelmed by joy, he lost all composure.

"I'm going to die!" Yu Heye's mood plummeted from the heavens to the depths of despair in an instant.

Most cultivators would still fight desperately, but Yu Heye had suffered Qi Deviations far too many times. His experience in this area was tragically extensive.

He immediately recognized the reality of his situation: this was a hopeless predicament, a certain death from which there was no escape.

"I never imagined I would die like this!" He lost consciousness.

Ning Zhuo's brow furrowed deeply.

If Yu Heye truly died, things would become much more complicated.

Ning Zhuo's most urgent priority was to enter his mother's cave abode. To achieve this, he needed to start from this mountain peak, taking a shortcut to avoid the lengthy and time-consuming official channels.

If Yu Heye died, the incident would escalate into a major scandal.

The Myriad Manifestations Sect encouraged cultivators to resolve disputes through martial arts competitions, not through such violent means.

This made it easy to suspect that Yu Heye had been ambushed and killed. His death would inevitably trigger an investigation by the Myriad Manifestations Sect, potentially leading to further complications.

As for Shen Xi, he was merely an afterthought. While there was room for development, for now, he served primarily as a facade - useful but ultimately dispensable.

Ning Zhuo scoffed inwardly. "Qi Deviation? Before me? I won't allow you to succumb to Qi Deviation!"

He extended his hand, fingers splayed wide, spiritual energy surging forth, and seized Yu Heye from the air.

He grasped Yu Heye's head in his palm, his fingers clamping down like he was holding a ball.

Yu Heye had completely lost consciousness, lying motionless.

Divine Power One: A Life Hanging by a Thread!

Ning Zhuo peered into Yu Heye's body and discovered a chaotic mess: molten lava erupting from the Heart Palace, poisonous vines piercing the Liver Palace, stagnant water corroding the Kidney Palace, golden blades dancing wildly in the Lung Palace, and the earthen foundation of the Spleen Palace collapsing. The Five Elements Spiritual Energy and vital essence and blood were in utter disarray, entangled like a tangled ball of yarn.

If this continued for even a few more breaths, it would inevitably affect the Reverse Five Elements Golden Core, causing it to self-detonate. The entire cave abode and mountain peak would be annihilated in the resulting explosion.

The destructive power of a Golden Core self-detonation was formidable indeed.

This was especially true for Yu Heye, a Golden Core cultivator renowned for his combat prowess.

Earlier, Qing Yan had self-detonated his Golden Core, managing to withstand a Spatial Storm for a single breath's time, buying Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi the crucial moments they needed to escape.

Ning Zhuo snorted coldly, channeling his divine sense into Yu Heye's body, completely enveloping him. Simultaneously, the Life Hanging by a Thread technique descended like a silken thread, piercing directly into the Reverse Five Elements Golden Core.

In the next instant, Ning Zhuo seized control of the Golden Core, unleashing a torrent of violent Five Elements Spiritual Energy.

The spiritual energy surged wildly, tearing through Yu Heye's body and inflicting grievous wounds.

Blood trickled from the corner of Yu Heye's mouth, his injuries severe.

Yet this brutal counterattack proved immediately effective, temporarily stabilizing his condition, easing the crisis, and buying them precious time.

Ning Zhuo meticulously refined his control, beginning to sculpt the spiritual energy with painstaking precision.

Yu Heye offered no resistance. Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity to put his earlier deduction into practice, initiating a completely new cycle of spiritual energy circulation within Yu Heye's body.

Sweat gradually beaded on Ning Zhuo's forehead. His intense focus rapidly drained his mental reserves.

After a moment, Ning Zhuo exhaled a turbid qi and slowly withdrew his hand.

His face was as pale as paper, his eyes shone like cold stars. He secretly rejoiced, "This is the first time I've ever manipulated another's Golden Core like this."

"The Reverse Five Elements Golden Core is notoriously difficult to control. The spiritual energy it emits naturally mixes the Five Elements, making precise flow regulation impossible."

"Fortunately, I have similar experience..."

Ning Zhuo's experience stemmed from the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel.

This mechanism was the core component of the Black Iron Han Armor. During his fierce battles with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, Ning Zhuo had repeatedly damaged several of these devices.

Frequent use in life-or-death combat had given Ning Zhuo invaluable insights into manipulating Golden Cores.

These insights proved crucial in his struggle to control the Reverse Five Elements Golden Core, allowing him to barely achieve his intended goal.

Ning Zhuo retrieved a meditation cushion and immediately sat cross-legged, closing his eyes. He focused on recuperating while mentally reviewing his experiences, meticulously recording his insights and inspirations.

This practical application had sparked new ideas about the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel.

He committed these ideas to memory, planning to delve into them further when the opportunity arose.

"Perhaps I can refine the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel even further!"

After the time it takes to brew a cup of tea, Yu Heye, who had been lying on the ground, slowly opened his eyes.

"What... happened to me?"

"It hurts!"

"Wait, didn't I die?!" His eyes widened abruptly, and he bolted upright.

A sharp pain shot through him, causing him to gasp for breath.

He instinctively focused his divine sense inward, discovering he was severely injured!

Yet he was overjoyed.

He realized the desperate situation of the reversed Five Elements that had overwhelmed him before his collapse had completely vanished. A new cycle had been established, revolving around the Reverse Five Elements Golden Core, operating autonomously.

The mortal crisis had been averted.

"I'm still alive! I'm actually still alive!"

His gaze abruptly fixed on Ning Zhuo.

Only then did he notice: he was lying on the ground, while Ning Zhuo, the mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, was sitting in his seat, sipping tea and perusing the Cultivation Art Jade Slips on his bookshelf.

Yu Heye blinked several times, his expression a mix of shock and suspicion as he looked at Ning Zhuo. "Did you save me?"

Ning Zhuo glanced at him, his face impassive, and merely hummed in response.

Yu Heye's expression froze, and he suddenly snapped to his senses.

Suppressing the pain, he forced himself to stand. With a solemn expression, he clasped his hands and bowed deeply to Ning Zhuo. "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, I am eternally grateful for your life-saving grace. This Yu will never forget this debt!"

In his mind, he wondered: Had Ning Zhuo acted alone, or had some hidden expert intervened?

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo is only at the Foundation Establishment Stage. Could he truly have resolved my perilous situation?"

"It's more likely that a senior expert is secretly protecting him. His earlier eloquence during our conversation was probably due to the elder's guidance."

Yu Heye had just fainted, completely unaware of his surroundings. Given his life experiences, he could hardly imagine that Ning Zhuo had single-handedly saved him from such a desperate situation.

Regardless of whether it was an elder or Ning Zhuo himself who had intervened, both were his life-saving benefactors.

Maintaining his bowing posture of gratitude, Yu Heye spoke again, expressing his desire to repay Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo secretly felt satisfied. This Yu Heye is surprisingly quick to understand the situation.

This outcome didn't surprise Ning Zhuo.

During his earlier intelligence gathering, he had analyzed Yu Heye's character. The conflict between Yu Heye and the main peak had subjected him to years of suppression. This harsh experience had taught him valuable lessons, fostering a strong sense of self-awareness and a deep understanding of social etiquette.

If Yu Heye had truly acted recklessly, following his whims without restraint, he would have long since courted his own demise and never reached this point.

It was precisely this understanding of Yu Heye's character that had led Ning Zhuo to intervene when the man collapsed unconscious.

"You do indeed need to repay me," Ning Zhuo said, first tossing Yu Heye a Divine Contract. "But before that, sign this."

Yu Heye's heart sank. He had feared it was a contract of servitude.

Even if it were, I'd accept it!

But upon inspection, he discovered it was merely a simple confidentiality agreement.

He immediately signed the contract.

Ning Zhuo smiled. "Fellow Daoist Yu Heye, I have no interest in the mountain peak you've chosen. I wasn't even aware of it beforehand."

"Originally, I planned to take the ten mid-grade spirit stones and leave to rent another cave abode elsewhere."

"Less trouble is always better, after all."

"As a newcomer, I don't want to make enemies so easily."

"But then Shen Xi came to me and told me..."

Ning Zhuo used Shen Xi's request as an excuse.

Yu Heye immediately accepted, nodding repeatedly. "I've long heard of the Shen Clan of Nine Palaces Immortal City. They're renowned throughout the Flying Cloud Kingdom for their mastery of Formations - truly remarkable!"

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, you've achieved extraordinary things at such a young age. Communicating with a genius like Shen Xi is perfectly fitting for you!"

With that, he clasped his hands in a bow. "Then this Yu will immediately pack his belongings and move out with his subordinates."

Ning Zhuo chuckled and waved his hand. "No need, no need. That would be too ostentatious."

"As a newcomer, I don't want to draw too much attention. Let's observe the situation for a while before making any moves."

Yu Heye understood and nodded again, indicating his willingness to follow Ning Zhuo's arrangements.

Ning Zhuo said, "Since I'm leaving, I won't be returning. Let's keep today's events strictly confidential between us."

"I need you to host a banquet for Shen Xi and Su Lingkou, the cousins. During the meal, you and I will converse, maintaining an air of equality."

Yu Heye froze again, stunned.

He had never imagined Ning Zhuo's request would be so simple!

Yet this simplicity only increased his sense of pressure. He first expressed his willingness to fully cooperate with Ning Zhuo, then cautiously added that such an arrangement could never repay the debt of his life.

Ning Zhuo smiled. "The conflict between us is as insignificant as dust. If not for Shen Xi... do you think I would bother with this? If your death before my eyes wouldn't have caused so much trouble and attention, I wouldn't have intervened."

"This is the truth. Please don't take offense."

By now, even though Ning Zhuo was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, he possessed enough confidence to stand as an equal to a Golden Core cultivator like Yu Heye.

Yu Heye opened his mouth to speak, clearly determined to insist.

Seeing this, Ning Zhuo proposed, "How about this? I'll arrange for some of my subordinates to temporarily reside on your mountain. It's not convenient for them to stay by my side right now. Just provide a list of the cave abodes here, and I'll choose a few."

Yu Heye, suspecting nothing, immediately agreed.

By this point, Ning Zhuo had achieved his true objective.

Shortly after, a Flying Message reached Shen Xi.

Shen Xi was discussing the arrangement of a Formation with Su Lingkou when he received the message. A faint smile appeared on his face as he read it. "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo has succeeded."

Su Lingkou extended her divine sense. "Yu Heye is hosting a banquet and specifically invited us, along with Ning Zhuo. How... how did Ning Zhuo manage this?"

Shen Xi quickly reviewed Ning Zhuo's actions in his mind. "He likely persuaded some elders to intervene. This person must be from a major clan!"
