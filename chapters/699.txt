Chapter 699: Studying Xiaohui

"We won!" Su Lingkou cheered excitedly.

"This Mechanical Puppet's combat power is incredible!" Shen Xi thought, deeply shaken.

Having observed the entire battle, he knew the Tiger Demon was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, his combat prowess far surpassing that of ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators.

In his true form as a ferocious tiger, his physical attributes were superhuman. Though his Magic Artifacts were somewhat lacking, falling short of his cultivation level and combat capabilities, this was understandable given his status as a rogue cultivator and Demon Cultivator.

This was the golden age of Cultivation, a world dominated by humans.

The two Demonic Talismans Pi Fujie had bestowed upon the Tiger Demon amplified his combat power by at least five times its original level!

The Thousand-Layer Scale Skin Talisman functioned as an exceptional defensive magic treasure. The Blood-Burning Surge Talisman granted the Tiger Demon wings, dramatically increasing his speed. This speed enhancement wasn't limited to footwork; it encompassed every aspect of his movements - punches, turns, and even the circulation of Qi within his body - providing a comprehensive boost to his agility.

The Shen and Pi Clans were mortal enemies, and Shen Xi was intimately familiar with the power of the Seven Talisman Demonic Skin Sutra.

From the start of the battle, Shen Xi had been apprehensive, specifically warning Ning Zhuo about this. When he saw the Tiger Demon, empowered by the two Demonic Talismans, push Snow-Colored Lady Hui into a disadvantageous position, he wasn't surprised in the slightest.

"But in the end, the Tiger Demon was completely suppressed by this Mechanical Puppet!"

Shen Xi marveled inwardly.

The final freeze had fully revealed Snow-Colored Lady Hui's overwhelming combat power - genuine Golden Core-level strength!

Shen Xi couldn't help but wonder, "Which faction is backing Ning Zhuo? How did they leave him with a Golden Core-level Mechanical Puppet?"

He then pondered which factions in the Flying Cloud Kingdom specialized in mechanisms.

"Is it the Ban Clan? The Xuanji Sword Sect? The Hall of the Compass? Or perhaps Weaving Cloud Loom City?"

Pi Fujie's face was as dark as water.

He stared intently at Snow-Colored Lady Hui, who stood with her head raised, and painfully realized that if he were to fight her himself, he would be locked in a bitter struggle.

"Fortunately, this person's control over mechanisms is lacking. The early stages of the battle flowed smoothly, but when the Tiger Demon used two Demonic Talismans, he panicked and made critical mistakes."

"Even so... this Mechanical Puppet is not to be underestimated!"

"Damn it."

Pi Fujie gritted his teeth inwardly.

Although he believed that Ning Zhuo, as the puppet's controller, was the weakest link and would be his primary target in any future conflict, he couldn't deny that Ning Zhuo was a formidable enemy.

Ning Zhuo retracted Snow-Colored Lady Hui but remained in the arena, turning to Pi Fujie outside the arena. "Come on. Your subordinate is dead. Now it's your turn."

Ning Zhuo issued another aggressive challenge.

Pi Fujie's eyes flickered, his fighting spirit plummeting further.

In his view, Ning Zhuo hadn't personally engaged in combat, clearly lacking expertise in controlling mechanical puppets. He was obviously using Snow-Colored Lady Hui as a disposable pawn to probe the enemy's capabilities.

In truth, Pi Fujie had the same intention. He had sent the Tiger Demon into battle to gauge Ning Zhuo's true strength.

The result was disastrous: the Tiger Demon was no match for Snow-Colored Lady Hui and was slain outright.

Pi Fujie knew in his heart that the Tiger Demon's failure wasn't due to its own weakness, but rather because the enemy's mechanical puppet was simply too powerful.

If I accept the challenge, I'll have to deal with this mechanical puppet first. It will be a grueling battle, exposing my weaknesses.

Even if I win, how will I then confront this big-headed cultivator?

A wise man knows when to retreat!

With this thought, Pi Fujie sneered coldly. "I refuse your challenge."

Ning Zhuo burst into laughter, his voice ringing with mockery. "Is this the Pi Clan's family tradition? Are you the Foundation Establishment's face for the clan? You're a disgrace to your family!"

"Don't worry, I'll make sure everyone knows about your cowardice."

Pi Fujie shook his head, his face turning ashen, but his refusal remained firm. "A true man knows when to yield and when to strike, when to advance and when to retreat. Spread whatever lies you wish. The Pi Clan's prestige cannot be shaken by mere rumors."

Ning Zhuo wasn't surprised when Pi Fujie refused to accept the challenge.

He had already grasped Pi Fujie's temperament and deliberately projected an overwhelming aura to make him retreat.

Ning Zhuo turned to Shen Xi. "Brother Shen, this Tiger Demon bears two Demonic Talismans from the Pi Clan. I'll gift him to you. Studying these talismans will undoubtedly reveal the secrets of the Seven Talisman Demonic Skin Sutra."

Pi Fujie remained unshaken, his confidence unwavering. "Dismantle them all you want. If the mysteries of my clan's cultivation art could be so easily deciphered, the Pi Clan would never have endured for so long!"

With that, he turned and left abruptly.

Having already lost one round, what was the point of staying? To endure further verbal humiliation?

Shen Xi and Ning Zhuo could only watch him go.

After all, this was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main headquarters. Everyone seeking to join this super sect naturally had to abide by its rules.

The sect rules governed disputes between cultivators, requiring them to be settled through martial sparring.

But Pi Fujie refused to accept the challenge, disregarding his reputation. Ning Zhuo couldn't force the issue.

As Pi Fujie stormed out of the Martial Training Hall, his spiritual energy surged like a tempest, radiating a murderous aura that warned all to keep their distance.

With the Tiger Demon dead and Ning Zhuo's overwhelming display of power, he could at least report back to his clan with some semblance of dignity.

But losing the first round meant that losing the second would be disastrous.

Next, he needed to find a way to regain the upper hand.

"My clan supports me, giving me an advantage over Shen Xi. After all, I have more subordinates."

"But I never expected Shen Xi to forge such a strong alliance."

"Facing two opponents alone puts me at a disadvantage."

"Think he's the only one who can make connections?" Pi Fujie sneered. "If Shen Xi can befriend experts, why can't I?"

"This time, the Ban Clan's talented juniors have also come to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect. The Ban Clan has always coveted exceptional mechanical constructs, especially Ban Ji, who's notoriously greedy and obsessed with collecting powerful machines..."

Pi Fujie began plotting his counterattack. Meanwhile, in the Martial Arena, Ning Zhuo once again offered the Tiger Demon's corpse to Shen Xi, making it clear this wasn't just empty courtesy.

Shen Xi waved his hand, clasped his fist in a respectful salute, and replied, "Many thanks, Brother Ning, but this is your hard-earned trophy. How could I possibly accept it?"

Driven by ulterior motives, Shen Xi refused the Tiger Demon's corpse. Since Ning Zhuo had already made an enemy of Pi Fujie, accepting the gift would only complicate matters.

The Tiger Demon was merely at the Foundation Establishment Stage, of little real value.

If he accepted it, the nature of this Martial Arena duel would shift. Instead of being a personal feud between Ning Zhuo and Pi Fujie, it would become Ning Zhuo acting on behalf of Shen Xi and the Shen Clan.

Pi Fujie's voluntary retreat revealed his apprehension toward Ning Zhuo. Should Ning Zhuo later publicize Shen Xi's acceptance of the Tiger Demon's corpse, Pi Fujie would likely seize the opportunity to gracefully back down, abandoning his pursuit of Ning Zhuo and focusing solely on Shen Xi and his group.

This was the established custom of the Righteous Path.

Shen Xi continued his explanation: "Brother Ning may not be aware, but Pi Fujie's earlier remarks held some truth. The Shen and Pi Clans have been enemies for generations, with countless casualties on both sides. Our clan has collected no small number of corpses of Pi Clan cultivators."

"We have long studied the Seven Talisman Demonic Skin Sutra. While the Tiger Demon's corpse could indeed offer insights into the Sutra's secrets, it holds no further value for our clan."

"Brother Ning, I urge you to examine it. With your exceptional comprehension and scholarly knowledge, you are sure to gain enlightenment."

Yet these explanations alone were insufficient.

As befitting a genius from a prominent clan who had received elite-level education since childhood, Shen Xi produced a Jade Slip: "Brother Ning has shown interest in the Nine Palaces Formation. Though our acquaintance is brief, we have formed a deep bond. Since Brother Ning has stood up for my friend today, allow me to present you with these Academy Notes. I implore you not to refuse."

A subtle glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he immediately discerned Shen Xi's underlying intentions.

He promptly praised the Shen Clan's mastery of the Nine Palaces Formation, affirmed the bond between himself and Shen Xi, and finally accepted the Jade Slip.

With this matter settled, both Shen Xi and Ning Zhuo felt their friendship had deepened.

Shen Xi invited Ning Zhuo to accompany him in observing the martial performances of others.

This had originally been Ning Zhuo's purpose in coming here, but the encounter with Pi Fujie had been an unexpected turn of events. Even more surprising was Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's performance in battle.

This disrupted Ning Zhuo's original plans, so he politely declined Shen Xi's invitation, explaining that he couldn't wait to delve into the Academy Notes Shen Xi had gifted him.

Shen Xi naturally wouldn't force Ning Zhuo to stay and could only bid him a reluctant farewell.

As Ning Zhuo departed, Su Lingkou voiced her concern: "Cousin, by giving Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo the Academy Notes, aren't you revealing the Shen Clan's arcane knowledge of array formations?"

Shen Xi smiled faintly. "Naturally, there are some unique insights belonging solely to the Shen Clan, but not many."

"Don't worry, cousin. I considered this carefully before offering the notes."

"Ning Zhuo could have shown some restraint and avoided this battle. I would never have retreated, and I made my intention to fight to the death clear from the start."

"Yet he insisted on intervening, demonstrating his sincerity in wanting to get closer to me through his actions. How could I possibly avoid him?"

Shen Xi's gaze turned somber. "To express my gratitude, I must show my own sincerity."

"I don't know the extent of Ning Zhuo's backing, but judging by this battle, it must be considerable, with deep reserves."

"Therefore, the only foolproof approach is to offer him something he undoubtedly lacks."

"Right now, the Academy Notes are the most suitable."

"With the Shen Clan's unique insights into the Nine Palaces Formation, once Ning Zhuo studies them, he'll inevitably crave more."

Su Lingkou clapped her hands in admiration. "I see now, Cousin! This is our bait!"

Shen Xi laughed heartily. "Exactly!"

"Among the ten classic static formations, the Nine Palaces Formation is particularly complex. My Academy Notes contain three years' worth of records. For someone without family teachings, it would take even longer to master."

Su Lingkou smiled. "Cousin, I can already picture Ning Zhuo eagerly holding his Academy Notes, begging you for guidance."

Shen Xi burst into another hearty laugh.

Returning to his rented cave abode, Ning Zhuo immediately released Snow-Colored Lady Hui.

Divine Art: Life Hanging by a Thread!

He unleashed his most potent control technique, forcefully connecting to Snow-Colored Lady Hui's spiritual energy.

Simultaneously, he extended both hands, the fingertips of his ten fingers emitting Five Elements Suspension Threads that connected to the Mechanical Puppet's body joints.

Snow-Colored Lady Hui immediately struggled, but failed to break free.

Through Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo instantly sensed her impatience.

A sharp glint flashed deep within Ning Zhuo's eyes as he made his assessment: "She's unresponsive to Life Hanging by a Thread and resists external control."

"Her spiritual energy has indeed reached the Spirit-Motion Stage."

Having studied On Spiritual Nature, Ning Zhuo knew that spiritual energy was divided into four major stages: the Dead Spirit Stage, Living Spirit Stage, Intelligent Spirit Stage, and Divine Spirit Stage.

Each major stage was further divided into five minor stages.

Previously, both Snow-Colored Lady Hui and Snow Pivot Lord Xie had reached the Spirit Primate stage of the Living Spirit Stage, their spiritual energy fully matured and endlessly self-sustaining.

Beyond the Spirit Primate stage lies the Spirit-Motion Stage.

At this stage, spiritual energy manifests distinct and intense emotions, acting independently and breaking free from the cultivator's control.

Ning Zhuo already had experience with this.

Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Yuan Dasheng had fallen into this stage. He had left the city and sat vigil at his Old Master's Secret Burial Ground for two days and a night.

"In this stage, one must follow the spiritual energy's emotions, not forcibly control it."

"By stroking its fur the right way, I can earn its loyalty and truly master it!"

Despite this understanding, Ning Zhuo harbored deep anxiety.

After all, Ning Xiaohui had died because of him.

Ning Zhuo had no choice at the time.

It was either her life or his.

"Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's spiritual energy originates from Ning Xiaohui. Normally, spiritual energy shouldn't retain memories from its previous life. But Yuan Dasheng remembered his Old Master's Secret Burial Ground... Could Ning Xiaohui still see me as her enemy?"

It was precisely because of these concerns that Ning Zhuo had previously limited his control to the Mechanical Component, the Floating Ice White Jade Hand, rather than the entire Mechanical Puppet.

Therefore, when Ning Xiaohui began exhibiting signs of the Spirit-Motion Stage, Ning Zhuo, burdened by worry, immediately left the Martial Training Hall to return and assess the situation.

"Life Hanging by a Thread is a Divine Art. She couldn't resist it, nor even detect it. Her emotions show no murderous intent or hatred toward me, but she is clearly impatient with my control."

The reality wasn't as dire as Ning Zhuo had feared, allowing him to breathe a sigh of relief.

"Since she's impatient, I should reduce my control during this sensitive period, perhaps even grant her temporary complete freedom."

"But how can I satisfy her emotions?"

Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.

He possessed three major Mechanical Puppets: the Buddha Physician, Meng Yaoyin, and Meng Yehu. However, their spiritual energy had already surpassed the Spirit-Motion Stage from the start. Only Yuan Dasheng's case offered valuable reference material.

Yuan Dasheng had personally sought out his Old Master's Secret Burial Ground to vent his grief and longing.

Yuan Dasheng's initiative was remarkably strong, but when applied to Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, she remained utterly still.

Ning Zhuo retracted the Five Elements Suspension Threads, leaving only the Life Hanging by a Thread secretly controlling her. Yet the Mechanical Puppet remained motionless in place.

Thoughts surged through Ning Zhuo's divine sea: "There's a clear pattern here. Yuan Dasheng's loyalty to his Old Master, rooted in his very nature, fueled his intense grief and longing."

"What was Ning Xiaohui's temperament like in life?"

Gradually, Ning Zhuo found his answer.

The battle against the Tiger Demon flashed before his eyes. The memory froze on the moment the Tiger Demon was frozen to death, capturing Snow-Colored Lady Hui's proud, slightly upturned gaze as she moved freely.

This image served as powerful confirmation of Ning Zhuo's conclusion.

Breaking free from his thoughts, Ning Zhuo surveyed his surroundings. "I need to rent a new cave dwelling."
