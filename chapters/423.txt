Chapter 423: Treating the Petrification Dao Injury

Zhang Chongyi drove away all irrelevant people.

Very soon, in this area of tents, only Zhang Chongyi, Ning Zhuo, and Sun Lingtong remained.

Zhang Chongyi began selecting medicinal herbs.

Around the circular tent, there were more than half a circle of medicine cabinets.

These medicine cabinets were all at the level of magical treasures, possessing powerful abilities to store specific herbs.

Zhang Chongyi was extremely familiar with these cabinets; from hundreds or thousands of drawers, he quickly selected the herbs he wanted.

They were, respectively, Earth-Life Vine, Stone-Breaking Grass, Fire Spirit Flower, Thousand-Year Bitterwood Root, and Dragon Scale Vine.

Earth-Life Vine was entirely yellow-brown in color, buried deep in the earth, warm in nature, and could soften rock layers, turning them into soil.

Stone-Breaking Grass often grew alongside Earth-Life Vine; as the name suggested, its leaves were as sharp as swords and could break open rocks as they grew.

Fire Spirit Flower absorbed fire-element spirit energy; after blooming, it self-combusted, its ashes falling to the ground to become nutrients for continued growth and blooming the following year.

Thousand-Year Bitterwood Root was extremely cold in nature, but deep inside contained a trace of tenacious vitality; it was a classic good medicine for combating petrification.

The surface of Dragon Scale Vine appeared to have layers upon layers of dragon scales, extremely dense, covering the entire vine. It had a strong breathing ability, commonly found in ancient stone mines, and could purify the air.

Each herb had a different processing method.

Zhang Chongyi soaked Earth-Life Vine, Stone-Breaking Grass, and Fire Spirit Flower in water; he crushed Thousand-Year Bitterwood Root into pieces and ground it into powder with a pestle.

As for the Dragon Scale Vine, he formed hand seals, used fire refining, burned the vine core, and burned off the dragon scale pieces, collecting them all.

Finally, Zhang Chongyi accurately weighed these herbs and carried out alternating soaking and mixing.

From time to time, he stopped and used spells to check; if he found some quantities insufficient, he would add some corresponding herbs.

Finally, he activated the Hundred Herbs Harmonizing Skill, used specific magic power, blended them together, and ultimately made a basin of medicinal liquid.

The medicinal liquid was thick, presenting a yellow-brown color, with dots of green light floating on the surface.

Although it looked unappealing, the medicinal liquid was very hot, emitting steam and giving off a strong and peculiar earthy fragrance.

Having successfully prepared it, Zhang Chongyi immediately called Sun Lingtong to come forward.

Sun Lingtong walked up to Zhang Chongyi; the latter immediately manipulated his divine sense to fetch the medicinal liquid and evenly applied it to Sun Lingtong's petrified arm.

The medicinal power was strong, quickly spreading and penetrating, softening the petrified outer shell, causing the stone skin to wrinkle and crack.

Zhang Chongyi took out a pouch of silver needles.

He took out a slender silver needle, held it in his hand, but did not move for a long time.

It was only when he observed that the stone skin had softened to a certain degree that he inserted the silver needle into Sun Lingtong's arm.

His hand speed seemed slow but was actually fast, extremely steady.

After a dozen or so breaths, he had inserted over a hundred silver needles into Sun Lingtong's petrified arm.

Zhang Chongyi formed hand seals, mobilizing his magic power.

The tails of the silver needles immediately trembled slightly, emitting faint silver light.

These silver lights drew out silk threads, continuously rising, floating into the air, drifting toward Ning Zhuo.

Zhang Chongyi instructed, "Young friend Ning Zhuo, just expose your wrists."

Ning Zhuo did as instructed.

These silver light threads were as light as nothing, winding around Ning Zhuo's wrists.

Zhang Chongyi continued, "Young friend Ning Zhuo, in a moment I will withdraw my magic power; you need to immediately take over, infusing your magic power, following the silver threads to reach the silver needles, then using the silver needles to continuously sense the Dao and principles within the petrified arm."

"I am not an Earth-element master; this step can only rely on yourself."

"Whether you can comprehend the principles within is the most critical."

Ning Zhuo's face was full of seriousness; after taking a deep breath, he slowly infused his magic power.

When the magic power reached the silver needles, he immediately had a vague perception.

He closed his eyes; at this moment, his consciousness seemed to sink into the depths of the earth.

"I felt it!"

In almost an instant, he comprehended the Earth-element principles within.

These were principles related to cohesion and confinement, also mixed with aspects of nurturing and storing.

Zhang Chongyi silently calculated the time and couldn't help showing a worried expression.

He saw that on Sun Lingtong's petrified arm, the medicinal liquid had gradually hardened; even the bases of the silver needles had a layer of grayish stone skin.

Zhang Chongyi's heart sank slightly: "Where did this little fellow receive such a Dao injury? The injury was internalized, much more severe than it appeared on the surface."

"We must hurry!" Zhang Chongyi couldn't help but become anxious.

He looked at Ning Zhuo.

"The injury is more severe than imagined; you only have half a stick of incense's time."

Zhang Chongyi did not dare to disturb Ning Zhuo and could only shout in his heart.

But the next moment, Ning Zhuo suddenly opened his eyes, "Lord Zhang, I have comprehended the principles within; what is the next step?"

Zhang Chongyi: ?!

"Wait, wasn't this a bit too fast?"

Zhang Chongyi found it hard to believe, "Young friend Ning Zhuo, you couldn't be careless. You must know that such an opportunity, if we missed it this time, next time to reach the same level, we'll have to change the herbal formula, pay a greater price, and the time for comprehension will be further shortened."

Ning Zhuo nodded, smiling, "Senior Zhang, how could I joke with my friend's life? Indeed, I have comprehended all the principles."

Zhang Chongyi was half-believing, half-doubting.

Sun Lingtong smiled, "I trust Ning Zhuo; Senior Zhang, let's proceed to the next step quickly."

He knew a lot of inside information, understanding that Ning Zhuo's Five Elements realm was not just as simple as master level.

Therefore, it was reasonable that Ning Zhuo could comprehend the principles in a very short time.

"Alright," seeing that both were confident, Zhang Chongyi also chose to believe for the time being.

Zhang Chongyi began to pack up the silver needles, herbs, etc.

Sun Lingtong sat cross-legged to the side, calming his mind, adjusting his state positively.

Ning Zhuo closed his eyes, brewing in his mind, constantly designing targeted spells.

His realm was profound; designing these spells was very easy, as simple as lifting a finger.

Very soon, he opened his eyes and said to Zhang Chongyi, "I have thought it out."

At this time, Zhang Chongyi hadn't even finished packing up the herbs; he smiled, "Young friend Ning Zhuo is truly talented to have designed spells so quickly."

"But I am not an Earth-element master; next, I needed to design auxiliary treatment methods through your spells."

"Therefore, naturally, the more spells you design, the better I can understand the situation, and the auxiliary methods I design will be more appropriate."

Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned. At first, he wanted to hide his capabilities a bit, but after glancing at Sun Lingtong, he decided to tell the truth, "Lord Zhang, are three spells enough?"

Zhang Chongyi smiled, "Three spells were sufficient. Actually, two were barely enough."

Ning Zhuo chuckled, "Alright then, I have thought of three."

Zhang Chongyi: "What?"

Ning Zhuo immediately took out a blank jade slip and inscribed the three spells into it.

After reading the jade slip, Zhang Chongyi couldn't help but look up at Ning Zhuo, his heart filled with suspicion, "These three techniques really seemed legitimate. But what's up with this kid Ning Zhuo? If these spells were workable, then his Earth-element realm seemed quite extraordinary!"

He studied carefully and found that these three spells approached solving the petrification from three angles, cleverly designed, making people involuntarily exclaim in admiration.

The first one took heart blood as the source, repairing in sequence from bones, meridians, to flesh.

The second spell countered petrification with petrification, making the petrification more severe, and after exceeding the limit, it collapsed on its own, turning stone into sand.

The third spell used magic power to penetrate Sun Lingtong's petrified arm, influencing and unblocking through magic power, always maintaining balance, constantly removing the stone skin, continuously healing itself. It was like constantly pouring clean water into a basin of muddy water and continuously draining it, ultimately achieving healing.

Zhang Chongyi pondered for a long time, devised three auxiliary methods, and also inscribed them into a jade slip with his divine sense, handing it to Ning Zhuo to examine.

Ning Zhuo read the jade slip and was immediately immersed.

The first auxiliary therapy used Rotten Astragalus, Silver Dragon Gallbladder Grass, Mountain Chuanxiong, and Golden Ginseng as the main formula. Rotten Astragalus could strengthen the body, Silver Dragon Gallbladder Grass cleared heat and detoxified, Mountain Chuanxiong promoted blood circulation and removed stasis, Golden Ginseng greatly replenished vitality, which could be called treatment and nourishment in one.

The second auxiliary therapy used Gold and Silver Starlight Flower, Divine Eagle Goji Berry, Fire Cypress Shell, and Night Angelica to make pills, which should be taken both internally and applied externally.

The third therapy used acupuncture, mainly puncturing the Elbow Liao point to relieve petrification pressure and increase blood flow; secondly, puncturing the Shoulder Five points and Baihui point to relax the muscles and regulate the body's qi and blood.

These three auxiliary therapies greatly satisfied Ning Zhuo, who praised, "As expected of the Imperial Physician. They complement my three spells; the coordination can be called perfect."

Zhang Chongyi, however, shook his head and pointed out the drawbacks of each of the three therapies.

"The first one required long-term medication, which would lead to the accumulation of medicinal properties, and in the future, more time would be needed to resolve residual medicinal effects."

"The second one, although the fastest-acting, the effect of the pills varied from person to person, and might very likely cause muscle atrophy."

"The third one used acupuncture combined with qi meridians; although it was moderate and steady, frequent needle application was quite stressful, and if there was any mistake, it could lead to future meridian blockage."

Hearing this, Ning Zhuo fell into silence.

He was worried about Sun Lingtong, so naturally he wanted to do his utmost to heal his own leader.

All three therapies had drawbacks and risks. If it were himself, Ning Zhuo wouldn't mind. But for Sun Lingtong, he wanted to minimize the risks and drawbacks as much as possible.

Sun Lingtong understood Ning Zhuo quite well, "Little Zhuo, it's no big deal. Even if there are some residual ailments, it's better than my current state, right?"

"Hurry up and treat me; I've been feeling really uncomfortable lately."

Zhang Chongyi also said, "I have also treated Dao injuries three times. The spells designed by young friend Ning Zhuo are already excellent and astonishing."

"According to my experience, it's almost impossible to improve to another level in a short time."

"This realm thing is not achieved overnight."

Ning Zhuo sighed, thinking, "Wasn't my Five Elements realm created in an instant?"

He confirmed that he had just designed the spells, indeed doing his utmost, racking his brains, and couldn't design better ones in a short time.

Next, Ning Zhuo and Zhang Chongyi discussed which treatment plan to adopt.

According to Sun Lingtong's impatient nature, naturally he chose the second one.

Ning Zhuo directly refused him.

Although the second one acted quickly, the sequelae were huge.

Zhang Chongyi admitted frankly, he had unique advantages in herbal concoctions because his cultivation method was the Hundred Herbs Harmonizing Skill. In acupuncture, he couldn't guarantee the level throughout the treatment; being old, he might make mistakes.

Finally, Ning Zhuo and Zhang Chongyi settled on the first therapy.

Next, they encountered difficulties.

Ning Zhuo kept practicing the first spell but couldn't reach Zhang Chongyi's standard for a long time.

Sun Lingtong smiled and said, "Little Zhuo, although your realm is profound, you spend too little time each day practicing spells. Even if you can design exquisite spells, when you actually perform them yourself, you are unable to achieve fine control."

Zhang Chongyi sighed, "Young friend Ning Zhuo, a genius like you should be heavily protected, practicing diligently within the family. Yet your Ning family lets you roam around; they are too bold."

Ning Zhuo modestly said a few words, then suddenly had an inspiration.

"I can't control it myself, but I can rely on the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique to precisely control the amount of magic power. Then design two more spells, one Fire element and one Wood element, to constrain the effect of the Earth element spell."

"Fire generated Earth; Wood restrained Earth."

"Through the relationships of mutual generation and mutual restraint, ultimately achieving fine planning of the Earth element spell."

Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo waved his hand, "Wait, I have a good idea."

How to put it?

Having a profound Five Elements realm allowed one to do as one pleased!

The two newly designed spells, although not precisely controllable, were like rules, restricting the performance of the Earth element spell.

Zhang Chongyi witnessed Ning Zhuo designing two brand new spells, his heart shocked, and exclaimed, "You are also a master of Fire and Wood elements?"

"Could it be that you possess the Five Elements Transformation, or the talent of Wood-Fire-Earth Three Element Fate?"

Ning Zhuo chose to conceal part of it, saying, "I do have some talent, but it has never been fully assessed."

Zhang Chongyi took a deep breath, looking Ning Zhuo up and down, clicking his tongue repeatedly.

Ning Zhuo used the three spells, and Zhang Chongyi prepared the herbs; with a two-pronged approach, they quickly restored Sun Lingtong's left arm.

Feeling returned, Sun Lingtong clenched his left hand, his face full of joy.

Suddenly, his heart trembled, sensing something.

Seeing that Ning Zhuo was about to cast a spell on his right arm, Sun Lingtong quickly jumped back a step, dodging away.

"Wait a moment, wait a moment," he shouted.

"Boss, was there any discomfort?" Ning Zhuo immediately felt nervous.

Sun Lingtong grinned, raising his left hand, showing off, "Look, look, have you noticed anything different?"

Ning Zhuo extended his divine sense over it, his expression changing slightly, "Boss, the cultivation method you practiced mainly cultivated the Sea of Consciousness, only paying some attention to the other two dantians."

"But now, the strength of the flesh and bones of your left hand far surpassed before, and there was a noticeable difference from other parts of your body. Why was that?"

Sun Lingtong winked at Ning Zhuo, "Little Zhuo, do you remember the cultivation method you recently obtained by accident?"

Ning Zhuo was slightly startled; a book title immediately appeared in his mind—'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing'!

He became even more curious.

This time, Sun Lingtong switched to voice transmission, telling Ning Zhuo the details, "In the Mechanical Dragon, with nothing to do, I had been comprehending the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing', and gradually gained many insights."

"One day, I suddenly thought that perhaps I could rely on this method to alleviate my injury. After all, enhancing the body could also increase resistance."

"So, I got into the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, allowing myself to enter a fetal breath state."

"Unexpectedly, after the stone skin was removed, the physical attainment of my left hand far surpassed other parts of my body. What do you think, can I use this ailment to cultivate my physical body?"

"Boss, you..." Ning Zhuo was speechless.

However, Ning Zhuo was also used to it.

Sun Lingtong was like this, always having many whimsical ideas.

Ning Zhuo carefully examined Sun Lingtong's left arm, briefly explaining the cultivation idea to Zhang Chongyi.

Zhang Chongyi stroked his beard and smiled, "There were actually many examples of using one's own illness to cultivate."

"For example, the Blood Shadow Cave Master of the Six Caves Sect was afflicted with a blood poison disease since childhood. By practicing demonic cultivation methods, his cultivation instead soared rapidly."

"Another example was Young Master Sheng Xu, who was frail and sickly, with inherently weak five organs, even incomplete, but instead formed a Void Qi Cave, attracting all external things."

"There were also some cultivation methods, such as the Diamond Indestructible Skill, which required constantly beating oneself, causing damage, thereby allowing the body to continuously repair and become stronger and stronger."

"If the situation was truly as little friend Sun said, then there's no need to rush to heal."

Sun Lingtong grinned, "Indeed, I'm benefiting from misfortune. Little Zhuo, you can also try it; the feeling of being petrified is quite unique."

Ning Zhuo was tempted.
