Chapter 715: Pine Breeze Qi Nurturing Art

Ban Ji pressed a hand to his chest, gasping for breath until his heart finally calmed.

Yet his face remained as cold and dark as ice, unyielding to any change.

His carefully laid plans had been utterly disrupted!

He instinctively tilted his head back to gaze at the sky, sensing a deeper layer of mystery and malice surrounding the Human Tribulation.

"Che Zhuzi is a member of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. How dare Lady Spiderweb, an outsider, lay a hand on him?

"Even if it was just seduction, the consequences would be dire if discovered! If Che Zhuzi realized what was happening, killing Lady Spiderweb would be perfectly justified.

"This woman's audacity knows no bounds!"

Ban Ji felt a surge of regret.

"These rogue Demonic Cultivators may know the Myriad Manifestations Sect's rules, but they only grasp the surface. They completely lack the understanding of nuance and restraint!

"If this case is investigated and leads back to me, I'll be severely implicated.

"Sigh..."

Ban Ji clenched his fists.

He needed to prepare for the worst-case scenario and devise the best possible response.

If Lady Spiderweb were captured, he couldn't rely on her silence. The most likely outcome was that she would turn on him to save herself. He couldn't trust the integrity of a Demonic Cultivator.

"In truth, even if Lady Spiderweb were killed, the world has no lack of methods for soul-searching."

"Tch..."

I must sever ties with this matter as quickly as possible...

Ban Ji took a deep breath, and as this thought crossed his mind, a chill ran through him from the depths of his heart.

Clearly, if he completely cut ties with the seven Demonic Cultivators now, the vast sums he had invested would go down the drain. Moreover, he would lose the ability to use that method to restrain and entangle Ning Zhuo.

"Isn't this your Human Tribulation? Forcing you to confront it head-on?"

"Hmph!"

Ban Ji's expression hardened. "You only need to sever ties with Lady Spiderweb and immediately sign new contracts with the remaining six to prevent them from turning against us."

"Exactly! Let's do it that way!"

Ban Ji was being deliberately vague. If he were to stubbornly adhere to his original plan, the consequences could be catastrophic!

Even if Ning Zhuo didn't participate, once the Myriad Manifestations Sect investigated and discovered that Ban Ji was the mastermind behind Lady Spiderweb, and that he had ultimately profited from the Prosperous Cloud Gathering through Che Zhuzi, what would the sect think?

Ban Ji knew all too well: given the Myriad Manifestations Sect's reputation, they would show him no mercy!

"Void Spider Silk... my Void Spider Silk..."

Ban Ji sighed inwardly, forced to abandon his efforts with a heavy heart.

He felt deeply frustrated. Despite Ning Zhuo's inaction, the true obstacle had been himself all along!

Ning Zhuo awoke refreshed, his fatigue completely gone, his mind clear and invigorated.

"My Soul Crystal contains the souls of a million people, and my Physical Body has been tempered through repeated cultivation, allowing it to nearly fully bear the weight of those million souls!"

The foundation of his Soul Crystal and Physical Body now revealed their true power.

All his past accumulation and efforts had not been in vain.

His previous weakened state had prevented him from reviewing his progress.

"This time, I used nearly every method at my disposal to study, and the results were significant."

"I've finally understood the structure of the twelve Spiral Blood Meridians in the Demonic Bloodline Tempering Art. They consume less blood than the basic condensation method and can increase my strength by at least thirty percent."

"Hah..."

Ning Zhuo finally pierced through the veil of mystery surrounding the Demonic Bloodline Tempering Art, revealing its true form.

"Hanging my head by my hair clears distracting thoughts. Piercing my thigh with an awl generates piercing insights, helping me overcome learning obstacles."

"When my spiritual energy is exhausted, I can passively consume my Literary Wind to generate strands of Literary Qi, nourishing my Upper Dantian and extending my study time."

"The Luoshu pages are like an eternally accurate abacus, ensuring that every calculation and direction I pursue is correct."

"The synergy between Bitter Ink and the Intent Brush amplifies their power exponentially. This combination grants me access to profound knowledge beyond mere words and images, allowing me to grasp hidden truths with remarkable speed."

"The drawback is the lingering bitterness at the bottom of the Divine Sea's Upper Dantian"

"What a pity. If I possessed the original manuscript of the Demonic Bloodline Tempering Art left by the Three Sects' High Elders, the combination of Bitter Ink and the Intent Brush would unleash its full potential."

"The text I'm currently studying is merely a copy I transcribed onto a Jade Slip."

Even a Jade Slip created by a Golden Core-level cultivator practicing the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art would be superior to my own. Others' interpretations inevitably differ from mine.

With the Intent Brush and Bitter Ink, I could access the unspoken meaning within the original manuscript.

"Ah!"

"The Three Sects' High Elders once left behind an original manuscript of the Demonic Bloodline Tempering Art - a True Scripture!"

"Yet, unbeknownst to me, it was used as a precious material to refine bean soldiers."

The intent contained within a True Scripture isn't merely profound; it's true intent.

Cultivators who can absorb this true intent can directly comprehend the myriad mysteries of the Cultivation Art within the True Scripture, making cultivation remarkably convenient.

This also meant that True Scriptures were extremely valuable. Few cultivators could produce them, and they were rarely circulated on the market.

Ning Zhuo subconsciously twisted his fingers, mentally reviewing his analysis to its conclusion.

"The Literary Wind's assistance is significant."

"It's a pity I can't cultivate Confucianism concurrently. Otherwise, I could transform the Literary Wind into even more, higher-quality Literary Qi!"

"From this small detail, one can grasp the immense advantage Confucian cultivators have in this area."

"Therefore, mastering the Pine Breeze Qi Nurturing Art is essential."

"Furthermore, while Pine Breeze Scholar has granted me permission to draw Pine Breeze Qi from the mountain at any time, this seemingly generous offer may actually come with hidden costs."

"What's free is always the most expensive!"

"Thus, I must personally procure pine trees, plant them myself, and strive for self-sufficiency."

With this, his review concluded.

Ning Zhuo summoned Old Chef, gave him a Ghost Path Golden Core, and instructed him to purchase pine trees, cultivation materials, and planting tools.

"The Literary Wind is crucial - an indispensable element for my future cultivation."

"Perhaps I should simply select a Void compartment within the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon and plant pine trees there."

After several months, Ning Zhuo resumed construction on the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon, starting with the Spirit Hidden Willow.

Ning Zhuo retrieved the Jade Slip containing the Pine Wave Qi Cultivation Technique.

"Without a doubt, this punishment was specifically tailored for me by the Confucian cultivators. However, my performance thus far should have made things easier for them."

This was Ning Zhuo's subtle demonstration of his sincerity in cooperation.

He sat cross-legged like a pine tree.

"Head suspended by the beam!"

Sun Lingtong sat upright behind the Water Vortex Formation, his eyes radiating spiritual light as he observed the pages of the Luoshu. This allowed Ning Zhuo to share the Dao Artifact's profound power.

He took a deep breath, his gaze as deep and still as an ancient pool.

The Sea of Consciousness trembled, the headband tightened, and his scalp tightened, sweeping away all distractions from his divine sea like dust.

"Thigh pierced by the awl!"

The wooden awl pierced his calf, the sharp pain burning like a red-hot needle piercing bone marrow.

His Mindful Spirit snapped taut like a drawn bowstring.

Sharp thoughts surged and receded in rapid succession.

Ning Zhuo slowly extended his arm, reaching for the Intent Brush.

The brush, imbued with Bitter Ink, glowed with a warm, lustrous light that intertwined with the ink's profound, dark-white radiance.

The brush tip, saturated with the mercury-heavy, pitch-black ink, descended heavily onto the paper as Ning Zhuo began to write.

First, he wrote the general principles of the Pine Breeze Qi Nurturing Art:

"Heaven and Earth possess righteous Qi, which flows and manifests in myriad forms. Pine and cypress embody resilience, their spirits enduring through the coldest winters..."

The brush scratched laboriously across the paper, each stroke a struggle.

For Ning Zhuo, the style of Confucian cultivator cultivation arts was unfamiliar, and as a beginner, mastering it felt like a cripple climbing a mountain.

A deluge of complex and profound principles overwhelmed him, making it difficult to grasp the core concepts.

"Hah..."

The Intent Brush transmitted its inner meaning, starkly contrasting Ning Zhuo's own understanding. The flow was continuous but remained vague overall.

Sensing this was merely the initial accumulation, Ning Zhuo remained patient, knowing this was only the first round of copying.

The Bitter Ink's sluggishness was particularly pronounced. Each character required immense mental effort, as if wading through quicksand, his Mindful Spirit suffocating under the oppressive weight of "bitterness."

Fortunately, Ning Zhuo was accustomed to hardship and possessed unwavering resilience. He forced himself to memorize the characters' physical forms, exerting every ounce of his strength.

The Pine Breeze Qi Nurturing Art was relatively short. After completing the first round of copying, Ning Zhuo had gained much but was utterly exhausted.

He closed his eyes and meditated for a long time before slowly opening them and beginning the second round.

"The pine, chief among all trees, its Qi clear and vigorous..." As Ning Zhuo's accumulated understanding deepened, a qualitative shift occurred.

The Intent Brush's strokes became somewhat clearer and more resonant. Though the Bitter Ink's heaviness persisted, the brushwork flowed with slightly greater ease.

Ning Zhuo's comprehension had advanced to a new level: "The so-called Pine Breeze Qi is the harmonious interplay and rhythmic pulsation of Qi."

"The wind whispers through the pines, its voice like crashing waves..." The Intent Brush conveyed a starkly different "image," as if Ning Zhuo could see pine needles swaying in the howling wind, envisioning a surging sea of pines - a vision of raging waves and clashing swords and armor.

His understanding deepened: "Literary Qi, Martial Qi... Though originating from the same source, they flow in divergent streams!"

After completing his second tracing, Ning Zhuo's rest time was halved compared to the first.

Third tracing.

He reached a passage: "Nourish the heart with literature, temper the body with martial arts. When heart and form harmonize, the Dao's power may be attained."

At that moment, Sun Lingtong, far away within the Water Vortex Formation, seemed to see the Luoshu's pages tremble slightly!

The Luoshu's precise guidance allowed Ning Zhuo to deepen his understanding once more: "Fierce power requires a resilient heart to control it, and a resilient heart needs the support of a fierce will! Like the pines and cypresses - their sturdy trunks withstand wind and snow (Martial), while their abundant needles gather spiritual energy (Literary)!"

"So, the true essence of this cultivation art lies in the mutual nourishment of heart and form!"

At this point, Ning Zhuo finally gained his first visceral, albeit still hazy, comprehension of the Pine Wave Qi Cultivation Technique's core mysteries.

"Hah..." He exhaled a long stream of turbid qi.

Ning Zhuo slowly set down the brush, his face pale and his body and mind utterly exhausted. Only now did the piercing pain in his legs surge forth with clarity.

His heart pounded, and cold sweat drenched his body.

The Literary Wind that had enveloped him completely had been utterly exhausted by the second attempt at imitation.

The paper, soaked through with Bitter Ink, lay in ruins.

His thigh was a bloody mess.

His scalp ached, and strands of severed hair littered the ground around him.

"Literary Qi's 'softness,' Martial Qi's 'hardness,' Mindful Spirit's 'stillness,' and Physical Form's 'movement'... So, Pine Breeze Qi Cultivation integrates these four elements into the single concept of 'Qi Nurturing,' operating in perpetual motion through the principle of mutual reinforcement between softness and hardness."

Ning Zhuo closed his eyes, as if hearing the sound of pine waves from that day on the mountain.

This sound now held a different meaning in his heart. It was no longer merely a sound, but a grand symphony containing vibrant Qi, revealing the profound truths of heaven and earth.

Filled with contentment, Ning Zhuo drifted into a deep sleep.

When he awoke, he felt completely refreshed.

"This method of learning is beyond the endurance of ordinary people."

"Fortunately, my foundation is strong enough!"

"The poor quality of the paper is a bottleneck. Otherwise, the Intent Brush and Bitter Ink could have provided even greater assistance."

Ning Zhuo didn't attempt to solve this problem himself.

He had a feeling - 

This bottleneck...

The Confucian cultivators of the Myriad Manifestations Sect would likely resolve it for him during the next Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

"The Pine Breeze Qi Nurturing Art might have been a last-minute addition from Pine Breeze Scholar, a gift just for me."

"Brush, ink, paper, and inkstone... They probably came in that order."

"Let's look forward to it for now."

Ning Zhuo rose and left his Cave Abode, heading toward the Pine Mountain Pavilion.

The mountain peak was already protected by a Formation, restricting entry to outsiders, but Ning Zhuo passed through unimpeded.

Arriving at the pavilion, he found the doors wide open and the interior completely empty.

Ning Zhuo sat in his usual spot and attempted to activate the Pine Breeze Qi Nurturing Art. His Five Elements Spiritual Power wasn't well-suited to this Cultivation Art, requiring significantly more energy to achieve the same potency as Confucian Spiritual Power.

A massive influx of Qi surged into Ning Zhuo, reinforcing his body.

This time, it wasn't just Literary Wind but also Martial Wind.

"I can absorb Literary Wind more easily and efficiently, using far less spiritual energy!"

"So this pavilion actually enhances my Confucian cultivation techniques as well."

Discovering this secret, Ning Zhuo realized that the benefits Pine Breeze Scholar had granted him extended far beyond his words.

He silently tucked this gratitude away in his heart.

"If I study here, will the pavilion's enhancement apply to my learning as well?"

Ning Zhuo immediately put his theory to the test. But the moment he began, he felt an invisible force pushing him toward the exit.

Though the force was gentle and subtle, Ning Zhuo yielded to its guidance and stepped out of the pavilion.

The pavilion doors closed behind him.

Ning Zhuo was no Lady Spiderweb. Having been a righteous cultivator from childhood, he immediately understood the boundaries.

"It seems providing me with the convenience of gathering Pine Wind is the limit these Confucian cultivators are willing to go."

"If I were to study inside the pavilion, I'd be breaking that limit and implicating the entire Confucian cultivators group."

"Since they don't want that, I can't force the issue."

By now, Ning Zhuo's cooperation with the Confucian cultivators had become quite harmonious, and he valued the relationship. He had no desire to sour it.

Leaving the mountain peak, Ning Zhuo returned to his Cave Abode and received the latest intelligence.

"Qing Huangzi is holding a second trial?"

"Mm... we need to prepare the Primordial Sound Bamboo Slips."

"Every reed component from the Primordial Sound Reed Book must be crafted."

"Time is of the essence!"

Ning Zhuo immediately shifted his focus to this task.

Qing Huangzi's Prosperous Cloud Gathering was unlike any other. With its emphasis on inheritance, its value was undoubtedly the highest among current gatherings.
