Chapter 778: Ning Zhuo’s Guardian God

In the past.

Grandmother: "Ah Xiang, do you know the biggest difference between my Zhu family and other powers?"

Childhood Zhu Fenxiang: "I know, Grandma. Other families and sects all have a main cultivation method, but our family majors in a technique!"

Grandmother nodded: "Correct, good child, you are right. The foundation of our Zhu family lies not in a cultivation method , but in a technique - the Divine Summoning Art."

"To support a family in becoming a super power, the Divine Summoning Art is naturally profound and extensive."

"To master this technique is both easy and difficult. Succeeding once counts for nothing, and failing countless times does not matter."

"Child, you possess the talent of 'Incense Ascending to Heaven.' Mastering this technique will be much easier for you than for your peers."

"But you must be mentally prepared. You need to know: to truly invite a significant God, your talent only adds a few bargaining chips to your favor."

Grandmother’s cultivation of Zhu Fenxiang was extremely strict.

In Zhu Fenxiang's childhood memories, there were only the cold, hard bluestone slabs beneath her kneeling knees; the long, complex, and tongue-twisting prayers; and the deep, cold, heavy darkness after her divine sense was exhausted.

With the elders' careful cultivation, the junior's obedient striving, and the boost from her innate talent, Zhu Fenxiang displayed amazing cultivation efficiency from a young age, repeatedly achieving stunning results.

This was a golden age of cultivation , where Gods were countless!

At first, it was only demigods and false gods, then minor gods with official positions, and then, Zhu Fenxiang set her sights on the Great Gods.

Even among Great Gods, there was a hierarchy.

Several years ago, in preparation for this Myriad Manifestations Sect Flying Cloud Assembly, Zhu Fenxiang began seeking the aid of a Great God.

After careful screening and a stroke of luck, she obtained a statue related to Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard.

It was like obtaining a supreme treasure!

Zhu Fenxiang went into seclusion for bitter cultivation.

The stone chamber cut off the noise and temptations of the outside world. She locked herself within, stubbornly kowtowing to the statue, constantly offering up her savings, and sincerely chanting prayers.

Amidst the curling smoke of incense, time passed.

The statue showed no reaction, lasting for several months.

Zhu Fenxiang felt like a stubborn stone abandoned in a corner. She curled up in pain during the dead of night, questioning whether her persistence was foolish. Sometimes, despair would drown her like a tide, leaving her lost and unsure of the path ahead.

Until one day, the statue emitted a warm, jade-like yellow light, pulling Zhu Fenxiang's soul into a Divine Domain.

The body of the Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard was colossal, resembling a mountain.

He sat high upon a divine throne, eyes closed, appearing to sleep, yet also seeming to look down upon Zhu Fenxiang.

Zhu Fenxiang knelt at His feet, her soul trembling slightly due to excitement and long-term overdraft from prayer.

She offered a devout prayer, knowing this was likely her only chance.

After the prayer, she curled up her soul body, listening with extreme nervousness, waiting for the True Lord's "judgment."

The Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard kept His eyes closed, giving no response.

Not long after, Zhu Fenxiang's soul returned to her body. She wept with joy: "I succeeded! I succeeded in the Divine Summoning Art this time!"

"The Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard really responded to me!!"

Success the first time, establishing a connection between the cultivator and the God, was the most critical step.

With the first time, there would be a second and a third.

After dozens of times, Zhu Fenxiang, having almost exhausted her family assets, had her soul pulled into the Divine Domain once again.

She knelt on the ground, praying sincerely once more.

The eyelids of the Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard moved slightly. He barely opened a slit, looked at the ant-like Zhu Fenxiang at His feet, and then slowly, cherishing his words like gold, spat out a single character: "Granted."

From then on, Zhu Fenxiang could summon the Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard to aid her in battle!

At this very moment.

On the altar, Zhu Fenxiang’s heart was filled with a sense of disparity.

The scenes from her memory formed a sharp contrast with the situation before her eyes.

The Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard, always high and mighty, was now using an unprecedentedly kind expression and an admiring tone to actively invite a peer cultivator to let Him serve as his Guardian God!

The young man reacted with god-like speed, agreeing on the spot.

"I don't agree!" Zhu Fenxiang almost shouted out loud.

How could inviting a Great God be so casual?

But ultimately, she dared not shout the true voice of her heart.

She then heard the statue laugh loudly: "Hahaha, good!"

But Ning Zhuo continued: "But how do I summon the God? I have never cultivated the Divine Summoning Art."

The True Lord felt genuinely happy about Ning Zhuo's straightforwardness. He directly ordered Zhu Fenxiang: "Zhu Fenxiang, you have done well in this matter. Considering your sincerity, teach Ning Zhuo now and pass on the Divine Summoning Art to him."

Zhu Fenxiang: "Ah?"

True Lord: "Act quickly."

Zhu Fenxiang fell into hesitation.

The True Lord said to Ning Zhuo: "The Divine Summoning Art is very easy to cultivate. Ning Zhuo, you can master it right here on the spot. Once mastered, with just a thought, you can establish contact with this God."

Ning Zhuo nodded: "I understand."

He looked at Zhu Fenxiang.

The statue also looked at Zhu Fenxiang.

Zhu Fenxiang dared not hesitate any longer. Gritting her teeth, she immediately began teaching: "This is the incantation. First, Fellow Daoist Ning, memorize it firmly, then I will teach you the essential meaning within!"

Saying so, she began to chant: "The Divine Path is faint and subtle, inaccessible without sincerity; the Zhu lineage inherits from the Heavens, using incense as a boat. Burning dragon marrow to pierce the Nine Hells, igniting the heart's flame to knock upon the God's slumber. With a blood contract as the guide, communicating with ten thousand spirits in a square inch; using the Ancestor's taboos as a vessel, crossing the waves of tribulation in vain requests..."

Ning Zhuo listened carefully, his expression gradually becoming somewhat amazed.

He could hear that this was not the ordinary, basic Divine Summoning Art circulating in the market, but the Zhu family's exclusive Divine Summoning Art!

"Why is Zhu Fenxiang teaching me her family's Divine Summoning Art?"

The Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard was also listening. The statue clone looked down at Zhu Fenxiang, its gaze playful: "The Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art is being passed to an outsider just like that?"

"It seems Zhu Fenxiang and Ning Zhuo have a deep relationship. Very good, very good."

Thinking back to just a moment ago, when He cast the Divine Art Silent Observation of Mortal Ties, and the scene He observed, He immediately understood more: "No wonder I saw many female cultivators fighting each other over Ning Zhuo. Zhu Fenxiang was among them."

"Oh, and her mother too."

The True Lord did not collect believers casually.

Zhu Fenxiang was quite important to Him.

Therefore, He also had a deep understanding of the Zhu family.

Once Zhu Fenxiang finished chanting, the statue clone nodded repeatedly: "Very good, Zhu Fenxiang, you have done very well."

Zhu Fenxiang hurriedly kowtowed, acting humble and not daring to claim credit, merely obeying the God's command.

Ning Zhuo’s expression was somewhat complex: "I didn't expect that coming here this time would cause Fellow Daoist Zhu to pay such a price..."

Zhu Fenxiang turned slightly to look at Ning Zhuo, smiling, showing no sign of the disparity in her heart: "Fellow Daoist Ning, as the saying goes, the Law is not passed down lightly. I did indeed use my only authority to teach you my clan's Divine Summoning Art."

"Later, when people from my family arrive, I ask for your cooperation in explaining the specific reasons."

"My clan's Divine Summoning Art has more than just this layer; naturally, there is deeper content. However, if you wish to exchange for it in the future, you will have to pay a price."

Hearing that he could obtain even more, Ning Zhuo immediately revealed a look of joy and cupped his hands in thanks.

He didn't fear the price; he feared not having the channel.

Ning Zhuo said sincerely: "Fellow Daoist Zhu shows such deep affection; I will engrave it in my heart and will surely repay it in the future."

Zhu Fenxiang smiled and nodded slightly, saying nothing.

During her hesitation just now, she had already overcome her sense of disparity and thought things through very clearly.

Ning Zhuo himself was worth befriending!

He was a genius and had passed the three questions of the heart at the Demon Subjugation Hall. Dealing with such an upright character was reassuring.

Ning Zhuo had rejected Ban Jie's heavy reconciliation gift and continued to make things difficult for Ban Ji. This time, winning the minor trial in the Profound Armor Cave and eliminating Ban Ji not only indirectly showed his powerful background and lack of fear toward the Ban family, but also revealed his upright and unyielding fighting spirit.

If such a person were to stand with Situ Xing, it would be terrifying.

Now, by poaching him to her side to deal with Situ Xing together, this business transaction was simply a massive profit!

"Moreover, I can't see it, but the God seems to have seen through some of Ning Zhuo's details. He didn't hesitate to lower his status and actively requested to be Ning Zhuo's Guardian God!"

"With the God behaving like this, am I a fool?"

"I must strike hard and do my utmost to befriend Ning Zhuo!"

"As for teaching the Zhu family's internal Divine Summoning Art..."

"This treatment is usually for a husband. I indeed have the authority!"

"It's just that the current situation is special and peculiar. When I report back to the family afterwards, I'll explain it first. The family will certainly understand! This is just a small matter."

After this train of thought, Zhu Fenxiang took action immediately.

Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought, quickly comprehending the Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art.

His perception was superior to others, and with various means to assist his learning, he gained insights immediately.

While results appeared constantly, new questions also arose.

A moment later, Ning Zhuo asked Zhu Fenxiang three key questions.

Upon hearing them, Zhu Fenxiang's face showed a strange expression. She scrutinized Ning Zhuo deeply, marveling that this person had grasped the core essence of the Divine Summoning Art so quickly.

However, she immediately thought of Ning Zhuo's exaggerated performance in the Profound Armor Cave, learning while practicing and finally taking first place, and felt that such performance was normal for him.

The Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard, transmitting divine power across the Yin and Yang realms to maintain the clone, was originally impatient.

But seeing Ning Zhuo's performance, He held back.

Zhu Fenxiang explained the answers to Ning Zhuo in detail.

After listening, Ning Zhuo thought for a while and asked another question.

Zhu Fenxiang's heart shook, and she shook her head slightly: "Fellow Daoist Ning, this question involves a deeper level of the Divine Summoning Art, and I have no way to answer you."

Ning Zhuo hurriedly expressed his thanks again.

"Alright, cast the Divine Summoning Art now," the statue clone urged.

Ning Zhuo attempted it for the first time, but since it was his first time casting the Divine Summoning Art, he failed midway.

Zhu Fenxiang's heart shook again. The progress of Ning Zhuo's first attempt greatly exceeded the upper limit she had expected.

Therefore, Zhu Fenxiang looked even more favorably upon Ning Zhuo's upcoming performance.

But the clone of the True Lord waved his hand: "Alright, alright, no need to try again, it's enough."

Saying so, He took the initiative to act and responded actively.

The next moment, a mysterious connection was established between Ning Zhuo and Him.

Zhu Fenxiang: ...

Although she had figured out her attitude and strategy toward Ning Zhuo, at this moment, the corners of her eyes still couldn't help twitching.

Is this right?!

She thought of her own past hardships, the countless repetitions of the Divine Summoning Art just to intermittently advance her relationship with the God, eventually collapsing from exhaustion before achieving her wish.

Now, she saw with her own eyes the True Lord actively cooperating, not caring at all that it was an incomplete Divine Summoning Art, "impatiently" establishing the connection.

"The Divine Summoning Art isn't cast like this!" Zhu Fenxiang was heartbroken.

With the god summoning successful, the True Lord's statue clone laughed loudly, waved his small hand, and said carelessly: "You all step back. I will use my full strength to rescue this mechanical puppet."

The statue clone's eyes burst with divine light , firmly locking onto Meng Yehu.

He extended a small hand and grabbed at Meng Yehu from a distance!

Sasha sasha...

The dim yellow sand mist enveloping Meng Yehu boiled instantly, its appearance changing drastically as it transformed into billions of grains of Earth Garrison Divine Sand!

The Divine Sand shot out continuously, gathering into a ball on the side.

The dim yellow sand mist on Meng Yehu’s body kept emerging, seeming endless.

Under the means of the True Lord's clone, the newly emerged sand mist was immediately converted into Earth Garrison Divine Sand and separated.

Ning Zhuo understood: "The True Lord didn't use brute force against brute force, but converted the sand mist into Divine Sand under his control. The solution is quite gentle and skillful."

The dim yellow sand mist on Meng Yehu’s body was just water without a source; it emerged more and more sparsely until it dissipated completely.

Meng Yehu was no longer shackled and fully regained his freedom.

However, he remained motionless, as if in a comatose state.

The True Lord's statue clone revealed a look of realization: "So this mechanical puppet already possesses spirituality. No wonder you, Ning Zhuo, tried every possible way to rescue him from his predicament."

Aside, Zhu Fenxiang's pupils shook.

She hadn't noticed this secret before. After being pointed out by the True Lord, she looked at Ning Zhuo and said sincerely: "Mechanical constructs possessing spirituality are extremely rare! If it grows in the future, it will definitely be of the Spirit Treasure level! Fellow Daoist Ning, congratulations!"

Ning Zhuo smiled: "I ask Fellow Daoist Zhu to keep this a secret for me as much as possible."

Zhu Fenxiang nodded: "Easily, easily."

The stronger Ning Zhuo was, the happier she was.

After all, their relationship was now different from before.

Ning Zhuo inspected Meng Yehu and stored him in his storage belt : "This mechanism's spirituality is dim; it will need to recuperate for a long time. I'm afraid it won't be of use in this Flying Cloud Assembly."




Zhu Fenxiang nodded: "Methods concerning spirituality are rare in the world. However, I know that within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, there is a method that fits this case exactly."


Ning Zhuo was overjoyed and hurriedly asked.

Zhu Fenxiang was straightforward by nature and said directly: "Xuanhuang Mother Qi."

"Years ago, a mass of Mystic Heaven Yellow Cloud was born in the depths of the Myriad Manifestations Cloud Sea. A mighty figure of the Myriad Manifestations Sect detected it accidentally and spent ten years successfully capturing it."

"Afterward, the mighty figure cut off a part of the Mystic Heaven Yellow Cloud and refined it to obtain wisps of Xuanhuang Mother Qi."

"This item is extremely precious and is currently held by Danxia Peak."

"Perhaps, Fellow Daoist Ning can seek out connections and obtain it through trade."
