Chapter 620: Mysterious Organization

Yang Sanyan and Wen Ruanyu were taken aback when Zheng Shoumo abruptly confessed.

Earlier, Zheng Shoumo had vehemently argued with Ning Zhuo, only to suddenly surrender.

"What's going on here?" they wondered, their minds swirling with suspicion.

They turned to Ning Zhuo, expecting an explanation.

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "In that case, Old Zheng, you might as well surrender. After all, you've contributed greatly to the education of White Paper Immortal City. You might be granted leniency."

Zheng Shoumo sneered. "Boy, you may lack concrete evidence, but you're not without your tricks."

"Capturing me alive won't be easy."

Before he could finish, a surge of energy erupted from his body.

Dao Field - Dragon Pool Hidden Scales!

In the next instant, the two Dao Fields merged, rapidly transforming the surrounding environment.

The once lush grassland, where grass grew waist-high, now became a marshy wetland dotted with scattered boulders.

Several streams began to flow, their waters murmuring softly.

Wen Ruanyu drew his brush and began writing in mid-air.

Yang Sanyan summoned his flying knives, which sliced through the sky.

The characters and the flying daggers arrived at Zheng Shoumo's eyes almost simultaneously from opposite directions.

This was clearly Wen Ruanyu and Yang Sanyan's intention. Though fighting together for the first time, their high combat proficiency allowed them to coordinate their attacks seamlessly, launching a synchronized assault on Zheng Shoumo.

Zheng Shoumo didn't dodge, remaining rooted to the spot.

In the next instant, a torrent of water erupted, swirling around him to form an impenetrable barrier.

The characters splashed against the translucent water, sending droplets flying.

The more potent flying dagger Magic Artifacts were swallowed whole, leaving only faint ripples in their wake.

Wen Ruanyu and Yang Sanyan's expressions turned grave.

Ning Zhuo called out a timely warning: "Careful! That's Overturned Water!"

The Water-element Sinister Treasure - Overturned Water! It severed all connections to whatever it enveloped.

As the saying goes, "Spilled water cannot be recovered!"

Wen Ruanyu suddenly understood.

Yang Sanyan glanced at Ning Zhuo, finally grasping why Zheng Shoumo had abruptly lost his resolve at the last moment, abandoning his defense and openly admitting to being an Internal Traitor.

The key reason lay in the Overturned Water itself!

Storing such a Five Elements treasure was no easy task, and maintaining it came at a considerable cost.

Storing Water Element treasures, whether virtuous or sinful, generally followed the same principle: water flows downward.

Storing pure Overturned Water was particularly expensive. The slightest negligence could cause it to dilute on its own.

For daily storage, cultivators typically diluted the Overturned Water themselves to drastically reduce maintenance costs.

When needed, they would purify it again.

Ning Zhuo had learned this principle from Li Xiangshang.

As a Carp Transformed into a Dragon, Li Xiangshang had been chosen by the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign to cultivate in the Weak Water.

Each time he introduced fresh water to dilute the Weak Water, he struggled relentlessly, gradually approaching the level of dormancy until he finally leaped out of the pool.

Just as with Weak Water, the same principle applied to Overturned Water.

Zheng Shoumo, who controlled the Ink Pool, had conveniently stored the Overturned Water within it, using it as a daily disguise.

Zheng Shoumo had once disguised himself, activated the Dragonfall Hidden Scale Dojo, and ambushed Jin Yangzi.

Sun Lingtong had witnessed the entire process.

As a result, Ning Zhuo knew that the internal traitor possessed Overturned Water.

When Ning Zhuo suspected Zheng Shoumo after noticing Yang Weida's flaws, he immediately connected the dots from previous clues.

Before arriving, Ning Zhuo had secretly speculated: if his hunch was correct, Zheng Shoumo would likely be carrying Overturned Water with him.

If he was wrong, at worst he would only be detaining a Golden Core cultivator.

This wouldn't significantly impact the overall situation in White Paper Immortal City.

As Ning Zhuo had publicly stated, he was no Divine Constable and never claimed any detective skills. He didn't need solid evidence; action was enough. If he was right, excellent. If wrong, no harm done.

According to Wen Ruanyu, Zheng Shoumo was a follower of Meng Yaoyin.

If he wrongly accused Zheng Shoumo, Ning Zhuo believed that revealing his true identity would surely earn the man's understanding.

The evidence of Zheng Shoumo's guilt was on his person!

This was the Overturned Water.

Once it was discovered, no explanation Zheng Shoumo could offer would dispel the overwhelming suspicion. He harbored no illusions and would never accept being confined.

Whether the Overturned Water was found or not, prolonged confinement would inevitably lead to its deterioration. Like food past its expiration date, the Profound Mystery and Subtle Ability within would dissipate, gradually weakening. His combat prowess would plummet accordingly.

The Overturned Water was Zheng Shoumo's greatest asset.

Defending against the initial assault, Zheng Shoumo thrust his palms forward, unleashing waves of the Overturned Water.

Wen Ruanyu, Yang Sanyan, and Ning Zhuo retreated simultaneously.

The three men instinctively activated their techniques.

Yang Sanyan conjured blades of light, Wen Ruanyu's brush danced across the air, inscribing characters, and Ning Zhuo unleashed hand seals, incantations, and mental commands, cycling through Fire Element techniques.

Boom!

The spells collided with the Overturned Water, sending waves crashing and steam billowing.

Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu, and Yang Sanyan pushed their spells to the limit, forming protective barriers around themselves. They avoided using their personal magic treasures and artifacts unless absolutely necessary, fearing the Overturned Water would absorb them.

Zheng Shoumo ascended into the sky, channeling both the Overturned Water and his own magic treasures to strike from all directions.

Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu, and Yang Sanyan retreated while fighting, finding themselves unexpectedly on the defensive.

Though Zheng Shoumo held a clear advantage, his expression remained grave. Overturned Water was formidable, but it was particularly effective against magic treasures and artifacts.

In a one-on-one confrontation, he could easily force his opponent to resort to such items. Then, by seizing their treasures with Overturned Water, he could trigger a backlash that would severely weaken them.

But now, with Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu, and Yang Sanyan working together, they were able to share the pressure and hold their ground using only techniques.

This created a situation where their techniques were draining Overturned Water, a disadvantageous position for Zheng Shoumo.

"I must attack with full force, leaving nothing in reserve! The opportunity is here - we must force out his magic treasures and artifacts!" Zheng Shoumo was about to summon another magic treasure.

Yang Sanyan, proud and arrogant, had long been simmering with anger at being pushed back despite their three-on-one advantage.

Superior natural talent - All Under my Gaze is Emptiness!

His gaze hardened into a blinding glare that locked onto Overturned Water, causing a large portion of the liquid to vanish instantly.

Yang Sanyan's patience had snapped. With a cold snort, the vertical mark between his brows abruptly split open.

The eruption of power instantly shifted the tide of battle.

"A perfect opportunity!" Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu thought in unison, seizing the moment to strike.

One unleashed the Mystic Gold Slash, while the other rapidly inscribed three characters for "kill."

Zheng Shoumo's entire body turned icy, as if plunged into an ice cave, overwhelmed by the palpable killing intent.

He hastily switched from offense to defense, but his earlier all-out assault had left him vulnerable. Though his reaction was swift, the transition still required precious time.

And that critical moment was the difference between life and death for him!

First, the Mystic Gold Slash shattered his defenses. Then, the three "kill" characters branded themselves directly onto his body.

Zheng Shoumo coughed up blood and was sent flying backward, his vital energy plummeting to rock bottom.

The Overturned Water dissipated, scattering uncontrollably across the ground.

Yang Sanyan, who had neutralized so much of the Overturned Water, had paid a steep price. His third eye, once vibrant, now appeared dull and gray, its vision nearly extinguished.

Ignoring the cost, he summoned another flying knife.

The blade shot forth like lightning, reaching Zheng Shoumo in an instant. Aiming precisely at his forehead, it sought to pierce his Divine Sea Dantian!

Severely wounded and dazed, Zheng Shoumo couldn't react in time.

At the critical moment, a token suddenly activated, flying out from Zheng Shoumo's storage ring and blocking the flying knife.

The token then hovered in mid-air, emitting a dazzling array of mystical light.

Within the radiant glow, a swirling archway formed.

The archway emitted a powerful suction force, drawing Zheng Shoumo directly into it before vanishing without a trace.

The scene left Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu, and Yang Sanyan stunned.

They had been confident of capturing Zheng Shoumo, yet this unexpected turn of events left them speechless.

"What kind of technique is this?!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed in disbelief.

All three turned their bewildered gazes toward the token.

The swirling archway had completely disappeared after absorbing Zheng Shoumo, leaving only the token to fall from the sky and land on the grass.

Yang Sanyan reached out and summoned the token into his palm.

Upon closer inspection, he saw that the token was riddled with cracks, its surface completely fractured. It wouldn't have been surprising if it had shattered completely at any moment.

The token's original patterns and markings were barely discernible beneath the network of fissures.

The cracks intertwined like angry lightning bolts and twisted, grotesque shapes, their chaotic arrangement vaguely resembling the image of a gate.

The aura of the token had plummeted to the mundane, rendering it an ordinary object, not even a low-grade Magic Artifact.

It was clear this miraculous item could only be used once.

Wen Ruanyu stepped forward, staring at the shattered token. "What exactly is this?"

Ning Zhuo shared the same question. "The Dao Field isolates the interior from the exterior. Zheng Shoumo personally activated it as the master of the Dragonfall Hidden Scale Dojo. How could he possibly escape directly from it?"

Yang Sanyan stared intently at the token in his hand, his heart pounding with shock.

His face turned ashen. After a long silence, he looked at Wen Ruanyu and Ning Zhuo, his voice low and heavy with shock, apprehension, and solemnity. "It's understandable that you don't recognize this."

"All I can say is... this matter is of immense significance!"

"I must immediately send a flying message to report this to the Sect!"

Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu exchanged bewildered glances.

Yang Sanyan's gaze swept over Wen Ruanyu before settling on Ning Zhuo. After a moment's hesitation, he said, "Your mother, Meng Yaoyin, and the other fallen geniuses... their deaths may very well be the work of this organization."

"What?!" Ning Zhuo paled, his voice urgent. "What do you mean?"

Yang Sanyan shook his head. "This is classified information from the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Demon Subjugation Hall! Even Golden Core True Inheritors like Wen Ruanyu are mostly unaware of it. If you wish to learn more, I suggest you join the Myriad Manifestations Sect and apply to serve in the Demon Subjugation Hall alongside me."

"Myriad Manifestations Sect, Demon Subjugation Hall..." Ning Zhuo muttered, his brow deeply furrowed.

He knew his mother had suffered a Dao Injury, but he had never understood its cause. Meng Yaoyin hadn't practiced any unorthodox cultivation methods.

Now, Yang Sanyan was telling Ning Zhuo that a shadowy organization might have been responsible for his mother's injury. This token, capable of rescuing its bearer from peril, was one of the organization's symbols.

A surge of anger and bewilderment flooded Ning Zhuo's heart.

Yang Sanyan cast several spells to carefully preserve the shattered token, then tucked it into his storage belt.

His face grave, he addressed Wen Ruanyu and Ning Zhuo: "The situation is far more complex than I imagined."

"Zheng Shoumo is a member of this organization. He's been in White Paper Immortal City for years. If they're trying to seize control of this Immortal City, the reality is likely far worse than we feared."

"I must first investigate the City Lord and other high-ranking officials of the Immortal City. That includes both of you, of course."

Wen Ruanyu replied solemnly, "Please proceed as necessary."

Ning Zhuo added, "I'm willing to fully cooperate, but this must be done discreetly. White Paper Immortal City is already under siege by both the Ghost Tide and the Yin Soldiers, and the atmosphere within the city is extremely tense."

Yang Sanyan nodded slightly, his sharp gaze fixed on Ning Zhuo. "You're probably clean. If you were involved, you wouldn't have triggered Zheng Shoumo, the internal traitor."

"I'm starting to seriously doubt the White Paper City Lord!"

"The current City Lord of White Paper Immortal City is quite ambitious, and her true form hasn't been publicly revealed in years."

Ning Zhuo touched the mechanism ring on his finger, but it remained still. "I'd like to accompany Senior Yang to visit the City Lord's true form!"

Yang Sanyan's eyes flashed with admiration. "As expected of a descendant of our sect's Golden Core True Inheritor."

Wen Ruanyu added, "I wish to go as well!"

"Good," Yang Sanyan took charge. "Then the three of us will head straight to the City Lord's Mansion."

Yang Sanyan dismissed the Dao Field. Without his guidance, the Dragonfall Hidden Scale Dojo dissipated on its own, drawing the attention of nearby cultivators.

Wen Ruanyu quickly gave a few instructions to reassure them.

When the trio arrived at the City Lord's Mansion, they were first greeted by the City Lord's Paper Puppet Avatar.

Wen Ruanyu clasped his hands in a respectful gesture. "Brother Yang, would you allow me to explain the situation?" He worried that Yang Sanyan's arrogance might lead to unnecessary complications during negotiations.

Yang Sanyan glanced at Wen Ruanyu and nodded slightly. "You're also a Golden Core True Inheritor of our sect. I'll give you that courtesy."

"Ah, it's him," the Paper Puppet Avatar said, showing little surprise. It sighed deeply.

Wen Ruanyu reported to the City Lord's avatar that the internal traitor, Zheng Shoumo, had been exposed.

Yang Sanyan's eyes flashed with sharp intensity as he immediately demanded, "The City Lord doesn't seem surprised?"

The White Paper City Lord said, "As the City Lord, I naturally suspected the Heart-Piercing Scroll might be failing when repeated investigations failed to uncover the internal traitor."

"Zheng Shoumo was one of my primary suspects."

"He oversees the Ink Pool, yet he's constantly making mistakes, leading to repeated repairs. It's quite peculiar."

"I secretly sent people to investigate him, but they found nothing."

Wen Ruanyu couldn't help but show surprise. He never imagined the City Lord had long suspected Zheng Shoumo and even investigated him!

Yang Sanyan frowned. "Why didn't you investigate further? If it were me, I would have thoroughly investigated the suspicious pattern of the Ink Pool's repeated repairs."

The White Paper City Lord scoffed. "Young Yang, you're not a City Lord. You wouldn't understand the constraints we face. We can't always act on our own whims."

"Zheng Shoumo is one such case."

"He was placed here by Meng Yaoyin, naturally aligning him with the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Moreover, as a Confucian cultivator, he's unusually close to Wen Ruanyu."

"If I had pressed the investigation, I might have uncovered evidence that he deliberately caused the damage to embezzle repair funds."

"That would have been detrimental to both of us!"

Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu, and Yang Sanyan fell into silence.

The White Paper City Lord's words held considerable weight.

Meng Yaoyin had made significant contributions to the White Paper Immortal City, even having a colossal paper puppet statue erected in her honor south of the city. Disposing of those she had appointed would severely damage her reputation.

Meng Yaoyin was the White Paper City Lord's handpicked hero, and her image and reputation were intertwined with the City Lord's own prestige.

By acknowledging Meng Yaoyin's achievements, the City Lord was also signaling goodwill to the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

In a sense, Zheng Shoumo had replaced Meng Yaoyin as the living testament to the alliance between the White Paper Immortal City and the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

His downfall would be detrimental to both the City Lord and the alliance between the Immortal City and the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

Therefore, even if he had embezzled maintenance funds, the White Paper City Lord would likely turn a blind eye.

It was precisely this consideration that led the City Lord to overlook the suspicious circumstances.

Many things in life require a touch of willful ignorance.

Wen Ruanyu sighed deeply, breaking the silence. "Perhaps this was Zheng Shoumo's plan all along."

"On one hand, he used the repeated Ink Pool repairs to secretly tamper with things, nurturing his Overturned Water and making other preparations. Now that I think about it, the Gate of the Underworld that appeared in the Ink River within the city, from which a large number of water ghosts emerged, must have been Zheng Shoumo's doing."

"On the other hand, he used this as a 'shield,' calculating that City Lord, you would prioritize the greater good and choose to remain willfully ignorant. He used this 'shield' to deflect any subsequent investigations."

The White Paper City Lord turned to Ning Zhuo. "We owe everything to our little savior for exposing this man as an internal traitor!"

Ning Zhuo, still dwelling on Yang Sanyan's earlier words, his eyes flashed with determination. "This isn't over by a long shot. My mother's death is likely connected to this man."

Yang Sanyan produced the shattered token and explained the details of the battle.

Upon learning that Zheng Shoumo might be a member of this mysterious organization, the paper doll avatar lost its composure, its face contorting in shock.

Yang Sanyan said, "This matter is of grave importance, City Lord. I must meet your true form and sign a Divine Contract with all of you. Otherwise, I can't truly trust any of you. Without trust, how can we defend the city?"

The paper doll avatar remained silent for a long moment before shaking its head with a wry smile. "Very well. Please follow me, all three of you."

The trio exchanged glances. Ning Zhuo stroked his mechanical ring and stepped forward first.

Moments later, they arrived at an underground chamber.

The paper doll avatar activated a magical formation, revealing the City Lord's true form.

"This?!" Wen Ruanyu's expression twisted in shock.

Yang Sanyan narrowed his eyes, instinctively concealing the turmoil in his pupils.

Ning Zhuo also wore a look of astonishment. He had never imagined the City Lord's true form would be in such a state.
