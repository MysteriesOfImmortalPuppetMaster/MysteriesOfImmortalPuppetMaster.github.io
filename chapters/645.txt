Chapter 645: Luo Si Slaughters His Enemies

"Luo Si has gone mad! He's lost his mind!"

"Attack him together!"

"Kill this traitor!"

Xie Sichao, the White Bone Crocodile Demon, and other powerful beings roared furiously, surrounding Luo Si.

Though Luo Si had received guidance from the Ash Bone Elder and steadily risen through the ranks in the Forgetful River Prefecture, he remained an outsider. His tenure was too brief to earn true trust.

His appointment as commander of the White Paper Immortal City's assault forces was merely a way for the senior elders to avoid responsibility, passing the hot potato to him.

Fundamentally, he was still an outsider.

Lacking time, opportunities, and connections, he had never fully integrated into the Forgetful River Prefecture's hierarchy.

Even Luo Si himself, guided by the Ash Bone Elder's prophecy of encountering his destined sovereign, had subconsciously maintained distance from the Forgetful River Prefecture.

However, as a Nascent Soul-level expert, his appointment as commander clearly indicated that his combat prowess was recognized by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and the top echelons.

He effortlessly repelled the combined assault, then escaped like a streak of light, swiftly reaching Immortal Hanyan.

"Let me handle this!"

"You two go ahead."

Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan exchanged a glance, then turned away from the battle zone and swiftly rejoined the Qing-Jiao Army.

Seeing the Qing-Jiao Army's fierce assault, Xie Sichao, the White Bone Crocodile Demon, and the others abandoned their pursuit of Luo Si and rushed to take command of their forces.

However, Luo Si's forces weren't composed solely of cultivators. They also included a vast number of ghostly creatures.

Wail... Wail... Wail...

Amidst the cacophony of ghostly wails, Big-Headed Ghosts, Small-Headed Ghosts, Ghost Mothers, Drowned Ghosts, Hanging Ghosts, Flayed Ghosts, and other spectral entities became the source of chaos, turning on their own comrades with ruthless efficiency.

Most of these ghostly creatures lacked intelligence, but they strictly adhered to the highest command orders.

The Qing-Jiao Army was outnumbered, making their attack on Luo Si's forces like a mouse attacking an elephant.

But under Luo Si's orders, this elephant began a brutal bout of self-destruction, collapsing from within.

Though the elephant was massive, completely crushing it seemed impossible.

Xie Sichao and the others strained to maintain control, but their efforts yielded minimal results.

"The situation has deteriorated rapidly. We can't save ourselves alone anymore."

"All we can do now is wait for the Imperial Guard's rescue!"

Yet as they awaited external aid, the Imperial Guard was already overwhelmed with their own troubles.

The root of the problem lay with the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts.

This seasoned cultivator, with her profound reserves of power, specialized in enslaving ghostly creatures. She had meticulously selected and nurtured over a hundred formidable ghostly creatures, each possessing exceptional combat prowess, which earned her the title "Mother of a Hundred Ghosts."

With her death, the bonds on these hundreds of powerful ghostly creatures were broken, granting them complete freedom. They immediately began to act.

Some fled, others stood frozen, staring around in confusion, while the most resentful and vengeful turned their wrath on the Imperial Guard, striking with brutal ferocity.

This created an awkward situation: the Imperial Guard and Luo Si's forces found themselves simultaneously facing internal rebellions caused by the same source.

Luo Si had anticipated this scenario before turning his blade against his former allies. His primary target had been the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts, using her ghostly minions to manipulate the battlefield!

The entire Qing-Jiao Army rode Black Blood Paper Horses.

Crimson ghostfire burned fiercely within the paper horses' frames, channeling immense power through their rigid paper skeletons to every part of their bodies. Each hoofbeat thundered like a clap of lightning.

The paper horses' silence amplified their aura of invincibility. The oppressive pressure of their silent charge was more suffocating than any war cry!

Thud... thud... thud...

A series of dull impacts echoed as countless cultivators from Luo Si's forces fell to the Qing-Jiao Army's charging onslaught.

"Loose arrows! Throw spears!" The young officer shouted, desperately directing the battle, relying on the time bought by the heavy sacrifices of his comrades.

Father Jiao Ma waved the Bone Blade Battle Flag, sacrificing soldiers to activate defensive military strategies. The flag emitted a pale green light that swiftly enveloped the entire Qing-Jiao Army. The shower of arrows and spears aimed at them seemed to collide with an invisible swamp, slowed and deflected. Less than ten percent of the projectiles reached their targets, landing weakly and sparsely.

Leading the charge was always Qing Chi, the Ghostmen girl blazing with roaring Azure Flame. The flame even engulfed her paper horse, causing cultivators to scream as they were scorched during the charge. Qing Chi's fists and palms clashed, unleashing solidified Azure Flame in the form of fist and palm strikes. Amplified by Military Power, she crushed Luo Si's forces, which were in unprecedented disarray. Several Golden Core-level cultivators fell to her onslaught.

Following close behind Qing Chi were the elite cavalry of Qing Jiao, wielding Crescent Moon Greatswords. They crouched low on their paper horses, merging with the skeletal frames. The instant they plunged into the enemy ranks, they swung their greatswords with devastating force.

Buzz - Clang - !

A peculiar metallic resonance tore through the air, not like the clash of metal on metal, but more like the cracking of ice on a frozen river.

The blade slashed out in a brilliant arc, unleashing streams of icy moonlight from its frosty veins. These condensed into razor-sharp, serrated beams of cold light, each edge pulsing with spatial ripples!

Wherever these beams struck, space seemed to freeze and shatter under their extreme sharpness!

Whether it was heavy armor, defensive spells, or weapons raised to block, all were sliced open, frozen, and pulverized by the cold light!

Then the beams pierced the cultivators' bodies. Whether flesh and blood or ghostly creatures, they instantly froze in the extreme cold, shattered into icy powder, and perished on the spot.

Following the Crescent Moon Greatswords were soldiers wielding Void-Piercing Spears.

The spear tips were not forged from metal, but created by tightly rolling, compressing, and bonding countless layers of talisman paper with unimaginable density.

The spears thrust into the enemy ranks.

Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!

The dense, rain-like succession of piercing sounds merged into a continuous noise.

The fluffy midsection of each spear tip suddenly exploded, unleashing countless compressed talisman paper fragments that shot forward. As the talismans activated, they tore through space, carrying Void Shards that coalesced into a terrifying storm.

Countless enemies were pierced through by flying Void Shards, riddled with holes.

The Void-Piercing Spear retracted, its tip now only half-intact. But it didn't matter. Fragments of talisman paper swiftly transferred from the spear's body, converging at the tip to form a new one.

Leading the charge was the Crescent Moon Greatsword, cleaving a path through the enemy ranks.

With each thrust of the Void-Piercing Spear, stubbornly resisting warriors were instantly slaughtered.

"Hold them! Stop them!" An officer roared, his bloodshot eyes blazing with fury as he desperately tried to maintain control of the battle.

But the Qing-Jiao Army moved like a massive python, slithering through the enemy ranks with devastating efficiency. Anyone who dared block their path met instant death.

The Qing-Jiao Army also paid a price. Several soldiers fell, and over a hundred were wounded, their injuries ranging from minor to severe.

Witnessing this, Qing Chi took a deep breath. She abruptly channeled forty percent of the army's military might into herself and cast a spell: Wither-Bloom Fire Ring.

A fierce azure flame erupted from her body, radiating outward to form a massive, emerald fire ring centered around her.

As the green flames brushed against the bodies of the Qing-Jiao soldiers, they carried scalding vitality.

Their wounds rapidly stopped bleeding, and new flesh - pale azure skin - regenerated at a visible rate.

Even the Black Blood Paper Horses reacted, the ghastly green Ghostfire in their chests flaring violently. Their Talisman Paper skin tightened, and their withered skeletons emitted a faint hum, radiating a more vigorous surge of Yin Qi vitality.

When the green fire enveloped the enemy soldiers, the scene transformed into a horrific spectacle.

The enemy soldiers screamed as the flames seared their flesh, their blood and flesh withering and charring in the inferno, their bones exposed and twisted into charred, blackened remains.

Most of the enemy soldiers rapidly shriveled, ultimately collapsing into piles of ash-covered bones, still clad in tattered armor, surrounded by wisps of gray smoke and charred grease.

The Qing-Jiao Army was nearly fully restored, their morale skyrocketing.

Qing Chi panted heavily, her eyes gleaming with fierce determination, her battle spirit roaring like a dragon.

Immortal Hanyan was locked in combat with Luo Si.

Surrounded by swirling cold air, Immortal Hanyan unleashed a torrent of ice shards, his attack ferocious and relentless, like a raging tempest.

Luo Si countered with his fishing rod, whipping the fishing line to create spatial ripples that deflected the ice shards, maintaining perfect composure.

Immortal Hanyan sneered, attempting to break Luo Si's resolve with words. "Luo Si, how utterly foolish you are!"

"Even if you manage to stall me for now, what good will it do?"

"Don't forget, your file still lies in the secret archives of Forgetful River Immortal City! The moment you turned traitor, the order to execute you was sent back!"

"In the next instant, you might be cursed to death by the Cursed Kill Formation."

"Turn back now, forsake darkness for light, and you might yet escape death!"

Luo Si's gaze remained calm and unshaken, devoid of fear or wavering, focused with a near-religious devotion.

It was as if he were once again facing the Abyss, like he had in the Dragon-Severing Gorge when he had been cornered.

"Immortal Hanyan, you needn't remind me. I am well aware of this."

"But I trust the Ash Bone Elder!"

"The moment I led my troops into this place, I received his divine sense transmission."

"My wise lord is before me. I refuse to believe I will be so easily cursed to death."

Immortal Hanyan sneered again. "You're entrusting your life to an outsider? How utterly foolish!"

Luo Si replied, "Years ago, if the Ash Bone Elder hadn't intervened, I would have lost my rationality and clarity long ago, becoming a ghostly creature."

"If he could save me then, why would he harm me now?"

"Throughout the years, if not for his guidance and arrangements, how could I have risen so swiftly?"

Immortal Hanyan roared furiously, "He's using you!"

"Even if he uses me and harms me, the worst I can do is give him my life," Luo Si said with a carefree smile.

"Stubborn fool! Die!" Immortal Hanyan roared, thoroughly enraged. He stopped wasting words and pointed his finger at Luo Si.

Ice Technique: Frozen Kill Line!

A beam of icy blue light shot forth, more condensed and powerful than when he had used it against Ning Zhuoqingyan.

The icy line, like the brush of the King of the Underworld, carried fatal intent as it streaked toward Luo Si's Upper Dantian between his eyebrows, faster than lightning.

Luo Si dodged with astonishing speed.

But Immortal Hanyan merely twitched his finger, and the icy line twisted to follow, moving even faster!

Where the icy line passed, it left behind clear, frosty trails that lingered in the air.

Knowing he couldn't evade, Luo Si violently jerked his fishing rod wrist. The Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook at the end of the line vanished!

Clang!

A crystalline sound, like ice shattering against a glazed bowl, rang out.

The Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook had materialized inside Immortal Hanyan's body.

Luo Si abruptly raised his fishing rod.

Immortal Hanyan sneered, "My Han Yan Dharma Body has long transcended ordinary weaknesses. This is futile - "

His sneer froze mid-word, swiftly replaced by terror.

The Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook tore out a massive chunk of his spiritual energy, life force, and consciousness, ripping through his body and soaring into the air.

Immortal Hanyan immediately focused on defense.

But the attack from the fishing hook and line was utterly ingenious, rendering his usual defensive measures completely ineffective.

Luo Si was struck by the Frozen Kill Line, his entire left arm frozen solid like an ice pop.

Immortal Hanyan's misty body visibly thinned, his aura weakening by nearly a third.

After this exchange, neither gained the upper hand, each scoring a hit.

Their battle continued, soaring from mid-air to the ground, then spiraling upward again in a deadly dance.

Hanyan grew increasingly alarmed as the fight progressed.

He had initially assumed that without Military Power Amplification, Luo Si, a Military Strategist cultivator, might put up a decent fight, but he would never be a match for him.

After a dozen exchanges, his previous assumptions were shattered. He couldn't hide his shock. "He's this formidable without Military Power Amplification. How many rounds could I last against him if he did use it?"

"No!"

"I must eliminate him - using every ounce of my strength!"

Ice Technique: Eternal Ice Hell!

He pressed his palms together, channeling Nascent Soul-level spiritual energy mixed with Military Might, unleashing a cataclysmic blast.

Hanyan's body violently expanded, transforming into a torrential cold current that sacrificed itself to engulf Luo Si.

Wherever it touched, space froze instantly.

Luo Si retreated explosively, but the cold current split apart, circling around to encase him completely.

Finally, the current solidified into a mountain-sized block of ice, sealing Luo Si within its frozen heart.

The iceberg trembled slightly, and Immortal Hanyan's cold laugh echoed from within: "Luo Si, dying beneath my ultimate trump card is an honor sufficient for any warrior."

But in the next instant, an imperceptible fishing line, coiled around Luo Si's frozen body, began to exert its power.

Slithering through the ice like a spiritual serpent, it seemed to ignore the frozen space entirely.

Netherworld Ferrying Line!

The line pierced through the ice, one end emerging from the iceberg.

Luo Si's figure vanished from his frozen position, reappearing at the far end of the fishing line.

Before Immortal Hanyan could react, Luo Si gripped the line and yanked it violently outward.

Fishing Art - World-Swaying Life-Fishing!

Immortal Hanyan let out a pained howl as the entire iceberg shattered into billions of icy fragments.

The countless shards dissolved back into terrifying cold energy.

The cold energy coalesced, attempting to reform into a humanoid shape, but it remained in constant turmoil, unable to solidify.

After a few breaths, like morning mist evaporating under sunlight, it emitted a hissing sound and dissipated completely.

Immortal Hanyan... defeated!

Luo Si's face was pale, his injuries severe, and his Qi plummeting.

After slowly descending to the ground, he arranged the fishing line around himself, urgently resting and healing.

The Qing-Jiao Army had already routed Luo Si's forces.

Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, Qing Yan, and the others were utterly exhausted, their spiritual energy and physical strength nearly depleted.

The situation for the other troops was even more dire.

There was nothing to be done. They numbered only a few hundred, while their opponents were overwhelming in number. The Green Blaze Army fought with all their might, like a snake attempting to swallow an elephant. They fought relentlessly, fearing that their enemies would recover and regroup.

Even if only a portion of the enemy forces reorganized, they would become a tough nut to crack, resulting in significant losses for the Green Blaze Army.

Fortunately, the entire army fought with their lives on the line, united in purpose. Ning Zhuo repeatedly charged alone, while Qing Chi displayed astonishing battlefield intuition, ruthlessly crushing every attempt at enemy reorganization.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Ning Zhuo gasped for breath, while Qing Chi's body was drenched in sweat.

They had achieved remarkable results, but their endurance was at its limit. If they continued fighting, they would collapse before the enemy even had a chance to regroup.

"Damn it!" Ning Zhuo turned back, his expression darkening.

Luo Si's forces were completely shattered, but without a second Green Blaze Army to suppress the Imperial Guard, organized remnants of the enemy forces were beginning to form.
