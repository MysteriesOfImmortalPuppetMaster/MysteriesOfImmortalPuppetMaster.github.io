Chapter 737: This Young Man's Ambition Exceeds Even My Expectations

Within the Martial Arts Formation, Ning Zhuo fell into deep contemplation.

"Judging by Qing Huangzi's intentions, he wants to cancel the Rising Cloud Trial altogether and bestow the inheritance directly upon me."

"While this would save me trouble, what I'd actually gain would be far less than what I'd planned for."

"Without the Rising Cloud Trial, there would be no first-place title. And that's something I need to obtain."

He already possessed a Stone Token. Three more first-place finishes would allow him to upgrade to a higher-tier token.

Having resolved to maintain a high-profile approach, Ning Zhuo wouldn't hesitate now.

"I must seize every opportunity to claim first place and widen the gap between myself and the others!"

"Beyond the first-place title, I also need to cultivate my reputation."

"Many eyes are already on me. If the Rising Cloud Trial is suddenly canceled, some might spread malicious rumors about me under the guise of 'public opinion.'"

"That won't do!"

In the Righteous Path, a good reputation is paramount. Ning Zhuo understood this all too well.

After careful consideration, Ning Zhuo began drafting his reply.

Soon after, Qing Huangzi received a reply and immediately read it with his divine sense.


Esteemed Senior Qing,

Your letter arrived like a thunderclap, filling me with both awe and trepidation! I am but a humble, unlearned junior, a mere commoner. What merit could I possibly possess to warrant such extraordinary favor from a senior like you - to entrust me with your legacy? Every word of your magnificent letter resonates like gold and jade in my heart, each sentence ringing like a great bell awakening my spirit. Your profound insight into the subtlest nuances of the Mechanism has earned my deepest admiration, and your expectations shine brighter than the warmth of spring sunlight.

The art of Mechanisms is not merely about the movement of bones and gears; it is the blade that dissects the essence of things, the bridge that connects the mundane to the profound, the very embodiment of thought itself! I have long cherished this path, often secluding myself in my humble chamber, studying its intricacies with unwavering focus, forgetting food and sleep, yet still feeling time slip away like lightning, my fascination boundless. Now, to hear of your great Dao before me is like a traveler lost in darkness finally seeing the North Star, or parched land suddenly blessed with life-giving rain!

The trust you have placed in me weighs heavier than a thousand jun. I hereby pledge to exhaust my intellect, to pour my life's essence into this art, to meticulously refine this craft! I vow to not merely inherit the profound principles and mystical sounds of the Mechanism, but to illuminate and amplify them through my own hands! Your aspirations, and those of your esteemed master, shall become the guiding stars of my life, a path I will follow to the death without regret.

However, I have one humble request, which I earnestly hope you will grant: I still wish to participate in the Rising Cloud Trial!

I dare not question Senior's discerning judgment, nor do I harbor any luck or covet empty fame. My sole concerns lie in preserving my "posthumous reputation" and maintaining the "Purity of the Dao Tradition."

The Sect is vast, and public opinion is fickle. If I were to receive the True Inheritance without undergoing the Rising Cloud Trial, it would inevitably arouse suspicion among petty minds. They might accuse Senior of favoritism, violating established customs, or even slander the lineage of our esteemed master, claiming it has become lax and lacks worthy successors. Such rumors, like three men claiming to have seen a tiger, could tarnish Senior's hard-earned reputation and dishonor our master's memory. I would bear an unpardonable guilt for such a calamity!

Participating in the Rising Cloud Trial offers two distinct advantages:

First, the trial serves as a whetstone to refine my skills and validate my training. Through practical combat, I can deepen my understanding of the profound depths of Senior's teachings.

Second, demonstrating my strength through the trial will serve as irrefutable proof to my fellow Sect members. If I were fortunate enough to emerge victorious, claiming the mantle of True Inheritor would be both legitimate and justified, silencing all dissent. This would dispel any unwarranted ambitions among lesser individuals and silence their baseless criticisms, making it clear to all that Senior's decision today stems not from personal sentiment, but from his discerning eye, like a true connoisseur recognizing a fine steed.

Entrusted with Senior's weighty responsibility, I carry this burden in my heart. Whether I succeed or fail in the trial is irrelevant to my personal honor or disgrace; what truly matters is the integrity of my Dao Heart!

Victory would honorably uphold Senior's reputation for discerning talent; defeat would equally demonstrate the strict standards by which the Dao Tradition chooses its inheritors!

I earnestly implore Senior to grant this humble request!

Written with fervent sincerity, I wish you peace and well-being.

Respectfully submitted by your junior, Ning Zhuo.


Qing Huangzi read the letter three times with his divine sense before exhaling a long, trembling breath, thick with complex emotions.

"Good... what a remarkable person, Ning Zhuo! A true embodiment of 'Purity of the Dao Tradition' and 'Worthy of the Name'!" His voice was hoarse, yet carried an unexpected tremor of fervent admiration and burning satisfaction.

"This young man's vision, his unwavering resolve, his profound foresight, and his boundless spirit... they far surpass my expectations!"

Qingzhuzi's gaze pierced through the paper as if he could see the white-robed youth writing the reply with utmost reverence. The young man sat upright, his posture as straight as a mountain peak, his face solemn, radiating unwavering righteousness.

"He shows neither arrogance nor complacency! Even after receiving my approval, he displays not a hint of pride, impatience, or negligence. Instead, he treats this opportunity as a burden of immense weight, pondering its significance with utmost seriousness!"

"He doesn't shirk responsibility, he embraces it! He shows no fear of the dangers of the Rising Cloud Trial, volunteering to continue and willingly entering the fierce competition to prove himself! This isn't about empty fame, but about preserving the honor of this old man and my late master!"

"What a remarkable youth!" Qing Huangzi exclaimed, his excitement growing with each thought. He couldn't help but rise and pace the narrow cave, his steps lighter than usual.

"How could I betray such a promising talent and his earnest intentions? How could I allow his noble heart to be tarnished?"

"In that case, I must lend him my support."

The next day, Green Bamboo Peak.

The stone platform was already surrounded by a sea of people.

"So many people have come," Jiang Xiaobian marveled, a hint of nervousness in his voice.

"Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Trial is different from most. He's choosing his successor," Zhang Xiaodan replied.

"No, that alone wouldn't draw such a crowd. There's only one reason..." Old Patchwork Sun shook his head, but before he could finish, a commotion rippled through the crowd.

"Am I seeing things?"

"No, no, it's definitely Ning Zhuo!"

The observing cultivators erupted into shouts and exclamations, countless pairs of burning, curious eyes turning toward Ning Zhuo as he descended on a cloud.

Ning Zhuo had anticipated this reception. With a serene smile, he descended from the Cloud Head, clasped his hands in a respectful bow, and exuded the refined demeanor of a scion of a great clan.

The cultivators in the crowd returned his bow in unison.

Many showered Ning Zhuo with flattery: "Young Master Ning Zhuo's participation guarantees victory!"

"It's an honor to witness Young Master Ning Zhuo sweep through the trials!"

"No one can stand in your way!"

Ning Zhuo keenly sensed the malice hidden beneath these flattering words, but his smile only deepened, as if he were completely oblivious.

The crowd parted automatically, clearing a path for Ning Zhuo to approach the stone platform with measured grace.

There, he recognized many familiar faces.

"Greetings, everyone. It's good to see you again," he said, taking the initiative to greet Old Patchwork Sun, Chen San, Jiang Xiaobian, Zhang Xiaodan, Huo Wa'er, and others.

Ning Zhuo had hosted a banquet for these individuals, establishing a superficial acquaintance with them.

The group returned his greetings in unison.

Some cultivators who had declined Ning Zhuo's invitation to the previous banquet now regretted their decision. If only I had accepted, they thought, I could have forged a connection with Ning Zhuo.

Old Patchwork Sun clasped his hands in a hasty bow, echoing Ning Zhuo's earlier sentiment with even greater humility and deference.

Jiang Dabian pursed his lips, appearing even more relaxed.

The others also felt the pressure because of Huo Wa'er.

Only Huo Wa'er showed an unwilling expression, shouting that even if Ning Zhuo was strong, he wouldn't admit defeat.

Ning Zhuo smiled and accepted the challenge on the spot.

Qing Huangzi materialized and immediately announced the rules for the seventh round of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

Beneath the stone platform, cultivators could only use Sound Control to manipulate their Bamboo Warriors in a chaotic free-for-all. During the battle, Qing Huangzi would personally interfere by emitting discordant sound notes, disrupting everyone's Sound Control.

As Qing Huangzi announced the rules, the entire arena fell silent.

Chen San, Huo Wa'er, and the others listened intently. When the announcement ended, they exchanged glances, each sensing the other's excitement.

The cultivators who had come specifically to observe immediately began communicating through divine sense.

"These rules put Ning Zhuo at a great disadvantage."

"Exactly! If I were participating, I'd immediately form an alliance to take down Ning Zhuo first!"

"Qing Huangzi's rules don't prohibit alliances at all. This effectively forces Ning Zhuo to face everyone else alone."

"Not necessarily. Maybe Ning Zhuo has already contacted other cultivators in advance and reached some kind of understanding."

Qing Huangzi descended gracefully, settling onto the stone seat at the side.

With a deliberate stomp of his foot, he activated the Formation, instantly erecting two barriers that enveloped the entire stone platform.

"Everyone, step onto the platform!" Qing Huangzi called out.

All the cultivators participating in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial stepped forward, standing at the edge of the platform.

They stood with their backs against the outer hemispherical barrier, facing the inner barrier.

Qing Huangzi continued, "Release your Bamboo Puppet armies."

Ning Zhuo and the others complied.

Soon, the stone platform was swarming with hundreds of miniature Bamboo Warriors.

These intricate Mechanical Puppets, each crafted by a different cultivator, bore distinct personal styles.

Old Patchwork Sun's Bamboo Puppet, for instance, looked dilapidated, as if cobbled together from mismatched mechanical parts, with many joints twisted askew. The Bamboo Warriors stood in sparse, uneven rows.

In contrast, White Runner Chen San's Bamboo Puppet was noticeably smaller and more agile, equipped with needle tubes and jade discs, exuding a sinister aura.

Jiang Dabian's Bamboo Puppets were particularly bizarre, each with beetle-like carapaces on their backs. Some sported wasp-like stingers, while others wielded scorpion-like tail needles.

Iron Drum Zhang Xiaodan's Bamboo Puppets numbered only eight, but they were the largest on the platform. Each one was completely encased in heavy armor, from head to toe.

The Bamboo Warriors stood solid and immovable, resembling eight miniature fortresses.

Huo Wa'er's Firearm Child Bamboo Buddha carried a string of cannonballs on its back, but the ceramic shells were empty and lacked fuses.

Ning Zhuo's Bamboo Warriors were the most striking.

Each warrior was unique, their arrangement seemingly complex yet governed by an ironclad logic. Every joint moved smoothly, and though each puppet had its flaws, when standing still, they resembled an elite army poised for battle, their silence radiating a chilling sharpness.

Qing Huangzi sat regally on the elevated dais, his expression as calm as an ancient well, though a flicker of anticipation danced deep within his eyes.

"The Rising Cloud Minor Trial begins now!" As his words rang out, nearly all the Bamboo Warriors on the stone platform sprang into action.

Their attack was unified, their blades aimed squarely at Ning Zhuo's Bamboo Warrior formation!

"Charge! Give them everything you've got!" Huo Wa'er roared, striking a bronze gong. His Bamboo Buddha brought up the rear.

Zhang Xiaodan pounded his waist drum, driving his eight heavily armored giants forward with relentless momentum, steadily closing in on Ning Zhuo's Bamboo Buddha formation.

Chen San's sharp eyes glinted as he whistled incessantly, maneuvering his Bamboo Warriors away from the main force to flank Ning Zhuo's formation from the right.

Jiang Dabian blew his bamboo flute, emitting a piercing, eerie melody that split his insect-like Bamboo Warriors into a swarm, each darting forward like a sharpened blade.

The spectators watched the scene unfold, some cheering wildly for Ning Zhuo, others gleefully anticipating a spectacle of failure.

Still others secretly harbored envious thoughts: If only we could see Ning Zhuo humiliated here, defeated in public - that would be a sight to behold!

Qing Huangzi couldn't help but glance at Ning Zhuo, poised to activate his sonic techniques and intervene at any moment.

He had meticulously designed the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, ensuring his control through its rules. If Ning Zhuo failed to react swiftly, Qing Huangzi would unleash a torrent of sonic notes, disrupting the entire battlefield.

If he can withstand the combined might of everyone else, I'll declare him the champion without a single objection!

This next moment presents a crucial opportunity. If he seizes it, he might yet turn the tide.

Come on, show me your true strength!

Qing Huangzi held deep expectations for Ning Zhuo.

In the next instant, chaos erupted within the temporary Bamboo Buddha Union Army. Many Bamboo Puppets went berserk, some halting abruptly, others charging wildly, and some even collapsing into pieces on the spot.

"What's happening?" Old Patchwork Sun and the others paled in alarm.

A glint flashed in Chen San's eyes as he immediately grasped the situation and transmitted a message through divine sense.

Simultaneously, a cultivator cried out: "We're all using Sound Control, drawing from the same Fundamental Reed Flute Manual! The overlapping sounds are creating interference and internal conflict!"

The others instantly understood.

The onlookers grew somber.

"So, the Rising Cloud Minor Trial wasn't as simple as it seemed on the surface. There were hidden depths."

"Of course Qing Huangzi would devise a complex trial to select his successor!"

"Heh, if I were him, I'd just hand the inheritance to Ning Zhuo and be done with it. Why bother with a trial?"

"But then we wouldn't get to see such a good show!"

"True!"

The Bamboo Union Army descended into chaos, their overall offensive grinding to a halt.

Ning Zhuo, expressionless, waved his arm, summoning a Magic Artifact-grade guzheng from the Void.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, the young leader pressed two fingers of his right hand against the strings.

He plucked lightly.

Zing!

A sharp, piercing note erupted, like metal being forcibly torn apart.

With that resonant strike, Ning Zhuo's Bamboo Puppet squad surged forward!

Following that, Ning Zhuo's right hand danced with seven fingers, moving so swiftly they left trails of white afterimages.

A series of piercing, high-pitched noises suddenly swept across the battlefield without warning!

The abrupt sonic assault felt like countless steel needles piercing the eardrums of every cultivator present.

"What is that sound?"

"It's unbearable!"

"Ugh... I'm going to vomit."

The noise resembled fingernails scraping across glazed glass - razor-sharp and utterly maddening.

Old Patchwork Sun and his forces were severely affected, plunging the entire Bamboo Union Army into even greater chaos.

Ning Zhuo's Bamboo Puppet squadron seized the opportunity to drive deep into the retreating ranks, cutting through the enemy lines with unstoppable momentum.

Before the competition, Huo Wa'er had humbly challenged Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo had promptly granted his wish.

In mere moments, Huo Wa'er's Bamboo Warriors had been utterly decimated by Ning Zhuo.

"No!" Huo Wa'er's eyes widened in despair and fury as he roared in disbelief.
