Chapter 680: A Golden Core Trying to Please a Foundation Establishment - Is This Right?

Boulder Cave Residence.

Five or six exquisite dishes adorned the circular stone table.

Yu Heye sat at the head of the table, naturally reserving the guest of honor's seat for Ning Zhuo. Besides the two of them, the only other guests were Shen Xi and Su Lingkou, cousins by blood.

"Young Master Ning, please try this dish," Yu Heye said with a smile, gesturing toward a steaming cauldron. "It's called Nine Peaks Sea-Quelling Soup. The broth is made from fermented dough crafted from nine-colored spiritual rice flour, simmered in seawater. The dough is then stewed in a magic treasure-grade Tao's Cauldron and infused with Golden Rock Marrow. If the Spirit Chef's skill is exceptional, the process can even yield Earthen Essence Refinement."

As Yu Heye spoke, he lifted the lid of the cauldron.

A moment later, a brownish-yellow mist, streaked with nine-colored radiance, erupted from the cauldron. Within this swirling mist, three illusory mountain peaks materialized briefly before vanishing.

Shen Xi, a noble young master from a prominent clan, was visibly surprised. "Those are three illusory mountain peaks," he exclaimed. "This means the Earthen Essence Refinement in the cauldron must contain at least three pieces.

"To prepare such a dish requires a Spirit Chef of extraordinary skill. Senior Yu, may I ask which master chef from the Mountain Gate you commissioned?"

Yu Heye chuckled, secretly pleased that Shen Xi recognized the quality. He seized the opportunity and announced, "This is the work of Tao An, the Warm Cauldron Hermit."

Su Lingkou immediately exclaimed, "So it's Chef Tao, the Golden Core-level master! No wonder this Spirit Food is so extraordinary."

Though she was new to the area, she had already heard of Tao An's reputation.

Golden Core-level Spirit Chefs were almost always head chefs or grand chefs.

While Nascent Soul-level Spirit Chefs existed, they rarely served the public market, preferring to cater to small, exclusive circles.

In the regular market, the highest-level cultivators whose services were consistently available to the public were those at the Golden Core level.

"Young Master Ning, please try some," Yu Heye said, personally scooping a spoonful of the viscous, honey-like soup from Tao's Cauldron, along with a piece of Earthen Essence Refinement, and placing it in Ning Zhuo's bowl.

The soup was thick and translucent, shimmering like liquid amber.

Ning Zhuo took a spoonful and felt as if he had swallowed a mouthful of warm quicksand. Initially, a robust, salty flavor with a hint of bitterness filled his mouth, but this quickly gave way to a clear, sweet aftertaste that surged from the back of his tongue, like mountain spring water infused with wildflower honey.

As Ning Zhuo swallowed, the soup slid down his throat, and his spine straightened involuntarily.

A torrent of Earth Spirit energy cascaded down like a waterfall, plunging directly into Ning Zhuo's stomach, bringing with it a powerful sense of weight and grounding.

The Earth Spirit energy rapidly vaporized, transforming into a warm, golden light that permeated Ning Zhuo's entire body.

His muscles strengthened, his meridians widened, and his heartbeat settled into a steady rhythm. Accumulated toxins were purged from his system along with the golden light.

After just eight breaths, Ning Zhuo had fully digested the Spirit Food. He felt a significant improvement in his physical body's defense and endurance, and nodded in satisfaction.

Yu Heye was astonished.

Having consumed this particular Spirit Food dish many times, he knew its benefits were excellent, but it also had a major drawback: its difficulty to digest.

He never imagined Ning Zhuo could digest it so quickly.

At least, as far as he could tell with the naked eye, he seemed to have digested it.

It took Yu Heye six breaths to digest this Spirit Food.

Don't let his Foundation Establishment realm fool you - his physical body's foundation is remarkably strong!

Suppressing his surprise, Yu Heye turned to Ning Zhuo with a beaming smile. "Young Master Ning, how do you feel?"

Ning Zhuo replied, "Excellent, excellent."

Then he turned to Shen Xi and Su Lingkou. "You two should try it as well. It's quite beneficial."

Shen Xi and Su Lingkou each took a spoonful, their expressions immediately changing. They closed their eyes and began circulating their qi at the dining table.

Shen Xi circulated his qi for over thirty breaths, while Su Lingkou reached fifty-six breaths before fully digesting the food.

A faint golden glow still lingered on Su Lingkou's face as she exclaimed with genuine delight, "Truly a masterpiece forged by a Golden Core-level chef!"

Shen Xi, now recovered, turned to Ning Zhuo, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.

"Ning Zhuo's physical body foundation seems extraordinarily robust!"

"At least, his digestive capacity far surpasses mine."

"Is he primarily cultivating the Essence Sea in his Lower Dantian?"

With this thought, Shen Xi openly praised Ning Zhuo's physical cultivation.

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "Alas, I still have a long way to go. This meager physical cultivation is nothing to boast about."

Shen Xi and Yu Heye exchanged speechless glances.

Ning Zhuo's expression was sincere, his sigh heartfelt.

His physical cultivation paled in comparison to the depth of his soul foundation!

Ning Zhuo's soul already contained the spirits of a million souls, but his inadequate physical cultivation had long stalled his soul's progress.

Recently, his skin had even turned a sickly gray-blue, unable to bear the weight of his powerful soul.

The situation had only improved slightly. Ning Zhuo still had a long and arduous path ahead.

"Young Master Ning, this is Golden Needle Mushroom Crisp. What do you think of the flavor?" Yu Heye picked up the serving chopsticks and placed more golden needle mushrooms on Ning Zhuo's plate.

The mushrooms were slender and coated in a layer of dazzling gold powder that shimmered brightly.

Ning Zhuo ate them. As the Spirit Food entered his mouth, it immediately transformed into a gentle, flowing stream upon chewing.

The stream rapidly coursed through his body, clearing away all internal stagnation and blockages.

Shen Xi and Su Lingkou exchanged covert glances, astonished.

They had never heard of Yu Heye treating a Foundation Establishment cultivator with such warmth and hospitality.

This was highly unusual!

Shen Xi's mind raced with speculation. "What method did Ning Zhuo use to earn Yu Heye's favor?"

"And... is it just my imagination?"

"I can't shake the feeling that this show of equality is laced with a hint of fawning?"

Shen Xi possessed keen insight and exceptional observational skills.

Though he recognized this possibility, he couldn't quite convince himself to believe it, as it seemed utterly absurd.

Yu Heye ate very little himself, focusing instead on serving Ning Zhuo.

This excessive attentiveness made Ning Zhuo uncomfortable. Adopting a deliberately aloof tone, he said, "I can serve myself, Senior Yu. You're being too kind. Please, enjoy your meal."

Yu Heye burst into hearty laughter. "Many thanks for your concern, Young Master Ning!"

Shen Xi remained silent.

Su Lingkou, however, felt puzzled. How could the intelligence reports describe Yu Heye as volatile and quick-tempered, when in reality he's so warm and approachable? she wondered.

Seeing Ning Zhuo's refusal, Yu Heye immediately stopped.

He shifted his approach, patiently waiting for Ning Zhuo to take a few bites of the delicacies before saying, "Young Master Ning, I have some cultivation dilemmas I'd like to seek your guidance on."

Su Lingkou: ?!

The intelligence reports never mentioned Yu Heye being so studious and humble, did they?

The rumors always painted him as volatile and quick-tempered. Could they all be false?

Shen Xi's lips twitched slightly. Yu Heye is showing such deference to a Foundation Establishment cultivator? he thought. And using the pretense of seeking guidance to curry favor? This is going too far, beneath the dignity of a Golden Core cultivator.

But then, right before Shen Xi and Su Lingkou, Yu Heye actually began asking Ning Zhuo about the core principles of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art.

Ning Zhuo set down his chopsticks, his expression turning serious and earnest as he shared his insights.

Shen Xi's disbelief deepened. He's actually treating this seriously.

But as he listened, his expression gradually shifted, becoming equally serious and earnest.

Ning Zhuo's responses were always precise and insightful. More importantly, he skillfully used analogies to explain complex concepts in a way that was remarkably clear and easy to understand, leaving everyone deeply enlightened.

Su Lingkou quickly noticed this.

The cousins gradually set down their chopsticks, focusing entirely on listening. As for Yu Heye, he had long stopped eating, his posture radiating a desire to learn. The dining table had transformed into a lecture hall.

Ning Zhuo spoke eloquently, becoming the undisputed master of the situation.

Knowing Yu Heye's limited understanding of the Five Elements, particularly the Metal and Earth Elements, he focused his explanations on these areas.

Yu Heye initially listened intently, his face lighting up with joy and sudden comprehension. But as Ning Zhuo continued, his eyes grew hazy, his focus drifting.

Observing his expression, Ning Zhuo immediately realized that Yu Heye's comprehension had reached its limit. Continuing further would be counterproductive, so he wisely brought the discussion to a close.

This left Shen Xi and Su Lingkou deeply disappointed.

Su Lingkou gazed at Ning Zhuo, her eyes shining with admiration. Young Master Ning Zhuo is truly insightful! My cousin's brilliance shines through - he spotted such a talented individual in the crowd at once.

Shen Xi clasped his hands in a respectful bow toward Ning Zhuo, sincerely impressed. "Hearing your words, Fellow Daoist Ning, is worth ten years of study! What an honor it is to share this meal with you today."

He clasped his hands and bowed to Yu Heye, thanking him for the opportunity that had greatly benefited him.

Yu Heye waved his hand, first expressing his respect for the Shen Clan of Nine Palaces Immortal City and for Shen Xi himself, before turning to Ning Zhuo to convey his gratitude and admiration.

This time, Shen Xi no longer felt that Yu Heye was merely flattering him.

The reason was simple: Ning Zhuo possessed genuine talent and ability!

Shen Xi's eyes gleamed as he stared at Ning Zhuo, his voice fervent. "I wish I could share wine and late-night strolls with Fellow Daoist Ning, talking endlessly without rest!"

Ning Zhuo waved his hand. "As the saying goes, every inch has its strength, and every foot has its weakness. My Qi Sea Dantian is primarily cultivated with the Five Elements Technique, so I have some understanding of the Five Elements' transformations and arrangements. But I'm still far, far away from becoming a true master."

At that moment, Ning Zhuo thought of the Five Elements Divine Lord and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

Su Lingkou stuck out her tongue. "Is that what you call 'some understanding'?"

Yu Heye's Adam's apple bobbed. He found Ning Zhuo's humility a bit excessive. Given his own temperament, he usually despised such affectations from noble scions.

If it were him, he would have held his head high and proudly declared, "This is my personal ability, my excellence. Ordinary people can't match it."

But Ning Zhuo's words...

Yu Heye resigned himself to the situation.

After all, Ning Zhuo had saved his life.

Even if the elder hidden near Ning Zhuo had intervened, their deliberate concealment suggested they wanted Ning Zhuo to receive the credit.

Yu Heye understood this perfectly and immediately attributed the life-saving debt to Ning Zhuo.

What a charmer! Ning Zhuo's humble demeanor greatly appealed to Shen Xi.

Shen Xi, hailing from the prestigious Shen Clan of Nine Palaces Immortal City, had been raised in nobility and rigorously trained. Had he been in Ning Zhuo's position, he would have adopted the same modest approach.

This made Shen Xi feel a strong affinity for Ning Zhuo, seeing him as a kindred spirit.

Ning Zhuo then looked up at Shen Xi, his expression sincere. "The name of the Shen Clan of Nine Palaces Immortal City has long resounded in my ears like thunder."

"It is a great honor to meet Fellow Daoist Shen Xi."

"To be honest, I've always been deeply interested in formations. However, I'm not very familiar with the Nine Palaces Formation. I usually rely on the Five Elements Formation."

Shen Xi laughed heartily, his mood buoyant.

Ning Zhuo's compliments to the Shen Clan filled Shen Xi with pride.

Previously, such praise from Ning Zhuo wouldn't have pleased Shen Xi so much. But now, through Yu Heye's persistent questioning, comprehension, confirmation, and further inquiry, Ning Zhuo had revealed the profound depth of his mastery over the Five Elements.

While Shen Xi couldn't fathom the full extent of Ning Zhuo's expertise, he was certain that Ning Zhuo far surpassed him in this domain.

That alone was enough!

To think that someone as young as Ning Zhuo had already surpassed Shen Xi in this field, even capable of serving as a teacher to a Golden Core cultivator like Yu Heye - this was an extraordinary achievement!

Of course, the cultivation world possessed countless methods, including miraculous techniques for preserving youth. Yet, after interacting with Ning Zhuo, Shen Xi felt certain that the young man couldn't be much older than himself.

This was primarily because Ning Zhuo still possessed an air of innocence and curiosity, lacking the world-weariness characteristic of middle-aged or elderly individuals.

Shen Xi's position in Nine Palaces Immortal City had exposed him to a wide range of people, a result of the Shen Clan's deliberate cultivation of his skills. Consequently, he possessed an exceptional ability to discern character.

"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo may appear younger, but I suspect he's actually a bit older than me - perhaps a decade or so," Shen Xi, who was thirty years old in name only, mused.

He had greatly underestimated Ning Zhuo's mastery of the Five Elements, but the palpable difference in their cultivation levels led Shen Xi to estimate Ning Zhuo's age accordingly.

Shen Xi immediately said, "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo's profound understanding of the Five Elements is truly enviable. Your Five Elements Formations must be extraordinary as well."

Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up. "I've recently gained some insights. I'd be grateful to learn from Fellow Daoist Shen."

"I wouldn't dare," Shen Xi replied hastily.

Yet Ning Zhuo proactively revealed the Five Elements Formation he had designed.

Yu Heye immediately recognized the underlying principles of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art within the design.

Shen Xi listened intently, his brow furrowing slightly. "Fellow Daoist Ning, are you planning to create a Five Elements Formation Plate?"

Ning Zhuo answered truthfully, "Fellow Daoist Shen, you're mostly correct. To be precise, I'm designing a Five Elements Mechanism Component."

This wasn't merely a pretext he had concocted.

The truth was this: his study of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art and his manipulation of Yu Heye's Chaotic Five Elements Golden Core had, through practical application, sparked a wealth of inspiration.

During his battle with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, his cultivation level had been too low. Relying on the Black Iron Han Armor - Golden Swallow, he had repeatedly dodged and narrowly escaped death. This intensely stimulating combat experience had fueled his determination to further refine the Black Iron Han Armor.

"These are still just ideas, not yet fully developed," Ning Zhuo said, directly sharing his thoughts.

Shen Xi's brow furrowed deeper. "I understand, Fellow Daoist Ning is refining the armor's mechanisms, intending to use them as a source of Spiritual Energy."

"But... isn't using a Golden Core as the core excessively extravagant?"

Shen Xi phrased his concern delicately, but his underlying meaning was clear: We're just humble Foundation Establishment cultivators. Isn't using someone else's Golden Core as a consumable resource a bit too ambitious?

Yu Heye, listening nearby, broke into a cold sweat, remembering the Five Elements Golden Core residing within his own body.

Little did he know, Ning Zhuo possessed over a hundred Golden Cores!
