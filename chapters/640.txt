Chapter 640: Invoking Divine Assistance

"Ceremonial Barracks?" Qing Chi's eyes lit up at Ning Zhuo's reminder. She retrieved a paper model from her Storage Belt.

The model, smaller than a young girl's palm, rested in her palm, exquisitely crafted like a child's toy. The entire barracks was constructed from a peculiar pale talisman paper, meticulously folded, cut, and assembled. Windows, gates, watchtowers, and even a miniature altar in the central plaza were all clearly visible, the level of detail astonishing. A scent of incense ash mixed with icy grave soil emanated from the structure.

This was the Ceremonial Barracks, a major military armament of immense cost. Neither Qing Chi nor Ning Zhuo could possibly create it, nor could they afford it. It had been lent to them by the City Lord of the White Paper Immortal City.

In the process of raising an army, there was a crucial step called "military armament." A large quantity of such armaments was required to complete even the most basic formation of an army. The City Lord of the White Paper Immortal City had generously lent the Qing-Jiao Army a substantial amount of military armaments, including not only the Ceremonial Barracks, but also Bone Blade Battle Flags, Crescent Moon Greatswords, Void-Piercing Spears, and Black Blood Paper Horses.

There was only one Ceremonial Barracks.

Immediately, Qing Chi channeled spiritual energy and Military Might into the Ceremonial Barracks in her hand.

Her total spiritual energy was insufficient to activate this Military Armament, but the Qing-Jiao Army now possessed abundant Military Might.

In an instant, vast amounts of Military Might were drained, completely consumed by the Ceremonial Barracks.

The paper barracks soared into the air and hung motionless.

Then, countless intricate runes erupted across its surface, swirling, intertwining, and merging.

The runes' radiance intensified, growing brighter and brighter.

The paper barracks began to swell against the wind.

The folded paper walls unfurled like blooming flowers, layer by layer, hardening and rising! In the blink of an eye, a towering dark-green stone wall, etched with solemn Ghost Runes and beast-headed totems, stood majestically complete! The parapets along the wall's crest interlocked like jagged teeth.

Watchtowers, barracks, stables, parade grounds... all structures materialized from thin air under the flow of runes, transforming from paper into cold stone, netherworld iron, and spectral wood!

At the heart of the barracks, the miniature altar from the model had grown into a nine-tiered white bone altar, each side three meters wide! Its flat top bore a massive, complex Formation, radiating a mysterious aura that seemed capable of channeling the will of ghosts and deities.

The sudden appearance of the Ceremonial Barracks elicited a wave of exclamations from the Qing-Jiao Army.

Though astonished, the soldiers remained motionless, their Black Blood Paper Horses proving remarkably stable and reliable.

Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi, however, remained calm.

The two had privately examined all the Military Armaments beforehand, including this very Ceremonial Barracks.

"Enter the barracks! Ascend the altar!" Qing Chi commanded. The Qing-Jiao Army swiftly and orderly streamed into the newly appeared sanctuary, ultimately forming a solemn formation below the altar.

Qing Chi led the way, with Ning Zhuo following slightly behind her, as they simultaneously ascended the sacrificial altar.

Qing Chi channeled Military Might, activating the altar.

Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, produced a massive quantity of Azure-Purple Talisman Coins and tossed them into the center of the formation.

The formation began to activate, emitting a gray light. The gray light coalesced into a wave that suddenly radiated outward in all directions. Its expansion was incredibly swift, reaching the horizon in an instant before vanishing at the edge of vision.

Qing Chi began to pray:

"With bones as kindling, and souls as incense,

O Exalted Gods who reign over the Netherworld, unmatched in power!

We offer thirty thousand talisman coins in sacrifice, beseeching your divine mercy.

Grant us your sacred power, that we may soar through the heavens!"

"Whatever the response, the entire Qing-Jiao Army will forever cherish this divine grace and offer three times the number of Talisman Coins after the war!"

Qing Chi's prayer sent ripples through the very fabric of space.

Buzz!

A will as heavy as a mountain and as decayed as a ten-thousand-year-old tomb suddenly descended!

The air above the altar twisted, revealing a colossal skeletal giant seated upon a throne of bones, crowned with a thorny diadem.

The Bone Mountain God!

His icy gaze swept across the Ceremonial Barracks, lingering on the thirty thousand Azure-Purple Talisman Coins on the altar as if they were worthless trash.

In the next instant, the god's phantom let out a thunderous snort, thick with disdain, and vanished in an instant!

Three breaths later.

Swish, swish...

A sound like underground streams in a cavern echoed in the soldiers' ears.

Another will arrived.

Above the sacrificial altar, countless flowing water apparitions materialized, within which a conch shell pulsed in and out of view.

The natural patterns on the conch shell formed a massive eye.

The eye rotated, indifferently examining the sacrificial offerings. An invisible force tugged at the ghostfire on the altar, nearly distorting its shape.

The sound of flowing water in the soldiers' ears grew much louder.

Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes. "It seems to be communicating."

But Qing Chi, the commander of the army, looked utterly bewildered.

After a few breaths, the giant eye on the seashell showed clear disappointment and weariness, withdrawing its Divine Intent.

The seashell suspended in mid-air and the swirling currents of energy dispersed like smoke in the wind.

Tingling...

The third God took notice of this.

From the Sacrificial Altar came a series of tinkling sounds, like ice crystals colliding.

Then, countless shattered mirror fragments materialized in the air, and a voice resonating with endless echoes sounded in the hearts of every soldier:

"Ants..."

"These meager offerings..."

"Increase the quantity..."

"Sacrifice yourselves..."

Ning Zhuo's expression changed, and he sent a thought through his divine sense: "Qing Chi."

Qing Chi nodded and quickly activated the Formation to block out this Divine Intent.

This world was home to many Gods. Some were righteous, like the Celestial God Contract, while others were wicked, like the Wandering God.

Whether righteous or wicked, benevolent or malevolent, all could be dealt with.

But the Shattered Mirror Mother was different.

She was a God of the Strange Path!

One moment she might seal a Divine Contract with you, and the next, she'd turn her back on you without reason.

The truly terrifying thing was that her capriciousness wasn't driven by self-interest or some hidden agenda, but by the very nature of the Strange Path itself - utterly incomprehensible and unpredictable.

After three consecutive failures, Qing Chi turned slightly and glanced at Ning Zhuo, communicating telepathically through their divine sense: "Should we add more sacrificial offerings?"

Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head. "I've studied the deities of the Underworld extensively. Invoking deities isn't just about the quantity of offerings; it also depends on the person conducting the sacrifice. Since I'm already participating, my life essence alone is sufficient to attract many ghosts and deities. We mustn't add too many offerings! Otherwise, we'll attract deities with overwhelming power. If their divine power manifests through the sacrificial altar, we won't be able to withstand it. If they harbor any malicious intentions, we'll become living sacrifices."

"Our goal is the Night Wanderer. These minor deities are numerous. Let's wait a little longer; we should receive a response soon. No need to rush."

Qing Chi nodded. "Little Ma, I'll follow your lead."

No sooner had she spoken than a response came from the sacrificial altar.

Whoosh...

A gust of wind swept across the air.

A tall, ethereal figure materialized. Draped in a massive cloak, the shadow beneath its hood was bottomless, with only two flickering, pinprick-sized globules of phosphorus fire serving as eyes. The figure's limbs were unnaturally slender, concealed within billowing sleeves and pant legs. Its movements were utterly silent, like a massive, living kite silhouette.

It was a Night Wanderer!

The Night Wanderer hovered above the altar, its two pale phosphorus fire "eyes" sweeping across the Ceremonial Barracks before settling on the thirty thousand Azure-Purple Talisman Coins.

"You seek... to tread upon the void?"

Qing Chi nodded, offering another prayer in reverence.

"This wish... is small... very small..." the Night Wanderer replied, implying it was a trivial matter.

Qing Chi turned to Ning Zhuo, who gave her a slight nod.

Soon, the Divine Contract was sealed in the ethereal realm.

Qing Chi fully activated the Formation, creating a stable passage.

The Night Wanderer's cloak stirred slightly as a hand, concealed within its wide sleeve, emerged.

The hand was gaunt and deathly pale, with long, claw-like nails. A faint yin wind coiled around its fingertips.

It pointed at the assembled soldiers of the Qing-Jiao Army.

In the next instant, the entire Qing-Jiao Army involuntarily rose into the air, hovering three feet above the ground.

Having accomplished this, the Night Wanderer withdrew its hand and swept its sleeve.

The thirty thousand Azure-Purple Talisman Coins on the altar vanished in an instant.

"It worked!" Qing Chi exhaled a mouthful of turbid qi, her forehead glistening with fine sweat.

Ning Zhuo, however, remained deep in thought. "Mother always said my fate was unique. Now I see she was right!"

"Thirty thousand Talisman Coins shouldn't have attracted so much attention."

"The first three Underworld deities are all exceptionally powerful. The Bone Mountain God is one of the most formidable deities of the Underworld, his divine name renowned far and wide. As for the conch-shaped deity, he's shrouded in mystery. I don't know his name, but even from his shadowy form, I can tell he's extremely difficult to deal with."

"Let alone the third, the Shattered Mirror Mother, the God of the Strange Path. Even the first two would likely choose to keep their distance from her."

"Even the final deity, the Night Wanderer, is far from ordinary."

"Judging by its might, it clearly possesses formidable combat power. It likely isn't far from attaining a Unique Divine Name."

Ning Zhuo reined in his thoughts and descended the sacrificial altar with Qing Chi.

The sacrifice had succeeded. The divine spell released by the Night Wanderer now encompassed the entire Qing-Jiao Army.

After studying it, Qing Chi, Ning Zhuo, and the others discovered that this divine spell indeed granted them the ability to hover in the air, temporarily granting them flight.

Though not permanent, the spell's duration was sufficient for an intense battle.

"Even if things go south, we can still deploy the Ceremonial Barracks on the front lines and continue seeking divine assistance," Qing Chi said optimistically.

The Ceremonial Barracks could be rapidly deployed and retracted, with minimal setup and teardown time. This was a tremendous advantage.

Qing Chi and Ning Zhuo had long considered this very scenario: on the battlefield, if the situation turned against them, they could immediately deploy the barracks to gain defensive capabilities, as well as time to catch their breath and tend to injuries.

Ning Zhuo pondered, "Though everyone can fly, combat capability is another matter entirely."

"Sharpening a spear on the battlefield - though it may not be sharp, at least it's ready."

"Let's have everyone practice first. Otherwise, flying into the sky would be pure suicide!"

This suggestion immediately garnered Qing Yan's approval.

Qing Chi, though the commander, followed Ning Zhuo's advice almost unquestioningly. She immediately began drilling her troops on the spot.

Ning Zhuo, Jiao Ma's father, and Qing Yan served as instructors.

The latter two, both Golden Core cultivators, had reached a level where aerial combat was both essential training and standard practice. Their experience and expertise in this area were profound.

Yet Ning Zhuo's performance astonished everyone. He displayed remarkable insight and skill in aerial combat.

Qing Chi marveled, "Little Ma, how did you develop such skills? I had no idea!"

Ning Zhuo's solid foundation in aerial combat had been established during his time in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. The Blue Azure Iron Armor, imbued with a Golden Core cultivator's power, had granted him the combat capabilities of a Golden Core cultivator.

After the great war with the Two Note Kingdom, Ning Zhuo drew nourishment from the conflict and actively improved the Sky Iron Heroic Armor, further enhancing its aerial combat capabilities.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong each possessed one of these armors, and the two had even clashed deep within the clouds.

"Qing Chi, let's use the Military Seed," Ning Zhuo proposed decisively.

Qing Yan hesitated. "Now? If we want the entire army to rapidly gain experience, I fear the Military Seed won't be available for some time."

The Qing-Jiao Army was a true success story in military cultivation, possessing a Military Seed.

This seed was a major trump card.

If they used it now, they would have nothing to rely on during the upcoming life-or-death battles.

Ning Zhuo remained resolute.

Jiao Masheng's father, as well as the Jiao Clan, naturally followed Ning Zhuo's lead.

Qing Chi also stood with Ning Zhuo.

With a deep sigh, Qing Yan could only go along with the majority.

Qing Chi, without a word, channeled vast amounts of Military Might into the Military Seed within her dantian.

Ning Zhuo, Qing Yan, and Jiao Ma's father personally took to the field to instruct the troops. After a brief period of practice, the entire Qing-Jiao Army's combat prowess advanced at a remarkable rate.

All thanks to the Military Seed.

Once the Military Seed reached a certain stage of development, it could grant the Qing-Jiao Army some military strategies. At the same time, it allowed the soldiers to share their combat experience.

Thanks to this power, the Qing-Jiao Army achieved rapid mastery of aerial combat.

After retracting the Ceremonial Barracks, the entire Qing-Jiao Army soared upward.

Each soldier was enveloped in swirling yin wind as they shot into the sky, swiftly plunging into the black clouds.

"An army is approaching!"

"What banner do they fly?"

"They haven't revealed a banner. Defying warnings - they're enemies, not allies!"

The approach of the Qing-Jiao Army immediately raised the alarm among the defending forces deep within the black clouds.

These defenders, having suffered devastating losses in successive battles against the Lady of Sorrowful Bones, the Soundless Ghost Monk, and Yin Jiuzhu, had already lost more than half their numbers and were actively recovering.

The Qing-Jiao Army's assault interrupted their recovery.

"Though the army isn't strong, we can't rule out the possibility that they're a decoy, hiding some powerful experts..."

"Activate the Grand Formation. Prioritize defense - hold off these enemies."

"Stay vigilant at all times - maintain strict watchfulness!"

After a swift investigation, the defenders discovered that the Qing-Jiao Army's strength was lacking. This, paradoxically, made them even more cautious and conservative.

They had previously endured three assaults by powerful adversaries, each time breaching their defenses and clashing with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord atop the Sacrificial Altar in a life-or-death battle.

Even the defenders stationed outside, who were operating the Formation, suffered catastrophic losses from the residual combat effects alone.

Having recently learned this bloody lesson, they now watched a seemingly weak force boldly advance. Their thoughts echoed: How strange! Something's amiss! This must be a diversion, a feint to draw our attention!

"Charge! Charge! Charge!" Qing Chi soared skyward, the fierce wind stoking her fighting spirit.

Ning Zhuo, however, remained grave. "Slow down, slow down. The enemy will surely seize this opportunity to attack. Our army has only recently mastered aerial combat; this is a perilous journey!"

His vigilance intensified. If he were the defender, he would never let such a prime offensive chance slip by.

Attacking an army mid-crossing is a fundamental principle of military strategy!

Yet, even as the Qing-Jiao Army entered the swirling black clouds, no attack came.

The defenders poured all their energy into activating the Formation, churning the dark clouds into a massive barrier. They adopted an ultra-conservative strategy, wary of falling into a trap set by a cunningly strong enemy hiding behind this facade.

This weak force was too peculiar!

The safest course was to keep them outside the Formation's protective reach.
