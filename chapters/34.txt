Chapter 34: Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance

Ning Zhuo felt a sense of urgency.

He didn’t know when the next challenger would be drawn into the Lava Immortal Palace for the test.

It was entirely possible that at any moment, Meng Chong would enter the palace, pass through all the levels, and reach the maintenance room to see Ning Zhuo’s name.

“After all, Meng Chong has a super-grade immortal talent!

“Is there any way for me to quickly double the strength of my soul?”

Ning Zhuo frowned and opened several drawers full of jade slips.

Each jade slip had a simple label on it.

Ning Zhuo scanned through the piles of jade slips and quickly picked one out, placing it between his brows.

His divine intent left his divine sea and entered the jade slip, reading the information inside.

Back when he started earning spirit stones, he had also begun collecting information from outside. At this point, he had maintained this habit for more than ten years.

It was because of this information that his understanding of Fire Persimmon Immortal City was so in-depth. Otherwise, how could a Qi Refining cultivator like himself know about cultivators in the Golden Core and Nascent Soul stages?

Although much of this information was merely surface-level, Ning Zhuo had spent over a decade collecting it, comparing the developments to past and future events, and making his own speculations.

Ning Zhuo looked through multiple jade slips, mainly checking for information about souls.

Eleven years ago.

A demonic cultivator named Hua Qianhun[^1] arrived at Fire Persimmon Immortal City. She planted flowers in a valley near the city, resulting in a sea of flowers spreading all over and causing rumors of the birth of a miraculous flower. Many people were attracted by these rumors and entered the sea of flowers, only to have their souls extracted and turned into fertilizer. In the end, a miraculous flower was indeed born – the Soul Blossom Flower. Hua Qianhun immediately picked it and fled.

Eight years ago.

News spread among the cultivation community regarding the appearance of the Seven Star Lamp. Fire Persimmon Immortal City also heard about it.

The Seven Star Lamp was made by Kong Riyue[^2], a famous prime minister of Green Mountain Kingdom. He wanted to change his fate, so he created the lamp; it was supposed to use the power of the stars to replace part of his soul with the soul of heaven. In the end, he failed due to being sabotaged by Dai Yan[^3], a spy from Artifact Hegemon Kingdom.

The appearance of the Seven Star Lamp caused a commotion in several kingdoms back then. Countless cultivators scrambled for it, and Green Mountain Kingdom and Artifact Hegemon Kingdom almost went to war.

Five years ago.

A Golden Core cultivator from the Holy Ape Sect was traveling the world and arrived at Fire Persimmon Immortal City. During his stay, his cultivation deviated and his soul merged with his spirit pet, the Furious Heart Ape. The resulting existence went on a rampage, causing considerable damage to Fire Persimmon Immortal City before several Golden Core cultivators joined together to kill it.

Four years ago.

Numerous will-o’-the-wisps appeared in the cemetery at the foot of Fire Persimmon Mountain, setting off a capturing craze.

Three years ago.

In a dead valley in a barren mountain seven hundred li away from Fire Persimmon Immortal City, a Yellow Springs Pool[^4] appeared. Many cultivators ran over to fight for it.

Two years ago.

A Nine Nethers Black Death Cat[^5] was born near Fire Persimmon Immortal City. The City Lord personally made a move and fought for three days and three nights before driving it away.

The aftermath of the battle affected hundreds of li of surrounding mountains and forests.

Many mountains were shrouded in death energy, and hundreds of ghosts paraded through the night.

Fire Persimmon Immortal City was also affected. The City Lord continuously sent out orders for cultivators to leave the city, clear the surrounding area, and restore the mountains and rivers. The Southern Bean Royal Court allocated disaster relief funds and sent over large amounts of supplies, allowing nature to gradually recover its vitality.

One year ago.

Sun Lie[^6], a master alchemist, came to Fire Persimmon Immortal City to visit some friends. The Zhou Clan commissioned him to refine Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellets with the soul and blood of a phoenix. On the day of the pill’s completion, a wondrous phoenix cry echoed out, and it lingered in the city for three days.

In the end, there were eighteen pills in total, twelve of which were delivered to the Zhou Clan. As for the remaining six, numerous cultivators fought over them, resulting in one death and three serious injuries. The culprit, Han Ming[^7], was still at large…

“Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellet.” Ning Zhuo’s eyes flickered with a flash of brilliance.

He knew that this pill, which was as red as blood and gave off a refreshing fragrance, had incredible effects when it came to nourishing and revitalizing the soul.

Nign Zhuo took out a token and threw it into the air. The token disintegrated and quickly turned into a suit of battle armor.

Iron Will Gray Armor!

After the bombing of the immortal palace, the iron armor was severely damaged, especially its back. But more serious than the structural damage was the fact that the Foundation Establishment Pill inside now had only 10% of its power remaining.

“There’s no way around it. I must take action!”

Ning Zhuo got into the Iron Will Gray Armor and leaned down. After a flash of shifting lights, the armor’s mask turned into an ancient old man with dark eyebags and deep wrinkles. He was wearing a tattered leather cloak, and there were Hanging-Hair Hooked Death Whips disguised as hair, hanging from his head down to his feet.

Hanging-Hair Traveler appeared once again.

Standing in a corner, Ning Zhuo activated a teleportation formation and appeared deep underground a moment later.

He walked out of the teleportation room, passing by the huge furnace he used to burn corpses, and gradually disappeared into the underground passage.

…

In Fire Persimmon Immortal City’s black market.

A cultivator was kneeling on the ground of a courtyard.

His whole body was shaking, his face was bruised and swollen, and his eyes were full of fear as he begged for mercy: “Boss Sun, I will definitely pay back the money I owe you. I’ll pay it back, really! You have to believe me, I-”

Splurt.

The next moment, a dagger flashed, and the kneeling cultivator lost one of his arms.

"Ah-!"

The kneeling cultivator was stunned for a moment, then let loose a miserable wail.

He covered the stump of his severed arm with his remaining hand and fell to the ground, rolling around due to the agonizing pain.

Blood flowed nonstop from the massive wound, soon pooling into a crimson puddle on the ground.

Boss Sun laughed, admiring the miserable scene in front of him.

He had short black hair, chubby cheeks, and a rosy face that made him look very cute.

His eyes were big, with the whites and irises clearly defined. His skin was tender and smooth, and he was very short. He looked like a child about three or four years old.

This was because he had accidentally eaten a Face-Setting Pill when he was young, and also cultivated a special technique.

Boss Sun was a cultivator in the Foundation Establishment stage, and his full name was Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong laughed disdainfully: “You want to trick me? How long do you think I’ve been in charge of the black market? It’s all because of this pair of eyes of mine. When it comes to judging people, no one can beat me. Do you think you can deceive my Spirit Eyes?”

As he spoke, he fiddled with the dagger in his hand.

This dagger was incredibly sharp, flying between Sun Lingtong’s nimble wrists and fingers like a butterfly dancing in the moonlight.

At that moment, a cultivator entered the courtyard respectfully, standing next to Sun Lingtong and whispering something in his ear.

Sun Lingtong’s smile immediately disappeared, and cold light flashed in his eyes.

“Clean up, a distinguished guest has arrived.” Sun Lingtong waved his hand, and two burly cultivators with fat, fleshy faces immediately came running over.

One of them immediately broke the neck of the previously-kneeling cultivator and carried the body away.

The other cast a spell to clean the courtyard.

A while later, someone led Hanging-Hair Traveler into the courtyard.

Sun Lingtong opened his arms and walked toward Hanging-Hair Traveler with a smile on his face: “Brother, what brings you here?”

Hanging-Hair Traveler's voice was hoarse and his expression was inscrutable: "Boss Sun, I do have a request for you. I’m planning on attacking Sun Lie.”

Sun Lingtong's pupils immediately contracted.
