Chapter 626: The Yin Soldiers Attack the City

The altar for the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual did not rest upon the earth of the Underworld. It hung like a colossal tooth from a forgotten beast, suspended in the depths of the dark clouds that shrouded the heavens.

A frigid whirlwind enveloped the structure, devouring the swirling mists until only wisps of soul dust reached the stone. The altar itself was constructed from massive, pale bones riddled with cracks, its edges constantly shedding fragments that were ground to dust by the tempest.

"So, in the end, it's just me left standing?" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord stood at the altar's edge, his black robes billowing in the gale. The fierce wind carved his gaunt frame into angular lines, the wide sleeves clinging to his arms like second skin, revealing contours that bordered on inhuman.

In that moment, the weariness in his eyes vanished, replaced by a piercing intensity. The Forgetful River Prefecture he'd nurtured for decades now stood at the brink of destruction. His elite troops, his treasured magic artifacts - all had been committed to stave off the encroaching threats from all sides.

Only five true powerhouses remained, positioned beyond the whirlwind's reach within the Skeleton Legion's formation deep in the shadowed clouds. Beyond these Nascent Soul-level Ghost Cultivators stood the 30,000-strong imperial guard of the Forgetful River Prefecture.

Yet the Prefecture Lord knew with stark clarity that his forces had been depleted by at least sixty percent.

There was no choice.

The enemy had targeted the entire Forgetful River Prefecture, forcing him to act.

The Underworld Prefecture served as both his wings and shackles. As Prefecture Lord bearing the Royal Mandate, he stood with the nation in shared fortune and calamity - a single loss or gain affecting all.

To neglect this would lose the people's trust, bringing backlash against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and drastically reducing his fate's course.

Only by protecting the Underworld Prefecture's strength could he stay aligned with the righteous path.

"Having committed so much of my power, I've used it to counter my enemies' attacks."

"My painstaking efforts have proven remarkably effective."

"A century of planning - success or failure rests on this moment."

"Report!" A subordinate's voice pierced through the whirlwind, carried by the Formation.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord scoffed. "More bad news?"

He'd endured countless reports recently, tempering his resolve like steel in fire.

Yet this time, the calamity carried unexpected blessing.

Enemies had breached the Forgetful River's dam, causing a section to collapse. The raging floodwaters, through some twist of fate, veered precisely into thirty thousand acres of prime Fire Grain fields.

The deluge extinguished fires while the Forgetful River's waters enriched the soil, making the fields even more fertile.

True fortune from misfortune.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart stirred slightly, a flicker of realization crossing his face. "The obstacles blocking my path this time are purely man-made calamities, without any natural disasters or heavenly tribulations."

"In truth, by performing the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual and offering tribute to the Underworld Celestial Heavens, I've secured heavenly favor. As the ruler of the Forgetful River Underworld Prefecture, I already possessed the advantage of geographical position."

"So, this is the blessing of heaven and earth, allowing me to turn misfortune into fortune by making the two man-made calamities cancel each other out."

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord felt a slight easing in his heart, but he didn't relax in the slightest. He silently warned himself: "Even so, the cosmic fortune of heaven and earth has suffered great losses, which is unfavorable for me to completely refine the Heavenly Ghost Skull."

"I can't delay any further."

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord made up his mind and officially began the final stage.

He ascended the altar, his body straight as a spear. He looked up at the Heavenly Ghost Skull suspended in mid-air above the altar and chanted in a loud voice:

"O resplendent Heavens! O profound Earth! I, the Dark Lord of Forgetful River, prostrate myself to offer this prayer - 

"By the will of Heaven, the inverted Forgetful River becomes my imperial crown
by the grace of Earth, the ten thousand skeletons entwined form my foundation stones! 
The azure firmament grants me authority to chariot souls and command spirits, ruling over the underworld;
The thick earth bears me with these dark bones, building cities and towers, establishing my dominion over Forgetful River
Heaven's favor transforms tribulation waves into whetstones
Earth's virtue absorbs disasters as nourishing sources!
Now I offer supreme sincerity, my gratitude boundless!"

"Let my remnant soul become a lamp, my soulflame a torch!
Let ten thousand years of loneliness forge my edge, let a billion regrets temper my blade!
For all who block my path - even if the calamitous fire returns, even if karmic obstacles regather - I shall tear out their roots, burn their foundations to the ground!
By the name of the Forgetful River, by my unshakable resolve through eternity - I swear to hold this bone in my palm, to meld it with my very being!"

"Let heaven and earth bear witness! Let this heart and this resolve shine through the Nine Hells!"

As he continued to chant, the final stage of the Offering of Tribulation was shockingly activated.

In an instant, a fierce gale erupted, dark clouds churned like a cauldron, and it seemed as if thousands of dragons and serpents were constantly traversing through them.

The power of Heaven gradually manifested on the altar, and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord began the final phase of the Heavenly Ghost Skull's refinement.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord felt increasing resistance, and his recitation of the sacrificial text slowed, each word now carrying a thousand-pound weight.

He knew the reason: "My sacrifice is insufficient; I haven't summoned enough of Heaven's power."

"It all comes down to the battle at White Paper Immortal City."

For this, he had long prepared a plan.

Living Realm.

White Paper Immortal City.

Dark clouds pressed down like an iron curtain, and under the gloomy light, the terrifying formations of the Netherworld Army had already been arrayed, completely surrounding White Paper Immortal City!

As far as the eye could see, countless Yin Soldiers and ghostly creatures filled the entire view.

At each city gate stood a group formation.

In the forefront was the Skeleton Legion. Neatly arranged like a forest, the countless dry bone soldiers were densely packed. Hollow eye sockets burned with eerie green soul fire, and their decaying bone hands clutched rust-stained, resentment-wreathed giant bone blades or broken bone shields.

On both wings of the Skeleton Legion flowed a viscous "Water Ghost Tide." Countless swollen, rotting Drowned Ghosts, covered in algae and mud, had gathered in such numbers that the water vapor they carried merged together, forming a river on the ground.

They floated in the river, rising and falling, gathering strength for their assault.

Above the Skeleton Legion, a swarm of Flayed Ghosts hung suspended in the yin wind. The skin they had peeled off themselves dangled behind them like kites or parachutes, catching the wind to make them glide through the air.

Though they moved slowly now, once combat began, they would accelerate with a piercing shriek that tore through the air. They could repeatedly dive and climb at low altitudes. During previous Ghost Tides, these very creatures had inflicted the most casualties on the Cultivators stationed on the city walls.

Behind the Skeleton Legion stood ranks of towering Headless Ghost Riders, their charred armor hanging loosely from their frames.

Both the riders and their bony warhorses burned with a sickly green Ghostfire. The flames around their necks formed vague outlines of human skulls.

The Ghostfire licked at their blackened bones and armor, crackling and hissing as it released thick black smoke that distorted the air. Their mere presence radiated terrifying power - not a single person in White Paper Immortal City would want to see them charging through the streets.

Each legion was guarded by a Nascent Soul-level Ghost Cultivator, supported by numerous Golden Core-level Ghost Generals.

Luo Si had already arrived in the Living Realm, taking command of the entire operation.

The Vanguard General, Flying Spear Ghost General, White Bone Crocodile Demon, Xie Sichao... even Sun Lingtong was among their ranks.

Beyond the four great military formations corresponding to each city gate lay a sea of ghostly creatures.

These spectral beings came in countless varieties, the result of the Netherworld Army's deliberate collection of previous Ghost Tides and continuous accumulation.

Small-Headed Ghosts, Big-Headed Ghosts, Ghost Mothers, Hanging Ghosts, Drowned Ghosts, Lantern Ghosts, Soul-Hooking Geckos, Ghost Yakshas...

Among them, the most striking were the Dead Bone Giant Spirits.

These colossal monsters were formed from countless black and dark gray bones intertwined and pieced together. Each bone was thick, robust, and weathered, eroded by Yin Qi and the passage of time. The towering city walls didn't even reach their necks.

During the Ghost Tide, their combat strength could reach Nascent Soul level.

Now, as the army besieged the city - though this wasn't a full Ghost Tide - the Dead Bone Giant Spirits' combat power remained formidable, still approaching Nascent Soul level!

On the walls of White Paper Immortal City, countless City Guards, Cultivators recruited from the Black Marsh at great expense, and Cultivator squads from several major superpowers all wore solemn expressions.

Tie Guzheng, the commander of the City Guard, was undoubtedly the core figure in the defense battle.

Yang Sanyan from the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Zhou Wenyan from the All-Book Pavilion, and Bone Tomb Daoist from the Soul Devouring Sect each led a Cultivator squad stationed on the other three sections of the city walls.

Within the city, the City Lord's Paper Doll Clone and Wen Ruanyu primarily managed the defensive lines.

At the deepest heart of the City Lord's Mansion lay the true form of the White Paper Immortal City.

Undoubtedly, in terms of military strength - both in the scale of cultivators and high-level combat capabilities - the White Paper Immortal City paled in comparison to the Netherworld Army. The disparity between the two forces was strikingly evident.

The White Paper City Lord's previous pleas for aid had not broken convention; the reinforcements she obtained were all Golden Core-level cultivators, falling short of Nascent Soul-level experts.

Even Yang Sanyan, though possessing Nascent Soul-level combat prowess, remained at the Golden Core cultivation stage.

The White Paper City Lord's greatest reliance was naturally the White Paper Immortal City itself!

Possessing an Immortal City granted them a formidable defensive advantage - a position that was easy to defend but difficult to attack.

Could the disparity in military strength overcome this strategic advantage? The answer to this question would likely determine the outcome of this epic battle.

Commander Luo Si remained silent, merely waving his command flag.

The flag pointed directly toward the city gates.

In the next instant, battle flags within the army began to wave, war drums beat rhythmically, and the massive horde of ghostly creatures surged forward like mad, charging toward the walls of the White Paper Immortal City.

Big-Headed Ghosts blew yin winds, while Small-Headed Ghosts, Ghost Yakshas, Ghost Bats, and others rushed toward the wall's summit.

Ghost Mothers lay on the ground, continuously spawning new ghostly creatures.

Hanging Ghosts and Soul-Hooking Geckos began climbing the city walls.

Tie Guzheng immediately activated the City Defense Command, causing the White Paper City Wall to emit a radiant glow that incinerated all ghostly creatures upon contact, instantly reducing countless to ash.

The Cultivators stationed along the wall followed military orders, launching their attacks in coordinated waves.

Magic Artifacts and Spells rained down, slaughtering ghostly creatures mid-flight until they dissolved into nothingness.

Luo Si and the other generals remained steadfast on their Skeletal Ghost Horses. Xie Sichao stroked his beard, his gaze constantly scanning the city defenses.

As Military Intelligence reports continued to reach the generals' hands, the frenzied assault lasted approximately half the time it takes to drink a cup of tea. With a satisfied hum, Luo Si issued his second command.

The war drums ceased, replaced by the blare of military horns. Most ghostly creatures retreated at the sound, while the remaining few were annihilated by the city's defenses.

Tie Guzheng exhaled a long breath, tension easing from his shoulders.

The enemy's first probing attack had ended. Under his leadership, the White Paper Immortal City's defenses had performed flawlessly, revealing no weaknesses - a textbook-perfect response.

Luo Si recalled Tie Guzheng's intelligence report and mentally acknowledged: Truly a master of defense.

The Netherworld Army had been planning their assault for ages, and the White Paper Immortal City had been equally prepared for this confrontation.

The first wave of the assault was repelled with perfect efficiency by White Paper Immortal City. Both the four-sided city walls and the command structure operated flawlessly, leaving Luo Si no openings to exploit.

If there's no opportunity, then create one!

Since the ghostly creature tide had failed to reveal any weaknesses, it was time to deploy the main forces.

Luo Si issued a decisive new military order.

The ashen Skeleton Legion advanced with heavy, synchronized steps. Each time white bones struck the ground, the earsplitting crackle of countless joints ground against each other, the sound grating on the nerves.

Cultivators on the city walls immediately launched their attacks.

Yet these assaults proved ineffective against the Skeleton Legion. Though the gray-white bones appeared fragile and broken, they proved more resilient than most ghostly creatures.

"This is a regular army!"

"They've been rigorously trained and well-cultivated."

"Who knows how many military strategies were applied to this force before their deployment?"

The Living Realm cultivators felt a chill in their hearts as they redoubled their efforts.

But soon, Tie Guzheng's voice cut through the chaos.

"Cease this prolonged battle! Retreat immediately for rest and recuperation. Restore your spiritual energy to the fullest!" Tie Guzheng's voice echoed across the city walls.

The cultivators suddenly realized their mistake, recalling Tie Guzheng's pre-battle instructions. They turned and descended from the city walls, allowing fresh cultivators to take their places.

Yet many cast one last attack at the Skeleton Legion below before leaving.

Tie Guzheng watched helplessly, remembering the Qing-Jiao Army and their three Military Systems' strict discipline.

"We're not a proper cultivation army," he thought. "This is the result of inadequate training."

The City Guard might have achieved more, but the current defense forces included too many untrained personnel.

Reaching this level of performance was already Tie Guzheng's limit.

"Defense is my specialty, not drilling troops," he sighed. "If only I had a Military Seed... everything would be so much easier!"

He couldn't help but envy Qing Chi's capabilities.

After the first wave of cultivators descended, they received immediate treatment at the temporary barracks - healing potions and Formation assistance to restore their spiritual energy.

The second wave climbed the walls and launched their attacks, but with little effect.

The Skeleton Legion, as if having shed a layer of skin, advanced to the base of the city walls. There, they began climbing atop their comrades, forming a human ladder!

This was no simple ascent.

Crack, crack...

Bones continuously disassembled and reassembled, interlocking tightly. The skeletal foundation at the base expanded steadily, growing increasingly stable. Above, the bone bridge took shape with alarming speed.

As the Cultivators watched the ladder approach, their faces paled. They redoubled their attacks, but to little effect.

BOOM!

A massive fireball suddenly detonated at the wall's base. The violent explosion shattered one entire section of the bone bridge ladder.

The Cultivators' spirits surged at this significant breakthrough. All eyes turned to the attacker - a young man with a sallow complexion.

It was Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo)!

Tie Guzheng recognized Ning Zhuo's identity immediately, though he'd expected as much.

Ning Zhuo continued his assault, unleashing Five Elements Spells in rapid succession. Combined with his Five Organs Temple Divine Technique, he slaughtered the surrounding enemy forces without draining the Qing-Jiao Army's strength.
