Chapter 560: Formation Beheads the Demon Heart!

"The mechanical carriage is finally mine!" Ning Zhuo's heart surged with excitement.

Having previously intruded upon the Six Caves Sect's encampment, Ning Zhuo dared not rashly deploy his Mechanical Dragon again.

A frontal confrontation became his primary choice.

Ultimately, he caught Lin You completely off-guard, as Lin severely underestimated Ning Zhuo's hostility.

Ning Zhuo was a master of patience.

He'd practiced restraint since the age of two, enduring silently for over a decade, achieving extraordinary success at the Lava Immortal Palace.

Now, in Two Note Nation, his patience once again bore fruit!

“My son!” On the frontline of Two Note Nation's main camp, the battling Demon Heart Cave Master suddenly paled dramatically.

Clutching his chest, he felt the warning method he'd placed on Lin You being triggered.

This demonic master of the Six Caves Sect immediately realized his most prized successor had suffered greatly!

"Continue fighting!" Demon Heart Cave Master curtly instructed the nearby Poison Scorpion and Blood Shadow Cave Masters before rapidly retreating from the battlefield.

"What?!" Poison Scorpion and Blood Shadow stared in shock.

Unconcerned with their reaction, Demon Heart Cave Master, consumed by rage, swiftly pinpointed the culprit through his spiritual senses.

"You dare attack my son?! You shall all die!" Demon Heart Cave Master roared as he soared toward Ning Zhuo’s forces.

Flying high, he immediately faced heavy artillery fire.

Technique - Demonic Sinew Scaled Armor!

He continuously maintained this demonic spell, enveloping himself in a thick, resilient armor of blood-red sinews.

Withstanding numerous attacks, Demon Heart Cave Master swiftly crossed the battlefield, positioning himself above his enemies.

Technique - Nine Abyss Heart Devourer!

Boom.

It felt as if a drumbeat echoed within everyone's chests, abruptly causing hearts in the Three Generals Battalion and Red Flower Battalion to accelerate unnaturally.

Boom.

Another drum-like pulse surged, further accelerating their heartbeats.

Boom.

By the third beat, many soldiers felt intense palpitations.

Boom, boom, boom...

Three more consecutive heartbeats caused numerous soldiers to clutch their chests and collapse to their knees or fall outright.

The formations of the Three Generals and Red Flower Battalions were instantly thrown into chaos, with nearly half of their ranks incapacitated.

Hearts raced faster still.

“Argh…” Some soldiers' eyes rolled back, bleeding from every orifice as their hearts exploded.

Such was the terrifying strength unleashed by Demon Heart Cave Master, the second-ranked master of Six Caves Sect.

As the battalions faced disastrous casualties, Zhang Zhongyi quickly intervened, scattering numerous pills which instantly transformed into medicinal mist, protecting the soldiers' hearts.

Even then, over fifty men lost their lives by the seventh heartbeat.

These were cultivator-soldiers enhanced by strict military discipline!

“What a sinister and bizarre attack!” Liu Er coughed blood.

“We can’t let him continue!” Mu Lan, brows furrowed deeply, drew her bow.

Military Tactic - Feigning Strength!

But Demon Heart Cave Master remained unbothered, pressing his assault.

Boom.

The eighth heartbeat claimed over sixty additional lives.

Mu Lan’s feigned tactic was utterly ignored, her brows knitting tighter. Clearly, Demon Heart Cave Master had seen through her bluff.

Liu, Guan, and Zhang also attacked, but with morale shattered and forces severely weakened, their strikes appeared feeble. Even attacks landing on Demon Heart Cave Master had little effect.

This was the flaw of military cultivators.

If an enemy targeted the soldiers directly, their foundational power could quickly collapse.

Of course, not anyone could achieve this.

Demon Heart Cave Master's demonic technique directly affected the heart, circumventing traditional defenses, resulting in devastating effectiveness.

"You dare touch my son?! Who gave you such courage! Die, all of you!!!"

Clang.

A golden lightning-like light pierced Demon Heart Cave Master's chest, momentarily stalling his furious momentum.

Immediately, countless five-element spells rained down on him, forcibly knocking him to the ground.

Covered in dust, Demon Heart Cave Master's sinew armor showed breaches, leaving him injured.

Crucially, his Nine Abyss Heart Devourer magic was forcibly disrupted, causing severe backlash that forced him to spit a mouthful of blood.

“Impossible! Why weren’t you affected?” Demon Heart Cave Master stared at Ning Zhuo in disbelief and fury.

Standing proudly upright, Ning Zhuo showed no injury.

His previous displays of coughing blood and agony were purely feigned.

"Husband," Mu Lan gazed at him with radiant admiration.

"Strategist, truly impressive!" Zhang Hei enthusiastically raised a thumb, despite his exhaustion.

Just as Jin Tunhe countered Ning Zhuo’s "Warriors Return Technique," Ning Zhuo’s Fire Heart Temple precisely countered Demon Heart Cave Master's lethal technique.

The white-robed youth’s heart had long been transformed, significantly mitigating the effects of the demon’s assault.

“You struck down the son, now you face the father,” Ning Zhuo shouted sternly. “Perfect! You and your son have committed endless evils. Now is precisely when I eliminate demons and uphold justice for all beings!”

Demon Heart Cave Master’s eye twitched in fury, "Little brat, I'll scatter your bones and ashes!"

Boom, boom, boom…

Both sides engaged in fierce combat.

Demon Heart Cave Master unleashed overwhelming demonic qi, backed by his powerful physical strength and aggressive attacks, utilizing strange techniques targeting the heart that were nearly impossible to defend against.

Ning Zhuo prioritized stability, relying on the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor and protection from the Fire-Element Heart Temple. With various Five Elements spells, he gradually wore down the Demon Heart Cave Master's momentum.

Demon Heart Cave Master grew increasingly shocked and doubtful. After experiencing actual combat, he found the battle situation unbelievable: "What's happening? Isn't this kid just in Foundation Establishment? Yet he's actually exchanging blows evenly with me?"

Although he'd received intelligence earlier that Ning Zhuo could exhibit Golden Core-level power by utilizing military strategies, he himself was a dignified Nascent Soul cultivator!

Even though his strength was inferior to Lu Hongtu, and far below experts like Elder Long and Xiang Yue, he was still considered a relatively strong Nascent Soul cultivator.

Yet, he couldn't even suppress Ning Zhuo!

Ning Zhuo grit his teeth, barely holding on.

Earlier, he had only caught Demon Heart Cave Master off guard. Now that they were truly fighting, the youth felt immense pressure.

"Fortunately, Demon Heart Cave Master expended a lot of strength in the core battlefield and his combat power has significantly declined. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to resist!" Ning Zhuo inwardly rejoiced.

After several exchanges, Ning Zhuo began to fall behind.

Without assistance, in a one-on-one fight, Demon Heart Cave Master would eventually gain the upper hand, converting this into victory and taking Ning Zhuo's life.

But reality was different. Demon Heart Cave Master fought alone, whereas Ning Zhuo had allies - Liu, Guan, Zhang, Mu, and Sun - by his side.

Centered around Ning Zhuo, a siege against the Demon Heart Cave Master began!

"Demon Heart, where did you go?! Come back immediately!"

"Demon Heart, return quickly! We can't hold on much longer."

Blood Shadow Cave Master and Poison Scorpion Cave Master frantically sent messages to Demon Heart Cave Master, but received no response, as if throwing stones into the ocean.

Without Demon Heart Cave Master, Thousand Peaks Forest suffered numerous weaknesses in the core battlefield.

Shen Qinghe seized this opportunity and launched a sudden strike:

《Azure Spirit Purifying Poison Scripture》!

Tu Ming watched helplessly in grief as his poisonous techniques rapidly dissolved under Shen Qinghe's assault, melting away like snow under a blazing sun, completely unable to resist.

"Damn it! How could something like the Azure Spirit Purifying Poison Scripture even exist in this world!"

Tu Ming fled miserably.

As the cleansing light of Azure Spirit struck him, purple poisonous mist billowed from his entire body, and the toxins he painstakingly accumulated quickly dissipated, causing unbearable pain that forced him to scream while fleeing.

Such miserable screams naturally drew attention, dealing another heavy blow to Thousand Peaks Forest’s morale.

But the next moment, Shen Qinghe staggered and nearly fell from the sky.

"Hehehe, little girl, I'll get rid of you first!" Li Jiuchu had successfully ambushed Shen Qinghe. "My gu worms don't fear your purifying poison light."

But right as his words fell, Li Jiuchu’s expression suddenly changed, turning sharply to look behind him.

A black shadow quietly approached and violently slammed into Li Jiuchu’s back!

Li Jiuchu was horrified to discover that his numerous defenses collapsed instantly, unable to block the strike at all.

Caw!

With a sharp crow, the black shadow that severely wounded Li Jiuchu swiftly retreated, dodging Li Jiuchu's terrifying counterattack, and soared into the sky.

It was none other than Mo Yechen's beast companion, the Starling Bird.

Li Jiuchu had just ambushed Shen Qinghe, only to be ambushed in return by Mo Yechen.

He stared fiercely at Mo Yechen in the distance, who was riding on a "giant starling." Clearly, the real starling had just inflicted heavy damage on Li Jiuchu, while Mo Yechen’s mount was merely an illusion.

"Be careful, Fairy Shen." Mo Yechen's deceptive tactic succeeded, and he acted decisively to rescue Shen Qinghe.

Shen Qinghe's beautiful eyes lingered on Mo Yechen, causing an unprecedented ripple in his usually calm heart.

"Thank you. I will repay this favor after the battle," Shen Qinghe nodded in gratitude, then immediately flew out of the core battlefield.

She wasn't fleeing from battle; she had gone after Tu Ming.

When Tu Ming looked back and saw Shen Qinghe chasing him, he shuddered in anger and distress: "This crazy woman is after me again!"

Mo Yechen stared at Shen Qinghe's departing figure, feeling a sudden impulse to follow her. However, this hesitation lasted only a brief moment before he turned his attention back to Li Jiuchu.

"Fellow Daoist Li, let's continue our battle," Mo Yechen challenged loudly.

Li Jiuchu, enraged and filled with hatred, started healing himself even as he struck back at Mo Yechen.

This time, however, unlike before, they fought evenly, locked in a stalemate.

Elsewhere in the sprawling battlefield:

"Eat! I'll give it all to you!" Jia Wan raised a hotpot high, dumping all sorts of freshly-cooked spiritual delicacies in front of him.

The Golden River Swallower, transformed into its true form - a three-legged golden toad - immediately felt a mouth-watering aroma. Seeing all the delicious spiritual foods, greed overwhelmed its senses, and it eagerly devoured them without hesitation.

The next moment, the three-legged golden toad suddenly froze in place, its body swelling uncontrollably as massive amounts of spirit energy and magical power erupted from hundreds of thousands of pores.

The Golden River Swallower instinctively clamped its mouth shut, yet energy continued to flood uncontrollably from its entire body.

Utterly horrified, it tried reverting to human form but found its magical power chaotic and impossible to control.

"My ‘Intestine-Penetrating Heavenly Soup’ isn't something ordinary beings can handle!" The spiritual chef Ding Bi smiled gently.

With one strike, he'd decisively defeated The Golden River Swallower and made a great contribution!

The Golden River Swallowing Toad desperately exerted force from its three legs, frantically discharging fluids as it fled in embarrassment.

“Chen Lingfeng, you idiot!” Gu Ya cursed, feeling utterly powerless.

In his madness, Chen Lingfeng had completely lost his senses, severely devastating Gu Ya’s wolf pack.

After several battles, Gu Ya’s wolves had nearly been wiped out. The demonic beasts he painstakingly nurtured for more than half his life were almost entirely lost!

Without his beasts, Gu Ya instantly lost his sense of security, his battle power significantly diminished. He was forced to swing his wolf-toothed club and fight bitterly.

“Time to retreat!” Bi Tengyi’s golden Core husband, the Verdant Vine King put away his stringless bow, leading his Ancient Vine Tribe members to withdraw voluntarily.

More and more cultivators and groups from Thousand Peaks Forest began retreating. Even those initially positioned on the battlefield’s edge showed signs of leaving the field altogether!

The situation on the battlefield was becoming clearer.

Within the vast battlefield’s core area, the walls of the Two Note Kingdoms’ main camp had already collapsed by more than half amid the chaos, with most heavy weaponry destroyed.

The battle between Qianye and Song Ji had also reached its climax.

Qianye was an illusionary fox demon whose divided images were indistinguishable from the real body, and each image had offensive power.

Song Ji, on the other hand, was a national oracle skilled in divination. Although not outstanding in direct combat among Nascent Soul cultivators, his predictive techniques allowed him to pinpoint Qianye’s true form easily.

Song Ji also excelled in utilizing others' strength, forcing Qianye to retreat step by step and finally withdrawing from the core battlefield.

As more and more people withdrew, the morale of Thousand Peaks Forest continuously declined, its collapse accelerating rapidly!

Magic - Blood Vortex Rapids!

The Demon Heart Cave Master's eyes had no pupils, only swirling blood vortexes.

The blood vortexes spun faster, gradually expanding and overflowing from his eye sockets.

It was both offensive and defensive, capable of absorbing external attacks and tearing enemies apart.

Zhang Hei’s arm had already been devoured by this blood vortex!

Buddhist Art - Vajra Body Protection!

Martial Array - Zen Wind Flying Fist Formation!

Buddhist Art - Moonlight Universal Salvation Technique!

Combined as one!

Mechanical Art - Golden Moon Zen Wind Fist!

Ning Zhuo once again unleashed endless fist shadows, winds roaring, forcibly breaking through the blood vortex.

“An opportunity!” Mu Lan again drew her bow.

This time, it was no longer a bluff!

Phoenix Emperor Bow, Burning Heart Arrow.

Divine Ability - Scarlet Heart Homing Arrow!

The arrow nearly pierced through space, incredibly swift, especially given their close distance. Perhaps due to previous feints, the Demon Heart Cave Master had become complacent.

Almost instantly, the arrow pierced through the Demon Heart Cave Master's body, directly puncturing his heart.

Despite the severe injury, the Demon Heart Cave Master survived!

If Long Ye or Xiang Yue had suffered such critical heart damage, it would have been fatal.

Yet, the Demon Heart Cave Master was different.

“I still have a backup heart!” Just as the Demon Heart Cave Master gloated, Ning Zhuo suddenly opened his mouth and released another attack.

Metal Element - Profound Gold Slash!

Metal Element - Temple of the Metal Lung!

Channeling all his power into this final strike!

The Profound Gold Slash shot into the Demon Heart Cave Master's open wound at lightning speed, entering his body and obliterating all his internal organs.

“How can such a domineering, straightforward Metal Art even bend?!” The Demon Heart Cave Master fell into total shock.

He glared furiously at Ning Zhuo with immense grief and rage - this brat had concealed his true strength all along! If Ning Zhuo had revealed this earlier, he would’ve certainly prepared a countermeasure!

“You shall die with me!” Even in death, losing all his hearts, the Demon Heart Cave Master still had some mobility.

Boom!

His dying counterattack struck Ning Zhuo.

Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Mu all showed drastic changes in their expressions. The Demon Heart Cave Master's final strike was terrifying; if it landed on them, there would be no chance of survival.

“Strategist!”

“Husband!!”

Before Ning Zhuo could even scream, his body dissolved in bloody light and explosions, utterly vaporized.

Yet, in the next instant, Ning Zhuo reappeared nearby.

He was still shaken, his face filled with lingering fear.

The Demon Heart Cave Master twisted his head, glaring fiercely at Ning Zhuo as the last breath of life dissipated into the wind.

A Substitute Talisman!

A Space Escape Talisman!

And the timely warning from his mechanical ring at the critical moment.

Together, these items allowed Ning Zhuo to narrowly evade this deadly catastrophe.

Thus, Ning Zhuo slew the Demon Heart Cave Master!
