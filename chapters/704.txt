Chapter 704: Cradle of Myriad Phenomena

Liu Fushu caught sight of the scene and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. Thank goodness! Bai Jiyun made the same mistake as me.

Hold on, I still have a chance!

After making a series of errors, Liu Fushu finally realized the crux of the challenge.

Gritting his teeth, he slowed his pace to its absolute limit, meticulously writing each stroke with deliberate slowness, suppressing his instincts. He finally managed to advance steadily.

However, this meant he had fallen far behind and lacked the means to quickly catch up.

Liu Fushu grew inwardly anxious, but seeing Bai Jiyun's predicament immediately eased his pressure.

A pang of shame struck him. If Brother Bai wins, I should be happy for him. He's my friend, and I shouldn't be gloating over his misfortune. This isn't the conduct of a gentleman!

Bai Jiyun failed over a dozen times, his face ashen.

After a few stunned breaths, he exhaled a turbid qi and abruptly stopped writing.

Frowning in deep concentration, he sank into profound contemplation.

So, the difficulty of this bizarre question lies here!

"But why would Mr. Chu Xuangui design the trial this way?"

"Cultivators with deeper calligraphic skill are actually at a disadvantage. This is supposed to be a Confucian Flying Cloud Minor Trial, yet it favors those with only a superficial grasp of calligraphy. Is that fair?"

Bai Jiyun scanned the surrounding cultivators, his gaze settling on Ning Zhuo.

To his eyes, Ning Zhuo lacked any visible Literary Qi, suggesting he wasn't a Confucian cultivator. Yet, with his solid foundation in talisman strokes, Ning Zhuo had steadily advanced, now firmly holding second place.

In a typical Confucian Minor Trial, such a scenario would be virtually impossible.

And the first-place contender...

Bai Jiyun's gaze fixed on Kong Ran.

A sudden thought surfaced in his divine sea: "Ideographic Brush, Prodigy... Could it be that this Flying Cloud Minor Trial was specifically designed for Kong Ran?"

Liu Fushu, with his limited experience, wouldn't have considered such a possibility.

But Bai Jiyun was different. He wasn't merely sightseeing; he had traveled extensively throughout the Flying Cloud Kingdom, immersing himself in its diverse customs and gaining a deep understanding of its social dynamics.

"If my guess is correct..." Bai Jiyun turned to Chu Xuangui, a flicker of disdain in his eyes. "It's hard to imagine that Mr. Chu Xuangui, renowned throughout the nation for his meticulousness, impartiality, and iron-fisted justice, would resort to such tactics!"

Bai Jiyun had given up.

At this pace, even if he pushed himself to the limit, he couldn't catch up to the top two.

By this point, the situation was clear.

The vast majority of Confucian cultivators found themselves in the same predicament as Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu - making mistake after mistake, their progress painfully slow.

The top two competitors remained far ahead.

Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the true victor would emerge from this pair!

"I'm going to win!" Kong Ran hadn't forgotten to observe his rivals. When he realized he was in first place, his face lit up with joy.

Liu Fushu refused to give up, still giving it his all.

Chu Xuangui remained expressionless.

Ning Zhuo, on the other hand, maintained a calm demeanor, appearing unhurried yet steadily advancing, never letting Kong Ran widen the gap.

After several more poems, more and more Confucian cultivators realized the insurmountable gap and gradually withdrew.

They gathered to watch, buzzing with speculation.

"Who's that big-headed youth?"

"I never imagined Kong Ran would ultimately win the Ideographic Brush!"

"He's a prodigy, after all, and has been carefully selecting his Dao Path. No wonder Mr. Chu Xuangui brought out the Ideographic Brush - it was likely because of Kong Ran's arrival."

Realizing Kong Ran was likely being favored and would soon be inducted into the core circle of Confucian cultivators within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Confucian cultivators began cheering him on enthusiastically.

Compared to Ning Zhuo, who was clearly an outsider, they preferred this young cultivator with a brighter future.

The atmosphere grew feverish, as if Kong Ran had already been declared the ultimate victor.

Yet Ning Zhuo remained unnoticed, maintaining his pursuit.

Kong Ran made a mistake.

His mental state faltered.

The crowd's adulation and expectations weighed heavily on his young heart, adding external pressure.

One mistake meant rewriting the entire piece.

Kong Ran had to start over. In his haste, he glanced back to check Ning Zhuo's progress.

Though Ning Zhuo hadn't surpassed him, the gap between them had vanished almost entirely after Kong Ran's error.

"Damn it!"

"I can't afford to make another mistake.

"The Ideographic Brush must be mine!"

Kong Ran grew increasingly anxious. Steeling his resolve, he activated his Innate Talent, channeling Literary Qi to unleash a Confucian technique:

Cradle of Myriad Phenomena!

Ning Zhuo was startled, finally lifting his gaze to Kong Ran. "That familiar aura... Could his Innate Talent also be... Early Wisdom?"

Empowered by the Confucian technique, Kong Ran's eyes became as clear as water, like those of an infant.

His memories were suppressed to the deepest recesses of his mind, leaving him like a newborn child encountering the world for the first time. He observed everything before him with the fresh eyes of a first encounter.

Though still young and not yet old enough to attend school, Kong Ran's father was one of the Flying Cloud Kingdom's most powerful prime ministers. Recognizing his son's Innate Talent, his father had hired private tutors to guide Kong Ran in various subjects from a very young age.

While his calligraphy skills couldn't match those of Liu Fushu, Bai Jiyun, and others, he possessed a solid foundation.

Now, under the influence of the Cradle of Myriad Phenomena, everything around Kong Ran appeared entirely new. Beyond their novelty, these objects became his childhood primers, continuously inspiring and guiding him.

With this, Kong Ran's previous calligraphy foundation no longer hindered him.

His writing speed increased by another thirty percent.

In moments, he had widened the gap between himself and Ning Zhuo, and the distance continued to grow.

The cultivators were astonished and began discussing the phenomenon excitedly.

"Is this Innate Talent?"

"Rumor has it that Kong Ran possesses the Innate Talent of Early Wisdom. It seems the rumors were true!"

"With such talent, Kong Ran is certain to win this competition."

Liu Fushu's eyes were bloodshot. Seeing Kong Ran's writing speed accelerate further, he finally gave up in despair.

The gap was simply too vast, leaving Liu Fushu no hope of catching up.

At the same time, he found himself thinking along the same lines as Bai Jiyun: "This year's Flying Cloud Minor Trial is different from previous years. The questions are strange, and the rewards are excessive. Could it truly be a scheme to lure Kong Ran onto the path of Confucian cultivation?"

By now, no other cultivator remained in the competition.

After Kong Ran activated his Innate Talent Technique, he left everyone else in the dust. The cultivators instantly recognized the futility of their efforts and withdrew.

Only Ning Zhuo persisted.

After a while, the cultivators grew impatient. The gap between Ning Zhuo and Kong Ran had become insurmountable, yet Ning Zhuo showed no sign of giving up.

"Is there any point in continuing like this?"

"Face reality! Your opponent is a prodigy with Innate Talent!"

"I understand this big-headed youth. He once saw a glimmer of hope for victory, but when Kong Ran revealed his true depth, that hope turned to despair. The sudden shift was too much for him to bear."

"Hmph, he's not even a true Confucian cultivator - just an outsider. He probably joined the Flying Cloud Minor Trial out of curiosity, just to play around. How dare someone with such a shallow foundation try to steal treasures from us Confucian cultivators?"

"That's a bit harsh. Kong Ran isn't a true Confucian cultivator either."

"But Kong Ran is only at the Qi Refining Stage, while this youth has already reached Foundation Establishment. Having already chosen his path of cultivation, why be so greedy, trying to snatch advantages from the Confucian cultivator's path?"

"Hmm, you're right."

The cultivators' murmurs reached Ning Zhuo's ears, clearly intended for him to hear. Yet he remained deaf to their words, continuing to act as he pleased.

Chu Xuangui observed this scene and nodded inwardly.

Setting aside everything else, Ning Zhuo's composure alone, at his age, was remarkable.

At this stage of the Flying Cloud Minor Trial, Kong Ran held a commanding lead, yet Chu Xuangui remained calm, showing no signs of panic.

Chu Xuangui was well aware of Kong Ran's intelligence, including his Early Wisdom and Innate Talent Technique. These were all part of his calculations.

Without betraying any emotion, Chu Xuangui continued to condense poems using his spiritual energy.

With each poem completed, Kong Ran's face grew paler. Fine beads of cold sweat dotted his forehead, and his upper body began to sway.

He was nearing his limit!

Activating the Innate Talent Technique drained not only physical stamina and spiritual energy but also mental focus.

In the past, he had used the Cradle of Myriad Phenomena to aid his studies, but he had never sustained it for such an extended period.

The crushing burden forced him to his breaking point, and Kong Ran was forced to deactivate the Innate Talent Technique.

His head swam, golden light flashing in his vision. He turned weakly toward Ning Zhuo, a chill running through him. "Why is this guy still going?"

Kong Ran began making frequent errors.

His condition had deteriorated so badly that he had to rewrite each line of poetry seven or eight times before it met the standard, barely passing.

And each poem required at least four lines.

By the time Kong Ran finished a single poem, Ning Zhuo had completed four or five.

Under these circumstances, Ning Zhuo steadily began to close the gap.

The assembled cultivators fell silent.

Few had anticipated such a dramatic reversal in the later stages of the competition.

"That's right. Kong Ran may be a prodigy, but he's still only at the Qi Refining Stage."

"He can't sustain a prolonged battle."

"Compared to someone at the Foundation Establishment Stage, his reserves are far too weak."

"What a pity. If I'd known this would happen, I wouldn't have given up!"

The cultivators turned their gazes toward Ning Zhuo, their expressions complex.

Thud.

Moments later, Kong Ran collapsed to the ground, unable to maintain his focus any longer.

Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu rushed to his side, helping him regain consciousness.

Kong Ran lay limp, his weary eyes fixed on Ning Zhuo as he surpassed him.

"Ah, my Ideographic Brush!" His eyes rolled back in fury, and he fainted again.

Chu Xuangui slowly ceased channeling his spiritual energy, no longer conjuring characters in the Void.

His expression remained impassive as he turned to Ning Zhuo.

The cultivators fell silent.

After a few breaths, Chu Xuangui nodded slightly and said calmly, "You are the victor of this Flying Cloud Minor Trial. What is your name?"

Ning Zhuo bowed respectfully, his voice trembling slightly as he announced his name, subtly conveying his excitement.

"Very well." Chu Xuangui immediately retrieved a token and presented it to Ning Zhuo along with the Ideographic Brush.

Chu Xuangui surveyed the assembled Confucian cultivators and spoke in a deep voice, "In ancient times, Ancestor Cang created written characters, leaving behind the Primordial Seal Stele. This stele is a National Artifact of the Hua Zhang Kingdom, and they have long sought a worthy successor to inherit its legacy."

"Yet countless Confucian cultivators, whether prodigies or great masters, have failed before the Primordial Seal Stele."

"Though we belong to the Myriad Manifestations Sect, we retain the authority to make recommendations."

"Recently, during a conversation with a friend, I gained a new insight: Ancestor Cang's creation of characters was inspired by the forms of talismans, leading to the development of the Primordial Seal Script."

"If Confucian cultivators have proven inadequate, why not approach the matter from the source of Ancestor Cang's inspiration - the art of talisman-making?"

Upon hearing this, the Confucian cultivators collectively showed expressions of sudden realization.

A complex expression crossed Chu Xuangui's face as he turned to Ning Zhuo. "You are not a Confucian cultivator, but that does not matter. I hope you will make good use of this Ideographic Brush to enhance your talisman-making skills. If you can also study the Confucian classics, all the better."

"When you have achieved mastery and gained confidence, bring this token to me. If you pass the assessment, we will recommend you to the Hua Zhang Kingdom to attempt the Primordial Seal Stele."

Bai Jiyun's brow unfurrowed. "So that's it! As expected of Mr. Chu Xuangui. I had underestimated his wisdom."

Liu Fushu clenched his fists, his voice tinged with regret. "What a missed opportunity! By failing to win, I've also lost my chance to study the Primordial Seal Stele."

"Mr. Chu Xuangui truly lives up to his reputation as a senior figure in the Confucian School, always fair and impartial. He didn't let Kong Ran's Early Wisdom and Innate Talent influence his judgment."

"His decision to award victory in the Flying Cloud Minor Trial to an outsider proves his integrity and moral character!"

Kong Ran remained unconscious.

Ning Zhuo watched as Chu Xuangui's words effortlessly swayed the crowd, completely clearing him of suspicion. A glint flashed in his eyes as he thought, Impressive! I've learned something valuable today.

Ning Zhuo bowed deeply to Chu Xuangui, expressing his gratitude and praising the elder's virtuous conduct.

Chu Xuangui, however, seemed reluctant to grow too close to Ning Zhuo. After urging everyone to focus on their studies, he turned and departed.

With the Golden Core elder gone, the atmosphere on the peak immediately relaxed.

Many Confucian cultivators gathered around Ning Zhuo, eager to befriend him.

Ning Zhuo welcomed them all with a warm smile, maintaining a humble and approachable demeanor that put everyone at ease.

Finally, he approached Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and the still-unconscious Kong Ran. "Fellow Daoists, our meeting here today must be fate."

"It's lunchtime now. Would you honor me by accepting my treat?"

Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu exchanged a glance and nodded in unison. "We accept."

The banquet was held at the Green Stone Cave Mansion.

Ning Zhuo introduced Old Chef, Qing Chi, and Gongsun Yan to the trio, prompting another round of meaningful glances between Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran.

Though Ning Zhuo's attire was plain, the presence of three attendants and his refined demeanor clearly indicated he was no ordinary commoner.

The three cultivators immediately revised their assessment of Ning Zhuo, elevating him by a degree.

Even without resorting to his signature Dark Cuisine, Old Chef prepared a feast of exquisite dishes.

While Bai Jiyun and Kong Ran ate heartily, Liu Fushu, despite his attempts at restraint, found himself indulging more than he intended.

After several rounds of wine, Kong Ran bit into a chicken leg and finally spoke. "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, are you willing to sell that Ideographic Brush? My father is one of the current prime ministers of the Flying Cloud Kingdom. If you're interested, name your price!"

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "The Ideographic Brush enhances cultivation realms, so I have no intention of selling it. However... I have a close acquaintance with innate talent and early wisdom. Fellow Daoist Kong Ran previously demonstrated an Innate Talent Technique. Would you be willing to sell that method? If so, this Ghost Path Golden Core can serve as a deposit."

The three cultivators' pupils constricted simultaneously, their gazes fixed on the Ghost Path Golden Core in Ning Zhuo's hand.
