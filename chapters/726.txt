Chapter 726: Heart Inquiry at the Sinking Karma Mirror Platform

Virtually all Soul-Searching Techniques extract the subject's memories for the cultivator to review.

This is akin to reading a book, but the content is unfiltered and overwhelmingly vast, with less than one percent likely to be truly useful.

From this perspective, Confucian cultivation possesses a significant advantage. The classical texts studied by Confucian cultivators are veritable pearls of wisdom, each word a gem, greatly enhancing cultivation efficiency.

Having mastered all the Soul-Searching Techniques recorded by Heavenly Frost, Ning Zhuo held an edge even within the Soul Devouring Sect, placing him at the forefront of the world.

He discovered that only the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique allowed cultivators to experience another's memories as if they were their own. The knowledge gained through this method was nearly indistinguishable from personal experience.

However, the technique's immense drawbacks were unbearable for most.

There must be other methods to mitigate or counteract this flaw. My Innate Talent is one such means.

"The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's ambitions run deep. If his century-long scheme succeeds, he'll likely soar to unimaginable heights."

"No wonder Yang Heaven seeks to thwart his path to enlightenment!"

Ning Zhuo needed to perform soul searches and rely on his true self to gain experience. But the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord possessed innate talent, allowing him to immerse himself in the Forgetful River and directly extract memories.

This method was far more efficient than Ning Zhuo's individual soul searches!

If the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord acquired this innate talent, his entire Dao Path would undergo a transformative qualitative shift.

Ning Zhuo studied diligently and practiced extensively, now fully realizing that the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique would be an indispensable spell in his future cultivation.

"My mastery of the Soul Dao and Yin Attribute remains weak, only at the initial stages. To improve the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique, I would need to invest an immense amount of time and effort."

"For the time being, focusing on resolving the five major flaws of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique is the most practical approach."

Having mastered numerous Soul-Searching Techniques and gained a deeper understanding of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique, Ning Zhuo now grasped the true nature of the so-called Five Calamities.

The Five Calamities were: first, Nameless Blame; second, Soul Awareness; third, Boat Marks; fourth, Karmic Burning; and fifth, Lost Navigation.

"The true purpose of this spell is to induce cultivation and create soul materials. Therefore, the greater the transformation of the soul, the more severe and negative the consequences."

"Soul Awareness occurs when the Soul's influence reaches the Upper Dantian Divine Sea, disrupting the condensation of divine sense."

"Boat Marks, on the other hand, arise from excessive Soul modification, causing the Soul to become incompatible with the Physical Body and damaging it. It's similar to how my excessively strong Soul cultivation once caused various bruises and marks to appear on my Physical Body. However, the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique is far more severe."

Having grasped the underlying principles, Ning Zhuo devised countermeasures for each of these drawbacks.

The solution was simple: since the spell modifies the Soul, he would simply refine the Soul back to its original state after using the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique.

This Soul modification lies hidden deep within the Soul, making it difficult to detect. Otherwise, the spell wouldn't have deceived so many cultivators.

But Ning Zhuo, having mastered the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique, was an exception.

However, he still lacked inspiration on how to refine the Soul back to its original state.

"That doesn't matter!"

"Since I can detect the modified portions of the Soul, I'll just excise them."

It was akin to having a piece of flesh cut from the Physical Body - the Soul would naturally be injured. But with the Four Treasures of Soul Cultivation and numerous soul cultivation methods and healing techniques at his disposal, Ning Zhuo could easily heal the Soul.

Just like Lady Spiderweb earlier, a significant portion of her Three Souls had been extracted and woven into soul cloth. However, with proper rest and treatment, her Soul would eventually recover.

The Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique was inherently against the natural order. By using the Three Souls Spinning Wheel Technique as an auxiliary method, one could avoid easily causing others' Souls to scatter.

This approach allowed Ning Zhuo to effectively circumvent the Red Lotus Karmic Fire, the most critical of the Five Calamities.

The other four calamities differed fundamentally from this one.

The Red Lotus Karmic Fire wasn't a mere side effect of Soul modification; it was a miniature heavenly tribulation triggered when the practitioner's accumulated sins reached a critical threshold!

The Jade Slip of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique warned: "In mild cases, yin fire will surge, burning meridians and destroying networks. In severe cases, flames will erupt from the five viscera, self-cooking the practitioner into a stew!"

This clearly demonstrated the catastrophic consequences of such a calamity.

"I need to understand how much karmic debt each use of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique incurs."

"What method can accurately measure this?"

This was a crucial question Ning Zhuo needed to answer. Without this knowledge, every future use of the technique would be fraught with anxiety, preventing him from fully utilizing its potential.

In the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, this problem might have remained unsolved. But now was the golden age of cultivation!

Even in other Immortal Cities, finding a solution might have been impossible. But this was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main headquarters!

Moreover, the Flying Cloud Assembly was still in its early stages.

Ning Zhuo quickly found three methods by reviewing the intelligence jade slip.

After pondering for a moment, he made his arrangements. Selecting one of the methods, he contacted Sun Lingtong through Life Hanging by a Thread: "Boss, I need you to go out and buy some supplies."

Upon hearing Ning Zhuo's explanation, Sun Lingtong immediately set off in secret. He left Jade Cleansing Hall and headed straight for Yu Heye's cave dwelling.

Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo left his Blue Stone Cave Dwelling and made his way to the nearest branch of the Demon Subjugation Hall.

The Myriad Manifestations Sect comprised eight peaks and sixteen halls, with the Demon Subjugation Hall being one of them.

Yang Sanyan, a comrade-in-arms of Ning Zhuo, was a key figure in the Demon Subjugation Hall.

The Demon Subjugation Hall had already held its Rising Cloud Trial. Their purpose was clear and singular: to recruit new members.

Ning Zhuo descended from the clouds, entered the Demon Subjugation Hall, and arrived at an inner gate.

Cultivators guarded the entrance. Ning Zhuo presented his wooden token and was granted entry.

Stepping through the gate, his vision abruptly shifted, transporting him into a spatial formation.

Black stone walls surrounded him, while the ground was a deep, eerie swamp that glowed with an unsettling, dim light.

The Sinking Karma Swamp!

At the center of this artificial swamp stood a stone platform, upon which rested a plaque. Four majestic, gilded characters, radiating righteous energy, were inscribed on it: "The Clear Mirror Hangs High."

On the steps beneath the plaque sat several cultivators, their Qi deep and profound, clad in the dark cyan robes of high-ranking members of the Demon Subjugation Hall. Their gazes, sharp as lightning, periodically swept across the swamp, scrutinizing the cultivators struggling through the mire.

The Demon Subjugation Hall, one of the Sixteen Halls, offered exceptional benefits and compensation, naturally attracting a flood of newcomers eager to join its ranks.

The grueling trek through the Sinking Karma Swamp served as the first stage of selection.

Ning Zhuo was merely one among them.

His gaze swept across the scene, revealing at least fifty cultivators wading through the swamp.

Cautious by nature, Ning Zhuo paused to observe before proceeding.

Most cultivators who entered the swamp found the mud reaching their ankles, while for some, it rose as high as their thighs. Pulling their legs free from the swamp proved arduous, as the mud exerted a powerful suction. A layer of gray mist constantly swirled around them, further intensifying the oppressive atmosphere.

Sweat beaded on the cultivators' foreheads, their expressions grave as they relentlessly channeled their spiritual energy, their physical stamina rapidly depleting.

Several cultivators faced particularly dramatic predicaments. The moment their feet touched the swamp, the mud instantly engulfed them up to their waists or even chests! Only by frantically activating their magic treasures to shatter the mud and struggling desperately could they manage to escape.

Throughout this ordeal, the Sinking Karma Swamp seemed to come alive, clinging to the cultivators and attempting to drag them down into its depths.

As Ning Zhuo observed, more than half of these cultivators were eliminated. Crying out for help, they were teleported away by the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivators on the Stone Platform, who activated the Formation.

A handful of other cultivators - so few they could be counted on one hand - moved with remarkable ease. Their feet trod firmly on the swamp's surface, the mud solidifying beneath their steps. They advanced steadily, leaving only shallow footprints in their wake, completely unaffected by the swamp's suction or attempts to drag them down.

"The Sinking Karma Swamp's reaction is directly proportional to the weight of one's sins," Ning Zhuo murmured to himself.

"The more sins a cultivator carries, the more treacherous the Sinking Karma Swamp becomes, capable of drowning them."

"Conversely, the fewer sins one bears, the more harmless the swamp becomes, transforming into a seemingly flat, solid surface!"

Ning Zhuo was no stranger to the Sinking Karma Swamp, having studied it extensively in books.

What kind of performance will I exhibit? With this question in mind, Ning Zhuo took his first step onto the swamp.

The swamp's surface instantly solidified beneath his foot, transforming into a solid brick!

As Ning Zhuo continued forward, the ground remained firm and unyielding, leaving not even a footprint.

This was truly walking on solid ground!

There was no sinking, no suction, no resistance whatsoever.

While ordinary cultivators were shrouded in a layer of gray mist, Ning Zhuo's surroundings remained clear and pristine. He moved with effortless ease, strolling leisurely through the swamp, a stark contrast to the struggling cultivators around him.

"Hmm?" After taking just a dozen steps, Ning Zhuo immediately drew the attention of numerous onlookers.

By the time he reached the midpoint, nearly all the high-level cultivators on the central Stone Platform Official Seal had their eyes fixed on him, scrutinizing him intently.

"Who is this young man?"

"His cultivation is at the late Foundation Establishment stage, but he's young and shows great promise!"

"It's rare to see a cultivator elicit such a reaction from the Sinking Karma Swamp."

"The boy's gaze is clear and his bearing is dignified. He must have been nurtured by one of those ancient, Righteous Path sects with strict rules, where they spare no effort or resources to isolate their disciples from the world's turmoil!"

The high-ranking cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall secretly communicated using their divine sense.

One of them shook his head slightly. "It seems this boy hasn't experienced much bloody combat. His hands are remarkably clean. That's why the Sinking Karma Swamp reacted this way - no karmic debt from killing. Once we recruit him, we'll need to focus on developing his combat experience."

Another cultivator countered, "While he may lack combat experience, the absence of even a wisp of gray mist around him proves his pure foundation and clear mind. Isn't this precisely the integrity we expect from a renowned Righteous Path sect?"

The group showered Ning Zhuo with praise.

"Regardless of his innate talent, this performance alone warrants his admission to the Demon Subjugation Hall."

"Patience! The Sinking Karma Swamp is merely the first screening method, and its detection capabilities are limited. In past years, some Demonic Cultivators have used strange magic treasures or other means to conceal their sins and blood debts, allowing them to pass through the swamp."

"Indeed. Now, let's see how the youth performs under the Official Seal."

The high-level cultivators secretly held Ning Zhuo in high regard, but outwardly, they quickly shifted their gazes away from him.

Ning Zhuo effortlessly surpassed Fellow Cultivator Xu.

Amidst envious, jealous, and resentful stares, he leisurely approached the central stone platform.

"This must be the easiest Rising Cloud Trial I've ever participated in," Ning Zhuo mused inwardly.

The high-level cultivators on the stone platform were already growing impatient. One elder couldn't help but urge, "The newcomer should ascend the platform."

"Junior Ning Zhuo pays his respects to all seniors," Ning Zhuo said politely, bowing with clasped hands from below the platform before beginning his ascent.

The cultivators on the platform nodded inwardly. "This lad knows his Rites. He must be from a prominent family. Good, good."

As Ning Zhuo climbed to the top of the platform, the elder who had spoken earlier continued to instruct, "Step forward and touch the Official Seal with your hand."

Ning Zhuo complied.

With a calm expression, he gently placed his palm on the surface of the Official Seal.

The four large characters on the official seal, "The Clear Mirror Hangs High," began to emit a faint golden glow.

The high-ranking cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall exchanged surprised glances, communicating through divine sense.

"This youth actually possesses merit."

"What good deeds has he performed?"

"His background must be deep, with a powerful family supporting him. It's no surprise he's done some charitable acts."

"It's a pity the Hall Master isn't here. If our Master were present, he could fully activate the official seal to determine the exact extent of this young man's merit."

"How much merit could someone so young possibly have? Perhaps his family arranged this for him to join the Demon Subjugation Hall, pulling strings behind the scenes."

"Let's see if he passes the Heart Inquiry first."

Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, was examining the official seal, a hint of curiosity in his eyes. This is an official artifact?

The elderly cultivator spoke: "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, you have merit and no crimes. You have passed the second round of testing. Congratulations."

"However, I still have three questions for you. You may answer or remain silent. But if you speak, you must speak from the heart. Do not deceive others, and above all, do not deceive yourself."

Upon hearing these words, the faces of the cultivators closest to the stone platform paled, their expressions a mix of anxiety and anticipation, hoping to see Ning Zhuo stumble.

The other high-ranking cultivators remained impassive, showing no surprise.

Ning Zhuo's performance in the Sinking Karma Swamp had earned him the right to undergo the Heart Inquiry by the Demon Subjugation Hall.

Ning Zhuo immediately clasped his hands in a respectful bow, his voice clear and resonant. "Thank you, Senior. Please ask whatever you wish."

He was well-versed in the relevant information.

This round of the Rising Cloud Trial served as the Demon Subjugation Hall's preliminary selection process, comprising two tests: the Sinking Karma Swamp and the Stone Platform Official Seal. Passing both would grant entry to the next round.

However, for exceptionally promising newcomers, the Demon Subjugation Hall would administer a third test: the Heart Inquiry.

The elderly cultivator nodded slightly, a flicker of subtle approval in his eyes. He spoke slowly, his voice measured: "The Great Dao stretches vast and boundless, yet demonic fiends roam rampant. If you encounter vile demonic fiends who poison living beings, and you lack the strength to subdue them, so be it. But if you capture them, and they grovel for mercy, offering great rewards or pledging their usefulness as vanguard... how would you deal with them?"

All eyes, both on and off the stage, focused on Ning Zhuo.

Some subtle mechanisms had already been activated. Ning Zhuo felt a faint tremor in his Upper Dantian Divine Sea, but the next moment, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal emitted waves of demonic light, sweeping through his divine sea and instantly stabilizing his dantian.

Ning Zhuo's mood was peculiar. He was somewhat surprised, as this was the first time he had witnessed the Buddha Heart Demon Seal passively activating and emitting demonic light. Previously, it had only ever emitted Buddhist Light.

In that instant, he realized that the Demon Subjugation Hall's Heart Inquiry methods had become ineffective against him.
