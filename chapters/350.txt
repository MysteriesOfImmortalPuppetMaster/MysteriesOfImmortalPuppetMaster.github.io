Chapter 350: Ten Thousand Medicines Valley

Six Golden Core level mountain essences were hidden in a wall compartment.

The four walls of the storage cabin were distributed with mechanical wall boxes.

Normally, the wall box covers were lowered, keeping the compartments sealed.

To the naked eye, no trace could be seen from the outside.

Ning Zhuo only needed to control with his divine sense to raise the wall box covers,

revealing the treasures inside.

Each wall compartment had a storage formation to care for it.

For example, the mountain essences in the wall box receives nourishment from earth-attribute spirit energy,

allowing them to be preserved for a long time.

Some wall boxes had space formations set up, with huge internal spaces able to store large amounts of items.

Treasures like mist rust orchids and mist haze stones were classified separately,

each stored in different wall boxes.

Ning Zhuo opened the wall boxes, checking the mountain essences, mist rust orchids, and mist haze stones in turn.

These were all obtained from the Fox God, and their quality was very good.

The mist rust orchids provided by the Fox God were even better in quality than those

Sun Lingtong had previously taken from inside the cloud whale.

Worthy of being a mountain god's treasured collection.

"Perhaps the mist haze stones can be combined with the Ice Snow Weather Sphere?"

Ning Zhuo thought while checking.

He had previously specifically purchased a Foundation Establishment level Cold Snow Cloud to pair with the Ice Snow Weather Sphere.
In the previous battle with the Fox God, this combination had shown good effects and achieved some results.

Although at that time, Ning Zhuo hadn't relied on them to dispel the mountain mist covering the sky, their contribution couldn't be erased.

"It's a pity the Fox God couldn't be used by me. Her Cloud and Mist Confusion innate talent are rather powerful. If it could have been combinedâ€¦"

From refining the Black Wind Tiger Demon's tiger bones, Ning Zhuo had seen:

the higher the grade and more lively the fire-refined item, the more spiritual essence obtained.

Ning Zhuo still regretted not obtaining the Fox God's Cloud and Mist Confusion innate talent.

At that time, he indeed had the opportunity to not plot against Jade Steel Mountain,

but to solidify the great crime of the Fox God colluding with the Black Wind Tiger Demon, causing her to perish.

Considering his branch family, fighting in a divine being's domain, striking at the Meng family, deepening cooperation with the Zhu family, and long-term considerations for the clan's future, he gave up the Cloud and Mist Confusion innate talent and chose the path of maximizing benefits.

When he asked Zhu Xuanji how to deal with the Fox God, he still held some hope.

However, Zhu Xuanji, being the Golden Core figurehead of the royal family,

not only had superior combat power but also understood the big picture, steady and wise.

Now, the matter of Mist Concealment Mountain was considered concluded.

The Fox God had become the official Mountain God, her past crimes offset, still retaining her official position in the Southern Bean Kingdom.

This made it very difficult for Ning Zhuo to take action again.

"Forget it, there are so many innate talents, it's not worth dealing with a small Fox God

and offending Zhu Xuanji and the Southern Bean Kingdom."

Ning Zhuo continued to check the purple qi morning dew, ghost shadow bamboo, and Spirit Concealment Willow.

The purple qi morning dew, like celestial dew, was bottled and well-preserved in the wall boxes.

Most cultivators focused on absorbing purple qi to aid cultivation.

Ning Zhuo, however, was an exception.

He cultivated the Three Sects Supreme Methods, unique and extraordinary, with no need for purple qi.

"The ghost shadow bamboo is very suitable for making Meng Yehu's mechanical body, these bamboos themselves are its companion items."

"Now, the time isn't ripe yet."

Ning Zhuo first needed to design the blueprint for Meng Yehu's mechanical body,

then use Foundation Establishment level materials to refine it.

The resulting mechanical body would need to be used extensively by Meng Yehu.

Ning Zhuo would make multiple improvements to the mechanical body during use,

based on Meng Yehu's suggestions and experience.

Only when the entire mechanical body was relatively mature would he choose to use the ghost shadow bamboo.

After all, this material was very rare.

Judging by market price alone, considering them as Golden Core level wouldn't be wrong.

The final focus was on the Spirit Concealment Willow!

The Spirit Concealment Willow's trunk was divine in color, with hidden mysteries.

Its branches were tender and yellow, full of vitality.

The willow leaves were evergreen, like a layer of thin jade, translucent and nearly transparent.

The edges of the willow leaves were slightly curved, and under light,

they faintly glowed with spiritual radiance, like the clear green light of a limpid lake.

Ning Zhuo reached out to touch the willow tree. The branches felt soft as cotton,

and the willow leaves gave him a cool sensation, as if touching dewdrops in the early morning.

The entire Spirit Concealment Willow constantly emitted a faint, clean fragrance,

like sandalwood or orchid. The scent wasn't strong but lingering and serene.

Ning Zhuo savored it carefully, feeling refreshed and clear-minded, all worries dispersed.

His entire being was being purified. Even without meditation,

he could feel his spiritual thoughts stirring, wisdom permeating in his heart.

"Good tree, good tree!" Ning Zhuo had a strong feeling that this Spirit Concealment Willow would be of great use to him.

"However, before that, it needs to be transplanted quickly.

The Spirit Concealment Willow can't always be kept in the wall box."

"For spirit plants, it's still best to be in the soil."

But this required Ning Zhuo to set up a spirit plant cabin.

The spirit plant cabin in the Myriad-Li Game Dragon was similar to the refining cabin.

It had formations, and they were at the Nascent Soul level, but it needed to be filled with other materials.

The current refining cabin didn't even have a grain of soil.

After personally checking everything, Ning Zhuo left the storage cabin and went to the dragon head cabin to replace Sun Lingtong.

Entering the cabin, he saw Sun Lingtong eagerly trying out various functions of the mechanical dragon, enjoying herself immensely.

Seeing Ning Zhuo arrive, he immediately asked about the fire burial.

Ning Zhuo told him truthfully.

Sun Lingtong felt very happy.

When Ning Zhuo prepared to replace him, he waved her hand:

"Little Zhuo, you go cultivate. You've just reached the early stage of Foundation Establishment, cultivation should be your priority. Secondly, don't you need to create Meng Yehu's mechanical body?

The spirit plant cabin for the Spirit Concealment Willow also needs you to set up."

"You have too many things to do."

"You go busy yourself, I'll watch over the course."

"Don't worry, when we reach Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, I'll call you."

Ten Thousand Medicines Valley was hidden among steep mountains, with magnificent scenery and unparalleled beauty.

A young girl in yellow, holding a bamboo basket, was walking down from the mountain.

The morning light was faint, thin mist like gauze, making the valley appear like a fairyland.

By the time the girl reached the foot of the mountain, the early sun had risen in the east,

golden light spilling over, illuminating the green mountains in brilliant splendor.

The girl, familiar with the path, entered the valley.

Inside the valley, towering cypresses and pines blocked out the sky.

Winding paths paved with stone slabs were flanked by strange flowers and exotic grasses, fragrant and lush.

Bird songs echoed in the mountains, crisp and pleasing to the ear, like heavenly music.

Gradually, the sound of water grew louder.

When the yellow-clothed girl came to a clear pool, she saw a silver curtain hanging on the cliff by the pool.

A small waterfall plunged straight down, thundering as it crashed into the pool, stirring up mist.

The girl stepped on the water's surface, cast a spell, and walked directly towards the waterfall.

Behind the waterfall was a slanting mountain path.

She followed the path, climbing diagonally upwards, with the waterfall and skylight on the outside,

and damp stone walls on the inside.

The mountain stone walls, due to the dense water vapor, were mottled with moss,

with vines hanging down. A morning breeze blew, shaking the mist,

making the green leaves on the vines sway, echoing the ripples in the pool.

The girl took a deep breath, feeling a cool freshness penetrate her lungs, feeling delighted.

She slowly stopped at the entrance of a cave and called out softly: "Senior Brother, Senior Brother."

After a few breaths, a male voice came from inside the cave: "Is that Little Junior Sister? Please, come in quickly!"

Inside the cave, the senior and junior disciples met.

The girl put down her bamboo basket, took out the meals, and arranged them on a relatively flat stone surface.

The Senior Brother glanced over and urgently asked: "Little Junior Sister, where's my wine?"

The girl snorted: "Wine, wine, wine, is that all you know?"

"Master told you to watch over the medicinal herbs, but you secretly used them to brew wine."

"Now you're being punished, guarding the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave, and still drinking.

If the Master finds out, see if he doesn't flay you!"

The Senior Brother sighed and frowned: "Little Junior Sister, you know I can't be happy without wine.

Please, be kind and bring out the wine quickly. My alcohol addiction is acting up,

I couldn't sleep all night yesterday."

The girl snorted coldly: "Here, here."

Her storage jade bracelet glowed faintly, and she took out a bottle of medicinal wine, handing it to Senior Brother.

Senior Brother received it as if it were a precious treasure, overjoyed.

He took it, uncorked the bottle, and after drinking a few mouthfuls, sighed with satisfaction:

"Why is there only a small bottle?"

The girl: "That's all there is."

"Senior Brother, you're guarding the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave.

If you get drunk and are dragged into the cave by beast demons, you'll lose your life!"

Senior Brother waved his hand dismissively: "This Ten Thousand Beasts Cave has been cleared out for a long time,

it's nearly abandoned now. How could there be beast demons?"

"This is a matter of life and death, Senior Brother, you're too careless!"

The girl immediately puffed up her cheeks and angrily began to lecture him.

Senior Brother listened to Little Junior Sister's lecture while picking up chopsticks and tasting the exquisite meal.

When Little Junior Sister was tired of talking, he looked up at the little sister he had watched grow up, his gaze tender: "Lin Shanshan, do you have anything else to say?"

Lin Shanshan rolled her eyes. Seeing that Senior Brother had finished breakfast,

she waved her hand, generating a burst of energy that collected the bowls and chopsticks into the bamboo basket:

"Linghu Jiu, can't you behave a bit? Always making the Master angry, being punished to guard the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave.

Do you know how annoying it is for me to bring you meals every day?"

Linghu Jiu quickly apologized.

After scolding him for a while, Lin Shanshan left the cave and returned the way she came.

At the poolside, she unexpectedly found a stranger wandering nearby and lightly called out: "Who are you?"

Ning Zhuo turned at her words.

His features were delicate, his gaze clear as the pool water.

Now dressed all in white, standing by the pool, his figure was tall and straight.

A mountain breeze blew, making his clothes flutter.

The pool was emerald green, its rippling surface reflecting his figure.

Around him, flowers were just blooming, morning dew glistening, grass and trees lush.

The girl's heart skipped a beat, and she unconsciously held her breath.

Ning Zhuo revealed an apologetic smile, cupped his hands in greeting and said:

"I am Ning Zhuo from Fire Persimmon Mountain. I've come to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley specifically to seek guidance and learning. I hope I'm not intruding."

"May I ask the young lady's name?"

Lin Shanshan didn't know why, but her heart began to beat faster involuntarily.

She opened her mouth to respond: "This little one is Lin Shanshan."

As soon as she spoke, she felt strange. Why had her voice become so small?
