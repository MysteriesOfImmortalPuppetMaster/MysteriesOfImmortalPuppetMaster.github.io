Chapter 596: Ten Thousand Man Soul

The battlefield reverberated with ghostly wails and wolfish howls.

An endless tide of ghosts relentlessly battered against White Paper Immortal City!

The six Golden Core-level ghost commanders, including the Silent Ghost General, had already discreetly retreated earlier. Sun Lingtong, mingled with the main ghost army, arrived beneath White Paper Immortal City and witnessed the spectacularly grim battle unfolding.

He saw thousands of Big-headed Ghosts spewing torrents of chilling winds, while countless Small-headed Ghosts swarmed incessantly toward the city walls.

On the walls, the City Guard held firm, wielding talismanic weapons to maintain their lines. Amidst flashes of blades and swords, not a single Small-headed Ghost breached the defenses.

Suddenly, hundreds of Lantern Ghosts surged forward, launching a focused assault on the city gates.

Spewing ghostly flames in a furious attempt to incinerate the gates, the Lantern Ghosts were quickly met by fierce countermeasures. From the city gates erupted thick layers of ghostly brilliance and streams of black water, not only extinguishing the ghost flames but also drowning and slaughtering most of the Lantern Ghosts.

Barely twenty Lantern Ghosts survived, fleeing hastily.

Yet, the ghost tide remained immense, continuously swelling with fresh waves of Small-headed and Big-headed Ghosts.

The source of these endless ghosts was none other than the Ghost Mothers.

These massive Ghost Mothers lay sprawled on the open ground outside the city, ceaselessly inhaling vast amounts of Yin energy, producing an endless stream of new ghosts.

On the city wall, Tie Guzheng, commander of the City Guard, glared fiercely at the Ghost Mothers. He knew clearly that stopping this tide required eliminating these sources.

He longed to lead a decisive charge outside the city to slaughter the Ghost Mothers but hesitated upon spotting the formidable ghostly army further away.

Unlike previous ghost tides, this time the Underworld Prefecture of Forgetful River had dispatched actual elite troops!

Undoubtedly, this posed an unprecedented challenge to Tie Guzheng.

Observing quietly from within the ghost army, Sun Lingtong was secretly amazed. "White Paper Immortal City's defenses are astonishing!"

The ghost tide surged fiercely, yet White Paper Immortal City remained as stable as a towering mountain. Tie Guzheng’s defensive prowess was impeccable.

Under his command, the City Guard operated like a well-oiled machine, calmly repelling each assault. Even when crises arose, Tie Guzheng swiftly issued precise orders, stabilizing the lines effortlessly.

"Truly deserving of its name as an immortal city," Sun Lingtong remarked to himself. "Even if this ghostly army were ten times larger, breaching the city would be impossible."

"However, the Lord of Forgotten River wouldn’t dispatch troops without a hidden card."

As Sun Lingtong considered this, turmoil erupted within the city!

Countless Water Ghosts surged from the waterways inside, attacking civilians indiscriminately. Initially caught unprepared, hundreds of city residents perished before organized resistance could form.

Even after the residents regrouped, these Water Ghosts, strengthened by military formations and strategies, continued their rampage, harvesting lives mercilessly.

Hearing this turmoil, the banners of the ghostly army began to flutter vigorously.

The ghost army charged, launching an assault toward the city walls.

Led by a Hanging Ghost General, a battalion of Hanging Ghosts swiftly moved beneath the city walls, tossing up nooses to scale upwards.

The City Guard quickly split, wielding swords and axes to cut these ropes.

The Hanging Ghost General climbed aggressively, lashing out with his long, venomous tongue at the defenders. His formidable prowess quickly wounded many guards, knocking several off the wall, where they were instantly torn apart by the ghosts below.

Seeing the Hanging Ghost General nearly breach the wall, Tie Guzheng snorted coldly, activating an ancient seal he held.

Instantly, layers of talismanic bricks rose from the wall, sending countless spells flying into the sky.

The spells had diverse effects - some fortified the defenses, while others decimated the Hanging Ghost ranks. The Hanging Ghost General, though mighty, was battered down by this barrage.

Seeing this setback, the Ghost Army commander swiftly adjusted tactics.

Flags waved again, and another wave, led by Lantern Ghost Generals and their subordinates, charged a different wall segment.

Rather than climbing, they directly rammed into the wall’s base.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A series of explosions violently shook the walls.

Flames erupted, rapidly engulfing the walls and licking the layers of enchanted paper protecting them.

Tie Guzheng finally showed visible concern.

The ghost army had clearly come prepared. These fiery attacks directly countered White Paper Immortal City's foundational methods.

Yet, moments later, Tie Guzheng scoffed coldly and activated another defense.

Torrents of black water surged forth again, violently clashing with the flames.

Hissing steam filled the air, as the water steadily extinguished the flames.

As the fire dwindled, it suddenly transformed into a massive Flaming Ghost, which let out one final, mournful wail before dissipating entirely.

"Black Water Mountain, White Paper City…" murmured Sun Lingtong, gaining deeper respect for this renowned title.

After consecutive failures, the Ghost Army commander wore a grim expression. With reluctance, he ordered his forces to slow their assault, eyes turning hopefully toward the south gate.

He was counting on greater chaos erupting within, hoping internal disorder would finally grant him an opening.

Silent Ghost General and his five companions were unaware of the lofty expectations placed upon them. At this critical juncture, their main concern was simply surviving the damned Jade Chime True Sound Formation.

They were riddled with wounds, while Wen Ruanyu and Ning Zhuo remained unruffled, their calm demeanor unmarred by even a single bead of sweat.

The key was preparedness against unpreparedness - the formation deployed was precisely tailored to counter their specific group.

Wen Ruanyu operated the formation, with Ning Zhuo standing quietly by his side, occasionally casting admiring glances towards him.

"Wen Ruanyu truly lives up to his status as a Golden Core True Disciple of the Myriad Manifestation Sect," Ning Zhuo thought, deeply impressed.

"He is a Confucian cultivator, proficient in the Four Arts - music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. He previously demonstrated his self-portrait, manifesting a Golden Core-level double. And now, by expertly setting up and controlling the Jade Chime True Sound Formation, he's revealed astonishing proficiency in both formation arts and music cultivation."

Ning Zhuo quietly praised Wen Ruanyu in his heart, gaining a deeper understanding of the man's strength.

If Wen Ruanyu were to fight one-on-one against opponents such as the earlier Blabbermouth Ghost General and the other two Golden Cores, he would find himself at a disadvantage.

However, with sufficient preparation - setting and commanding formations - he was able to unleash far greater combat prowess.

Throughout the battle thus far, Ning Zhuo had barely lifted a finger; it was Wen Ruanyu alone who shouldered the fight.

Utilizing the formation, Wen Ruanyu singlehandedly faced six opponents, firmly maintaining the upper hand.

Continuing on this path, Wen Ruanyu might even capture all six Golden Core ghost generals alive!

Amidst the chaos, the Crimson-haired Ghost General, surrounded by bronze luan birds, let out a furious roar, igniting his very life force to launch his strongest blow.

Boom!

The explosion and intense flames directly destroyed one of the bronze pillars.

Seizing this opportunity, the Flower Life Ghost General unleashed a sinister technique - Ghostly Fate Soul Flowers!

"Not good!" Wen Ruanyu's expression slightly changed as he focused entirely on maintaining the formation's stability, leaving him unable to counter this ghostly art.

The Jade Chime rang ceaselessly, mitigating most of the ghostly technique's devastating power.

Yet Ning Zhuo still sustained a minor injury.

His physical body was untouched, but his soul was invaded by countless flower buds. They quickly bloomed, greedily absorbing his soul energy, causing dizziness and rapidly diminishing his state.

Reacting swiftly, Ning Zhuo grabbed his Soul Martial Axe and swung it directly at his soul. In desperation, he did not hesitate to slice off even healthy parts of his soul, determined to eradicate every last soul flower swiftly.

With sheer determination, Ning Zhuo endured the agony of severing his soul, managing to swiftly clear the infestation.

"This ghost technique bypasses normal defenses, targeting the soul directly. My soul cultivation is still lacking," Ning Zhuo noted grimly, committing this lesson deeply to memory.

He also turned his attention to the Silent Ghost General, deducing the true source behind this surprise attack.

"The ghost technique appeared without warning - not due to a lack of preparation, but rather because it was silently enhanced by his talent, escaping my detection."

"What a formidable and practical talent," Ning Zhuo thought appreciatively.

The Ghostly Fate Soul Flowers represented the final desperate counterattack from the ghost generals.

Both Wen Ruanyu and Ning Zhuo successfully weathered this last-ditch assault.

Shortly after, five Golden Core ghost generals were captured alive by Wen Ruanyu, while the Crimson-haired Ghost General fell valiantly on the battlefield.

"After interrogation, could you possibly grant me this Silent Ghost General?" Ning Zhuo proposed.

Wen Ruanyu swiftly explained that this was not his decision to make. The ghost generals would be personally interrogated by the City Lord’s clone, aiming to extract valuable intelligence.

Wen Ruanyu reassured Ning Zhuo, emphasizing that Ning Zhuo's discovery of the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern and provision of crucial intelligence had significantly contributed to their victory. More rewards would undoubtedly follow. Due to the ongoing war situation, Wen Ruanyu advised Ning Zhuo to wait patiently for further developments while he personally escorted the captives to the City Lord’s mansion.

Ning Zhuo considered briefly, then shook his head.

"I'll stay here and take over controlling the Jade Chime True Sound Formation from you, Senior Wen," he stated firmly.

"Though unlikely, if another wave of attackers arrives, the paper giant at the city's south might fall."

After brief contemplation, Wen Ruanyu generously handed Ning Zhuo all formation-controlling treasures and provided him with a jade slip containing the formation’s details.

Additionally, Wen Ruanyu positioned his Golden Core-level painting clone next to Ning Zhuo, silently monitoring the situation.

As Wen Ruanyu left with the captives, Ning Zhuo hovered cross-legged, actively controlling the formation and considering the broader implications.

"This marks the second attack by the Forgotten River Underworld forces," he mused.

"The first time involved three Golden Core cultivators, now it has doubled to six."

"Will they continue their assault? And if so, how much stronger will the next wave be?"

"Why is this place so crucial?"

"Could it be because of Mother’s hidden arrangements here, provoking such dread from the Forgotten River Underworld, driving them to erase it at all costs?"

"Mother placed the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern here, and though the paper armies weren’t her doing, she crafted numerous passages to the Underworld. What exactly was her intent?"

Though he couldn't unravel these mysteries immediately, Ning Zhuo remained composed, patiently contemplating his circumstances.

Aware of his lack of crucial information, Ning Zhuo felt an intuition tugging at him, whispering that he was destined to uncover it soon.

Just then, Sun Lingtong covertly reached out through the Life Hanging by a Thread, swiftly bringing Ning Zhuo up to speed on the true state of battle.

"The White Paper Immortal City truly deserves its name. The frontal assault is currently manageable," Ning Zhuo mused thoughtfully. "The real threat remains internal. Ghostly creatures continue to emerge relentlessly from the city's waterways, launching attacks indiscriminately."

"Who could possibly be the traitor hiding among the city's upper echelons?" Ning Zhuo pondered aloud. The city lord had tasked him with rooting out the insider threat, yet Ning Zhuo was keenly aware of his limitations. His earlier discovery of the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern had been more luck than investigative skill.

Once Ning Zhuo ensured his mastery over the Jade Chime True Sound Formation, sufficient to repel attacks from the Golden Core-level ghost generals, he began cultivating his soul. The earlier encounter with the Ghost Flower Technique made him particularly cautious about strengthening his soul foundation.

Taking a generous gulp of Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine, a comforting warmth spread from his stomach, climbing his spine before blossoming into a crisp, refreshing chill reminiscent of mint at his neck.

Warm and cold sensations mingled within his skull, immersing his soul in an ethereal forest shrouded in morning mist, every thread of his soul glistening with crystalline dew.

His previously injured soul swiftly healed and even showed signs of subtle strengthening.

Not wasting a moment, Ning Zhuo lit the Nine Springs Rest Incense. Its fragrance filled his lungs, infusing his body and mind with profound tranquility. Chaotic thoughts and scattered emotions dissolved effortlessly, plunging him into an extraordinarily serene state.

Before long, his soul had fully recovered, showing hints of further improvement.

Next, he retrieved the bronze Hungry Ghost Backlash Cauldron, a three-legged vessel adorned with twin handles, and placed ghost creatures, obtained from Heavenly Ghost’s storage bag, inside it.

Channeling spiritual energy into the cauldron, it shone brilliantly. On its surface, the previously vague images of the Hundred Ghost Devouring illustration now emerged vividly clear. Trapped within, the ghost creatures battled fiercely, ruthlessly tearing each other apart until only one remained, which quickly perished of starvation, leaving behind a Soul Essence.

Absorbing this essence, Ning Zhuo experienced a dramatic surge in soul power, rapidly advancing from a Thousand-Soul strength to sixteen hundred souls.

Driven onward, Ning Zhuo absorbed several more Soul Essences, elevating his soul power beyond five thousand souls.

Such rapid advancement distorted the clarity of his soul, making his form hazy and bloated.

Pausing momentarily, Ning Zhuo opened the Underworld Punishment Codex. He flipped open the iron-bound tome, immediately encountering a depiction of the Boiling Oil Torture.

Channeling spiritual energy into the book, Ning Zhuo’s soul was engulfed in mystical radiance. He let out a muffled groan, experiencing agonizing torment, as though his very soul had plunged into scalding oil.

The book detailed countless infernal tortures - mountains of blades, forests of swords, oceans of fire, glaciers, iron beds, heart extraction, tongue removal, cattle pits, grinding wheels, saw dismemberment, crushing stones, iron trees, intestine-twisting, and blood pools. Ning Zhuo barely endured the third page before nearly collapsing.

His soul emerged severely injured, becoming not only swollen but also riddled with horrific wounds.

Fighting dizziness, Ning Zhuo once again relied on the Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine and Nine Springs Rest Incense to heal his damaged soul.

His recovery this time not only dissolved the bloating but enhanced the definition of his soul form. It now gleamed faintly, demonstrating greater resistance to burning, cutting, and slicing attacks.

Repeating this grueling cycle twice more, Ning Zhuo’s soul power decisively surged past the monumental threshold of ten thousand souls.
