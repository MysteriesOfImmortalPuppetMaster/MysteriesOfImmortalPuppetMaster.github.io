Chapter 172: "Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon"

Ning Zhuo had obtained the "Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra" for some time now. 

From the title of the scripture alone, its main idea is: through the purification of flames, to liberate the wisdom of life from worldly shackles, refining the prajna spirit. 

The Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra indeed possesses such capabilities. 

Ning Zhuo once relied on it to enhance and supplement Yuan Dasheng's spirit, reaching a perfect ten, resulting in a qualitative transformation.

From that moment on, Yuan Dasheng's spirit was full, capable of self-recovery. 

At that time, Ning Zhuo used the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra merely to add spirit to Yuan Dasheng. 

Now, he unexpectedly comprehended a deeper meaning of the Fire Burial Sutra, immediately realizing that he had made significant progress in mechanical constructs as well! 

He released more floating clouds and immediately tried his hand in the clouds for the first time. 

He succeeded on the first try! 

Ning Zhuo obtained a mechanical long whip, which moved like a snake, able to slither on the ground by itself. 

However, after a while, the long whip stopped moving, as if it had died. 

It wasn't because the magical power in the mechanical long whip was exhaustedâ€”it still had plenty.

Rather, the spirit refined by Ning Zhuo had run out! 

Ning Zhuo continued to try several more times. 

There were successes and failures. 

Overall, failures were more frequent, and successes were rare. 

This made Ning Zhuo see the limits of his abilities. 

He secretly assessed, "So far, although I can create some mechanical constructs with spirit, the spirit is quite thin. The more complete the construct, the higher the failure rate, and the shorter the duration of the spirit support." 

"But if I only make mechanical parts, or even accessories, the duration of the spirit support is significantly extended. I should invest in higher-end raw materials. No, it's not just that. I need a lot of practice." 

"My understanding and mastery of the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra also have huge room for improvement!" This unexpected progress made Ning Zhuo extremely excited. 

As long as he could master this technique proficiently, he would be able to tinker with spiritual constructs in the preparation room after his soul entered the Lava Immortal Palace. 

As for raw materials, he could use various demon beasts and spirits from the coffin room behind the Buddhist Sect. 

With the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Ning Zhuo could come and go freely in the Lava Immortal Palace. 

"All along, when my soul entered the Immortal Palace, I struggled to bring external resources inside. The only ones who could freely enter and exit were the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai." 

Cheng Bai, due to his spirit nearly being exhausted, was reluctantly shelved by Ning Zhuo. 

Relying solely on Yuan Dasheng, a single mechanical construct, it was already difficult to fend off the increasing number of trial disciples.

Among them, Meng Chong posed an ever-growing threat. 

Ning Zhuo's control over the trial checkpoints of the Lava Immortal Palace was rapidly declining! 

Now, with the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra, Ning Zhuo had new hope to regain his former level of control. 

Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian both came to report to Ning Zhuo. 

This group of Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Ning family had been overseeing the black market for several days. 

They had successively captured many cultivators who caused trouble in the black market, openly fought, or deceived others with extremely vile behavior. 

Ning Zhuo carefully examined the jade slip, and after a moment, said, "Interrogate these people and ask about their backgrounds. Those with minor offenses can leave after paying their ransom. The last group, hand them over to Lord Fei Si of the City Lord's Mansion. He will appreciate it." 

Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian immediately looked over and simultaneously discovered that the cultivators to be handed over to Fei Si were all notorious criminals, listed on the wanted list of the Southern Bean Kingdom. 

Ning Xiangqian frowned, "Should we secretly escort them?" 

Ning Zhuo shook his head, "There's no need for that. We've done a great deed, shouldn't we publicize it widely?" Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian exchanged glances, both realizing that Ning Zhuo had already reached some private agreement with Fei Si! 

Sure enough, when Fei Si received these captured criminals, he was filled with joy. 

For him, this was all political achievement! 

"It's worth it for me to voluntarily reduce my share to thirty percent. Ning Zhuo, you are very considerate." 

"I didn't misjudge you. In this regard, even the former Sun Lingtong couldn't match your meticulousness." Fei Si praised Ning Zhuo in his heart. 

He thought for a moment and wrote a letter, asking Ning Xiangguo to take it back. 

When Ning Zhuo opened the letter, he found it was an invitation, written by Fei Si on his behalf, to seek an audience with the Book Master. 

The Book Master was a Golden Core cultivator from the All-Book Pavilion. 

The All-Book Pavilion was a super sect, much larger in scale than the Soul Devouring Sect and the Void Sect. 

The first pavilion master who founded the All-Book Pavilion felt that there were too many people in the cultivation world who hoarded their treasures.

In his early years of cultivation, he struggled to find suitable excellent techniques, wasting a lot of time and taking many detours. 

Therefore, after achieving success in his cultivation, he devoted himself to collecting as many cultivation techniques, spells, and other texts as possible. 

Since its establishment, the All-Book Pavilion had always adhered to neutrality.

They profited by selling techniques, spells, or other texts, and then used the profits to acquire more techniques, spells, and so on. 

Ning Zhuo immediately realized that Fei Si writing this invitation for him was a subtle gesture of gratitude. 

Ning Zhuo set off immediately. 

Soon after, with the help of the invitation, he met the Book Master. 

The Book Master, a Golden Core cultivator, purely out of respect for Fei Si, personally received Ning Zhuo, asked a couple of questions, and gave Ning Zhuo an identity token before letting him leave. 

With the identity token in hand, Ning Zhuo went to find the shopkeeper in charge of selling books. 

Although the branch of the All-Book Pavilion in Fire Persimmon Immortal City had not yet been built, the identity token Ning Zhuo held granted him special privileges. 

The shopkeeper asked him what kind of book he wanted to buy. 

Ning Zhuo was not in a hurry and inquired if they were willing to purchase the first three layers of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique. 

The shopkeeper told him that the All-Book Pavilion had already collected over two hundred copies of the first three layers of the technique and had sent them to other branches for comparison and modification.

Eventually, they would complete a more universal and concise technique. 

Ning Zhuo was amazed at the wealth and efficiency of the All-Book Pavilion. 

He then showed the shopkeeper the Embrace Ice Technique and other spells. 

This immediately caught the shopkeeper's eye. 

After all, when the Transmission Bell transmitted the techniques, the whole city knew about it.

Therefore, collecting the first three layers of techniques from the city's residents was very easy for the All-Book Pavilion. 

However, spells like the Embrace Ice Technique were only mastered by the Qi Refining geniuses of the four major forces and the members of the reformation team. 

These people were too few. 

After a moment, the shopkeeper evaluated these spells and quoted a price to Ning Zhuo. 

"In our All-Book Pavilion, there are usually two ways to trade books. The first is with spirit stones. The second is to exchange for corresponding pavilion gold." Ning Zhuo didn't hesitate, "I choose pavilion gold." 

Pavilion gold was the All-Book Pavilion's own currency, without physical form, just a digital record. 

Trading with spirit stones was not cost-effective.

Pavilion gold transactions could trade for more texts. 

The All-Book Pavilion deliberately set up these two trading methods mainly to compare and highlight the superiority of pavilion gold, encouraging more people to use pavilion gold for transactions. 

Ning Zhuo sold the Embrace Ice Technique, Grasp Fire Technique, and others, obtaining his first batch of pavilion gold. 

He didn't keep it and asked the shopkeeper what good books he could exchange for. 

The shopkeeper replied, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, our All-Book Pavilion has a vast collection. Although your pavilion gold is not much, you can still exchange for thousands of books. What exactly are you looking for?" Ning Zhuo thought for a moment.

He had his main cultivation technique, and he had many spells he didn't have time to practice, especially the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique. 

"What mechanical construct texts can I exchange for?" 

As a result, during the selection process, Ning Zhuo was drawn to another book. 

In the end, he bought a copy of "Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon." 

This book was a travelogue, the author's name unknown, self-styled as Luo Yunzi. 

There were many mechanical construct texts, but this book was quite rare, involving fate energy. 

"I have the mechanical construct texts left by my mother, and their content is excellent. With my current pavilion gold, it's almost impossible to exchange for texts of the same level as my mother's relics. Some texts would help me, but it's hard to filter them out. It's better to look at content related to fate energy." 

"The Life-Hanging Thread involves fate energy. Maybe it will help me comprehend the complete divine ability." Ning Zhuo had a premonition that once the embryonic form of the Life-Hanging Thread Divine Ability broke through, he would experience a terrifying enhancement! 

By then, even though he was only in the Qi Refining Stage, he would be able to master a divine ability. 

Most Golden Core cultivators couldn't achieve such a feat. 

The Life-Hanging Thread Divine Ability would become a powerful trump card for him! 

Ning Zhuo held the "Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon" and boarded a carriage, reading all the way, but the embryonic form of the divine ability's lotus flower showed no signs of movement. 

Ning Zhuo had read three-tenths of the "Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon," and one story in the earlier part left the deepest impression on him. 

In the story, a villager saved Luo Yunzi, who was on the verge of dying from thirst and hunger. 

To thank him, Luo Yunzi offered to perform a ritual for the villager to change his fate and enjoy wealth and honor. 

The villager didn't believe him.

The reason was simple: Luo Yunzi was too disheveled and was saved by the villager.

What abilities could he have? 

Luo Yunzi introduced himself: "I am a person of the wandering clouds, defying the heavens and falling to the mortal world. I once cultivated in the Celestial Bureau, but misfortune followed me, and I roamed the four seas." 

Faced with the impressive Luo Yunzi, the villager reluctantly agreed. 

The villager followed Luo Yunzi's instructions, made large purchases, and set everything up. 

Eventually, the ritual was completed, and the villager's wealth began to flow in.

Six months later, he became very wealthy. 

Before leaving, Luo Yunzi told the villager: "First, your fortune will last for twelve years. Make good use of it. Second, after becoming wealthy, you must not show any mercy. No matter how difficult, destitute, or pitiful someone is, you must not help them, or you will bear the consequences." 

The villager, filled with kindness, couldn't bear to see people suffer.

After a few years, he encountered a famine.

He disregarded Luo Yunzi's advice and helped many poor people, saving many lives. 

His own body became increasingly weak, often feeling exhausted.

He was drowsy during the day and lacked energy.

At night, he frequently had nightmares, where countless ghosts clung to him, heavy as mountains, making it difficult for him to move. 

When Luo Yunzi sensed something was wrong and returned to the village, the villager was on his last breath. 

Before dying, the villager asked Luo Yunzi for an explanation. 

Luo Yunzi sighed, "You encountered poor ghosts." 

"I told you not to show kindness and help others." 

"Your kindness was well-intentioned, but it provided an opportunity for resentful spirits to attach themselves." 

"In this world, many spirits cannot find peace due to resentment and greed. They use your kindness to fulfill their needs. Being unkind as a wealthy person is correct; it protects you." 

"Once you help others beyond your means, those poor ghosts will drag you down, pulling you to the underworld!" After saying this, the villager closed his eyes. 

Tears streamed down his face. 

He died.
