Chapter 244: The True Victor is the Turtle

At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain, layers of clouds and mist intertwined as cultivators, led by Meng Kui, gathered together.

With both spells and formations concealing them, the countless Red Rock Demons hovering above Fire Persimmon Mountain could not disturb this place.

Meng Kui, the only Nascent Soul cultivator present, surveyed the scene before casting a spell to allow all the Golden Core cultivators to observe the battle on Fire Persimmon Mountain.

A vast number of Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts densely surrounded the Lava Immortal Palace.

A significant portion also charged towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Within the city, many cultivators contributed to the defense, either on the front lines or within the city itself.

Fei Si remained in the city, overseeing the overall situation.

Zhu Xuanji, Chi Han, and the Golden Core cultivators from three families approached Meng Kui.

The spell images continuously shifted, revealing many crucial corners of the battlefield.

Mighty and fierce Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts appeared before everyone.

Among them, a Fire Snake, its form long and slender, emerged from the magma, already displaying the posture of a flood dragon!

A Nascent Soul-level Fire Snake!

The hearts of the Golden Core cultivators sank.

Meng Kui, with a solemn expression, slowly spoke, "You have all witnessed the current situation. However, according to my calculations, this is merely the beginning of the beast tide. As time passes, the scale of this beast tide will expand further. By then, it may not be just this one Nascent Soul-level Fire Snake."

The Golden Core cultivators were moved.

Compared to human cultivators, demon beasts often had thick skin, long lifespans, and a significant advantage in physical strength.

Meng Kui, not being a body cultivator, could not personally fight against a Nascent Soul-level demon beast and could only rely on the city's defensive formation to hold.

The combination of Meng Kui and the Immortal City Grand Formation could fend off one Nascent Soul-level demon beast, giving them the upper hand.

But if there were two, it would be different, and the human side would be at a disadvantage.

If there were three... then they would have to plan to evacuate the city's residents and seek assistance from the royal family.

"Generally speaking, it's uncommon for two Nascent Soul-level demon beasts to appear in a single beast tide," Ning Jiufan said.

Chi Han sighed, "But our situation this time is unusual. The Lava Immortal Palace fired a cannon, causing a massive explosion, and the demon beast communities are in a state of intense anger and revenge. Normally, Nascent Soul-level beasts do not interfere with each other. But now, with their determination for revenge and the desire to destroy the Lava Immortal Palace, it's very likely that Nascent Soul-level demon beasts will join forces!"

The faces of the Golden Core cultivators turned grim. "Speaking of which, why did the Lava Immortal Palace suddenly fire its cannon, and why did it bombard Fire Persimmon Mountain, provoking so many Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts?" Zhou Nongying asked.

Meng Kui remained silent, and with a thought, the spell images began to replay, reconstructing the scene of the previous bombardment.

He had been stationed at the mountain peak, overlooking the Lava Immortal Palace, with a clear view of the palace's various scenes.

Although he was cultivating at the time and did not immediately notice the cannon tower's movement, his magical artifact placed in the clouds had been recording everything around.

Thus, the Golden Core cultivators witnessed the Lava Immortal Palace's original three-story Five Elements Cannon Tower rising with a clatter, transforming into six stories.

Each level extended its cannon muzzles.

After infusing magical power, the main and secondary cannons roared in unison, firing numerous Five Elements Cannonballs, which traced multicolored trails in the air before plunging into the magma, ultimately exploding deep within Fire Persimmon Mountain.

"Has the palace spirit gone mad?!" Zheng Shuangjun exclaimed in surprise. "Could it have sensed some enormous threat and acted preemptively?" Zheng Danlian speculated. "No, such bombardment is too provocative. It's luring the demon beasts to attack!" Zhu Xuanji judged.

His eyes glowed with golden light, his face solemn, "This is premeditated, it's man-made. A cultivator manipulated the Five Elements Cannon Tower, bombarding Fire Persimmon Mountain, and single-handedly triggered this calamity! This culprit is extremely vicious, disregarding countless lives, with sinister intentions. I swear to capture him and bring him to justice!"

Zhu Xuanji's eyes were sharp, filled with anger. "Is there someone who can control this cannon tower? Is it because they accumulated enough merit and contributions to obtain the relevant authority?" Zhou Nongying analyzed.

Ning Jiufan stroked his beard, "Strange, where is the palace spirit? Does it allow the culprit to act recklessly without any intervention?" Zhu Xuanji gritted his teeth and sighed lightly, "Don't count on it. The state of the Lava Immortal Palace's spirit is likely very poor, unable to make normal decisions."

Zhu Xuanji glanced at Meng Kui and continued to explain, "Previously, during the battle between Cheng Bai and Sun Lingtong, as well as Chui Xu Ke, the demon beasts also attacked the Lava Immortal Palace. It was evident that the palace's defenses were weak, and the formations were problematic. Ultimately, the palace spirit deployed the mechanical constructs to barely hold on and drive the external enemies out of the palace."

"I found a mechanical general in Fire Persimmon Mountain and used it to trace the origin, discovering that the palace spirit's state was too poor, causing the mechanical demon general to fall in battle and be lost outside. I suspect that the three major mechanical constructs, including the Buddhist healer, likely suffered the same fate."

The Golden Core cultivators were speechless.

Zhou Nongying's voice was dry, "I see." Meng Kui remained expressionless, not revealing his crucial discovery to Zhu Xuanji, allowing him to make erroneous assumptions.

Why tell Zhu Xuanji? Meng Kui's divine ability, Sitting Mountain Observation Technique, came at a high cost.

He lost much of his lifespan to obtain the truth and would not easily aid the enemy.

Moreover, Meng Kui saw a potential collaboration between his Meng family and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.

With this possibility, Meng Kui was even less likely to disclose his calculations to Zhu Xuanji.

After some consideration, Meng Kui slowly spoke, "Everyone, the culprit must indeed be found and severely punished. But right now, our real issue is not capturing the true culprit but ensuring that their actions to destroy Fire Persimmon Immortal City fail. The most important thing now is how we withstand this beast tide!"

Capturing the true culprit and inheriting the legacy were secondary; the real focus was on resisting the beast tide.

If they failed to resist, the existence of the Lava Immortal Palace would be in question.

The Golden Core cultivators were all worried.

The principle of "if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold" was clear to them.

If the Immortal Palace did not survive, the Immortal City would likely be in jeopardy.

The reason was obviousâ€”there would be no intact eggs under an overturned nest! No one could guarantee that the demon beasts, after conquering and destroying the Lava Immortal Palace, would calm down and return to their nests.

The greater possibility was that their anger would remain, surging down and completely submerging Fire Persimmon Immortal City! If such a situation occurred, thousands of people would perish, dying tragically in the mouths of various Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.

Zheng Shuangjun said, "The Lava Immortal Palace is easy to defend and hard to attack. It currently attracts the most demon beasts, and we must assist in its defense, doing our utmost to slay the demon beasts and make them retreat." There were too many Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts to kill them all.

But if they killed enough, the demon beast communities would begin to withdraw on their own.

In such a situation, only by killing to stop killing and demonstrating the strength of the human race could they calm the extremely enraged demon beasts.

There was no need for Meng Kui to persuade; the Golden Core cultivators, with their broad perspectives and keen insight into the battle situation, quickly reached a consensus after a brief exchange.

To protect the Immortal City, their home, they must ensure the safety of the Lava Immortal Palace.

The Lava Immortal Palace is also tied to the legacy of the Three Sects' elders, with immense benefits at stake, and absolutely cannot be lost!

He said in a low voice, "Given the current situation, we indeed need Golden Core cultivators to guard the Lava Immortal Palace. At present, we've only detected one Nascent Soul-level Fire Snake."

"But with the beast tide of such magnitude, it's certain that more than one Nascent Soul-level demon beast will be involved. We need to prepare in advance!"

"The elders of the Three Sects are at the Void Refining Stage, and this is one of their palaces. The palace itself is very powerful."

"You Golden Core cultivators, relying on the Lava Immortal Palace, can gain a significant geographical advantage and can contend with Nascent Soul-level opponents." The meaning of Meng Kui was understood by the Golden Core cultivators.

He needed someone to directly engage the Nascent Soul-level demon beast, then seize the opportunity for him to personally slay it.

If two Nascent Soul-level demon beasts appeared simultaneously, then the Golden Core cultivators must rely on the Lava Immortal Palace to temporarily hold one, leaving the other for Meng Kui to handle.

The core combat strength of the human cultivators' side was Meng Kui.

Only if he held the advantage could the human cultivators gain the upper hand in the entire beast tide battle!

Zhou Nongying suddenly asked, "Do we need to seek assistance from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family now?"

Meng Kui shook his head, indicating that for the time being, it wasn't necessary.

He was reluctant to seek help.

On one hand, the situation hadn't reached that point yet.

On the other hand, if he did so, his achievements would undoubtedly be greatly diminished.

Meng Kui looked at Zhu Xuanji, "I intend to gather all our forces to firmly defend the Lava Immortal Palace."

"Both the Purple Dawn Pavilion and the Great Purity Palace can be invited for assistance. What does Divine Constable Zhu think?"

The two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family had a slight change in expression.

Zhu Xuanji nodded, indicating his agreement.

Meng Kui couldn't possibly be unaware that a Golden Core true disciple from the Great Purity Palace had already been killed.

But he pretended not to know, showing no flaws in his words, fully displaying the seasoned nature of an immortal official.

Meng Kui continued, "We can also leverage the power of the Cloud Merchants. Especially that Cloud Whale, which is at the Nascent Soul level. Divine Constable Zhu, what do you think?"

Zhu Xuanji nodded, "This Cloud Merchant team is large in scale and can traverse the five lakes and four seas, naturally possessing some skills. In terms of combat strength, we can expect more from them."

"However, they are outsiders, and we cannot be completely careless."

"Moreover, negotiating their deployment requires the City Lord's Mansion to personally intervene."

Meng Kui nodded slightly and finally said, "Besides them, there are also the two Golden Core cultivators, Yang Chanyu and Luo Shang, in Fire Persimmon Immortal City."

"Divine Constable Zhu, what do you think of them?"

Zhu Xuanji pondered, "If we entice them with heavy rewards, it wouldn't be impossible to borrow their strength."

Meng Kui's expression relaxed.

He couldn't directly propose this matter, as colluding with people from the Demonic Dao would be a severe charge, detrimental to his future political career.

But for a royal family member like Zhu Xuanji, it was different.

Recruiting two people from the Demonic Dao was a sensitive matter, easily exploited by political enemies as evidence against him.

However, the benefits of recruiting them were considerable.

On one hand, it was to borrow Golden Core combat strength.

On the other hand, it was to keep them under surveillance, suppressing them to prevent any mischief.

Zhu Xuanji said, "I need to send a letter to report the situation here to the King."

"Additionally, I have another proposal."

"All four of us have reformation teams. It's time for these team members to collectively enter the Immortal Palace!"

The bombardment from the Five Elements Tower made Zhu Xuanji pay more attention to the staffing of the Immortal Palace.

Referring to Ning Xiaohui's situation, he believed that the reformation team members, being trial disciples, were insiders of the Lava Immortal Palace.

They received significant advantages on the path to entering the Immortal Palace.

They had a great advantage in competing for positions.

Many positions, no matter how hard someone like Zhu Xuanji, who practiced other techniques, tried, were not within their options.

Simply not selectable!

The Golden Core cultivators exchanged glances, and someone nodded, "This is the right thing to do, but if one party secretly enters the Immortal Palace to compete for the Three Sects' legacy while we are fighting the beast tide, what should we do?"

Zhu Xuanji had anticipated this question and immediately said, "We will sign an alliance agreement to bind ourselves and all members of the reformation teams."

"During the beast tide, no one is allowed to secretly enter the Immortal Palace to compete for the Three Sects' legacy!"

"We desperately need our people to occupy various positions in the Immortal Palace to better utilize its capabilities!"

Everyone had no objections and immediately discussed the contents of the alliance agreement for a short while before signing it.

Zhu Zhen found Zhu Xuanji.

"Brother, I'm really glad I came here. With the beast tide raging, I want to help you all," Zhu Zhen said.

Zhu Xuanji was curious, "Have you finished investigating Ning Zhuo?"

Zhu Zhen smiled wryly, "Brother, how much time has passed? I'm not a Nascent Soul cultivator; how much progress could I have made?"

"However..."

He continued, "This young man is indeed extraordinary."

"He has experienced many hardships early on, is very courageous, and dares to fight."

"He is adept at maneuvering, but seems different from those who grovel. Although he's only at the Qi Refining Stage, I always feel he possesses the same aura as a Golden Core cultivator."

"Brother, do you think highly of him and want to cultivate him?"

"Indeed, he is a good target."

"The Ning family, originating from Beifengtu, has temporarily established a foothold in our country and has estrangements with other forces."

"In this situation, the Ning family is the most suitable local ally for our Zhu family royal family."

"Moreover, Ning Zhuo has innate talent, and if he succeeds in cultivation, he will surely possess extraordinary means. His chances of forming a Golden Core are very high..."

Zhu Xuanji listened to Zhu Zhen's words and quickly waved his hand, "Wait, wait. I asked you to investigate him, not to praise him."

Zhu Zhen laughed heartily, winking, "Brother, don't be so reserved."

"When I was investigating him, I discovered that at least two other groups were secretly investigating Ning Zhuo."

"If you really want to recruit him, you must act quickly. If such a good seedling falls into the hands of other forces, it won't be good for our Zhu family."

Zhu Xuanji fell silent.

Zhu Zhen once again raised his request, wanting to help and enter the Lava Immortal Palace to fight against the beast tide.

Zhu Xuanji hesitated.

Compared to the beast tide, the human side's strength was indeed at a clear disadvantage.

Therefore, at this moment, every combatant was important.

At the same time, Ning Zhuo's image appeared in Zhu Xuanji's mind.

"When the Five Elements Tower fired, Ning Zhuo was entering the Immortal Palace."

"He couldn't have controlled the tower."

"He has never been seen entering the Immortal Palace."

"He's only at the fourth level of Qi Refining... his suspicion can be ruled out."

Thinking of this, Zhu Xuanji nodded to Zhu Zhen, "Very well."

"You can enter the Immortal Palace to fight the beast tide."

"With your expertise in mechanical constructs, it's easy to meet the standards and enter the Immortal Palace."

Zhu Zhen was overjoyed and quickly bowed, "Thank you, brother!"

Lava Immortal Palace, main hall.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely anxious, pacing back and forth.

"It's over, I'm doomed!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so nervous that its entire body was trembling.

It knew very well that it couldn't withstand these extremely angry Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts on its own.

However, in the next moment, Meng Kui personally took action, casting spells to clear a temporary path.

The Golden Core cultivators united and approached the Immortal Palace, receiving the illumination of the treasure light, and entered the Immortal Palace together.

Upon entering the Immortal Palace, they immediately rushed to the front lines in all directions, participating in the battle to resist the beast tide.

"Whew!"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, seeing this scene, finally breathed a sigh of relief.

It lay on the throne for a while before recovering.

Its gaze penetrated space, scanning the battle lines, gradually breaking into a smile.

"Ning Zhuo! You truly live up to your reputation."

"The development of the situation is exactly as you predicted!"

"Although we triggered the beast tide, the consequences are borne by the Golden Core cultivators."

"This feeling is truly satisfying!"

"But do you know what makes me happiest?"

"Hahaha, it's that you will no longer have a chance at the City Lord's position from now on."

"No matter how cunning you are, you ultimately suffered from a lack of information, allowing me to outsmart you this time. Hehehe!"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had many things it hadn't told Ning Zhuo.

For instance, participating in the palace examination required achievements, and achievements could be deducted, becoming negative.

Although Ning Zhuo held a position, his bombardment triggered the beast tide, ultimately causing damage to the entire Lava Immortal Palace.

When the final settlement came, his achievements would be heavily deducted, becoming the reddest of red numbers!

Ning Zhuo would completely lose the opportunity for the final palace examination quota.

"So, in the end, I am the ultimate winner!"
