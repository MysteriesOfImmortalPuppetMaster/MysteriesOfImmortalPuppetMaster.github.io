Chapter 448: The Style of the Righteous Path

A corner of the White Jade Camp.

A junior commander hurried to the scene of the incident: "What exactly happened?"

The junior commander was very puzzled; he didn't see any casualties among his own soldiers. But a strange feeling was swirling in his heart —something very peculiar was going on!

"Commander, something terrible has happened!"

"Our magical power pool —our magical power pool is gone!"

"A gray, unremarkable stone ball suddenly appeared and swallowed our magical power pool!!"

The soldiers hurriedly reported.

The junior commander widened his eyes sharply: ?!

He looked at the empty place where the magical power pool was originally located.

"I was wondering why something felt off..." The junior commander cursed, "Can the magical power pool be stolen? Thieves from the Thousand Peaks Forest have sneaked in."

"But it's okay; these military devices have already been refined. I will activate the spell to search for its location!"

"Protect me!"

After saying that, the junior commander began to perform his techniques.

He was also very anxious.

This was the magical power pool, after all.

It was one of the trump cards for the White Jade Camp to resist Lord Long and hold on. If it couldn't be retrieved and returned to its original place, the sustained combat capability of the White Jade Camp would be greatly weakened.

A layer of fine cold sweat oozed from the junior commander's forehead.

"Damn it, why can't I detect its location?"

The magical power pool had been moved into the cabin of the Mechanical Flood Dragon!

This magical power pool was nearly a perfect circle, with a diameter of three zhang and five chi, and a depth of two zhang and three chi —about the size of a common pond.

Sun Lingtong stood in a horse stance, one hand forming a mudra, the other hand holding the wrist of the hand performing the mudra, fully maintaining a treasure-stealing technique.

Stealing Technique —Actually Copying Hands!

It was precisely this stealing technique that shrank the magical power pool to the size of a round table and temporarily concealed it from the victim's search.

Sun Lingtong was only at the Foundation Establishment level and had not joined the Two Notes Kingdom, so he did not receive the blessing of national power.

"Little Zhuo, hurry up, hurry up!" Sun Lingtong urged.

His magical power and divine sense were being consumed rapidly.

And this magical power pool was a magic treasure, a treasure qualified to be used only by Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators!

Ning Zhuo raced against time, performing techniques to quickly inspect this magical power pool.

"The main material of the pool wall is Azure Profound Jade. This jade is hard in texture and can absorb earth qi, converting it into earth-element spirit energy."

"The pool water is hundred-year-old stalactite milk, milky white in color, capable of accumulating and storing massive amounts of earth-element spiritual power."

"The entire magical power pool has three layers of formations: Seed Earth Formation, Land Sinking Return to Origin Formation, and Pure Spirit Formation."

"The Seed Earth Formation allows this magical power pool, by merely contacting the ground, to connect with the deep underground earth veins. If there are no earth veins formed in the area, it will absorb earth qi to the maximum extent."

"The Land Sinking Return to Origin Formation can massively convert earth-element spirit energy into earth-element magical power."

"It is worth mentioning that this formation was once extremely popular in history. Almost all cultivation forces used it, laying it in key places of sects and families to provide massive amounts of earth-element magical power."

"As a result, because too much earth-element spirit energy was extracted worldwide, the entire continent began to sink."

"Forcing the imperial dynasty at that time to urgently order all forces, large and small, to prohibit the use of the Land Sinking Return to Origin Formation."

"As for the Pure Spirit Formation, it has the function of purifying spirit energy. It can purify all spirit energy, making its nature as uniform as possible."

"After spirit energy is purified, it is more efficient to use. Otherwise, if there are too many 'impurities,' the loss is too great, and the effect will be very poor."

Ning Zhuo's fingers moved, constantly activating techniques, stirring up the talismans in the magical power pool.

"There are more than three thousand talismans on the pool wall, forming a magical restriction together, which is... the 'Earth Mother Nourishing Milk Essential Art'!"

In Ning Zhuo's divine sea, within his upper dantian, his divine thoughts surged; the mirror surfaces formed by divine thoughts shone brightly, and as his thinking deepened, pieces of mirror surfaces shattered and were consumed.

"I have a way now, boss, hold on!" Ning Zhuo cheered.

Sun Lingtong immediately showed a look of joy; Ning Zhuo's cracking speed exceeded his imagination.

Ning Zhuo took out more than a dozen staff heads and then took out a wooden hammer, hammering them hard, forcibly driving the staff heads into the pool wall.

He then used mechanical arts to manipulate the staff heads, successfully interfering with the operation of the magical power pool, forcing the three formations to gradually come to a halt.

The magical restriction of the 'Earth Mother Nourishing Milk Essential Art' was also propped open with many gaps and openings by the staff heads, allowing Ning Zhuo to peer into the core within.

He infused his magical power with all his might.

This magical power followed the staff heads, accurately finding the core of the magical power pool, washing it like a flood!

After a dozen breaths, Ning Zhuo had washed away most of the connection between the magical power pool and its original owner. The rest would require slow work and would take a long time.

Having achieved this, Ning Zhuo had reached his goal.

He immediately stopped infusing magical power and withdrew his divine sense.

Huff, huff...

Ning Zhuo was gasping for breath, his face pale, his divine sense greatly consumed, and his magical power urgently needing replenishment.

Sun Lingtong was in an even worse state than him.

Sensing that the magical power pool was no longer shaking violently, he immediately revoked the stealing technique 'Real Copy Hand,' collapsing to the ground exhausted.

But he was very excited, his eyes shining, staring intently at the magical power pool.

Ning Zhuo was doing the finishing work; he was circling the magical power pool, now the size of a small table, using various materials to set up a sealing formation.

Sun Lingtong observed Ning Zhuo's techniques and nodded with satisfaction, immediately praising: "Little Zhuo, it wasn't in vain that I trained you since you were young. This set of methods to suppress treasures, although you haven't used it for a long time, you practiced it so many times before that you're already thoroughly proficient; it's practically ingrained in your bones! You did great!"

Although Ning Zhuo was physically and mentally exhausted, seeing the magical power pool in front of him also brought a flush of joyous redness to his face.

"I have refined most of it and learned that this magical power pool is called the 'Earth Milk Pure Spirit Pool.'"

"According to estimation, the market price is four hundred and four hundred fifty high spirit stones!"

"We've made a fortune, we're rich!"

The Earth Milk Pure Spirit Pool was of the magic treasure level.

And the price range of magic treasures was extremely large!

A magical power pool at the magic treasure level was a heavy treasure; the cost of refining it was often a huge sum, qualified to be used only by medium and large forces.

Therefore, magical power pools at the magic treasure level were expensive.

Usually, a Golden Core-level force had an annual output value of about 1.5 million low-grade spirit stones.

Note that this was the gross output value, not net profit.

Such an Earth Milk Pure Spirit Pool would require a Golden Core-level force to not eat or drink for three consecutive years to afford it.

For an individual Golden Core cultivator, assuming he had a strong earning ability, working hard on his own, not eating or drinking and spending no money, only making money, it would take at least forty-seven years!

When Sun Lingtong heard the quoted price from Ning Zhuo, he miraculously squeezed out a bit of strength from his exhausted body.

He stood up: "Quick, Little Zhuo, this is a rare opportunity!"

"There are at least two more magical power pools in the White Jade Camp."

Ning Zhuo waved his hand: "Don't rush, boss."

"We are not in good condition; we urgently need to meditate and restore our state!"

"Let's not take the magical power pools for now."

"Overly weakening the White Jade Camp —if they can't resist Lord Long, how will we have the opportunity to continue acting?"

Sun Lingtong gave Ning Zhuo a thumbs up, clicking his tongue in praise: "Little Zhuo, I said long ago —you have talent in our line of work!"

Ning Zhuo immediately coughed: "If it weren't for the divine decree upon us, forced by circumstances, plus Zhu Xuanji's previous instructions for us to weaken the Two Notes Kingdom, I, a dignified righteous person, how could I commit such acts?"

Sun Lingtong extended his other hand, also giving a thumbs up: "Little Zhuo, your words have the style of the righteous path!"
