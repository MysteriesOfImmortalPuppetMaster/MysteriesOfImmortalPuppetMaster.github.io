Chapter 278: Mourning

Upon hearing the reformation team members' increasingly excessive remarks, Zheng Hua coldly reprimanded, "Enough!" "These baseless speculations, swallow them back down."

"I understand that at this moment, your hearts are filled with sorrow and anger. But do not let these emotions cloud your judgment. Remember! You bear the surname Zheng, carrying the honor of our Zheng family." "Do not let outsiders see us as a joke. Invite Ning Zhuo in." Ning Zhuo walked into the hall.

As he looked around, he saw a sea of white mourning garments.

The Zheng family cultivators were lined up on both sides. Some raised their heads, eyes tightly shut, silently shedding tears. Others covered their faces, kneeling on the ground, burning paper money. Most turned their heads to glare at Ning Zhuo with eyes full of anger.

Zheng Jian's reputation in life was high, and his death united the Zheng family's reformation team in shared enmity, with a strong sense of mourning and determination.

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but recall how these people dared to confront the golden core stage Yang Chanyu.

At that time, Ning Zhuo was filled with admirationâ€”Zheng Jian had truly won the hearts of the people! The blood courage of the Zheng family was evident!

The air was thick with the Zheng family's hostility towards Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo, with a face full of sorrow, walked to the coffin.

He first saluted Zheng Hua, then stood silently before Zheng Jian's body.

His expression was solemn, his eyelids lowered, as if feeling the lingering warmth of the departed hero in silence.

A gentle breeze brushed the hem of his robe, and Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes wide.

At this moment, his eyes were red, his gaze filled with endless sorrow.

"Brother Zheng Jian!" Ning Zhuo cried out mournfully, breaking the deathly silence in the hall.

"Little brother remains in this world, yet you, my elder brother, have departed!" "From now on, the sun and moon are distant, and we are forever separated by the heavens." "My heart is like a knife, my pain cuts through my liver and intestines!" Ning Zhuo lamented, kneeling on both knees, beginning to weep bitterly.

"Alas, Brother Zheng! I recall when we refined the mechanical apes together, your plans were far-reaching, and my craftsmanship complemented them. Our cooperation was seamless, resulting in exquisite mechanisms. Your extraordinary talent was deeply admired by me, and to have you as a friend was truly a blessing of three lifetimes."

"Alas, Brother Zheng! I remember the trials we faced together, breaking through enemy lines side by side. Though the enemy was fierce, our united hearts were invincible. Unfortunately, due to Ning Xiaohui, our efforts were in vain, yet I was comforted by you, valuing heroism over gains and losses, thus relieving my heart."

"Alas, Brother Zheng! Though we ran for our respective families, our hearts were connected, with an agreement: I would yield the Medical Pavilion, and you would reciprocate with a hefty sum. Now that you are gone, the promise is void, and my heart burns with pain." "Burns with pain!"

Ning Zhuo tore at his chest, tears flowing like a spring, his voice hoarse, his heart in agony.

Seeing Ning Zhuo's genuine and heartfelt mourning, everyone in the hall was moved.

Many people's hostility diminished, and they began to cry. Even those who remained suspicious of Ning Zhuo were infected by the overwhelming sadness and grief, silently shedding tears.

The cries merged into one, gradually growing louder.

Suddenly, Ning Zhuo raised his voice: "The death of my brother will not be taken lightly! I will avenge you!" "Countless brothers of the Zheng family in this hall will avenge you!!" In their grief, the crowd was stirred by this shout, igniting their hatred and anger.

They began to shout.

"Revenge, revenge!"

"In this lifetime, I will kill Yang Chanyu!!" "I swear to slaughter the entire Void Sect!"

Zheng Hua listened, his eyelids twitching.

The Zheng family disciples were becoming more and more excessive, their emotions completely swayed by Ning Zhuo.

Zheng Hua was urgently dispatched here, partly to protect the reformation team, and partly to stabilize the situation and calm people's hearts.

Ning Zhuo's cries had incited the hall into a frenzy, the situation seemed to be spiraling out of control.

This forced Zheng Hua to speak, sternly shouting, "Revenge is necessary! But look at yourselves now, all at the Qi Refining Stage, not even at the Foundation Establishment Stage. How can you kill a golden core?" "Seeking revenge now? Is it revenge, or is it courting death? Hmm?!"

Zheng Hua's authority was significant, and with his words, the young cultivators in the hall fell silent.

In the silence, Ning Zhuo's body swayed as he stood up.

He faced Zheng Hua, bowing respectfully: "Senior Zheng Hua.

"Previously, Brother Zheng Jian had almost reached an agreement with me, where my side would largely withdraw from competing for Medical Pavilion positions, retaining only a few spots, and your side would receive a substantial compensation." "Brother Zheng Jian was someone I respected, and though he is gone, I still wish to do what I can." "How to avenge?"

At this point, Ning Zhuo stood straight, lowering his arms, and surveyed the surroundings.

He continued, "Although we are only at the Qi Refining Stage, we have our own ways of seeking revenge!"

He raised his fist, speaking forcefully, "The enemy does not want us to obtain positions in the Immortal Palace, so we must succeed, thwarting the enemy's schemes!!"

"I am willing to assist the Zheng family, personally helping each member of the Zheng family reformation team, working together on repair tasks, quickly enhancing the achievements of the cultivators in the hall, so you can enter the Medical Pavilion and obtain the position of medical officer sooner." "Furthermore, I promise all of you: from now on, the focus of the Ning family reformation team will never be the Medical Pavilion!" "Although our Ning family has obtained some positions in the Medical Pavilion, I swear on the honor of the Ning family that our positions in the Medical Pavilion will not increase!" These words moved the entire hall!

Even Zheng Hua looked at Ning Zhuo with newfound respect.

After Ning Zhuo left, the Zheng family cultivators exchanged thoughts, and their impression of Ning Zhuo greatly improved.

"I didn't expect Ning Zhuo to have such responsibility!"

"Such noble character, I misunderstood him."

"Hmph, even if he didn't do this, could our Zheng family not defeat the Ning family and seize the Medical Pavilion?" "Don't underestimate Ning Zhuo. Among us, only Boss Zheng Jian could suppress him!" "I think I misjudged Ning Zhuo before. He didn't have to do this, but he did."

"He just mourned our leader, weeping bitterly. It seems that although he and our leader came from different families, heroes cherish heroes, and they had become close friends." Ning Zhuo returned to his temporary residence to meet Ning Jiufan.

He had already reported to Ning Jiufan before taking action.

Ning Jiufan: "Judging by your expression, it seems you succeeded. Do you truly intend to assist the Zheng family in this way?" Ning Zhuo replied earnestly, "Ancestor, this is my intention."

"Firstly, Zheng indeed diverted the attention from me. If Yang Chanyu had targeted me first, how many strikes could the treasure talisman withstand? If I survived by luck, he contributed!" "Secondly, the conflict between our Ning family and the Zheng family regarding the Medical Pavilion remains unresolved."

"Thirdly, accomplishing this will earn me much reputation in the righteous path. If I don't do this, given the Zheng family's strength and their mourning spirit, they will eventually force our Ning family to retreat." "Fourthly, allowing the Zheng family cultivators to occupy the Medical Pavilion positions first is also beneficial. Don't forget, the Great Purity Palace and the Void Sect are both enemies of the Zheng family. Perhaps in the future, there will be a turning point." After listening to this analysis, Ning Jiufan finally showed a pleased expression, stroking his beard and saying, "Good, good, good. At such a young age, your thoughts are thorough." "The Void Sect aims to completely control your actions. Yang Chanyu likely targeted Zheng first because she sensed the treasure talisman on you." "After all, she is trained by the Void Sect, very skilled at sensing treasures. And this treasure talisman was not refined by you, it cannot be stored within your body, its aura constantly leaks, being discovered is quite normal." "Therefore, you need not be so grateful to Zheng. Blame it on their two golden core ancestors for being so inattentive to their own talented cultivators, giving too few protective items, or not giving ones of high enough quality." Ning Zhuo suddenly understood, showing a look of enlightenment: "I see!"

With this, he had settled matters with both the Zheng family and Ning Jiufan, paving a clear path to openly assist the Zheng family.

Ning Jiufan continued, "Give me that Oil Slick Talisman, and I will replenish your magical power."

"I will also grant you another talisman, named the Water to Fish Talisman. Although it lacks spirituality, after being refined with blood essence, it can still be used with some effort."

"In the future, if you encounter today's situation, when the Oil Slick Talisman is activated, you can use the Water to Fish Talisman, perfectly complementing the oil and water vapor, greatly increasing speed and allowing agile maneuvering, just right." Without needing Ning Zhuo to remind him, Ning Jiufan had already proactively provided him with more life-saving means.

After all, the fall of the talented cultivator Zheng Jian was a recent event.

In the following days, Ning Zhuo fulfilled his promise, actively assisting the Zheng family reformation team, enhancing their achievements, allowing them to quickly enter the Medical Pavilion and obtain the position of medical officer.

During this period, Ning Zhuo visited the critical care treatment room to retrieve a new spirit box.

Yang Chanyu had seized Zheng Jian's soul. After it fell into Sun Lingtong's hands, it was refined by the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra, extracting a portion of spirituality.

Since only the soul was used, the spirituality was only thirty percent.

Ning Zhuo successfully crafted a mechanical ring, housing Zheng Jian's spirituality, and wore it on his left index finger.

Ning Zhuo sought out Ning Xiaohui and Zheng Jian's belongings while taking care of the Ning family, arranging for them to enter the Five Elements Tower as much as possible.

He also reached an agreement with Zhou Zeshen, assisting them in quickly obtaining the position at the Command Platform. Ning Zhuo thus received considerable rewards.

At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain, amidst the clouds and mist.

Meng Kui's eyes shone brightly, once again using his divine abilityâ€”Sitting Mountain Observation Technique!

Great Wind Talisman!

Cloud Raising Talisman!

The great wind rises, the clouds soar, sitting on the mountain, listening to the sound of pines.

Meng Kui's vision suddenly changed.

Blazing flames, a dragon turtle like a mountain, bearing the Immortal City, crushing stone slabs, raising its head to the sky and roaring.

The night sky was pitch black, a massive mysterious bird emitted electric light, circling and dancing, almost ready to swoop down.

A gigantic tree, towering and earth-shattering, extended its branches and roots, deeply embedded in the dragon turtle, deeper than before!

The dragon turtle was weak, its wounds flowing with lava-like crimson blood fire.

It was in a precarious situation, the rock slabs shattered, causing its lower body to fall into the scorching magma, with a violent tendency to be submerged.

Meng Kui strained to observe, blood tears streaming from his eyes.

"How is this possible?"

"Why? Why can't I see the fate energy of the Void Sect? Where has the fate energy represented by Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu gone?!" This was the second time Meng Kui had used this divine ability.

The first time was after the golden core battle.

But both times he used the technique, he couldn't see the fate energy of the Void Sect!

This left him baffled.

Suddenly.

The magma erupted violently, forming a massive wave.

The scorching magma formed a vortex, fiercely pulling and dragging the dragon turtle down.

The dragon turtle let out a mournful cry, struggling to climb out, but only sinking deeper!

Seeing this scene, Meng Kui immediately forgot his previous questions, his face full of solemnity.

"The terror of the scarlet flame beast tide is beginning to manifest!"

At the same time, in the real Fire Persimmon Mountain, a Nascent Soul level fire snake let out a long hiss, revealing itself, its fiery body crashing directly towards the Lava Immortal Palace!
