Chapter 139: Escaping from the Ghost Gate

Ning Zhuo's interest was immediately piqued.

Sun Lingtong had previously taken out the Netherworld Ghost God Seal and the Soul Stirring Rattle Drum, but neither had elicited such a look of surprise.

Could it be that the treasure in Cheng Bai's sea of essence surpassed the previous two Magical Treasures?

Under Ning Zhuo's watchful gaze, Sun Lingtong withdrew the cloud mist, revealing a precious plant.

It was a cluster of small grass.

The grass stood about three feet tall.

Its stem was thick, covered with bark-like texture, and the root end was white, gradually darkening towards the leaves, eventually turning pitch black.

The leaves could be divided into two parts.

The lower part of the leaves was withered and curled, resembling ancient scrolls weathered by time; the upper part was vibrant, with clear veins and a faint glow at the edges, like a glimmer of hope in the darkness.

Without Sun Lingtong needing to say a word, Ning Zhuo exclaimed, recognizing the plant's origin: "Ghost Gate Escape Grass?"

This world is divided into the realms of the living and the dead.

The realm of the living is where Ning Zhuo resides, with the sun rising and the moon setting, full of vitality.

The realm of the dead is filled with wandering spirits, perpetually gloomy and shrouded in deathly aura.

The entrances and exits between the realms of the living and the dead are called Ghost Gates.

Ghost Gates are one-way.

One can only enter the realm of the dead from the realm of the living, or enter the realm of the living from the realm of the dead.

Only near the Ghost Gates that lead from the realm of the dead to the realm of the living can Ghost Gate Escape Grass grow.

The roots of this grass delve deep into the soil of the realm of the dead, absorbing deathly aura.

The leaves, however, stretch into the realm of the living, brimming with vitality.

It is born from death and possesses extremely potent restorative abilities.

Even a gravely injured mortal, upon inhaling its fragrance, can swiftly recover.

Ning Zhuo recalled the previous battle scene.

Cheng Bai had merely taken a breath and quickly recovered, turning severe injuries into minor ones.

It must have been due to this precious plant!

Sun Lingtong sighed, "Every Ghost Gate Escape Grass is a Nascent Soul-level treasure. Cheng Bai's luck is quite good to have obtained this opportunity."

"He cultivates Yin-based techniques, so the Ghost Gate Escape Grass is indeed very suitable for him!"

Ning Zhuo counted and found that this cluster of Ghost Gate Escape Grass had seven leaves.

"We've struck it rich!" Ning Zhuo said succinctly.

The market price of each leaf far exceeded the total cost of the Mechanical Constructs he had expended in battle! Moreover, the leaves were priceless.

The disparity among cultivators is immense, and the higher one ascends, the greater the gap, and the same applies to precious plants.

The Mechanical Constructs Ning Zhuo lost in battle were at most mixed with some Foundation Establishment materials.

But the Ghost Gate Escape Grass is a Nascent Soul-level treasure, crucial for life and healing, which greatly elevates its market value.

"That's good, Boss Sun, you don't need to worry about the injuries on your physical body anymore," Ning Zhuo said with a smile.

Sun Lingtong nodded slightly, "It's a pity my mana isn't of the Yin attribute. To make the best use of it, it's best to set up a formation." Every cultivation resource has different methods and effects for different cultivators.

After Sun Ning and Yuan Er carefully placed the Escape Grass, Sun Lingtong continued to search for treasures.

Not long after, he retrieved a set of miniature clothing from Cheng Bai's Qi Sea.

The clothing was only the size of an adult's palm, woven from golden threads.

The exquisite craftsmanship clearly indicated it was the work of a master tailor.

It was precisely this set of Golden Thread Garments that had formed a protective golden light, rendering Ning Zhuo's Chui Xu Ke's Hanging Death Whip ineffective.

Now, the Golden Thread Garments were severely damaged and unusable.

Repairing them would be quite troublesome, requiring a high level of tailoring skill in cultivation.

Sun Lingtong, unable to find any more treasures with the Cloud Smoke Technique, forcibly took a large portion of Cheng Bai's essence blood and poured it into his Blood Gourd.

As a result, Cheng Bai's essence, qi, and spirit were greatly diminished, significantly reducing his threat.

The Underworld Ghost Seal, Soul-Dispersing Rattle Drum, Ghost Gate Escape Grass, and Golden Thread Garments were Cheng Bai's personal treasures.

Three of these were Magical Treasures, and the Ghost Gate Escape Grass was a Nascent Soul-level treasure plant.

Only Magical Treasures were qualified to be nurtured in a cultivator's three Dantians.

Just like Ning Zhuo's Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his Mountain and Sea Dantian.

Cheng Bai, being a true disciple of a major demonic sect, possessed three Magical Treasures and a Nascent Soul-level treasure plant, which was quite a substantial fortune.

It's worth noting that ordinary Golden Core cultivators mostly used magical artifacts, and even if they had a Magical Treasure, it would usually be just one.

Cheng Bai, known as the Blind Judge, was not an ordinary Golden Core cultivator, possessing three Magical Treasures.

The Nascent Soul-level treasure plant was invaluable, even coveted by Nascent Soul cultivators.

"If it weren't for being in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Meng Kui's Sitting Mountain Observation Technique, and your monkey mechanism, defeating Cheng Bai would have been nearly impossible!" Sun Lingtong sighed.

The battle with Cheng Bai was extremely difficult and risky, but the rewards were immense.

The three Magical Treasures and the treasure plant were the main prizes, but Cheng Bai's clothing and accessories, many of which were magical artifacts like storage belts and bracelets, were also valuable.

Ning Zhuo had already stripped these off in advance.

As for the treasures hidden in the three seas, Ning Zhuo didn't have the ability to retrieve them yet.

The contents of the storage belts and other items were also worth looking forward to.

By removing the treasures from the three seas, Sun Lingtong had successfully disarmed Cheng Bai.

Sun Lingtong was greatly exhausted, his previously rosy complexion turning pale again, and the essence, qi, and spirit he had forcibly gathered plummeted once more.

"Cheng Bai is definitely going to die," Sun Lingtong said. "If he doesn't die, he'll seek revenge on us."

"But it's best if we don't kill him ourselves. He's a true disciple and a future high-ranking member of the Soul Devouring Sect. If we kill him, we'll be marked by the Soul Devouring Sect's soul imprint. If the Soul Devouring Sect seeks revenge, we won't be able to withstand it," Sun Lingtong sighed, frowning as he racked his brains on how to deal with Cheng Bai.

Ning Zhuo then said, "I might have a solution."

"Oh? What method?"

"Let the Lava Immortal Palace kill Cheng Bai!"

Sun Lingtong was curious, "What plan do you have?"

Ning Zhuo, however, did not rush to disclose, "I am not sure if it will work yet. I need to try it first."

"Boss, forgive me."

"Huh?" Sun Lingtong was baffled, not understanding what Ning Zhuo was talking about.

Meanwhile.

Fire Persimmon Immortal City was already under full lockdown.

Chi Dun walked out of the City Lord's mansion disappointedly.

He had just been with Fei Shi, investigating various records of the formation, but did not get what he wanted.

Fei Si said, "The formation on that battlefield was first tampered with by Sun Lingtong using Void Sect's methods. Later, Cheng Bai erased the formation patterns with all his might. It's not surprising that there are no detailed records of the battle with Cheng Bai." Chi Dun nodded.

Although the two despised each other and did not get along, they could still cooperate closely under the City Lord's orders.

The two Soul Devouring Sect Foundation Establishment Demon Cultivators, Hook-nosed and Triangular-eyed, had already been arrested by the City Lord's mansion.

Sun Lingtong, Han Ming, and Chui Xu Ke were all subjected to thorough interrogation, with great intensity.

Sun Lingtong's black market was essentially finished, while Han Ming's whereabouts were unknown.

"Sun Lingtong..." Fei Si sighed inwardly, feeling it was a pity.

Over the past few years, Sun Lingtong had secretly provided him with considerable benefits.

Fei Si also quite liked someone like Sun Lingtong.

It wasn't just about the benefits; Sun Lingtong had truly brought order to the black market, saving Fei Si a lot of trouble.

Chi Dun said, "Previously, Han Ming went missing, probably hiding in some underground base."

"After today's observation, I realized that the gaps in our Fire Persimmon Immortal City's grand formation are so many!" Fei Si pondered, "A full-scale city search is meaningless. I suspect there are quite a few such underground bases."

"Why don't we first report to the City Lord and request him to re-establish the Immortal City Grand Formation, doing our best to reduce the gaps between the formations!" Chi Dun thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.

The two of them went to the mountain peak together to seek an audience with the City Lord.

The City Lord was discussing the Immortal City Grand Formation with Zhu Xuanji.

Zhu Xuanji said, "Back when our royal family built the Immortal City Grand Formation here, we took into account the Lava Immortal Palace, so we left a lot of space to avoid the formation's operation interfering with the Lava Immortal Palace." 

Meng Kui said, "Now that the Lava Immortal Palace has emerged, if the royal family steps in to rebuild the Immortal City formation..."

Zhu Xuanji shook his head, "I didn't come to discuss this with you."

"City Lord Meng Kui, if you have any opinions, feel free to report them."

"My main purpose here is to inform you to actively cooperate with me. Next, I will enter the Immortal Palace!"
