Chapter 526: Ten Li Burning Forest

At the frontline camp of the Twin Rivers Country.

A military conference was taking place.

“Everyone, the current situation is exactly like this.” A Golden Core–level general had just finished speaking.

The others began to discuss.

“Ever since our camp was established, petty thieves have been constantly sneaking in around and picking up war loot. Previously, when our armaments had shown their might, we killed a bunch of people -yet I did not expect that there would still be those whose thieving hearts remained unrepentant!”

“If I were the enemy, upon discovering that there was glazed heart-blood, Ginseng Root Wall Soil, and the Dragon Pattern Talisman, I would also be irresistibly tempted and take the risk.”

“It is truly shameful. The enemy discovered these three treasures before us, and our side was only late to know.”

“The ones who detected these three treasures were the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts. Not only were these two from the Soul Devouring Sect, but their combined divine abilities were terrifying -very extraordinary. It is not surprising that they discovered them first.”

“Hmph! The nerve of the Soul Devouring Sect is far too audacious; our country is punishing injustice, and they actually dare to meddle in our affairs- their crime is deserving of execution!”

The generals and soldiers were all very dissatisfied with the Soul Devouring Sect.

After some cursing and complaints, they no longer mentioned it.

Because everyone knew that the Twin Rivers Country was not a major power, and the Soul Devouring Sect’s headquarters were also far from the Twin Rivers Country. In the face of such a super sect, the Twin Rivers Country ultimately only carried out a formality of accountability.

“If we can collect the heart-blood and the wall-earth, perhaps they could serve as clues to divine the location of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.”

“They could also be used as materials for curses.”

“It can only be said that it’s better than nothing, but at present our army does not have such experts.”

Everyone fell into brief silence.

An old general spoke up, “These two treasures are not key; even if they fall into the enemy’s hands, it will not affect the overall situation. What is truly important is the Dragon-shaped Talisman, which cannot be destroyed. The longer it remains on this battlefield, the more advantageous it is for our army.”

“Agreed!”

“I agree.”

“Indeed.”

The generals all nodded.

In the Thousand Peaks Forest, numerous deities of various sizes resided, thereby possessing a strong geographical advantage.

Once the Dragon-shaped Talisman merged into the earth’s veins, it would diminish the enemy’s advantage of the terrain.

The lieutenant generals agreed unanimously and decided to first deploy troops and strong warriors specifically to guard this giant Dragon-shaped Talisman. Then, once the army had surplus strength, they could lay out various defensive facilities deep underground.

“Among all the troops at present, the Three Generals Camp had recovered the fastest and was in the best condition. Let them be tasked with guarding the Dragon-shaped Talisman; it is the most fitting.”

“That’s right.”

“Agreed!”

Once again, the generals reached consensus.

However, in the next moment, Zhao Xi, who had remained silent, let out a light laugh.

He looked around, his eyes filled with mockery and disdain.

“Too late,” he said softly, “Long before this meeting, I had already issued mobilization orders.”

“By now, they must have already formally left the camp, right?”

“What?!” the generals exclaimed in astonishment.

The old general from before frowned, “Lord Zhao, guarding the Dragon-shaped Talisman is an extremely important matter!”

Zhao Xi sneered once again, “So, your army can take on this task.”

The old general spread his hands, “But our army has not yet fully recovered; it hardly has any combat capability, Lord Zhao.”

Zhao Xi narrowed his eyes, fixing his gaze on the old general: “So, you want to ask me for forgiveness? You are indeed at fault. Why is it that even now your army is still recuperating, whereas a force like the Three Generals Camp had been ready much earlier? Have you been too slack?”

The old general’s expression changed immediately; he stood up, clasped his fists, and solemnly gave an explanation.

No one backed up his words, because the armies these generals belonged to were also still in the process of recuperating.

Supervising general Zhao Xi scanned the room: “Our army is stationed in the central area of the Thousand Peaks Forest, surrounded by enemies on all sides, with offense being preferable to defense. The Three Generals Camp has performed excellently and should naturally bear the heavy responsibility of the attack. If anyone has objections, they may use their own troops to replace them.”

The room fell silent.

Zhao Xi laughed heartily three times, slowly rose, gave a cold glance, then, with his hands clasped behind him, walked away.

Although Du Tiechuan was in seclusion, his close aides and confidants, discontented with Zhao Xi’s usurpation of power, naturally turned their attention to the Three Generals Camp.

But Zhao Xi, being deeply entrenched in the bureaucratic world, had already made arrangements in advance.

“After all, the inherent nature of this main force was that of a new army, and that is what gave me the room to intervene.”

“Otherwise, given Du Tiechuan’s capabilities, it would have taken him only a month or two to mold his forces into a tight-knit unit.”

“Three Generals Camp, Ning Zhuo, do not disappoint me...”

Zhao Xi worried inwardly.

In a sense, he and the Three Generals Camp were already bound together; their fortunes rose and fell as one.

Battle formation -a straight-line snake formation.

The Three Generals Camp left the frontline camp, marching swiftly in accordance with this formation.

Their speed was over four times faster than before.

The soldiers’ level of training had improved, though that was not the main reason.

This time during the march, the entire Three Generals Camp employed marching talismans, swift wind talismans, and other enhancements, which greatly boosted each soldier’s speed.

They departed from the camp in the morning, marched all along, and arrived at Ten Li Burning Forest by dusk.

The outcome of the previous military conference had designated this place.

The pills stored in the Twisted Root Hundred Herbs Cave were too easily destroyed, so the gains were difficult to guarantee.

The prospects of Nine Dragon Shadow Reviewing Platform were the most extensive, but to construct a marching camp there would undoubtedly require a lot of funds. For this part, only Ning Zhuo came up with the money; the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang did not have such financial strength.

Even if funds were sufficient, there would also be a need for abundant materials and ample manpower in order to extensively transform this Peak.

The renovation would also require a long period, while the battlefield was changing in an instant.

In the end, the only choices left were the Thousand Vine Talisman Heavenly Corridor and the Ten Li Burning Forest.

In terms of value, the Thousand Vine Talisman Heavenly Corridor was undoubtedly higher; the number of talismans contained within was not less than tens of millions. But it was precisely for this reason that its attack difficulty was several tens of times that of the Ten Li Burning Forest.

“In my view, in this battle, we must consider not only the benefits but also safety!”

“After all, we are the first army to leave the camp to conquer a stronghold, so the risks are hard to estimate.”

“It is not only our current situation, but also considering Zhao Xi’s perspective; we need a victory, not a defeat.”

Ning Zhuo’s words prompted the Three Generals to finally choose the Ten Li Burning Forest.

As a newly established force, the Three Generals Camp was in the spotlight, and countless people secretly harbored envy, jealousy, and hatred.

Too many people hoped for their failure, so that they would have a legitimate reason to suppress them. And then, it would further implicate Zhao Xi, expelling this newly established supervising general!

Thus, this first battle was extremely critical; it had to be a victory, it had to succeed!

As twilight was approaching, the Ten Li Burning Forest had flames soaring skyward.

The numerous mountain ridges transformed into the red dragon’s backbone, and amidst the rugged ravines flowed a firelight like molten gold.

The peaks and valleys of the mountains were as if open furnaces, with surging orange-yellow tongues of flame licking the heavens, roasting the clouds into rolling caramel-colored silk.

Upon close inspection, the trees that were continuously being scorched appeared in a glass-like form, like billions of crystal columns enshrouded with raging fire.

Within the forest, everything was charred earth, flames swirling, as segments of eerie dances leapt upon the cracked rock walls.

Bang.

From time to time, a tree in the burning forest, having burned to its limit, suddenly exploded and shattered, emitting a muffled sound.

At that moment, flames burst forth, forming a fire tongue as high as ten zhang, shooting straight into the sky, only to vanish in an instant.

Waves of heat surged forward, with the firelight reflecting on the faces of every soldier in the Three Generals Camp.

Everyone was dumbfounded and silent.

“This is the Ten Li Burning Forest,” Liu Er sighed.

Guan Hong stroked his beard, “Magnificent.”

Zhang Hei said, “A good place!”

Ning Zhuo warned, “To avoid a long night with too many uncertainties, we should immediately reorganize the troops and prepare to attack.”

Liu Er, taking the advice smoothly, immediately ordered the entire army to rest and reorganize.

The soldiers divided tasks clearly: some were on perimeter lookout, while others inside ate and drank water, sat on the ground to relieve fatigue, wiped their weapons, and maintained their morale.

This scene was observed by Luo Chen and others.

Luo Chen, a Nascent Soul–level cultivator and the forest chief of the Ten Li Burning Forest, frowned at this moment, “Although the Three Generals Camp is a newly formed army, after several battles it scarcely exhibited the naivety of a new force.”

One of his Golden Core deputies, the Yan Liu Fairy, sighed, “Who would have thought that the Twin Rivers Country would suddenly send a force, specifically to our area?”

“What do we do?”

“In a hurry, I can only collect some treasures that are easy to carry and leave.”

Luo Chen looked toward another Golden Core deputy, “The Fire Crown Divine Fir cannot be relocated, and the Vermilion Bird Incense Burner is the heart of the great formation; thus, the only option is to take away the Wood Fire.”

“Yan Jin, have you found it?”

Old man Yan Jin shook his head, and with his divine sense transmitted a thought: “Sir, the seed of the Wood Fire has been wandering in the Ten Li Burning Forest. In a short period of time, unless one is extremely lucky to encounter it, we would have to activate the great formation and search, eliminating obstacles inch by inch.”

The Yan Liu Fairy’s face turned unpleasant, “Sir, have you sent a call for aid?”

Luo Chen nodded, then shook his head, “Given the current situation, reinforcements are difficult to obtain.”

The Yan Liu Fairy looked at Yan Jin, “If the three of us were to retreat directly, we would be unable to give an explanation to the Dragon King Temple and other forces!”

“But if we can protect the Wood Fire, thereby preventing the enemy from snatching the seed, and have a justified reason to depart, then we would have good days ahead.”

“Therefore, we must find the Wood Fire!”

Yan Jin nodded, gritting his teeth with a solemn expression, “I will do my utmost.”

Luo Chen reassured, “Rest assured.”

“My multilayered defenses in the Ten Li Burning Forest are sufficient to hold off the enemy for ten days or even half a month.”

“The generals of the Three Generals Camp have at most reached the Golden Core stage.”

“Of course, the sooner we locate the Wood Fire, the sooner we can leave, and the more secure that will be.”

At this time, Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning -the four of them -also talked about the Wood Fire.

“The Thousand Peaks Forest is all giant wooden mountains and lacks fire veins. The Ten Li Burning Forest, in contrast, is a place for refining artifacts that the Dragon King Temple, in conjunction with surrounding forces, constructed at great expense.”

“Because it is under the leadership of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, it uses human fire, namely, Wood Fire. This fire is one of the Samadhi types, and is extremely precious.”

“If we obtain it, then in the future, combined with Stone Fire and Sky Fire, we could forge the Samadhi True Fire!”

“Although the fire seed is good, for us, I’m afraid it might be too late.”

“Not so. According to the structure of the Ten Li Burning Forest, the Wood Fire must be left amidst raging flames, following the force of human heart changes, the path of the incense-fire deities.”

“So, to find a tiny fire seed in the endless sea of flames is not an easy task! Yet, there is still hope.”

After a round of discussion, the four’s hearts burned even more fiercely.

Although Ning Zhuo had acquired the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence, Fire Essence and Fire Seed are essentially different.

He was precisely lacking a Fire Seed that could be used for refining artifacts and alchemy. This would undoubtedly be of great convenience for his future in forging mechanism creations.

The Three Generals, upon seeing that the soldiers had finished their rest, immediately reorganized the troops and launched a direct frontal assault on the Ten Li Burning Forest.

The Burning Forest’s defensive formation had long been activated; at this moment, the flames raged so fiercely that melting gold and forging iron were no longer a challenge.

In the past, the entire Three Generals Camp could only watch the flames in lament. But now, they were no longer the same as before, with abundant funds and the backing of Zhao Xi, and the soldiers were fully equipped.

They all took their pills and applied Frost Talismans.

The entire army, numbering over six hundred (having absorbed many remnant soldiers), was suddenly clad in armor covered with frost, appearing as a brilliant white mass.

“Advance!” Liu Er commanded, forming a triangular arrow formation, and led the troops charging into the sea of flames.

Endless tongues of flame entwined around the soldiers, yet they could only lick the frost; in the short term, it did not threaten their lives.

Squeak, squeak, squeak…

After the army advanced about one li, swarms of rats surged in from all directions.

Fire Fur Rats!

Ning Zhuo was very familiar with this kind of demonic beast, because in Fire Persimmon Mountain there was an abundance of Fire Fur Rats breeding.

The Fire Fur Rats in Fire Persimmon Mountain were usually large, capable of swimming in lava and preying on birds. In the Ten Li Burning Forest, the Fire Fur Rats were smaller in size, but far more numerous.

It was the first time Ning Zhuo had seen such a vast swarm of rats.

The densely packed, layered rats surged like a tidal wave towards the Three Generals Camp.

All the soldiers had already lined up in full battle readiness.

Liu Er, out of caution, raised the Xuan Huang Sword in his hand and activated the military strategy contained within the sword for defending and securing the base, bestowing protective fortifications upon the entire army.

Guan Hong was more skilled at dealing with individual strong foes, while Zhang Hei’s tactics were better suited for handling the current situation.

Tactics -an overwhelming army pressing forward!

The Three Generals Camp’s combat strength suddenly diminished by 40%, converting into individual black water soldiers.

The soldiers, silently, raised weapons similarly formed from condensed black water, and counterattacked the rat swarm.

Ning Zhuo’s eyes twitched slightly as he keenly observed that the black water soldiers’ weapons were no longer uniformly spears, but now included axes, halberds, hook spears, knives, swords, and other common arms.

Ning Zhuo thought, “It seems Zhang Hei, having gone through numerous battles, has gained many insights into the art of war.”

The black water soldiers, a vast mass, directly clashed with the vermilion rat swarm.

The soldiers were like reefs, standing unmoved.

The rat swarm’s casualties were increasing steadily.

Although the black water soldiers suffered attrition, compared to the rat swarm, they were significantly more robust; each black water soldier, before dying, managed to kill at least a hundred Fire Fur Rats.

The Yan Liu Fairy concealed herself behind the scenes, using the great formation in the Burning Forest to control the rat swarm.

Seeing signs that the black water soldiers were about to push back, she decisively took action, dispatching additional demonic beasts.

Countless crimson floating entities, mingled with the flames, like brilliant stars shimmering in black and red, descended upon the black water soldiers.

The black water soldiers, caught in a pincer attack by the rat swarm and the crimson floating group, quickly showed signs of fatigue, with their casualties rapidly increasing.

The effect was immediate; the battle line was rapidly pushed back!

The Yan Liu Fairy, seeing this situation, proactively withdrew her troops.
