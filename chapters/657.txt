Chapter 657: Spirit Communication Mirror Illumination

An impenetrably dense crimson aura, thick as congealed blood, erupted from Ning Zhuo's body in an instant.

The scarlet radiance, carrying the murderous intent of clashing weapons, pierced through layers of black clouds to strike the Formless Pivot marked by Snowlight.

Simple, brutal!

Ruthless force shattering cunning!

Time seemed to freeze for a fraction of a second.

Then - everything shattered!

Rumble... Rumble... Rumble...

The Black Cloud Space convulsed as if countless bolts of lightning had crashed into the Abyss, unleashing an unprecedented cacophony of terror.

Deafening!

It wasn't a single sound, but a symphony of destruction: countless restrictions collapsing, spatial structures warping, infinite talismans tearing apart, and energy currents colliding chaotically.

Ning Zhuo's vision suddenly became a surreal, otherworldly spectacle.

Centered around the Formless Pivot, Snowlight Literary Qi surged outward, blood-saturation boiling, as dark and pale hues interwove into expanding ripples across the space.

Wherever they reached, the pivots - whether discovered or hidden - were utterly exposed. Like fragile soap bubbles, they burst silently one after another! The released Literary Qi transformed into Snowlight, but before it could spread, it was instantly devoured and distorted by the violent spatial ripples.

The space folded, then tore apart!

Spatial rifts erupted one after another, like grotesque scars marring the entire horizon. Countless chaotic energy currents, like wild horses freed from their reins, surged wildly through these fissures and distortions, colliding, annihilating each other, and exploding in a frenzy.

The entire Grand Formation collapsed in an unstoppable chain reaction.

Yet Ning Zhuo remained unscathed, standing in an eye of the storm. Outside was a scene of cataclysmic disaster, while inside, it was as calm as a still lake.

The young man's expression mirrored his grave mood.

He stared intently at the Formless Pivot before him, astonished to discover that despite the violent impacts that had twisted and distorted it, driving the entire Grand Formation to tear and collapse, the pivot itself remained resilient. It was gradually absorbing the shock and rapidly restoring its original form.

"The Formless Pivot!" A bolt of lightning seemed to strike Ning Zhuo's divine sea.

In that instant, he understood without instruction, gaining sudden enlightenment of one of the Formless Pivot's greatest advantages: its formlessness!

This rendered it impervious to many conventional methods of destruction!

It was like the moon's reflection on water. Even if Ning Zhuo stirred the water, distorting the reflection beyond recognition, once the surface calmed, the moon's image would simply return to its original full moon reflection.

As for the tangible pivots, even if they were utterly destroyed, as long as the Formless Pivot remained intact, the true foundations of the Grand Formation would remain unshaken. At worst, the formation would merely become dilapidated.

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth.

His mastery of formation arts paled in comparison to that of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. He simply lacked the ability to directly dismantle the Formless Pivot.

He had to give his all, unleashing a torrent of baleful energy while simultaneously invoking Military Power Amplification.

The crimson baleful energy erupted like ignited flames, transforming into a vast crimson light that engulfed the Formless Pivot.

With the Qing-Jiao Army's Military Might now amplifying Ning Zhuo alone, it made him even more formidable, like a tiger gaining wings.

Ning Zhuo's painstakingly accumulated baleful energy was being recklessly depleted, quickly dwindling. Yet the Formless Pivot remained intact, suffering no true damage.

Could I have made a wrong choice? Ning Zhuo's resolve wavered. Hmm? What's that?

Amidst the endless billows of black clouds and the tempestuous spatial storms, he glimpsed a massive silver-gray sphere.

A branch of the Wangchuan River.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart skipped a beat.

Ning Zhuo didn't recognize the silver-gray sphere, but the Prefecture Lord knew it all too well.

It was the result of his spell, the Profound Nether Water Dragons, where he had been forced to use the Lord's Seal to finally seal the Nirvana Buddha Phantom.

Originally, he had hidden this silver-gray sphere deep within the Grand Formation. But now, with Ning Zhuo's interference causing the formation to sway like willow branches in a gale, the sphere was completely exposed.

I hope this brat doesn't notice it, the Prefecture Lord thought. But the moment the thought formed, Ning Zhuo's head snapped up, his hawk-like gaze locking onto the silver-gray sphere, his expression a mix of surprise and sharp intensity.

Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart skipped a beat.

He never imagined that, as a Soul Formation-level powerhouse, the ruler of the Underworld Prefecture - a sovereign of a realm - would find himself so deeply concerned about a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator!

"But Qi Luck..." The Prefecture Lord nearly groaned to the heavens, the sense of impending doom intensifying within him.

Suddenly, his pupils contracted to pinpoints as he remembered another critical element:

The Void Return Black Sphere!

This was another masterpiece of the Soundless Ghost Monk.

The Soundless Ghost Monk specialized in the Nirvana Zen Sutra, and this sphere embodied its terrifying killing technique - the Void Return Finger!

To counter the Void Return Finger's destructive power, the Prefecture Lord had once exhausted all his strength, channeling the power of a Branch of the Wangchuan River. Yet even this supreme effort could only result in a stalemate, a battle of attrition. Completely annihilating the Void Return Black Sphere would be no overnight task.

Therefore, the Prefecture Lord had redirected the Wangchuan Soul Stream, pushing both the Void Return Black Sphere and the Profound Nether Silver Orb away from the Sacrificial Altar, hiding them deep within the layers of dark clouds and the depths of the Grand Formation.

"The Profound Nether Water Dragons, combined with my Lord's Seal, have sealed the Nirvana Buddha Phantom - the manifestation of the Soundless Ghost Monk's Lifebound Buddha Wheel."

"But the Void Return Black Sphere is also the Soundless Ghost Monk's creation. If their Qi resonances ever align, it will have catastrophic consequences!"

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord could already imagine the two spheres colliding, the Void Return Finger dissolving the surface seal's power and releasing the Buddha phantom.

He absolutely couldn't let this happen!

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord gritted his teeth.

He could only rely on himself and his Divided Spirit.

But the Divided Spirit was locked in a difficult struggle with Luo Si, and more importantly, it remained closely linked to the Earth Aspect Formation, preventing him from controlling the Heavenly Aspect Formation.

The Grand Formation surrounding the sacrificial altar comprised the majority of the Heavenly Aspect Formation.

Therefore, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had no choice but to act with his True Form!

He had also been hoping to seize the opportunity to risk entering a trance, to catch his breath and gather some more combat power. The current situation left him no room for thought; he could only exhaust his spirit to control the Heavenly Aspect Formation.

The Silver-Gray Giant Sphere had already been exposed, but the Void Return Black Sphere remained hidden.

He had to keep this black sphere concealed at all costs, and he would spare no effort to prevent the two spheres from colliding.

After just a few breaths of attempting to control the Heavenly Aspect Formation, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's face already showed signs of exhaustion.

This was too difficult!

Ning Zhuo was wreaking havoc on the Formless Pivot, and the entire Heavenly Aspect Formation was like a runaway carriage. The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had to struggle to maintain its balance.

He felt as weak as a newborn infant.

His spirit was being violently drained!

At this moment, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was drawing upon his deepest reserves, showcasing his far richer experience than Ning Zhuo's, and was actually managing to temporarily stabilize the situation and conceal the black sphere's movements.

This was incredibly difficult!

It was like walking a tightrope on the edge of a cliff during a raging storm.

Ning Zhuo remained completely unaware of it all.

He had no idea that he was subtly locked in a contest of wills with the lord of an entire prefecture, a Soul Formation-level existence.

What did he know of the Void Return Black Sphere?

He didn't even understand the origins of the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere before him.

Ning Zhuo stared at the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, his thoughts racing through his divine sea like lightning: "A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot... north? Could it be that 'north' here refers to a location even further north of the Formless Pivot?"

At that moment, the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere was positioned directly north of the Formless Pivot.

Ning Zhuo didn't know if this interpretation was the standard answer to the prophetic poem, but even if he wanted to act against the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, he was utterly powerless.

The reason was simple.

He was currently at the Formless Pivot, the eye of the storm. While the surrounding battlefield was fraught with danger, this place was relatively stable.

To approach the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, he would have to cross a battlefield raging like a hurricane - a move that would be tantamount to suicide.

A ranged attack?

Ning Zhuo resolved to try.

He maintained the Confucian technique "Scholar Meets Soldier" while activating his Five Elements Spells.

Fortunately, "Scholar Meets Soldier" was relatively simple, allowing Ning Zhuo to multitask while sustaining it.

Yet even with the Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art and Military Power Amplification, his Five Elements Spells were destroyed halfway, with no hope of reaching the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord observed this with a cold smile. "This brat still thinks he can attack from a distance and break the seal? Hmph, wishful thinking."

After a few attempts, Ning Zhuo immediately stopped.

His spiritual energy was limited, and casting multiple spells simultaneously drained his mind rapidly.

This wasn't the time for reckless bombardment. His Foundation Establishment cultivation was already insufficient; every ounce of power must be used sparingly.

What should I do?!

Ning Zhuo knew brute force wouldn't work. He racked his brain, desperately searching for a way to break the deadlock.

A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot...

A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot...

North... north...

Shine?

Shine?!

In that instant, a spiritual light flashed through his divine sea like lightning, dispelling the fog in his mind.

His eyes lit up with sudden clarity, his spirit surging!

Noticing Ning Zhuo's sudden change in expression, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart skipped a beat again, the sense of impending danger intensifying.

"So the 'shine' in this poem has a second meaning!"

"I understand!"

Ning Zhuo produced a Mechanical Treasure Mirror.

This was his Lifebound Treasure - the Spirit Communication Mirror!

Crafted from precious materials such as cold iron, flowing cloud sand, Great White Golden Essence, celestial crystal, and abundant earth, its physical form was forged using a Mechanism Platform. Finally, Ning Zhuo inscribed the Spirit Communication Mirror Spell Talismans into the Formation Core, completing its refinement.

The Spirit Communication Mirror could transport both people and objects.

In the past, when Sun Lingtong was trapped within the Dragon Pool Hidden Scales Dao Field, Ning Zhuo had used a two-pronged approach - combining the Life Hanging by a Thread technique with the Spirit Communication Mirror - to rescue him.

While transporting Sun Lingtong had been somewhat awkward, the mirror was perfectly suited for deploying mechanical constructs.

This was no surprise.

The Spirit Communication Mirror, as a Lifebound Treasure, originated from the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual - one of the Three Sects' Supreme Methods - and was inherently one of the world's foremost Mechanical Art Manuals.

Ning Zhuo activated the Confucian technique Scholar Meets Soldier while drawing the Spirit Communication Mirror, holding it in one hand.

He aligned the mirror's surface with the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, restraining himself from activating it immediately.

This simple action alone made the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart leap with anxiety.

Ning Zhuo waited for the perfect moment, watching for a relatively stable interval in the sphere's movements. When the opportunity presented itself, he abruptly activated the Spirit Communication Mirror, unleashing a beam of mirror light.

The pillar of mirror light, though struck mid-flight, still managed to strike half of the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere.

In the next instant, Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu materialized out of thin air, crouching atop the massive sphere.

This was the new Meng Yehu!

After the war between the Two Note Kingdoms, Ning Zhuo had realized the need to replace Meng Yehu's materials entirely.

The current Meng Yehu was three times more robust than before. Yet even so, compared to the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, the mighty and brawny Meng Yehu seemed like a mouse at an elephant's feet.

Mechanism - Shadow Slaughter Claws!

Dull, lusterless blades suddenly extended from Meng Yehu's hands, stabbing viciously at the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere before him.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Sparks flew, and then the Shadow Slaughter Claws snapped completely.

Ning Zhuo's pupils constricted in surprise at the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere's formidable defense. After all, the newly retooled Meng Yehu was now entirely composed of magic treasures!

This was the fruit of Ning Zhuo's immense war profits from the Two Note Kingdoms.

Despite this, the Shadow Slaughter Claws had only managed to scratch the surface of the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere.

"Is that all?" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord raised an eyebrow slightly, then quickly composed himself. "Did I perhaps make too much of this?"

Suddenly, a fissure split open on the surface of the silver-gray giant sphere, releasing a torrent of steam mixed with a desolate Buddhist light.

This phenomenon wasn't caused by the Nether Slaughter Claw, but by the turbulent, tearing Formation Space.

However, under Ning Zhuo's watchful gaze, the crack on the silver-gray giant sphere swiftly began to heal itself.

The primary seal restraining the Nirvana Buddha Phantom was the Lord's Seal, a National Artifact! Reinforced by several Profound Nether Water Dragons, the seal's power remained remarkably resilient.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord felt a slight sense of relief.

Ning Zhuo, however, noticed something amiss. Without hesitation, he activated the Spirit Communication Mirror and recalled Meng Yehu.

"This is the power of the Water Element, beyond my immediate reach. Now, I must rely solely on the Fire Seed!"

Fire Within Wood!

When decisive action was required, Ning Zhuo never hesitated.

He retrieved the Fire Seed, cast a spell, and placed it in Meng Yehu's mouth.

This sight made the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord tense up again.

"That brat is only at the Foundation Establishment Stage! How can he possess a Fire Seed?!"

Fire Within Wood!

"Even with this, he can't break through the Profound Nether Water Dragons' seal alone."

"But what kind of Fire Element Spell did he actually use?"

This question was crucial!

At its core, a spell is a method of wielding power. This power could be a cultivator's own spiritual energy, a precious material, or a magic artifact or treasure.

While Fire Within Wood couldn't directly counter the Profound Nether Water Dragons' seal, if the right spell was used, it could still break it.

This was the wisdom of cultivation.

"How could this brat have learned a spell specifically targeted against my Profound Nether Water Dragons?" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord tried to reassure himself, but the thought only made him more anxious.

After all, this opponent was a Human Tribulation chosen by the Living Realm's Heaven and its Heavenly Mandate!

How many strange coincidences and hidden agendas had already manifested in his life?

What the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord didn't realize was that Ning Zhuo hadn't learned any targeted spell at all. The truth was even worse than he imagined - Ning Zhuo's profound mastery of the Five Elements allowed him to create a new spell on the spot!

The Spirit Communication Mirror flashed, projecting Meng Yehu onto the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere once more.

With all his strength, Meng Yehu climbed to the fissure, opened his mouth, and spat out a fiery orb, arching it directly into the orb's interior.

Centered around the Fire Seed, the power of Fire Element Spells was boundless!
