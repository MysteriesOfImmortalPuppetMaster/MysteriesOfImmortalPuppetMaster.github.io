Chapter 691: How Many Golden Cores Does Ning Zhuo Possess?

Su Lingkou couldn't understand. She was deeply puzzled. "Cousin and Lin Jinglong were competing for the second position - a serious matter for both sides, with each taking it very seriously."

"How could Ning Zhuo's intervention turn it into a game of rock-paper-scissors? How could such a trivial matter decide the outcome?"

Why had Shen Xi agreed?

Because in that instant, he had suddenly realized the situation had completely changed!

He had initially believed that Ning Zhuo would form an alliance with him, supporting each other, and that at least this time, Ning Zhuo would be his key ally. But Ning Zhuo's actions had never followed his planned course.

Ning Zhuo had directly approached Lin Jinglong, successfully hosted a banquet, and judging by the atmosphere, they might have already reached a private agreement!

In this situation, if Shen Xi maintained a rigid stance and insisted on claiming the second position, he risked provoking a joint attack from Ning Zhuo and Lin Jinglong.

Therefore, he had seized the opportunity to concede, taking a step back to preserve his maneuvering space.

There was no need for a direct confrontation!

Even if he lost the second position, it would only be a minor setback, far from a crippling blow.

Ning Zhuo didn't just offer a casual greeting; he stood up and personally welcomed Shen Xi and Su Lingkou.

Seeing this, Yu Heye immediately rose as well.

Lin Jinglong, born into a prominent clan, naturally possessed an air of dignity and rose almost simultaneously with Ning Zhuo.

Yet Yu Heye's actions still sent a slight tremor through Lin Jinglong's heart, prompting him to subtly raise his assessment of Ning Zhuo by another level.

Ning Zhuo had arranged for Shen Xi and Su Lingkou to sit to Yu Heye's left.

This seating arrangement was quite intriguing.

Yu Heye occupied the head seat, with Shen Xi to his left and Lin Jinglong to his right. Su Lingkou sat beside Shen Xi, while Ning Zhuo sat beside Lin Jinglong.

Based solely on the seating arrangement, Ning Zhuo's status appeared to be on par with Su Lingkou's.

As for Gongsun Yan, he stood behind Ning Zhuo and Lin Jinglong, not taking a seat.

Yu Heye gestured to the delicacies on the table, introducing them and initiating conversation.

Following this opening, the group exchanged pleasantries and toasted each other for several rounds before finally addressing the matter at hand.

When Ning Zhuo clearly stated his intentions, Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong were visibly astonished.

Su Lingkou, thinking she had misheard, asked Ning Zhuo again, "What? You're not participating in the rock-paper-scissors game?"

Ning Zhuo smiled. "I was recommended by Brother Shen. How could I presume to surpass him? It's already an honor for me to be included at all."

Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong exchanged glances, both seeing the same shock and suspicion in each other's eyes.

Both men couldn't help but wonder the same thing: if Ning Zhuo had never coveted the second seat, why had he gone to such lengths?

They had severely underestimated Ning Zhuo.

To him, this was hardly a major undertaking. Revealing his true intentions might have been hurtful.

Initially, Ning Zhuo had simply wanted to test the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan.

He had learned about Gongsun Yan's situation from Shen Xi's flying message and, on a whim, decided to treat Gongsun Yan's illness. Of course, there was also an element of intimidation involved.

But he never expected Gongsun Yan to surrender so easily!

Having already undermined Lin Jinglong's position, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to seize the opportunity and use Lin Jinglong as a test subject for the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan's combat prowess.

Lin Jinglong was no match for Ning Zhuo.

To smooth things over, Ning Zhuo had Yu Heye arrange another meeting, inviting Lin Jinglong and Shen Xi. Su Lingkou was merely an afterthought, of no real importance.

Shen Xi stared at Ning Zhuo, hurrying to say, "Fellow Daoist Ning, your profound understanding of the Five Elements and extraordinary strength far surpass ours. You rightfully deserve the second seat."

Ning Zhuo replied, "What? I merely relied on the advantages of my Magic Artifact. Besides, my exchange with Fellow Daoist Lin was just a friendly spar, not a life-or-death battle. He undoubtedly held back his magic treasures and trump cards."

"If we were to truly clash, the outcome would be unpredictable," Ning Zhuo said.

Lin Jinglong smiled slightly, acknowledging the truth in Ning Zhuo's words. He had indeed held back his trump cards.

However, Ning Zhuo's lack of ambition for second place genuinely puzzled him.

Still wanting to probe Ning Zhuo's true intentions, Lin Jinglong remarked, "Fellow Daoist Ning, you're being far too modest. Setting aside everything else, this Ghost Path Golden Core alone would secure you the second position. Such a grand gesture is beyond my capabilities."

As he spoke, Lin Jinglong proactively retrieved the Ghost Path Golden Core and displayed it for all to see.

Shen Xi looked puzzled, while Su Lingkou directly asked, "Young Master Lin, did Young Master Ning Zhuo also give you this Golden Core?"

Lin Jinglong nodded slightly.

Yu Heye's pupils constricted involuntarily.

Among those present, Yu Heye possessed the highest cultivation level, being a Golden Core cultivator himself. But now, upon learning that Ning Zhuo had gifted a second Golden Core to someone else, Yu Heye's psychological advantage from his cultivation level completely vanished.

Su Lingkou frowned, recalling that her cousin had obtained the Ghost Path Golden Core only by sacrificing his beloved Array Dao Magical Treasure, the Array Rift Shuttle. What had Lin Jinglong given in exchange?

In truth, Shen Xi and Yu Heye shared the same question.

Lin Jinglong then explained that Ning Zhuo had given him the Ghost Path Golden Core to help Gongsun Yan break free from his contract with the Lin Clan.

The answer was truly unexpected.

Yu Heye, Shen Xi, and Su Lingkou all turned their gazes toward Gongsun Yan.

Gongsun Yan nodded. "It is my honor to serve Young Master Ning Zhuo. I am also grateful for his assistance in covering my expenses..."

"Ah, no need for such formalities," Ning Zhuo interrupted. "It is my honor to have Fellow Daoist Gongsun Yan's assistance. This isn't a matter of covering expenses; it's a response to this honor and gratitude to the Lin Clan for helping Fellow Daoist Gongsun alleviate the flaws in his Innate Talent. My connection with Fellow Daoist Gongsun is all thanks to the Lin Clan, especially Fellow Daoist Lin Jinglong's magnanimity."

Though Ning Zhuo's words were elegantly phrased, Shen Xi, a shrewd observer, saw through the facade.

He was inwardly astonished. He had never imagined Ning Zhuo would directly poach Lin Jinglong's most valuable asset!

Lin Jinglong isn't even angry?! Shen Xi glanced at Lin Jinglong.

Noticing the gaze, Lin Jinglong offered Shen Xi a bitter smile.

Shen Xi was even more shocked, suddenly realizing: Gongsun Yan was Lin Jinglong's most valuable subordinate. If he defected, Lin Jinglong would never let it go quietly. But his current attitude suggests Ning Zhuo has already dealt him a crushing blow, thoroughly intimidating him.

Ning Zhuo may have given him a Ghost Path Golden Core, but Lin Jinglong would never react this way over a single Golden Core!

"The question is," someone murmured, "was Lin Jinglong intimidated by the powerful elders backing Ning Zhuo, or did Ning Zhuo simply beat him into submission?"

Ning Zhuo quickly waved his hand, his tone humble. "Fellow Daoist Lin showed great generosity in helping Fellow Daoist Gongsun and me forge our connection. We cannot act the villain and let this matter fester, allowing others to exploit it and belittle Fellow Daoist Lin and the Lin Clan."

"Therefore, I implore you all to keep this matter confidential and remain tight-lipped."

These words immediately earned Lin Jinglong's goodwill.

Shen Xi sighed and agreed, "Of course, this is for our own good."

Su Lingkou's emotions were complex.

She instinctively glanced at Gongsun Yan. They had fought to a draw the previous day, though she had actually been at a disadvantage. The sheer power of his Heartfire still left her secretly shaken.

Yet only a day later, Gongsun Yan had become Ning Zhuo's subordinate.

How did he manage that?

What price did Ning Zhuo offer?

Su Lingkou shifted her gaze back to Ning Zhuo, and in that moment, she suddenly realized: Ning Zhuo was no ordinary cultivator like herself or Gongsun Yan. His status was likely comparable to that of her own cousin.

What price did Ning Zhuo offer?

This question also lingered in Lin Jinglong's mind.

Lin Jinglong secretly observed Gongsun Yan and was astonished to find him radiating vitality, his demeanor now exuding an unfamiliar confidence.

Lin Jinglong recalled his battle with Ning Zhuo and secretly speculated, "Ning Zhuo's fan must be his Lifebound Magical Artifact, explaining its immense power. He only revealed one defensive magic treasure earlier, so he's definitely hiding other trump cards."

"He likely cultivates a Five Elements-based Cultivation Art. Perhaps his other magic treasure is also Five Elements-aligned, specifically designed to counteract the flaws of his Melting Heart Talent."

"That's why Gongsun Yan defected to his side!"

"Magic treasures? I have plenty too... three in total!"

"I simply didn't need to use any during our earlier sparring match."

Though Ning Zhuo had "fought him to a draw," Lin Jinglong secretly believed he could have won. His family's pragmatic approach dictated that he withdraw when he had the upper hand, avoiding unnecessary conflict.

"As for the Golden Cores... Ning Zhuo's consecutive display of two Golden Cores was undoubtedly meant to showcase his deep reserves."

"Given this momentum, he likely possesses more."

"But not many!"

"These are Golden Cores! He couldn't possibly have ten or more, right? Hahaha."

Lin Jinglong continued to mentally assess Ning Zhuo's capabilities.

Perhaps distracted by these thoughts, he lost the next round of rock-paper-scissors to Shen Xi.

With this, Shen Xi claimed the second-place seat, while Lin Jinglong settled into third. As for Ning Zhuo, he explicitly stated that he would refrain from participating in the ranking for the time being.

"As long as I can interact with everyone, learn together, and improve together, I'll be content!" Ning Zhuo said with genuine humility.

There's really no need for all this.

His current priority was to wait for his true identity to be revealed. Until then, he needed to gather as much information as possible about the surrounding situation and find the most suitable entry point for himself.

After the banquet concluded and he bid farewell to the others, Ning Zhuo returned to his Immortal's Cave on a cloud, his expression thoughtful.

Old Chef was guarding the cave, while Qing Chi rushed out to greet him.

Ning Zhuo asked her a few concerned questions about her cultivation progress.

Although Qing Chi had lost her memories, her cultivation base remained intact. Having already reached the Foundation Establishment Stage, switching to a new Cultivation Art would come at a tremendous cost.

Therefore, she continued practicing her original Cultivation Art.

"Young Master, everything is going smoothly!" Qing Chi assured him.

This was to be expected.

Even without her memories, Qing Chi's body had practiced the Cultivation Art countless times, establishing a kind of muscle memory. Moreover, her Ghost Person physique had been gradually transformed by the art itself, adapting her form to better suit its principles.

Thus, Qing Chi's reacquaintance with the Cultivation Art posed no real challenge.

"This is Fellow Daoist Gongsun Yan," Ning Zhuo introduced Gongsun Yan to the pair. "He has also agreed to join us in our cultivation endeavors."

Gongsun Yan followed Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, glancing up and down at Old Chef and Qing Chi before offering a perfunctory bow.

Both Old Chef and Qing Chi were at the Foundation Establishment Stage, which Gongsun Yan assumed meant they were Ning Zhuo's servants or subordinates, unlike Sun Lingtong's more intimate role as a book attendant. Consequently, Gongsun Yan's attitude remained indifferent.

Had Qing Chi been a Human female cultivator, Gongsun Yan might have assumed she was Ning Zhuo's personal maid and treated her with greater respect.

But as a member of the Ghost-Human Clan...

Gongsun Yan instinctively regarded Qing Chi as an ordinary subordinate.

Ning Zhuo first settled Gongsun Yan into his quarters before entering the cultivation chamber to begin his practice.

The six stages of the Foundation Establishment Stage were: Unobstructed Field Opening, Nurturing Precious Medicines, Radiant Dantian, Phenomenal Seed Talisman, Golden Light Illumination, and Transforming Void into Reality.

Ning Zhuo's cultivation had already advanced to the Phenomenal Seed Talisman stage, placing him in the late-middle to late stages of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

He had resumed cultivation at the age of sixteen, switching to the Three Sects' Supreme Methods. Since these methods involved cultivating three dantian simultaneously, his progress should have been exceptionally slow.

Yet at seventeen, Ning Zhuo had already reached the late-middle stages - a cultivation speed that was nothing short of astonishing!

Even more terrifying was that his primary focus wasn't even on cultivation.

His most important goal was to save Meng Yaoyin. After leaving Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he spent most of his time traveling, though he diligently continued his cultivation. However, the actual time he devoted to cultivation was remarkably scarce.

Ning Zhuo knew perfectly well that his terrifyingly efficient cultivation speed stemmed entirely from external aids. These included the Three Luminaries Intersecting Treasure Talisman, vast quantities of Spirit Stones, and, most crucially, the National Power Brick!

Cultivating with the National Power Brick was truly miraculous, granting a sensation akin to ascending to heaven!

Ning Zhuo had been fortunate enough to experience this several times. He still possessed a National Power Brick.

However, during the Phenomenal Seed Talisman stage, brute force alone wouldn't suffice. It required cultivators to demonstrate their comprehension of the cultivation art.

"My cultivation in the divine sea and Qi Sea has already reached the required level, granting me the Spirit Communication Art and Five Elements Creation and Destruction Art respectively. But the Essence Sea's corresponding cultivation art, the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art, still lags far behind."

"Ah... I suppose I truly belong to the Righteous Path. Demonic Path cultivation arts just aren't suited for me."

Ning Zhuo had already devised a plan to accelerate his comprehension of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.

He retrieved a flower bud - the Dharma Aspect's seal from the Red Flower Battle Formation - within which Lin You was imprisoned.

This person was the son of the Demon Heart Cave Master, practicing the same cultivation art as his father, which should be quite similar to the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.

Ning Zhuo had originally planned to educate him in the ways of the Righteous Path, hoping to extract the cultivation art from him. This would not only help Ning Zhuo comprehend demonic techniques but also serve as atonement for the young man's sins, contributing to the Righteous Path.

However, Ning Zhuo hadn't expected the flower bud to still exist after passing White Paper Immortal City.

"So much time has passed... Could Lin You have already starved to death?" A sense of foreboding washed over Ning Zhuo.

Yet, faced with the red flower bud, he felt utterly helpless.

This was the power of military strategy. Had it been a Five Elements Technique, Ning Zhuo could have handled it with ease.

There was another such flower bud, imprisoning Wu Hen. Similarly, though the bud appeared fragile, its resilient material continued to firmly seal the cultivator within.

Ning Zhuo stored the flower buds away and fell into deep thought.

He channeled his Five Elements Spiritual Energy, activating his Innate Spell, the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Art, while secretly mobilizing the Wood Element Lung Temple.

Vast quantities of Wood Element Spiritual Power surged from his palm, swirling, growing, and continuously transforming within his hand.

This process continued for the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea. Suddenly, amidst the ever-shifting emerald spiritual energy, a spark of electricity crackled!
