Chapter 523: It Turned Out to Be a Trap!

Twin Rivers Nation Frontline Main Camp.

Camp of the Three Generals.

Military Strategist’s Office.

Ning Zhuo concentrated intently, his divine sense locked onto the jade slip in his hand, continuously observing the images within.

This was the latest instance of Liu Er and the others using three mechanical constructs to harvest Ginseng Whiskers.

“The performance of the Golden-scaled Chainsaw Snake almost perfectly met my expectations.”

“The actual performance of the Rolling Electric Ball Cage was also good.”

“Only the Root-Drilling Hammer did not succeed.”

“In every battle, this mechanical hammer was almost always broken. Only one instance survived, and that too was merely an accident.”

Ning Zhuo thought to himself, “How should I improve it in order to increase the survival probability of the Root-Drilling Hammer?”

To Shuangjing, the cost incurred by the Three Generals’ Camp was already pitifully low, but Ning Zhuo was not satisfied and still wanted to improve it.

In a sense, it was precisely his tireless pursuit of mechanical art that facilitated the continuous refinement of his craft.

Sun Lingtong said, “This is easy.”

The three kinds of mechanical constructs produced by Ning Zhuo also attracted Sun Lingtong’s interest.

Lately, he had also been delving into these things, finding them rather interesting.

When Ning Zhuo was pondering and refining the mechanical constructs, Sun Lingtong also joined in. In the past ten-plus years, such occurrences were not uncommon.

Once, Sun Lingtong had wanted to retrieve his missing master, which was his greatest motivation for studying mechanical techniques.

But gradually, that motive changed.

Sun Lingtong was not devoted to mechanical techniques, merely interested; however, he knew that Ning Zhuo loved them from the bottom of his heart.

He himself was also able to perceive the visible progress in his personal skills through this collaborative investigation.

Sun Lingtong then suggested, “Little Zhuo, you could absolutely design a mechanical hammer and hand it over to any one of Liu, Guan, or Zhang cultivators.”

“With their protection, the mechanical hammer would shoot more accurately and be safer, and it would never be smashed by the mad Ginseng Whiskers.”

Ning Zhuo let out an “ah” and stood dumbfounded right there.

After a few breaths, he slapped his own forehead, “Right, how come I didn’t think of that? This method is the simplest and most convenient.”

“Boss, you’re still amazing.”

Amidst the mechanical marvels, Sun Lingtong, his face beaming with praise, laughed and said, “Little Zhuo, actually you are the orthodox one.”

“I was only being lazy.”

“Based on your direction, if a Drilling Hammer that could activate on its own and protect itself were designed, it would certainly be better.”

“In this way, Liu, Guan, and Zhang would at least have one hand free, not having to undertake this task, giving them more room to exert themselves.”

Ning Zhuo shook his head, “Boss, although that may be so, the fact is that I had fallen into a cognitive pitfall.”

“I could never help but want to use mechanical techniques to solve every problem. I enjoyed the process, and I eagerly anticipated the wonderful sensation upon its successful realization.”

“But regarding the actual problem, I may have thought too far ahead. Just as you are advising me now, it could be dealt with in this way.”

“This would save me a great deal of time and energy.”

“All mechanical techniques are merely means, with the primary purpose of solving practical problems.”

“Although I enjoy this art, I must not forget my original purpose.”

“Thank you, Boss, for your guidance!”

Deeply enlightened, Ning Zhuo sighed, “I often hear that when one reads too much, one becomes a bookworm. If I study mechanical art too rigidly, I fear I may become a mechanical art bookworm as well.”

Sun Lingtong laughed heartily, “Little Zhuo, I was just speaking offhand, but it’s great that you found some inspiration.”

“In the past, while staying in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, being well-read in poetry and books, and living a repressed life, it was indeed rather monotonous, miserable, and oppressive.”

“Many people think that with your talent and insight, you should remain in one place, practice cultivation steadily, and only later, when you have achieved a certain level, travel around.”

“But in my view, what do these outsiders know? It is most suitable for you to travel all over now.”

“You yourself might not realize it, but from my perspective, you have changed a lot along the way.”

Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and nodded slightly, “Indeed, that’s so.”

“Reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand miles is truly the unparalleled method to broaden one’s experience.”

“Along the way, I encountered all kinds of people. Even though books record details very thoroughly, they are never as vivid as in reality.”

“On Cloud Concealment Mountain, I met the local Mountain God. At the Myriad Medicine Sect, I befriended a wine-loving confidant, truly experiencing that life can indeed become so pleasantly leisurely. In Thousand Peaks Forest, I met Liu Er, who had lofty ambitions; although he was in a lower position, he still persevered.”

“And there was the Vanguard Camp.”

“While taking part in the Iron Flow leveling the plains, I witnessed firsthand the bearing of the military. Even though I did not know them at all, I felt heartfelt admiration!”

“So unafraid of sacrifice, facing death resolutely… that was yet another aspect of life’s demeanor.”

At this point, Ning Zhuo slightly looked upward, his gaze as if piercing through the roof and casting toward the vast firmament, “How vast this world is. So many people live and cultivate in this world, each moving forward in their own way. Some harbor great ambitions, while others live leisurely and happily; there is no hierarchy among them —each displaying countless forms, each with its own beauty.”

“Meeting and befriending these people, sometimes I felt inferior, sometimes envious, and sometimes I longed for them.”

“It was truly very interesting!”

At this, a slight curve appeared at the corner of Ning Zhuo’s mouth.

Sun Lingtong laughed heartily, “Little Zhuo, I see that your mood has been much more carefree lately!”

Ning Zhuo scratched his head, “Yeah, Boss.”

“We entered Thousand Peaks Forest just to seek my mother’s heirloom.”

“Therefore, we were pursued by Nascent Soul demon cultivators, barely escaping death. We joined the armies of Twin Rivers Nation, scheming for a long time. We even played the role of the Old Stone Monster, taking risks on the battlefield.”

“Now, we have finally come to this point.”

“Du Tiechuan and the Ginseng Whiskerd Dragon King had fiercely battled once, each bearing injuries. They were also wary of the Old Stone Monster, this third-party Soul Formation level being, making it very difficult to unleash their full power.”

“At that moment, a stalemate ensued, with each army and every Nascent Soul-level and Golden Core-level powerhouse coming onto the stage, competing with one another.”

“This is exactly the perfect opportunity for us to deal with the Six Caves Sect.”

“Not only can we avenge our family, but also reclaim my mother’s heirloom. We have worked so hard for so long, and finally see hope.”

“How could I not be happy?”

Sun Lingtong hummed in agreement, “Indeed, that’s so.”

With his eyes clear and bright, Ning Zhuo suddenly said, “At this very moment, I feel very happy!”

Sun Lingtong: “Hmm?”

Ning Zhuo earnestly said, “I don’t envy the brotherly bond of Liu, Guan, and Zhang one bit, because I have you, Boss.”

“I could travel all over and adventure with you, Boss, always feeling assured.”

“This way of life is indeed much more interesting than that in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.”

“I can, on one hand, witness all kinds of people and, on the other, continuously draw closer to my goal. You and I become stronger together, struggle together, and almost every so often, achieve new accomplishments.”

“Such days are truly wonderful! Boss, thank you!!”

Taken aback by Ning Zhuo’s words, Sun Lingtong’s eyes reddened slightly, his nostrils tinged with a slight sourness, and, gritting his teeth, he said, “Little Zhuo, you little fellow…”

Taking a deep breath, Sun Lingtong then laughed out loud, “You stinky brat, don’t get satisfied so easily!”

“I’m still waiting for you to rescue your mother, so that the two of us brothers can seek out hidden secrets and be great thieves all over!”

Ning Zhuo hummed and nodded heavily, “I’ll accompany you, Boss!”

Sun Lingtong, hands on his hips, laughed heartily.

At that moment, a soldier reported, bringing a letter.

It was a letter from Shuangjing addressed exclusively to Ning Zhuo.

In the letter, Shuangjing invited Ning Zhuo to step out of the camp for a talk.

Sun Lingtong said, “This Shuangjing must have noticed that Liu Er has been monopolizing the top spot in recent days, and so he sought you out, Little Zhuo.”

“This guy has schemed against you many times; his aunt also once spoiled our good fortune in Green Forest Immortal City.”

“This is a good opportunity; we can have a good time teasing him.”

Ning Zhuo shook his head indifferently, “There is no need for that.”

“That would be a waste of time.”

“I now wished I could split myself in two to get it done. I have too many tasks at hand.”

“Teasing him, or even humiliating him, if it doesn’t create value, what use is it?”

Sun Lingtong glared, “This is a great opportunity for you to regain your honor. Just imagine, making that arrogant guy eat humble pie and fawn over you —it would feel really satisfying!”

Ning Zhuo shook his head, “It’s just a matter of pride.”

He and Sun Lingtong were of different natures.

For more than ten years, Ning Zhuo had always maintained a state of patience and forbearance. He had long become accustomed to it.

It was precisely such life experiences that made Ning Zhuo very composed, with a wisdom far surpassing his age.

Sun Lingtong pouted, “Little Zhuo, you’re not fun at all in this regard. When you’re alive, you should be indulging yourself a bit; otherwise, what is the point?”

“Besides, I’m not just looking for amusement. If you don’t step forward and play along with Shuangjing, how can we stall for time?”

“If you directly refuse Shuangjing like this, that kid will surely be seething with anger and will not give up easily.”

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, “Rest assured, Boss, I have already made arrangements.”

White Jade Camp.

“Hmph!” Shuangjing, furious, pounded the table and stood up.

He glared in the direction of the Three Generals’ Camp, “Not even deigning to reply to a single letter from me? Ning Zhuo, that little brat, is so full of pride. Fine, very good!”

“Then don’t blame me for resorting to methods.”

Shuangjing, making a prompt decision, left White Jade Camp and went to visit the quartermaster.

He was of the Guo surname, of high status, and was soon led into a study to have a confidential discussion with the quartermaster.

Shuangjing, adding embellishments, informed the quartermaster of the relevant situation.

The quartermaster feigned understanding, “So that’s it. I was saying that this Liu Er, a mere Golden Core-level minor cultivator, monopolizing the top spot for days, was unexpected. It turns out there is such a secret behind it.”

Shuangjing immediately said, “Liu Er is nothing more than a person of mixed human and demon blood, with a narrow vision. With such a powerful weapon, he should have handed it over to the army for rapid dissemination. In this way, the time our army spends scavenging the battlefield would be greatly reduced, which would be very beneficial for the overall situation.”

“But as it stands now, Liu Er, solely for his own personal gain, has placed our Twin Rivers Nation behind him; if such thoughts and behavior are not corrected, causing the masses to frequently imitate, thereby undermining the fine ethos of the military, that would be very bad.”

Shuangjing adopted an air of worry for the nation and its people.

The quartermaster looked at him in astonishment, thinking: Liu Er was an outsider, a newly recruited one; that he could form a new army was already praiseworthy. To ask him to forsake his personal gains and think of the country would indeed be forcing his hand.

He also muttered under his breath: All the soldiers of our main army are resting, and the time spent scavenging the spoils is precisely when the commanders can make use of it. Even if the time for cleaning up the battlefield is reduced, if the army still cannot be mobilized, then what good is it?

Even though Shuangjing did not have much experience in leading troops, it was obvious that he was speaking blatantly falsehoods; he must have ulterior motives.

The quartermaster then squinted his eyes, “I wonder, Lord Shuangjing, what advice do you have to offer?”

Shuangjing immediately clasped his hands and said, “How could I dare use the words ‘to impart wisdom’ when I am merely seeking your help, my lord? Please take action, for the sake of our great army and our Twin Rivers Nation, to rectify such a bad atmosphere!”

Saying that, he then handed over a storage bag to him.

The quartermaster took the storage bag, scanned its contents with his divine sense, and immediately a slight smile appeared on his face.

“Good!” the quartermaster waved his hand, “Lord Shuangjing, what you say is reasonable. For the sake of our army and the grand cause of our nation’s ruler, we, as his subjects, shall each do our part and serve with all our might. Such a bad atmosphere should be nipped in the bud; that is best.”

Shuangjing was overjoyed, and not at all surprised.

With his status, summoning the quartermaster to trouble a person of mixed human and demon blood —a minor cultivator who had just stepped into the officialdom of Twin Rivers Nation —was not difficult.

Immediately, Shuangjing stood up and said, “There is no better day than today; let my lord set out immediately to severely punish the Three Generals’ Camp!”

The quartermaster said, “That’s right. Although Liu, Guan, and Zhang have merits, they ultimately lack refinement and proper discipline. This time, let me properly teach them what the way of being an official is.”

Shuangjing then added, “The key figure in this matter is the military strategist of the Three Generals’ Camp, known as Ning Zhuo. It is he who designed and built the mechanical devices.”

The quartermaster then asked, “Who is this person?”

After Shuangjing explained, the quartermaster was relieved, “A mere Foundation Establishment minor cultivator, and also a person from Southern Bean Nation, ha ha.”

“Let’s go!”

“Let’s set out immediately; Lord Shuangjing, please have someone accompany us as a witness.”

Shuangjing hesitated immediately, “This…”

In the end, the quartermaster grabbed his arm forcefully and said, “We are going together, together!”

Shuangjing, with no choice, had to comply.

The quartermaster rallied a team of troops, and with fierce momentum, they arrived at the camp gate of the Three Generals’ Camp, but were blocked at the entrance.

Du Tiechuan ran his army strictly; the cost of violating military discipline was too high. The quartermaster dared not force his way in, so he ordered the soldiers of the Three Generals’ Camp to go quickly report.

The three generals —Liu, Guan, and Zhang —were training; upon hearing the commotion, they arranged their soldiers and immediately went to the camp gate.

The quartermaster, a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, upon seeing the Three Generals come to pay respects while riding his horse, arrogantly waved his hand and said, “Where is your camp’s military strategist? Have him come forth quickly to pay his respects to me.”

Liu Er immediately clasped his hands and said, “The military strategist is not in the camp; he is currently outside assessing the battlefield.”

The quartermaster immediately turned his head and looked at Shuangjing.

Shuangjing, cursing under his breath “old fox”, had no choice but to snort coldly and step forward, “Stop your nonsense —I dare say that Ning Zhuo is in the camp. This matter is of great importance; have him come immediately to be punished.”

Liu Er was rather astonished, and immediately stated that his side had been working diligently, fighting to the death, and had never been slack in cleaning up the battlefield, with achievements clearly evident —what wrong had they done that warranted punishment?

The quartermaster bluntly stated, “You secretly possess a powerful weapon that can efficiently clean the battlefield and contribute to the overall situation, which should be submitted, yet for your own selfish gains, you place the great army and the nation behind you.”

He further questioned, “Are you still the generals of Twin Rivers Nation?”

Before the Three Generals could retort, the quartermaster waved his hand, “People, come into the camp and bring that little military strategist over to me. He has too much nerve —not even coming to pay respects to me! Even if he is a foreigner, since he has joined our nation’s army, he should be subject to control.”

At his command, two Foundation Establishment cultivators immediately took orders and broke into the camp.

Zhang Hei glared, “You dare?!”

In the next moment, he directly took action, delivering two punches with a thumping sound, knocking the two Foundation Establishment soldiers down, who cried out in agony.

Such a sudden turn of events left Shuangjing astonished.

The quartermaster, in great anger, pointed his finger at Zhang Hei, “You black coal thief, how dare you be so rampant in front of me! If I have to personally deal with you, your punishment will be even greater.”

“Bah!” Zhang Hei spat in the direction of the quartermaster.

Shuangjing gasped, not expecting Zhang Hei to be so reckless.

“Oh dear,” Liu Er was greatly alarmed, opening his mouth to try to ease the situation.

But the quartermaster, enraged beyond measure, gave Liu Er no chance to smooth things over, and directly delivered a palm strike.

A palm imprint appeared out of thin air and shot straight toward Zhang Hei.

Liu Er shifted sideways, using his body to block.

“Pu.”

In the next moment, Zhang Hei was struck by the palm imprint and sent flying, spitting blood; after flying a considerable distance, he crashed to the ground.

The quartermaster was startled and immediately sensed that things were not good.

Then he heard a piercing, shrill voice say, “Good, such great official might!”

The quartermaster quickly turned around to look, his heart leaping; in his panic he forced a smile, “Lord Zhao, you have actually come!”

The one who arrived was none other than Inspector Zhao Xi.

Zhao Xi, very straightforward, directly waved his arm.

“Smack.”

Despite being a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, the quartermaster did not dare to shield himself in the slightest, and was forced to endure that slap.

He fell from his horse, his body staggering, nearly falling.

His cheeks quickly became red and swollen; his previous anger and arrogance had long completely vanished, replaced by fear and awe.

“Smack!”

Another slap followed.

The quartermaster’s cheeks became symmetrically red and swollen.

Inspector Zhao Xi pointed at the quartermaster and said, “Fortunately, I am here to supervise the army; otherwise, I would never have discovered a person like you —so willfully self-serving, exploiting public office for personal gain!”

“My lord, Lord Zhao, please allow me to explain.”

“Shut your mouth; you have no part in speaking here.”

“If you speak, your crime will be compounded!”

The quartermaster, in a panic, abruptly turned his head and looked at Shuangjing.

Zhao Xi also squinted his eyes and looked at Shuangjing.

Shuangjing’s face turned pale, unable to hide his panic; he quickly dismounted and bowed his head in greeting.

The quartermaster glared, staring fixedly at Shuangjing, his eyes filled with a mixture of anger and hatred.

Zhao Xi, meanwhile, squinted his eyes, snorted coldly, and waved his sleeve, signaling Shuangjing to leave.

Shuangjing took a deep breath, his steps seeming slow yet actually fast, and quickly left this place of disputes.

After he had gone far away, he then turned his head to look in the direction of the Three Generals’ Camp and gritted his teeth, “Well, well, Three Generals’ Camp— well, Ning Zhuo, so you were waiting here for me!”

He had completely understood by then.

This time, he intended to scheme against Ning Zhuo, but Ning Zhuo had long been prepared and had aligned himself with Inspector Zhao Xi.

Ning Zhuo and the others had set up a trap —in the end, Shuangjing, along with the quartermaster, fell headlong into it!
