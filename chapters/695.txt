Chapter 695: Thawing

Snow Pivot Guard Xie, still showing good manners, proactively greeted Ning Zhuo.

In contrast, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui remained motionless, staring blankly at Ning Zhuo.

As a precaution, Ning Zhuo had suspended Life Hanging by a Thread above both Mechanical Puppets.

After a thorough inspection, he confirmed that both puppets' spiritual energy was in the Spiritual Growth Stage.

Ning Zhuo mused, "Could it be that the small size of their vessels - the Floating Ice White Jade Hand and the Weather Orb: Ice Crystal Snow - limits the space for spiritual energy to develop?"

He pondered this silently.

His understanding of spiritual energy largely stemmed from the Treatise on Spiritual Existence. While invaluable, the book was concise, focusing primarily on the classification of spiritual energy stages.

"Perhaps I should start with the Myriad Manifestations Sect and see if they have methods for nurturing spiritual energy?"

Ning Zhuo made a mental note of this.

This was one of the benefits of joining a Super Sect. Many resources unavailable on the open market could be found here.

Of course, the All-Book Pavilion likely possessed similar knowledge on spiritual energy. However, as an outsider, acquiring such advanced Jade Slips would require a significantly higher price.

Besides, we're at the Myriad Manifestations Sect now, not the All-Book Pavilion.

A moment later.

In the training chamber, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Snow Pivot Guard Xie stood facing each other, with a massive block of ice between them.

Encased within the ice was an ape-like mechanism - the Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng.

"Begin," Ning Zhuo said from a distance, observing with his arms crossed.

Snow Pivot Guard Xie moved first.

The ice dragon beast heads on her shoulder armor glowed with icy light as they shot fiercely into the ice block.

Countless azure light threads rapidly spread through the ice, forming hexagonal patterns that interlocked into a three-dimensional grid.

Ning Zhuo understood: the denser the grid, the deeper Snow Pivot Guard Xie's control over the ice.

The hexagonal grid was merely a manifestation; the true source of her power lay in her Innate Talent - Snow Soul Ice Essence!

This talent granted its possessor a soul unlike ordinary mortals. Even without practicing Soul Cultivation, they could project their soul from their physical body and wield a degree of icy power.

Moreover, if their soul were injured, they could accelerate its healing by drawing upon the ice and snow.

The drawback was that the Soul's foundation would grow increasingly powerful, eventually overwhelming the Physical Body. In the early stages, this could lead to chronic frostbite. As the Cultivator's cultivation level advanced, the disparity between Soul and Physical Body would only widen.

By the mid to late stages, the Cultivator's Physical Body would freeze to death, leaving only the Soul to persist.

Once a Cultivator possessed the Snow Soul Ice Essence Innate Talent, they would inevitably become a Ghost Cultivator.

This was a low-grade Innate Talent.

The ice encasing the Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng had been largely permeated by the hexagonal grid.

But soon, Snow Pivot Guard Xie's power reached its limit. Just as the hexagonal grid was about to touch the Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng, it abruptly halted. No matter how she urged her Innate Talent, she couldn't reach Yuan Dasheng's body.

Snow Pivot Guard Xie initiated her next move.

The azure three-dimensional grid, infused with spiritual energy, blazed with intensified brilliance.

Crack... crack...

A series of crisp cracking sounds echoed as fissures spiderwebbed across the ice's surface. Then, countless ice shards, glittering like billions of tiny diamonds, scattered in a dazzling shower.

The ice encasing the Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng rapidly diminished at a rate visible to the naked eye.

After Snow Pivot Guard Xie exerted her full power, only a thin layer of ice remained encasing Yuan Dasheng.

Yet this final layer proved stubbornly resistant. No matter how she manipulated her techniques, it remained unyielding, not diminishing by even a fraction.

Seeing this, Ning Zhuo decisively ordered Snow-Colored Maiden Hui to join the effort.

Three pairs of jade arms unfurled, and the graceful female mechanism slowly levitated. Their Innate Talent, the Ice Jade Hand, began to manifest, their tricolored cloisonné armor radiating a dazzling brilliance.

With the two puppets working in tandem, a breakthrough was immediately achieved.

The thin layer of ice encasing Yuan Dasheng rapidly melted away like snow under the scorching sun.

The dark Yin Qi scattered in all directions, but Ning Zhuo swiftly gathered it all, preventing it from interfering with the subsequent thawing and rescue operations.

Inside the Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng, the internal mechanisms were all frozen solid, packed with ice.

This ice was even darker in color, clearly containing a higher concentration of Yin-attribute Qi.

Despite Snow Pivot Guard Xie and Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's combined efforts, they managed to dissolve only about a third of this ice.

The remaining seventy percent remained stubbornly in place, proving remarkably resilient.

Divine Art: Life Hanging by a Thread!

Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up with a hint of joy.

Unlike before, Life Hanging by a Thread had finally established a connection with Yuan Dasheng's spiritual energy.

His spiritual energy had shrunk into a frozen ball, unresponsive to Ning Zhuo's calls. Extracting it with Life Hanging by a Thread was out of the question.

Ning Zhuo sighed softly.

This was the limit.

Achieving even this much was remarkable.

After all, both Mechanical Puppets were crafted from Golden Core-level materials and possessed Golden Core-level combat power. They were simply no match for the life-or-death techniques of a Nascent Soul-level cultivator.

Fortunately, Ning Zhuo had anticipated this situation.

He instructed Snow-Colored Maiden Hui to continue using the Ice Jade Hand.

But this time, instead of thawing the ice, the Ice Jade Hand reinforced it.

New ice encased Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng, almost restoring him to his previous frozen state. However, this ice now pulsed with hidden vitality, continuously nourishing Yuan Dasheng's spiritual energy.

Ning Zhuo carefully observed through Life Hanging by a Thread, confirming that Yuan Dasheng's spiritual energy could barely sustain itself. Only then did he slightly ease his worries.

"The Ice Jade Hand and Snow Soul Ice Essence are both Innate Talents, essentially embryonic forms of Divine Arts."

"Even when these two Innate Talents combine their efforts, they can't completely thaw the ice. We'll have to find another way."

Ning Zhuo had already devised several potential methods.

For instance, he could construct a new mechanical body using Nascent Soul-level materials, allowing them to unleash Nascent Soul-level combat power. This should resolve Yuan Dasheng's predicament.

However, Ning Zhuo's mastery of Mechanical Arts fell short of this level.

The methods existed, but Ning Zhuo's lack of ability was his greatest frustration.

Ning Zhuo then retrieved the Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu and instructed the two Mechanical Puppets to attempt a solution.

This attempt proved even less effective than Yuan Dasheng's case.

The problem with the Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu differed from that of the Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng. The latter was frozen, while the former was covered in dust.

Even when Ning Zhuo's Life Hanging by a Thread technique was applied to the Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu, it failed to establish a connection with its spiritual energy.

In the end, Ning Zhuo reluctantly ordered Snow-Colored Maiden Hui to freeze the Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu in a block of ice as well.

"I hope this sealing will also support Meng Yehu's spiritual energy!"

Ning Zhuo stored Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu away and continued his cultivation.

Apart from his Physical Body, he focused on comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art. Among his Three Dantian, the Lower Dantian, the Essence Sea, lagged behind the most, progressing at the slowest pace.

Controlling Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Snow Pivot Guard Xie also became part of Ning Zhuo's cultivation regimen.

He discovered that manipulating these Puppets helped their spiritual energies more skillfully control their bodies.

Simultaneously, through these interactions, Ning Zhuo gained a deeper understanding of Mechanical Puppets, laying a practical foundation for future improvements.

Ning Zhuo didn't forget about making money either.

The lack of sufficient Spirit Stone reserves left him feeling uneasy.

As for how to acquire funds, Ning Zhuo had plenty of methods. He chose the fastest approach: aggressively selling Ghost Path Golden Cores!

However, he avoided selling them within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

That would be too conspicuous, easily revealing Ning Zhuo's true strength and causing others to overestimate and scrutinize him.

After all, the Myriad Manifestations Sect was overseen by a Soul Formation-level expert.

Ning Zhuo chose his old friends as the recipients of the Ghost Path Golden Cores.

These included Zhu Xuanji of the Southern Bean Kingdom, the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, General Mu's Manor, and the Three Generals Camp of the Two Note Kingdom. The White Paper Immortal City, however, was excluded from the distribution.

"Though the distance is vast, its secrecy is its greatest advantage."

"Even though I can't leave the Myriad Manifestations Sect due to other commitments, I can have representatives from the Southern Bean Kingdom and Two Note Kingdom come here to conduct the transactions!"

For such a large-scale deal, having his old friends act as merchants was perfectly reasonable!

"When trading with the Southern Bean Royal Family and the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, I'll also have them bring the Spirit Hidden Willow."

"It's been quite some time now. That spirit plant should have recovered by now, right?"

Southern Bean Kingdom.

Zhu Xuanji sat at his desk, immersed in official duties.

A knock came at the door.

"Enter," Zhu Xuanji said without looking up, his hand still moving across the parchment.

A subordinate knelt on the ground, his voice raspy as gravel grinding against stone beneath his mask. "Reporting, Your Excellency, the ambush was successful. Of the seven attackers, six were killed and one captured. Interrogation of the prisoner confirmed they were cultivators from the Soul Devouring Sect."

The subordinate presented an identity token and a Jade Slip with both hands.

Zhu Xuanji slowly raised his head, extended his hand, and summoned a gravitational force that drew the evidence - the waist pendant and Jade Slip - onto the table.

Instead of examining the waist pendant, Zhu Xuanji picked up the Jade Slip and infused it with a portion of his divine sense.

The Jade Slip contained a recording of the ambush.

In an unnamed canyon, crossbow bolts rained down like a storm, tearing through the night sky and catching the Soul Devouring Sect cultivators completely off guard. Within the first wave of the assault, three of them were critically wounded.

The Soul Devouring Sect cultivators retaliated, their black robes billowing like a swarm of bats as they counterattacked.

Ning Jiufan led the charge, his disguised Divine Constable Bureau cultivators engaging the enemy fiercely. Thanks to their thorough preparations, no one died, and they completely subdued the Soul Devouring Sect's small team.

"The Soul Devouring Sect..." Zhu Xuanji tapped his finger against the table, his doubts lingering.

He had been closely monitoring the Ning Clan of Fire Persimmon Immortal City for some time.

On one hand, the Ning Clan, the Royal Family of Southern Bean, and the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect formed a secret alliance. On the other hand, if Zhu Xuanji wanted to prevent Fire Persimmon Immortal City and Lava Immortal Palace from falling into the Meng Clan's hands, he needed to rely on the Ning Clan to counter the Meng Clan's aggressive expansion.

It was precisely because of this close observation that Zhu Xuanji had previously detected someone secretly infiltrating the area to gather intelligence on the Ning Clan, Ning Zhuo, and related matters.

Zhu Xuanji initially suppressed his suspicions, then secretly investigated and discovered that the force probing the Ning Clan and Ning Zhuo's information was none other than the Soul Devouring Sect, one of the super sects.

"Han Ming and Qi Bai both lost to Ning Zhuo... But that alone shouldn't warrant such a massive mobilization from the Soul Devouring Sect, right?" he mused.

"This time, the cultivator team targeting the Ning Clan includes five Golden Core cultivators!"

"Since they're gathering intelligence on Ning Zhuo, it seems our Child of Tribulation has inflicted even greater losses on the Soul Devouring Sect!"

Thinking of Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji couldn't help but grumble inwardly, "That brat! He's already gone, yet he's still causing trouble, forcing me to clean up his messes."

"Fortunately, he's already reached White Paper Immortal City, which is separated from our kingdom by the North Wind Kingdom and the Two Note Kingdom."

The intelligence networks of cultivation nations were naturally extensive. It was no surprise that the Southern Bean Kingdom's intelligence tentacles reached even the Ghostly Black Marshlands.

Otherwise, Zhu Xuanji wouldn't have been able to guide Ning Zhuo to seek out the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer in White Paper Immortal City in the first place.

"That brat owes me a big favor this time," Zhu Xuanji thought, just as he suddenly sneezed.

A sense of unease stirred within him.

"What? Why would I want to think about him? Better not to think about him at all."

"The Child of Tribulation... I should stay far away from him. The farther, the safer."

"Someone in the Soul Devouring Sect must have gotten too close. Look what happened to them!"

Soul Devouring Sect

Around the White Bone Altar, soul mist swirled and churned endlessly.

A Flying Message hovered at the edge of the mist, not daring to venture deeper.

On the Sacrificial Altar, Heavenly Ghost and Earthly Ghost sensed the Flying Message and slowly ceased their movements. Both Soul Cultivators wore expressions of exhaustion.

Heavenly Ghost waved his sleeve, parting the soul mist to create a clear path.

The Flying Message shot through the temporary passage and landed before the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts.

The two probed the message with their divine sense, their faces darkening.

"What?! A team of five Golden Core and two Foundation Establishment elites... completely wiped out?!"

"How is that possible?"

They were stunned, completely unprepared for such a development.

They had suffered a major setback at Ning Zhuo's hands during the Thousand Peaks Forest battle in the Two Note Kingdom.

The Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts had missed the second major battle. After regrouping, they launched their revenge operation.

But by then, Ning Zhuo had already left the Two Note Kingdom.

Because they were using the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon to traverse the Void, the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts lost track of Ning Zhuo almost as soon as they began their pursuit.

For the next period, they actively gathered intelligence, posted missions within the Soul Devouring Sect, and enlisted others to join the search.

Unfortunately, the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts never managed to find Ning Zhuo.

This drove Heavenly Ghost into a frenzy!

In their previous battle, Heavenly Ghost had suffered a crushing defeat. Not only had he forfeited nearly his entire fortune to Ning Zhuo, but he had also lost face before his longtime partner, Earthly Ghost.

What could they do if they couldn't find Ning Zhuo?

After consulting, the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts devised a plan: they would return to the Soul Devouring Sect's main mountain gate and use the White Bone Altar there to divine the Heavenly Ghost Ghost Mask's location.

Once Ning Zhuo used the Heavenly Ghost Ghost Mask, the divination would activate, revealing his exact whereabouts.

The Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts guarded the White Bone Altar, taking turns presiding over it day and night, maintaining the ritual at great cost.

Yet the Heavenly Ghost Ghost Mask remained silent.

"This is impossible!"

"The Heavenly Ghost Ghost Mask possesses Nascent Soul-level combat power. That brat Ning Zhuo can't possibly be avoiding using it forever, can he?"

Clinging to this belief, the pair stubbornly maintained the ritual for over a month, exhausting themselves to the brink of collapse.

Unable to sustain their efforts any longer, the two conspirators decided to offer a substantial reward and issue a mission, tasking their fellow sect members with attacking the Ning Clan to force Ning Zhuo to reveal himself.

Little did they know that the Ning Clan was backed by the Royal Family of the Southern Bean Kingdom.

The cultivator team they had placed their hopes on was completely annihilated!
