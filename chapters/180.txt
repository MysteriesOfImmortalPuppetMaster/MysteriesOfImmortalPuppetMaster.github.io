Chapter 180: Golden Core Enters the Fray

It was the Zhou Family's turn.  

The Zhou Family Patriarch appeared, "Our family rose to prominence with a Spirit Gathering Formation. As everyone knows, this formation birthed a Formation Spirit."  

"The Spirit Gathering Formation can consume some of its own spirituality to cast spells and enhance soul bodies."  

"With this spell, cultivators can automatically absorb external spiritual energy, convert it into personal mana, and reduce the various costs of spellcasting."  

The Zheng Family presented the Ghost Weapon Cultivation Art, the Zhou Family activated the Spirit Gathering Formation Spirit, and the Ning Family brought out the Foundation Establishment Ghost Cultivator Ning Xie, who possessed the innate talent of Snow Soul Ice Essence!  

Ning Zhuo's mood grew increasingly solemn.  

These were the foundations of each family, all grand gestures.

Usually kept hidden, they were now brought out for use.  

Ning Zhuo thought of what the Ning Family Patriarch had said, "This concerns the Golden Core Patriarch," making the actions of the three families seem reasonable.  

"Alright, you continue your discussions; we won't delay you." The Zhou Family Patriarch waved his hand and left the secret chamber.  

The Ning Family Patriarch followed suit.  

Ning Xie remained floating in mid-air, arms crossed, staring coldly at Ning Zhuo.  

Ning Zhuo acted as if he couldn't feel it, treating Ning Xie like air, which made Ning Xie quite frustrated.  

Zheng Hua continued, "These five jade slips record all the materials, spirit stones, and mechanical components we've gathered."  

"Because it's extremely difficult to bring items into the Lava Immortal Palace, the resources we can use in this battle are limited to these."  

Ning Xie of the Ning Family was the greatest achievement of the three families' joint research into the Lava Immortal Palace, attempting to bring items inside.  

In fact, each family had hidden ghost cultivators as part of their foundations.  

Only Ning Xie succeeded because of his innate talent, which formed a mysterious synergy with NIng Xiaohui's talent.  

Ning Zhuo placed the jade slip on his forehead, and after examining it, his mood grew even more solemn.  

The contents of the jade slip were very detailed.

Just the spirit stones were calculated meticulously.  

It tallied the number of explorers and assumed that everyone chose the spirit stone reward, calculating the maximum number of spirit stones the entire exploration team could obtain.  

If no one chose the reward, it also calculated the minimum amount of spirit stones.  

It divided the stages into thirty percent, fifty percent, seventy percent, and ninety percent, each with detailed spirit stone numbers.  

The same applied to mechanical components like the Hanging Ring and the Small Flying Box.  

The resources that could be purchased in the preparation room using spirit stones, the duration of each crafting tool, were all calculated with extreme precision.  

Moreover, the jade slip listed over a dozen mechanical constructs, categorized in detail.  

Zheng Hua explained timely, "These are the mechanical constructs we've selected after discussions among the three families."  

"Their functions and capabilities are detailed, and the materials and spirit stones required to construct them are meticulously calculated."  

"If anyone has good ideas for mechanical constructs, feel free to propose them for further discussion."  

Ning Zhuo remained silent.  

Zhou Zeshen looked at Ning Zhuo, not letting him off, smiling sincerely, "Brother Ning, you must have noticed that most of these mechanical constructs come from my sect, the Mudflow Sect."  

"The Mudflow Sect excels in terrain-altering mechanisms, which is also the sect's main livelihood."  

"The Ground Drilling Mouse is used to soften mountains and create tunnels, the Night Sky Bat for terrain detection and 3D mapping, the White Tiger Assault Chariot for large tunnel excavation, and the Mud Gate Earth Hammer for breaking boulders and solidifying foundations."  

"Brother Ning's talent in mechanisms is well-known. Your designs, the Mechanical Fire Monkey and the Fire Bamboo Snake, are also excellent in combat."  

"Therefore, your suggestions are very important!"  

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly, "I will do my utmost, but these mechanisms need careful study before I can give my opinion. This matter is too important to speak carelessly."  

"Hahaha." Zhou Zeshen laughed, "Then we await Brother Ning's high opinion."  

Zheng Hua continued, "Next, I'll introduce the battle tactics we've prepared jointly."  

"The first is the Zhou Family's battle formation."  

After the discussion, Ning Zhuo returned to his private room.  

Along the way, his brows were tightly knit, his mood heavy.  

"Preparation room, mature tactics, the foundations of the three families," Ning Zhuo pondered, feeling the immense pressure.  

His previous assumptions were correct; the three families indeed relied on the preparation room's functions.  

But it wasn't entirely correct.  

Whether it was the joint battle tactics or the foundations brought out by the three families, they were almost all unexpected.  

"The secret concerning the Golden Core Patriarch" made it even harder for him to guess what was happening at the higher levels.  

"The three families united... strength in numbers." Ning Zhuo deeply felt the advantage of numbers.  

Even if none of them made it to the rankings to receive abundant spirit stone rewards, the rewards from the sheer number of people alone were already substantial.  

The three families united all their resources, meticulously calculating and optimizing the best combinations.  

They fully tapped into their combat potential.  

Now, Ning Zhuo's greatest relief was that the exploration route of soul entering the Immortal Palace prohibited external items.  

This was a significant layer of protection for Ning Zhuo.  

If external items were allowed, the combined power of the three families would be even more terrifying!  

Ning Zhuo took out the Floating Cloud Cloak, immersed himself in the floating clouds, and then entered the Immortal Palace.  

Sun Lingtong had been waiting for him.  

Ning Zhuo conveyed the latest information, making Sun Lingtong's mood equally heavy, "The enemy is so strong. It seems we must let Cheng Bai join the battle to have a chance at victory."  

Ning Zhuo sighed, "Relying solely on Yuan Dasheng is indeed difficult."  

"But we can't be too aggressive. If it doesn't work out, I won't take the formation this time."  

"We must guard against the Soul Devouring Sect's hidden moves."  

Sun Lingtong nodded, "Don't worry, I have a plan!"  

Sun Lingtong's soul returned to his body.

Looking at Cheng Bai's storage bag in front of him, his brows furrowed, his face resolute.  

He had already made up his mind, "Little Zhuo is determined to seize the Lava Immortal Palace."  

"This goal is not just a major opportunity in his life but also his mother's last wish, a task he must complete!"  

"This is of great significance to him!"  

"He speaks lightly, thinking I don't know? If he doesn't take the formation, the three families will advance unimpeded, possibly arousing their suspicion."  

"As his elder, if I don't support him now, when will I?"  

Sun Lingtong was slowly breaking Cheng Bai's storage bag, progressing slowly but steadily.  

"Time is limited; I need to take some risks!"  

As a member of the demonic faction, Sun Lingtong never lacked the spirit of adventure.

During the Qi Refining Stage, he had stolen treasures from the Foundation Establishment Stage, had been caught stealing, and had been imprisoned and tortured by his gang.  

He didn't have to take risks; he enjoyed the thrill, the excitement of stealing and other stimulating activities that made him feel physically and mentally refreshed and happy.  

"Let's do it!" Sun Lingtong puffed up his cheeks, mustering all his strength, and cast a spell.  

Soon, Cheng Bai's storage bag was opened, and a wisp of black-gray smoke floated into the air.  

Sun Lingtong's eyes were quick, and he extinguished the smoke before it drifted away!  

"Good!"  

"My calculations were correct; there were no other defensive measures. Hahaha, I got a Golden Core cultivator's storage bag!" Sun Lingtong immediately checked, finding Cheng Bai's storage bag filled with valuable items.  

There were seven Magical Artifacts alone.  

The cultivation resources were almost all closely related to soul cultivation.  

The unrelated materials were all Golden Core level.

Such materials were not easy to sell and required suitable auctions or trading partners.  

So, they had accumulated in Cheng Bai's hands.  

The most valuable were some of Cheng Bai's personal items.  

"These are all excellent fuel for the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra." Sun Lingtong beamed with joy.  

Ning Zhuo had already passed the relevant sutra to Sun Lingtong.  

Therefore, during Ning Zhuo's special training, Sun Lingtong could also refine items on his own, adding spirituality to Cheng Bai.  

In the darkness, two ghost fires suddenly lit up.  

Upon closer inspection, the ghost fires were actually the eyes of a cultivator.  

Luo Shang!  

A true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect, tasked with finding and avenging the true culprit behind Cheng Bai's death.  

He had long since infiltrated Fire Persimmon Immortal City, avoiding attention and hiding his identity.  

"The two Soul Devouring Sect disciples in the City Lord's dungeon were just bait and traps."  

"Why has Han Ming been missing and out of contact?"  

"To this day, she hasn't responded to my secret transmissions."  

"Hmm?!"  

At this moment, Luo Shang sensed Cheng Bai's aura.  

He had been using the sect's secret technique.  

"It's in that direction... inside the mountain!"  

The ghost fire vanished, and Luo Shang immediately moved.  

Not long after he disappeared, a female cultivator appeared.  

Her face was like a peach blossom, her figure tall and graceful.

She was Yang Chanyu of the Void Sect.  

Yang Chanyu had been mingling in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, constantly changing her appearance and wandering around, mainly to find Sun Lingtong.  

In the sect, Sun Lingtong's soul tablet showed no abnormalities.  

Although the black market had been raided and Sun Lingtong was wanted, Yang Chanyu was convinced that Sun Lingtong was still in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  

"Where is that little rascal hiding?"  

"I left secret signals, but none were triggered."  

"Hmph, he's deliberately avoiding me!"  

Yang Chanyu couldn't find Sun Lingtong but unexpectedly discovered Luo Shang.  

The moment Luo Shang made a move, Yang Chanyu sensed it.

After some thought, she decided to follow him secretly to see what Luo Shang had discovered.  

Luo Shang cautiously found a gap in the Immortal City Grand Formation, circled around, and found the secret base inside the mountain.  

However, when he entered the secret base, Sun Lingtong had already left.  

Sun Lingtong had gone to another underground base to replenish Cheng Bai's spirituality.  

Luo Shang thought for a moment and decided to wait for Sun Lingtong to return, planning to catch him off guard!  

"A secret underground base... wait, it's Sun Lingtong's aura. Hmph, you little brat, I've finally found you." Yang Chanyu snorted coldly and also hid herself.  

Meanwhile, in another secret chamber.  

Zhu Xuanji gathered the Golden Core Patriarchs of the three families for a second secret discussion.  

In the first discussion, Zhu Xuanji proposed cooperation.

He wanted the Golden Core Patriarchs of the three families to assist him fully, combining their forces to invade Fire Persimmon Mountain and directly attack the Demon Ape's lair to seize the Demon General's corpse!  

This action was highly risky, even for Golden Core cultivators, who could face death.

But if six Golden Core cultivators worked together sincerely, there was a significant chance of success.  

The key was the high reward!  

Part of it was the rich spoils from destroying the Demon Ape's lair, and the other part was the generous remuneration Zhu Xuanji offered to the Golden Core cultivators for their assistance.  

The remuneration was very tempting.  

Therefore, the Golden Core cultivators of the three families were hesitant.  

Zhu Xuanji asked with a smile, "Fellow Daoists, have you made your decision?"  

Zheng Shuangou was the first to speak, "Our side can send two people, but... the price must go up!"
