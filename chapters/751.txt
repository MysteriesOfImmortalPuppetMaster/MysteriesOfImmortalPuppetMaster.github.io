Chapter 751: A Genius of Practical Combat

"This is bad, very bad!" Another cultivator shared Ban Ji's unease.

Concealing his appearance and identity, he had maintained a low profile, observing from the sidelines.

But now, he knew he couldn't remain hidden any longer.

He stepped forward and approached Ban Ji. "Young Master Ban Ji, I'm here to assist you!"

Revealing his true face, he deliberately raised his voice to draw everyone's attention.

Ban Ji was taken aback. He glanced at the newcomer and recognized an old acquaintance, letting out a cold snort. "What are you doing here?"

The newcomer was none other than the Rust Disaster Artisan.

He was clad in a dark crimson iron robe, beneath which the faint outline of a metallic skeleton-like structure could be discerned. Every movement produced a dull grinding of metal, accompanied by the occasional rust flakes falling with a soft rustle.

The Rust Disaster Artisan transmitted his thoughts through divine sense, his tone brusque. "Hmph! If Ban Jie hadn't offered me a fortune to secretly assist you, do you think I'd be here? To look at your ugly face?"

Previously, the Rust Disaster Artisan had accepted Ban Ji's generous payment to deal with Ning Zhuo. However, Ning Zhuo's high-profile actions had revealed his formidable strength. Coupled with Lady Spiderweb's disappearance, the Rust Disaster Artisan had promptly joined forces with two others to find Ban Ji, forcibly return the payment, and withdraw from the scheme.

Ban Ji naturally glared at the Rust Disaster Artisan.

The Rust Disaster Artisan continued communicating through divine sense: "Did you think I wanted to step forward and publicly support you? Control your temper. Do you still think you're in the Ban Clan?"

"If you keep acting like this, you'll end up being targeted by everyone again."

"Remember what happened on Green Bamboo Peak!"

Ban Ji gritted his teeth. "That time, I was just careless."

Rust Disaster Artisan: "Don't say I didn't warn you!"

Ban Ji narrowed his eyes and fell silent.

After a few breaths, he strode over to Lu Zeng and thanked him. After all, Lu Zeng had just given him a Jade Token.

Lu Zeng, being a businessman, naturally wouldn't offend Ban Ji.

Encouraged by the warm reception, Ban Ji then visited Ao Pan. Ao Pan treated him with the same enthusiasm he had shown Ning Zhuo.

As a foreigner, Ao Pan needed to cultivate broad connections. Since Ban Ji had taken the initiative to visit, he was eager to establish good relations with Ban Ji and the Ban Clan.

Why can't I be friendly with both sides? he thought. Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji may be at odds, but that doesn't stop me from getting along with both of them!

Ao Pan then visited Tie Zheng, who responded with equal coldness.

Finally, he visited Zhang Wangxing. The two exchanged divine sense messages, frequently glancing at Ning Zhuo, as if conducting a transaction or negotiation.

Ning Zhuo had been observing Ban Ji closely. Seeing his actions, he understood immediately: "Ban Ji was groomed by the Ban Clan from childhood and possesses political acumen. His choice of conversation partners is strategic, and his approach is perfectly sequenced."

By leveraging the attitudes of Lu Ban and Ao Pan, Ban Ji broke the deadlock. Soon, many cultivators began approaching him to strike up conversations.

After all, Ban Ji represented the Ban Clan.

The Ban Clan was not only a renowned orthodox sect, but the Myriad Manifestations Sect had always welcomed cultivators from both righteous and demonic paths. As long as such cultivators adhered to the sect's rules after joining, they were accepted.

The Myriad Manifestations Sect's rules were among the fewest and most lenient of any Super Sect.

Though Ning Zhuo had forced Ban Ji into action, the latter still possessed considerable skill. Learning from his initial setback, he skillfully dismantled much of Ning Zhuo's momentum, turning what had been a crushing defeat into a narrow loss.

A Golden Core-level cultivator emerged from the Profound Armor Cave and announced that the appointed time had arrived, officially commencing the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

With permission granted, the participants displayed their identity tokens and surged into the cave.

Nearly all the tokens were wooden, except for the stone tokens held by Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji.

The moment Ning Zhuo stepped into the cave, his vision abruptly shifted.

He found himself in complete darkness, surrounded by invisible barriers. It was as if the air itself had solidified into walls, sealing him within.

Ning Zhuo remained calm. Before entering, he had memorized all the information about the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.

Like the Demon Subjugation Hall's trials, the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's Rising Cloud Minor Trial remained virtually unchanged.

True to form, a divine sense emanated from the darkness, instructing Ning Zhuo to use his own divine sense to clear a path.

Ning Zhuo activated his divine sense, extending it forward as far as possible.

The divine sense seemed to push aside a layer of grime, leaving a gap roughly his size.

He strode forward, his divine sense continuously clearing a temporary tunnel ahead, allowing him to advance.

"This is the first stage of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's Minor Trial: the Divine Sense Gate."

"Without sufficient divine sense, you cannot pass."

Ao Pan walked with a hunched back but moved with the majestic gait of a dragon and the fierce stride of a tiger.

Tie Zheng crossed his arms, his expression impassive, his posture relaxed.

Lu Zeng stroked the ruler hanging from his chest, his divine sense swirling around him, continuously expanding to create a spherical void around him.

This stage didn't restrict cultivation levels, so Golden Core cultivators could pass easily. After all, their higher cultivation meant superior divine sense, spiritual energy, and stamina compared to Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators.

For the Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators, it was time to demonstrate their individual abilities.

Zhang Wangxing's robes rippled like waves as he moved forward at a snail's pace.

Ban Ji's eyes burned crimson as he glared ahead. Having cultivated the Greedy Mechanism Demonic Heart Art, which primarily focuses on the Upper Dantian, his divine sense was among the most formidable in the Foundation Establishment Stage, allowing him to navigate the darkness without difficulty.

Ning Zhuo, however, had made no special preparations for this challenge. This was because he cultivated all Three Dantian simultaneously. His mastery of the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual had endowed him with a divine sense foundation far surpassing that of cultivators who focused solely on the Qi Sea or Essence Sea.

Unlike Ban Ji's raw power, Ning Zhuo's strength lay in control. He precisely projected his divine sense, carving out a passage just wide enough for his body, conserving both time and energy.

Zhang Dadan remained silent. As a cultivator primarily focused on the Essence Sea, his divine sense had been tempered by secret techniques, making it resilient and difficult to disperse, though maintaining it for self-preservation posed no problem.

The Rust Disaster Artisan's divine sense was particularly unique. As he carved a path forward, it crackled and hissed, corroding the invisible barriers with ease, albeit at a slower pace.

Almost all the cultivators participating in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial had gathered intelligence beforehand. Even those who hadn't were informed of the relevant details through divine sense transmissions.

Each cultivator employed their unique methods, steadily advancing through the darkness.

The surrounding void was utterly devoid of reference points, yet none worried about losing their way.

The rules explicitly stated that even moving in circles was acceptable. As long as they persisted for the required duration and covered the minimum distance, they would advance to the next stage.

Among the three Golden Core cultivators, Tie Zheng was the first to break free and enter the second trial.

His divine sense, honed by secret techniques, was exceptionally sharp.

Lu Ban and Ao Pan followed soon after.

Among the Foundation Establishment cultivators, Ban Ji was the first to arrive, followed by Ning Zhuo. Zhang Wangxing, at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage, lagged behind; his divine sense was his weakest point. Even Zhang Dadan managed to pass through faster.

Ning Zhuo's vision suddenly brightened, and he found himself in a spherical space.

This was still part of the array's inner realm, but the structure was different.

Before him floated a Bronze Sword, its tip pointing straight down.

A telepathic message conveyed the rules: the second trial's rules were identical to the first, unchanged in any way.

The telepathic countdown began.

From ten to one, the floating Bronze Sword suddenly moved as if wielded by a person, lunging at Ning Zhuo.

The sword tip pierced the air with a sharp, piercing whistle, aimed directly at Ning Zhuo's throat.

Ning Zhuo's pupils constricted as his body snapped backward like a drawn bowstring, executing a perfect iron bridge.

The icy sword wind grazed his nose, severing a few stray strands of hair.

Missing its target, the Bronze Sword didn't falter. With a tremor, it seamlessly transitioned from a thrust to a slash, arcing horizontally toward Ning Zhuo's exposed neck as he leaned back.

The sword blade sliced through the air with razor-sharp precision, emitting a hissing sound like tearing silk.

Ning Zhuo twisted his body.

His physical foundation was exceptionally strong. Even in such an awkward posture, he forcibly rotated his torso, shifting his entire body to the side.

Shriiiick...

The sword's edge sliced through Ning Zhuo's collar, leaving a clean cut. A thin line of blood appeared on his neck, but after a few drops seeped out, his muscles tightened, stopping the bleeding.

Though just a graze, the burning pain was intense.

Still sideways and retreating, Ning Zhuo hadn't yet regained his balance when the Bronze Sword struck again.

This time, the sword swept upward in a rising slash, its blade flashing like a viper's tongue - devious and precise, aiming for Ning Zhuo's unsteady lower body.

Ning Zhuo's eyes narrowed. He stomped his left foot into the ground, using the momentum to spring backward while simultaneously striking downward with his right palm.

He had no intention of clashing directly with the blade. Instead, he angled the edge of his palm to strike the sword's spine mid-length, executing the strike with perfect speed, angle, and force.

The Bronze Sword was knocked downward, slamming into the ground. Ning Zhuo followed through with a powerful forward stomp, but missed.

The Bronze Sword recoiled to avoid Ning Zhuo's foot, then immediately thrust forward.

Ning Zhuo adjusted his posture at the critical moment, but the outer thigh of his left leg was still slashed, adding another bloody gash to his injuries.

Unable to subdue Ning Zhuo, the Bronze Sword shifted its tactics. Its swordplay transformed into an endless, surging torrent, like a river's relentless flow.

Thrusts, slashes, parries, sweeps, chops, cleaves... the sword executed these fundamental techniques to their absolute limit, moving so swiftly that dozens of shimmering green afterimages trailed through the air, weaving into a lethal net that relentlessly enveloped Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's figure twisted and turned within this storm of death, like a lone boat tossed about in a raging sea. Sweat mingled with blood trickled down his skin, leaving damp streaks across his body.

Sizz! A cold sensation brushed his left cheek as a strand of hair and a bead of blood flew into the air. The sword's tip had grazed his cheekbone.

Pfft! The coarse cloth over his right ribs tore open, flesh curling back as crimson blood instantly stained his garment.

Clang! Unable to evade, Ning Zhuo could only block an angled slash with the outer forearm of his left arm. Agony shot through his arm bone, his sleeve shredded, and a deep, bone-deep wound gaped open, dripping blood.

Though surrounded by mortal peril and constantly accumulating injuries, Ning Zhuo's eyes burned brighter with each passing moment.

This level of difficulty was exactly what he had anticipated, holding no surprises.

"My close combat and martial arts skills were only honed to a basic level in Fire Persimmon Immortal City."

It was at the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect that I truly compensated for this deficiency.

"The great battle in the Thousand Peaks Forest of the Two Note Kingdom taught me simple, direct military combat methods, adding to my courage and ferocity."

"My usual combat skills are sufficient for dealing with peers, but they're woefully inadequate for the Rising Cloud Minor Trial within the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor."

"The difficulty of the second trial increases gradually. The first weapon I faced was the least challenging, yet it still pushed me slightly beyond my limits."

Ning Zhuo's close-quarters combat skills were no longer a weakness, but they had never been a strength either.

The second trial of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor was designed to filter out cultivators skilled in martial techniques, eliminating those who were merely average.

Faced with this trial, Ning Zhuo found himself suppressed and sealed by the formation, unable to draw upon his other abilities. Forced to rely solely on his martial skills, he teetered on the brink of disaster, his movements desperate and clumsy.

An ordinary cultivator would have long since been critically injured and eliminated.

Ning Zhuo's endurance was largely due to his formidable physical body. Capable of housing the souls of a million people, his body could rapidly heal minor wounds.

His persistence wasn't futile. In the heat of battle, his martial skills improved rapidly.

Initially, his footwork consisted solely of evasive maneuvers, but now it gradually gained structure and rhythm.

At times, he moved like stepping across constellations, his small, nimble steps allowing him to evade razor-sharp strikes. At others, he moved like wading through mud, his movements sluggish yet narrowly avoiding the sword's edge. At times, he spun like a whirlwind, his afterimages intertwining with the sword's light, blurring the line between them, yet without sustaining any new cuts.

"Review complete!" Ning Zhuo's heart surged with exhilaration.

He had used the Soul-Searching Art to deliver righteous judgment upon a horde of Demonic Path souls. His Innate Talent protected him, while the Burning Boat Soul-Crossing Art had dramatically increased his foundation.

Among these Demonic Path cultivators were many masters of close combat. Their accumulated lifetime of experience had become part of Ning Zhuo's foundation.

However, Ning Zhuo had lacked the time to practice. Now, in the heat of battle against the Bronze Sword, he rapidly reviewed and mastered these techniques, truly making them his own.

As the battle raged on, Ning Zhuo's stance grew steadier, his movements more composed.

His most severe injury was on his left forearm, but his physical body was remarkably resilient. Even with a deep, bone-revealing wound, the bleeding had stopped despite the intense exertion, and the healing process had already begun.

This was partly because the Bronze Sword itself lacked any spiritual energy, relying solely on its razor-sharp edge.

This trial tested martial skill and close combat prowess.

For such superficial injuries, Ning Zhuo's physical foundation proved more than sufficient.

"Now!"

A sharp glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes. He suddenly crouched low, raised his foot, and aimed his toe at the sword's blade. With a powerful kick, he sent the Bronze Sword flying.

The Bronze Sword was forced to retreat, creating distance between them.

Ning Zhuo's heart surged with triumph. This was his first truly effective counterattack.

The Bronze Sword struck again, but Ning Zhuo's eyes burned with renewed confidence as he met the challenge head-on.

After several rounds of combat, Ning Zhuo's stamina proved inexhaustible, and the Bronze Sword was kicked away with increasing frequency.

The Bronze Sword thrust directly at Ning Zhuo's heart, but instead of retreating, he advanced, confidently sidestepping the blade with a fluid motion. His left hand, moving like a willow branch brushing through flowers, stretched out with fingers splayed wide to seize the sword's hilt, gripping it firmly.

The Bronze Sword struggled violently in his grasp.

Ning Zhuo could have easily suppressed it, but a smile played on his lips as he deliberately loosened his grip, allowing the sword to dart into the air like a startled fish, escaping once more.

"Again," he called out, clapping his hands at the retreating Bronze Sword, actively provoking it.

In this manner, Ning Zhuo used the Bronze Sword to hone his skills, his close-combat prowess steadily improving. This spectacle drew the attention of the Cultivators overseeing the trial.

"What's going on with Ning Zhuo?"

"At first, I thought he was just here to embarrass himself. But in less than the time it takes to brew a cup of tea, he's already improved so much!"

"Unbelievable! Yet it's happening right before our eyes. Is his martial arts aptitude really this extraordinary?!"

"To grow so rapidly in actual combat is exceedingly rare!"

The Cultivators marveled in unison.
