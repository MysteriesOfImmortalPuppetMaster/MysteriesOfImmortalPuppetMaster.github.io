Chapter 431: I Do Have Some Divination Skills

The grand formation besieging the Heavenly Pillar Giant Tree was withdrawn.

Mo Yuan and the other two Nascent Soul cultivators waved their hands, retrieving the formation flags, disks, and other items back into their pouches.

The three cultivators transformed into rainbows and flew through the sky toward their sect's residence.

On the way back, the Lord of the Demon Heart Cave used divine sense to communicate, expressing his confusion: "Great Cave Master, the three of us came together, having strength in numbers. Why did we need to take out such a precious treasure like the Western Pure Land to give to the Old Stone Monster?"

"We could have completely forced him to sign the divine decree of the Ginseng Beard Dragon King!"

Lu Hongtu's eyes flashed with a trace of cold light.

"Did you not sense it?"

"Old Stone Monster already has a trace of Soul Formation-level aura!"

The Lords of the Demon Heart Cave and Blood Shadow Cave were both stunned.

The Demon Heart Cave Lord said in surprise and uncertainty: "Could it be that Old Stone Monster has already advanced to the Soul Formation stage?"

Lu Hongtu shook his head slightly.

"This cultivator originated from a ten-thousand-year earth essence, and his own accumulation is extremely deep. However, he once devoured a fragment of the Treasure Dividing Rock."

"Although he gained the divine ability of Stone Forged Earth Treasure, this fortuitous encounter was not without drawbacks â€”it greatly hindered his cultivation speed."

This was a very common situation.

Along the path of cultivation, cultivators had to face this difficult choice.

That was, whether to increase their cultivation base and power or to master divine abilities and techniques.

If the cultivation base improved, one's own foundation would be strengthened, and there would be growth in all aspects.

But if one only had cultivation base without divine abilities and techniques, the cultivator's combat power would be very worrying.

Having profound cultivation but no combat power, it would be difficult to survive calamities when they occurred.

But if one focused on divine abilities and techniques, spending a lot of time and energy on them, it would also hinder the progress of one's cultivation base.

If the progress of cultivation base was too slow, and when the lifespan limit was reached the cultivator had not broken through to the next stage, then it was akin to seeking one's own death.

Therefore, choosing between cultivation base and divine abilities and techniques had never been a single-choice question.

As a normal cultivator, one had to balance both.

But which was more important, and at what time period, and what to choose as the focus of cultivation, all varied from person to person.

After Old Stone Monster devoured a fragment of the Treasure Dividing Rock back then, he had made rapid progress in divine abilities and techniques, undergoing a qualitative change!

But this wonderful divine ability also hindered his cultivation progress.

Lu Hongtu knew this quite well.

He shook his head.

"If the Old Stone Monster had advanced to the Soul Formation stage, his attitude toward us would not be like this."

"It can only be said that he is nearing Soul Formation, facing the critical point of breakthrough."

"In this situation, it's appropriate for me to give him the Western Pure Land."

The Demon Heart Cave Lord and Blood Shadow Cave Lord immediately understood.

Facing the Old Stone Monster who was about to reach Soul Formation, Mo Yuan Cave Master needed to show goodwill.

If in the future, Old Stone Monster advanced to Soul Formation and Mo Yuan Cave Master had had conflicts with him, he would inevitably suffer pressure and gain nothing.

It's better to give him the Western Pure Land now.

Old Stone Monster's true form was a ten-thousand-year earth essence; a virtuous treasure like the Western Pure Land, which was of earth attribute, was extremely helpful to him and could bring about a qualitative change. This would greatly enhance his chances of advancing to the Soul Formation stage.

The grudges between Lu Hongtu and Old Stone Monster were not deep enmities. Sending this treasure, when Old Stone Monster succeeded in advancing in the future, they would inevitably let go of past grievances, and moreover, Old Stone Monster would remember the favor of Mo Yuan Great Cave Master.

Even if Old Stone Monster failed to advance, the Western Pure Land was still of great use to him.

The favor of Mo Yuan Great Cave Master still existed.

And it sounded very good when spread out.

Mo Yuan Great Cave Master did not force other Nascent Soul cultivators to join the grand alliance of Thousand Peaks Forest.

Instead, he took the initiative to offer precious treasures like the Western Pure Land, achieving cooperation through incentives. In this way, Mo Yuan Cave Master was selfless, sacrificing his own interests for the future of the Thousand Peaks Forest; this was an act of noble character!

It was worth mentioning that the Six Cave Sect was not a purely demonic force but rather both righteous and evil.

Lu Hongtu had profound insight into the overall situation; he knew that to deal with the indigenous forces of the Thousand Peaks Forest, he must have a tough and domineering side, so he recruited Nascent Soul cultivators like Demon Heart and Blood Shadow.

At the same time, he also understood that if he was only tough, domineering, and ruthless, it would be equivalent to cutting himself off from the outside world; such a Six Cave Sect had no future.

Therefore, he recruited the other two Cave Masters, actively establishing good relationships with the outside world. The Six Cave Sect's evil and domineering actions were mostly used internally, which helped them gain a foothold in the Thousand Peaks Forest. Their righteous conduct allowed them to have more connections with the outside world, helping them exchange countless cultivation resources.

Having channels to communicate with the outside world enabled the Six Cave Sect to use the resources of the Thousand Peaks Forest to have extensive contact, trade, and good relations with outside forces. On the other hand, they sold external resources to various large and small forces within the Thousand Peaks Forest, making huge profits and gradually attaining a transcendent status.

All these were the results of Lu Hongtu's spirit!

At this moment, the Mo Yuan Cave Master was plotting for the future.

"If Old Stone Monster can really break through to Soul Formation, then he and the Ginseng Beard Dragon King will inevitably have a battle!"

The Ginseng Beard Dragon King, as the only Soul Formation-level existence in the Thousand Peaks Forest, had been entrenched here for countless years, deeply rooted, with numerous believers.

"One mountain cannot accommodate two tigers."

"If Old Stone Monster wants to continue cultivating in the Thousand Peaks Range, he will inevitably involve the earth veins of the Thousand Peaks Forest, which will seriously touch upon the Ginseng Beard Dragon King's fundamental base."

Thinking of this, Mo Yuan Cave Master's eyes shone brilliantly, his heart thumping.

"By then, when the two tigers fight, one will surely be wounded!"

"Is there an opportunity for me in this?"

"However, all of this has to wait until the crusading army of the Twin Rivers Country withdraws..."

At the bottom of the cave.

After the stone sphere had been silent for a long time, it began to loosen.

Crack, crack.

Cracks appeared on the surface of the stone sphere.

Lines of cracks quickly spread, eventually breaking open gaps, from which Sun and Ning emerged.

After confirming that the three Nascent Soul cultivators had all left, they still patiently waited for a period before crawling out.

"So thrilling, really too thrilling!" At this time, the stone layer on Sun Lingtong's body had already been unraveled by Ning Zhuo.

He applied another layer of medicinal mud, currently moving freely.

Even someone like Sun Lingtong, an evil sect cultivator who enjoyed seeking thrills, at this moment, was completely limp, unable to muster any strength.

The situation just now was too dangerous; with the slightest carelessness, a mistake in response would have allowed the three Nascent Soul cultivators to see through them.

At that time, the fate of Sun Ning and his companion would have been unimaginable!

A strong feeling of lingering fear enveloped Sun Lingtong's body and mind, making him not want to move for a while.

Ning Zhuo's gaze was focused on the ground beside him, where there was a handful of Western Pure Land.

The interaction with the three Nascent Soul cultivators had elements within his expectations and also some that were beyond his expectations.

Ning Zhuo had not expected that Lu Hongtu would take out the Western Pure Land, nor had he expected that they would be forced to sign the Ginseng Beard Dragon King's divine decree.

"From this, it can be seen that Lu Hongtu came prepared!"

"According to the collected intelligence, this person has excellent overall vision and can even spend from his own pocket to unite with other Nascent Soul cultivators."

"Moreover, under the enormous pressure of the Twin Rivers Country's crusading army, the Thousand Peaks Forest is changing its old state of numerous factions; a large number of people and forces here are rapidly integrating."

From this matter, Ning Zhuo immediately confirmed the change in the situation of the Thousand Peaks Forest.

In such a time of crisis, having a powerful leader was really crucial.

Thousand Peaks Forest benefited from the Ginseng Beard Dragon King, avoiding a state of disunity.

The Ginseng Beard Dragon King was the local deity. Based on the characteristics of a deity and being the greatest beneficiary, He himself was inevitably the most steadfast defender of the Thousand Peaks Forest.

At the same time, he was at the Soul Formation level, the strongest combat power.

Therefore, various cultivators and forces who did not wish to become homeless dogs were all rallying around this backbone, actively uniting.

Lu Hongtu brought the divine decree, which made it easier for Sun and Ning to muddle through.

Currently, Sun Ning and his companion had both signed the divine decree and were now under control.

But this advantage was also a disadvantage.

Just now, Sun and Ning, using the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat and employing the Stone Forged Earth Treasure divine ability, merged themselves with the stone sphere, being regarded by heaven and earth as a complete fetus.

Sun Lingtong's acting, Ning Zhuo's control, and the stone sphere's own disguise were all indispensable.

The three combined, leveraging the mysteries of the "Great art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing," only then did they deceive the three Nascent Soul-level cultivators like Mo Yuan.

Mo Yuan forced Old Stone Monster to sign the divine decree; Sun Ning and his companion had no choice but to comply.

Their divine senses, merged into one through the disguise of the Stone Forged Earth Treasure divine ability, together touched the divine decree, knowing the explicit decree within. Finally, they used their divine senses to sign the divine decree.

Therefore, the divine decree simultaneously bound Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and the stone sphere.

"What should we do next?" Ning Zhuo felt worried about this.

Sun Lingtong directly asked, "Little Zhuo, do you think we can break this divine decree?"

Ning Zhuo's expression was heavy; he slowly shook his head and said in a low voice, "This is a Soul Formation-level method. Although it's not impossible to break, the price to pay is really too great."

"If we seek help from the military of the Twin Rivers Country, we will inevitably expose our itinerary, reveal our trump cards, and the secret that Old Stone Monster has already died."

"According to the secret actions that Lu Hongtu previously confided, the Thousand Peaks Forest must have planted many spies within the Twin Rivers Country's army."

"Therefore, they could know the major military intelligence that the new army in the Green Forest Immortal City is about to depart."

"If we seek help from the Twin Rivers Country's military, there is no one we can trust."

"It is very likely that our information will be leaked. If the Thousand Peaks Forest side learns of this, and we have signed the divine decree, then just a single thought from the Ginseng Beard Dragon King would make us die without a burial place."

Sun Lingtong fell into silence. What Ning Zhuo said made a lot of sense.

Sun Lingtong sighed, "Yes, we have suffered so much, paid such a huge price, and finally obtained astonishing wealth."

"Even if the Twin Rivers Country's military does not leak this secret, if we want to break the Soul Formation-level divine decree constraint, I'm afraid the wealth we just obtained would be exhausted."

"If we encounter some unscrupulous people who raise the price arbitrarily, we might even have to pay more."

"If the commander-in-chief of the Twin Rivers Country, Du Tiechuan, knows that we possess the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, he would probably force us to keep going deep into the Thousand Peaks Forest to gather military intelligence!"

"Then, what about returning to the Southern Bean Country?"

Just as Sun Lingtong said this, he shook his own head.

The time was too insufficient.

According to the time requirements on the divine decree, the new army of Green Forest Immortal City would depart in four days.

By then, Sun Ning and his companion had to fully participate in the attack against the Twin Rivers Country's army, in compliance with the divine decree, and not violate it, to have a chance to survive.

"Alas, what else can we do? Let's take it one step at a time." Ning Zhuo shook his head.

"Let's not mine the final body of Old Stone Monster. This is part of the divine decree constraint; we can regard it as the body of the two of us."

"In the future, if the two of us take action and it's not in the full state when the divine decree was signed, and is considered that we did not go all out, that would be terrible."

Sun Ning and his companion, after a brief discussion, had no other way but to continue their previous actions.

After Ning Zhuo comprehended the complete divine ability of Stone Forged Earth Treasure, he cooperated with Sun Lingtong to dig out the entire stone sphere.

The two did not mine it but directly stuffed it into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.

Finally, they rode the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, traversed the void again, and returned to the vicinity of Green Forest Immortal City.

The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon became even more tattered.

Previously, it was already fifty percent damaged; after this trip, the outer shell was severely damaged, and many dragon scales were lost.

Many places had also undergone petrification.

Ning Zhuo wrapped the tattered Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon around his waist as a belt, walking slowly all the way back to the Three Generals Camp.

"The military advisor is back!" The soldiers, seeing Ning Zhuo, took the initiative to salute and greet him.

Previously, on the command platform, Ning Zhuo had used the "Tree Realm Descends" spell, stunning the entire audience, thus gaining the respect of the whole army.

Ning Zhuo observed the drills of the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang.

Seeing that they had not noticed at all that he had misappropriated public funds, he shook his head secretly.

These three generals really had big hearts.

He returned to his tent and calculated the accounts.

Midway, he put down his pen and sighed.

Not long ago, he was on the brink of life and death; now he was in his tent, outside were the occasional shouts of the three generals and the cultivators' yells, and a sense of security welled up.

Ning Zhuo felt a sense of being in a different world, an unreal feeling.

"The military intelligence of the Twin Rivers Country has been leaked; the Thousand Peaks Forest side is preparing to ambush the new army."

"I am the military advisor and sacrificial officer of the Three Generals Camp; at that time, I will inevitably march with them and become the target of ambush by a group of Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators."

"What's worse, Big Brother Sun and I have also signed the divine decree; we must deal with the Twin Rivers Country, and we have to go all out!"

At this moment, the curtain of the tent was lifted, and Liu Er walked in.

"What should we do about this?"

This really made Ning Zhuo feel troubled.

Seeing Ning Zhuo frowning, Liu Er immediately showed a kind smile: "Military advisor, making you manage the accounts really puts you in a difficult position."

Ning Zhuo hurriedly stood up and saluted.

Liu Er waved his hand, kindly indicating that they were all on the same side and there was no need for such formalities.

Liu Er did not put on airs, and his manner was like a spring breeze, which indeed made Ning Zhuo feel relieved.

Ning Zhuo sighed, "The military accounts can be calculated clearly, but the prospects are worrying, my lord."

"Currently, our military expenses can only last for three months."

In fact, Ning Zhuo had misappropriated a large number of spirit stones, which was already insufficient to support three months.

He had not yet had time to balance the accounts.

Ning Zhuo continued, "And during the process of calculating the accounts, my mind was touched, and I had many bad premonitions."

"I felt that the future was gloomy, so I deeply sighed and felt depressed."

Upon hearing this, Liu Er immediately became interested: "Military advisor can have such feelings; could it be that you have the ability of divination?"

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, "To say that I am a diviner, I dare not accept such praise."

"But I have indeed cultivated one or two divination methods and am most skilled in array calculations."

"My lord, please allow me to use some military funds to set up an array and calculate the future of our Three Generals Camp!"

Liu Er hurriedly asked about the cost.

Ning Zhuo then gave a number.

Liu Er fell into hesitation. The military funds were already scarce; if they were to be spent on divination, they wouldn't even last three months.

"These military funds are not mine alone; I need to discuss with Second Brother and Third Brother." After pondering for a while, Liu Er replied.

Ning Zhuo then extended his hand, "Please discuss it as soon as possible, my lord; time is of the essence."

Liu Er nodded and sighed, "I will go and inquire now; military advisor, please wait a moment."

Liu Er left the tent to find Zhang Hei and Guan Hong, who were still drilling the troops.

Seeing him act like this, Ning Zhuo knew that he no longer needed to repay the accounts in the Three Generals Camp.
