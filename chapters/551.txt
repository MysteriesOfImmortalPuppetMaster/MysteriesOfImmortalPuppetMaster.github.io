Chapter 551: Full Army Attack

Gao Cuo needed the Ying Zang Sha to cultivate a false mask, specifically to disguise himself as a dead thing, making the fake indistinguishable from the real, with excellent results.

But on ordinary days, Qiu Teng Peak’s defenses were extremely strict, self-contained, and without any flaws.

Therefore, Gao Cuo could only endure patiently, waiting for the right moment.

This time in the grand battle, he had escaped in advance, planning to take the opportunity to make a profit. He also learned from the latest battle report that Bi Tengyi’s physical body had been annihilated by Shuang Ling.

Gao Cuo then quickly conferred with Old Sword, changed the original plan, and hurried to the vicinity of Qiu Teng Peak.

After all, such an opportunity was too rare.

“Hmm?” Old Sword uttered softly.

Gao Cuo was completely unaware, but soon he saw that the entire Qiu Teng Peak had set up a grand defensive array, displaying the strongest defensive posture.

Gao Cuo’s heart stirred, and he immediately realized, “Oh, it must be that Bi Tengyi’s Nascent Soul has traversed the void and returned to her main base.”

Bi Tengyi was one of the high-level leaders of the Ancient Teng Tribe, who for many years had imposed her will and acted arbitrarily, and her own strength was quite formidable.

But in this grand battle, she experienced an unprecedented challenge - her physical body was destroyed, leaving only her Nascent Soul, which barely escaped with her life.

This sudden change caused the long-enjoyed privileges of Bi Tengyi to plunge her into a state of acute stress, fearing any mishap; therefore, upon her return, she activated all the defensive formations, making Qiu Teng Peak as impregnable as a fortress.

“However, in doing so, it also revealed a key piece of information.”

Old Sword said with a deep sigh, “Gao Cuo, you also know much of Bi Tengyi’s intelligence and her cultivation history.”

“She was originally the offspring of the tribe’s high-ranking families, born of noble origin; although she inherited the barbarian tribe’s courageous and ruthless temperament, she almost entirely relied on her background, her own aptitude, and her cultivation level to act arrogantly and bully others.”

“On the surface, this might seem fine. But when faced with major setbacks or life’s trials, her shortcomings immediately became apparent.”

“So, don’t be fooled by the fact that many Nascent Soul cultivators normally hold high positions and power; in reality, they are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, with temperaments not worthy of praise.”

“Bi Tengyi’s correct approach was actually to remain inconspicuous while maintaining strict control internally, keeping a low profile. But now, within several hundred li, whoever saw Qiu Teng Peak in such turmoil would know that something major was happening. Coupled with the latest battle report, it was easy to deduce Bi Tengyi’s current predicament.”

“If there really were enemies, they would surely strike at this time!”

“It must be known that the Nascent Soul is much weaker than the Cultivator's body.”

Receiving Old Sword’s guidance, Gao Cuo suddenly understood, “Old Sword, I understand.”

“On one hand, what you are saying is that although most Nascent Soul cultivators possess great power, their temperaments are hard to assess, perhaps even inferior to mine. This is a path I will take against Nascent Soul cultivators in the future.”

“On the other hand, the path of cultivation is not merely about the growth of one’s power, but also about the tempering of one’s personal character. Especially during times of weakness, the pressure from the outside world is often immense, which can foster growth in one’s inner nature.”

“And once that period is over, when one’s cultivation reaches a certain level - say, the Nascent Soul level - it becomes difficult to feel any pressure from the outside world, which in turn is detrimental to a cultivator’s overall path!”

Old Sword laughed heartily, “That’s right. Therefore, there are often those who achieve greatness later in life.”

“Cultivators who are always pampered and never experience setbacks or failures will not have a long-lasting cultivation path.”

“So, are the previous two failures, for you, truly just failures?”

“This is also a form of success.”

Gao Cuo had experienced two failures in succession.

The first was the Evil God Bone of Bi Kong Mountain. The second was the Wood-Fire in the Ten Li Burning Forest.

Both left Gao Cuo empty-handed.

Now it was the third time.

He planned to steal the Ying Zang Sha from Qiu Teng Peak.

Compared to the previous two times, he was noticeably more composed: “Old Sword, what you said is extremely reasonable. However... I still hope to truly succeed.”

As he spoke, many of the green vines on Qiu Teng Peak began to retract, with a large amount of verdant color rapidly fading, forming a surging wave of emerald light that gathered into the mountain body of Qiu Teng Peak.

Old Sword murmured, “It has begun.”

Gao Cuo nodded slightly, knowing that Bi Tengyi, in her effort to forge her body, would inevitably consume an enormous amount of life energy.

This would seriously affect the defense of the entire Qiu Teng Peak, causing vulnerabilities in its defenses.

And these vulnerabilities would also be his opportunity.

Old Sword reminded, “Prepare yourself.”

Gao Cuo nodded again and began to activate his cultivation technique.

This time, he truly unleashed his full strength, and the entire process was completely silent, with not a trace of aura leaking out.

After the time it took for half a stick of incense to burn, he transformed into a stone sphere -Old Stone Monster!

Had Bi Tengyi’s Nascent Soul not returned, Gao Cuo would not have needed to use his full strength to disguise himself as the Old Stone Monster.

But since her Nascent Soul had returned, sitting in command at Qiu Teng Peak, then obtaining the Ying Zang Sha would very likely lead to direct confrontation.

Under such circumstances, only a Soul Formation-level like Old Stone Monster could make Bi Tengyi hesitate to strike.

More crucially, after using this disguise, even the Dragon King Temple side did not want to continue investigating.

Because in this way, it was very likely to create an internal conflict between the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and the Old Stone Monster - the two Soul Formation-level entities within the Thousand Peaks Forest.

In the face of a formidable enemy, the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King would be compelled to hesitate, holding back.

This was exactly to Gao Cuo and Old Sword’s liking.

“Old Stone Monster?!” Bi Tengyi’s Nascent Soul let out a cry of shock.

Sure enough, when Gao Cuo officially made his move, he startled Bi Tengyi, causing her to dare not act rashly and to immediately call for reinforcements.

The call for aid was delivered with extreme speed, reaching the Dragon King Temple and arriving into Lord Long’s hands.

“Discovery of the real Old Stone Monster!”

“He has finally appeared!”

“Is it really true?”

“Bi Tengyi is absolutely certain!”

“Then act according to the previous arrangements!!”

The reaction of the Dragon King Temple was extremely swift.

Because they had long imagined the Old Stone Monster and had set up a large number of contingency plans. Among them, some had even been rehearsed.

They had no choice but to take it seriously.

Because in their eyes, the Old Stone Monster was of the Soul Formation level, a key figure that affected the overall situation in Thousand Peaks Forest.

During the period that the Old Stone Monster was missing, they searched frantically, but to no avail.

Now, the Old Stone Monster had finally surfaced!

Among all the plans, the first thing that the Dragon King Temple did was unanimous - they offered incense and reported to the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.

The Dragon King’s statue, upon receiving the news, immediately had eyes that flashed with brilliance, coming back to life from death!

Moments later, Lord Long received the latest instructions.

“Old Stone Monster?!” he suddenly sprang to his feet from his seat.

Upon learning of the Old Stone Monster’s appearance, the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King immediately set out!

Lord Long also received the latest order - launch a full-scale attack on the Twin Rivers Nation main camp without a moment’s delay.

“Everyone, listen to orders, full army attack!!” Lord Long roared suddenly, his voice resounding across the entire battlefield.

Zhao Xi: ?!!

The Twin Rivers Nation's army: ??!

The battle was raging fiercely, and the side of the Thousand Peaks Forest had even begun to gain the upper hand, so why had a full-scale attack suddenly been launched?

This was very strange!

Not only did the Twin Rivers side think so, but the allied forces of the Thousand Peaks Forest were also momentarily dumbfounded, all turning to look at Lord Long, not knowing what he was up to.

And Lord Long, with a stern gaze, swept around and responded to the many doubts, “Full army attack, no mistakes allowed!”

He issued orders once again.

“Hahaha. That’s the way it should be!” The first to react was none other than the contemporary Elephant King, Xiang Yue.

Xiang Yue ceased laughing, abandoned Shuang Ling, and charged fiercely towards the city camp of the Twin Rivers Nation forces.

His momentum was great and his power immense, breaking through the air and exhibiting an extremely ferocious posture, as if he were a cannonball charging forward relentlessly!

Zhao Xi suddenly stood up and immediately activated the formation.

Azure Moon Flying Shield Formation!

Seven hundred silver shields flew upward into the sky, with moonlight flowing on their surfaces; the Geng metal aura on the flying shields’ surfaces condensed into tangible light blades, serving as both offense and defense!

Bang bang bang.

Xiang Yue charged forward with his head covered, smashing through shield after shield.

“I really like this kind of battle. Hehehehe...”

On the other side, Li Jiuqu abandoned Mo Yechen and flew to an even higher position.

He grinned sardonically, his lips split up to his ears.

The moment the Corpse Immortal Poison Basket was overturned, three hundred thousand Corpse Immortal Sisters flowed like an asphalt torrent across the sky, descending headlong, covering the military camp and city!

Zhao Xi and the others’ expressions changed drastically.

Zhao Xi then urged the Azure Moon Flying Shield Formation again, and over a thousand silver shields emerged, circling and combining to form a perfectly round moon wheel above the city.

The Geng metal aura transformed into myriad light-blade gusts.

The venomous insect swarm that first rushed in collided with the light blades, disintegrating one after another, the sound of their shells shattering resembling hail striking a jade plate, ceaselessly.

Crack, crack.

Within the military camp and city, the formation disc of the Azure Moon Flying Shield Formation showed cracks, and these cracks rapidly grew and spread; within a few breaths, they expanded to cover the entire disc.

“I see it!” Within the Thousand Peaks Forest alliance, the Poison Scorpion Cave Master suddenly shot out a scorpion tail poison needle.

The poison needle, silently mingling with the venomous insect swarm, successfully approached, then suddenly erupted - piercing through the void in an instant, and when it reappeared, it had accurately stabbed into the formation disc.

The formation disc shattered with a bang.

The Azure Moon Flying Shield Formation immediately fell into chaos; the hindered Xiang Yue and the obstructed insect swarm broke through the barriers and surged again.

The shattered shield fragments broke into countless stardust pieces, scattering over the battlefield, and the dozen formation masters in charge of the formation were immediately counterattacked and perished on the spot.

The Geng metal aura dispersed like the wind.

Thunder Net Locking the Void Grand Formation!

In the next moment, from the gaps in the city walls, countless thunder snakes sprang forth, with purple and white electric light interweaving to form a hexagonal grid.

The wolf claw patterns on Guya’s face began to emit a green light, and his gnarled, muscular right arm suddenly swelled to three times its size.

“Wolf Fang Smash!”

He roared, and his Wolf Fang Club, enveloped in a blue-edged radiance, smashed fiercely into the Thunder Net.

Boom.

In the next moment, the explosive smoke engulfed Guya and the surroundings.

The Poison Scorpion Cave Master, Zisha, lightly floated and flew onto the battlefield.

Her tail needle, in midair, very slowly traced out a scorpion-shaped talisman.

In the next moment, the five formation masters responsible for the Thunder Net Locking the Void Grand Formation suddenly had black blood gushing from their seven orifices; the formation device-the red-copper Azure Dragon Pillar - tilted with a resounding crash, and the electric light chains twitched like a dying giant python.

At this point in the charge, Xiang Yue directly tore with both hands, ripping apart the electric net, and continued his charge like a wild beast!

Li Jiuqu’s insect swarm lagged a step; as the electric net was about to recover, it was covered by the insect swarm, and the two engaged in fierce mutual attrition.

“Bihai Soldier Tide Formation, open!”

Zhao Xi’s hairband immediately cracked, and his long hair danced wildly in the wind.

He was sweating profusely, frantically urging the formation.

Nine streams of water gathered like a dragon, rising from the moat into the air, their dragon roars stirring up waves a hundred zhang high.

The river waves raged to the skies, surging upward to quickly form a water curtain barrier.

Just as the barrier was about to completely close, Xiang Yue charged in with a bang, breaking into the water curtain ahead of everyone.

Martial Art - Breaking Army Stance!

Xiang Yue continued charging with his head covered, employing martial arts that countered the enemy; nine water dragons successively tried to block him, but their forces were dispersed, allowing Xiang Yue to neither dodge nor avoid, smashing through each one!

Soon after, the insect swarm clung to the water curtain, beginning to gnaw at it ferociously.

“Fire arrows, fire arrows!” a general hurriedly commanded.

Immediately, tens of thousands of arrows were fired from the city wall.

Employing military tactics, the arrow rain was extremely dense, with almost all arrows directed towards Xiang Yue.

Divine Skill - Diamond Indestructibility!

Xiang Yue’s entire body radiated golden light, his defenses surging to the extreme, and he stubbornly withstood the arrow rain, continuing his fierce charge.

“Didn't this stop him?!”

On the city wall, the generals’ faces changed one after another, sensing horror.

Xiang Yue’s ferocity exceeded their imaginations.

Just as they anxiously anticipated the thundering collision between Xiang Yue and the city wall, a mechanical doll suddenly appeared before Xiang Yue.

Boom!

The two collided, and the mechanical doll was knocked flying backwards.

But soon, it adjusted its posture and stood steadily.

It was seen that the mechanical doll’s appearance vaguely resembled Shuang Ling, but its body was as flexible as a snake, draped in a gauze robe, with starlight scattered and water vapor permeating within.

Nascent Soul-level!

Xiang Yue snorted coldly, exhaling a mouthful of scorching foul air through his nostrils, and once again began his charge.

Bang bang bang……

He trod on the mountainous terrain, with every footfall leaving a deep imprint.

The mechanical doll moved toward him like a baby being embraced by an adult.

Martial Art - Steel Fist.

Xiang Yue’s fist emanated a silver-black steel hue, its hardness surging dramatically as he struck and smashed forcefully.

The mechanical doll raised its pair of palms, directly colliding with Xiang Yue’s steel fist.

In an instant, thousands of suspended threads burst forth from the mechanical doll’s palms.

The suspended threads covered the steel ring and, combined with the martial art Mian Palm, formed a mechanical technique - Chan Yun Shou · Thousand Threads Bind!

Xiang Yue felt as though his steel fist had struck a clump of cotton, his immense and rigid force being rapidly nullified.

From the moment he entered the battlefield until now, for the first time he showed a hint of a different expression as he once again scrutinized the mechanical doll before him.

“Using softness to overcome hardness! This is Rougu Xuanji - this must be Shuang Ling’s trump card.”

“Three thousand six hundred segmented ring joints, each inlaid with ‘Force-Relieving Talisman Patterns’, capable of freely deflecting according to the direction of impact.”

“Internally embedded with ‘Nine-turn Corridor’ water-liquid mercury spirit, able to divert 70% of the force to elsewhere.”

“The outer gauze robe appears ordinary, but is actually woven from star silkworm silk, naturally possessing a force-dispersing net-like structure, and can also alter the direction and trajectory of external force.”

“This way, the core of this mechanical doll should be the Mermaid’s Tear.”

Ning Zhuo’s eyes shone brightly as he watched.

Although Rougu Xuanji temporarily blocked Xiang Yue, she also drained a large amount of Shuang Ling’s spiritual energy and mental focus.

For her to achieve "using softness to overcome hardness", she had to employ even more exquisite combat techniques.

Now, the scene that Shuang Ling had painstakingly maintained in battle collapsed dramatically.

The Nascent Soul cultivators, who had previously been locked in a stalemate with Shuang Ling, now suddenly found themselves free and quickly withdrew.

Shuang Ling was clearly a tough nut to crack; it would be more pragmatic to first injure others and secure the credit and achievements.
