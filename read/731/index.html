<paragraph index="1">Low-profile, moderate, or high-profile... three paths lay before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">As Ning Zhuo faced this crucial decision, his mind wandered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In that instant, he seemed to see a child on Fire Persimmon Mountain, who had begun his disguise from a young age. Each time he looked up at the City Lord's Mansion, it loomed like a towering mountain. He concealed his intelligence, growing up in the shadows, secretly clinging to Sun Lingtong. He twisted and grew in the cracks, scheming against adults, exhausting his mind, and risking his life in the Lava Immortal Palace - his first all-out assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The resentment he had suppressed for over a decade, the dark fire he had stifled for so long, erupted like the volcano on Fire Persimmon Mountain, scorching the depths of his heart. This was the resistance of a petty thief against his own misfortune!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">In that instant, he seemed to see a young man in Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, repeatedly showcasing his martial prowess, finally revealing himself to the world. The bone-jarring combat made him truly feel alive. He forged new friendships - drinking companions and female cultivators alike. Amidst the joyous revelry, their smiles bloomed like flowers, honest and radiant. He glimpsed a new life, a world of such splendor that Fire Persimmon Mountain seemed small and stifling by comparison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The young man began to show his true colors, embracing a new way of life. He admired Linghu Jiu, believing him to be a true gentleman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In that moment, he saw again the grand battle in the Thousand Peaks Forest. He was but a grain of sand in the iron tide sweeping across the plains, a witness to countless heroes crumbling beneath the relentless onslaught of war.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Each battle plunged him into perilous situations, yet like a hammer and fiery forge, they tempered Ning Zhuo, honing his sharpness and refining his brilliance. From Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei, and from Mu Lan, he learned the grandeur and martial prowess of a true commander. A man's courage, he realized, springs from within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In that instant, he saw the White Paper Immortal City, teeming with ghostly creatures, the Black Cloud Battlefield stretching across the horizon, and a resolute young man, his potential just beginning to bloom, standing tall against a Soul Formation-level foe - the sovereign of an entire nation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Yet the youth had never possessed innate courage. He simply felt bound by destiny, duty-bound to fulfill his mother's dying wish and his own ambitions. He finally declared with certainty that he was no longer a thief. He would honor his mother's expectations with the glory of a hero.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">At this very moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He had arrived at the Myriad Manifestations Sect, his mother's former sect. Ning Zhuo had always felt an innate affinity for this place. Here, he had forged friendships with people of all kinds, and here, he had also gained enemies, each with their own unique talents and schemes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">I'm not weak anymore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Three choices lie before me. I'm no longer limited to choosing to hide!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">So, which path should I take?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Or, to put it another way, how should I live?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The big-headed youth asked himself these questions inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Scenes from his past flashed through his mind, accelerating like a whirlwind, like a fleeting glimpse of flowers from horseback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">These were no longer mere fragments of memory; they were like sparks, accumulating in Ning Zhuo's eyes until they ignited his gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">His eyes grew increasingly bright, like stars kindled into flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">His emotions surged, gradually transforming into an overwhelming, unstoppable torrent - like the iron tide of the Thousand Peaks Forest sweeping across the plains, shattering all hesitation and cowardice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Each fallen mountain represented the shadows of his past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The boy who had survived for over a decade in those shadows had now undergone a complete transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He stood tall and proud, facing the unknown, embracing the challenge. He yearned to blaze across the heavens like a comet, unafraid to shine brightly, undeterred by the cost, burning passionately to forge his own path!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Then let me shine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Then let me dazzle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">This was precisely the moment:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">For twenty years, a blade lay hidden in a dark alley,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Molten waves forged a dragon's pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Thousand Peaks' iron tide forged my bones,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ten Thousand Medicines' herbs cleansed my heart anew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">White Paper's edge tears through the Ghost's veil,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">My blood-soaked robes bear witness to my brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">From this day forth, I shall no longer conceal my soaring ambition, but pilot the Flying Boat straight through the Nine Realms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">With this resolve, Ning Zhuo slowly raised his head from the stone platform within the Hall of Punishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">All eyes immediately turned toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo's gaze seemed to pierce through the Demon Subjugation Hall's towering walls, focusing on some distant, indistinct point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His expression was solemn, yet his composure carried an unwavering determination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He spoke, his voice low but each word resonating with the weight of his soul, sinking clearly into the hearts of everyone present: "What is this body worth?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">A collective tremor ran through the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo met the Golden Core Elder's deep gaze, enunciating each word with unwavering conviction: "If this broken vessel can still ignite a single spark, momentarily halting the demon's slaughter and shielding the grass and trees behind me for even a breath... then it is enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"To bear the stain of infamy? Compared to the myriad paths of life behind me, compared to the peace of mind within my heart... it is mere rubble!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"What is there to fear? What is there to hesitate for?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">A collective gasp swept through the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The elderly cultivator's eyes widened, his overwhelming joy nearly bursting from his skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">His eyes shone as he stared at Ning Zhuo, his heart soaring with silent exclamations: "A seed of the Righteous Path! This is a true seed of the Righteous Path!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The detection methods remained silent, confirming that Ning Zhuo's words sprang from the depths of his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This realization filled the elderly cultivator with boundless delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The other High-Ranked Cultivators also sighed inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"How many years has it been? How many years have passed since someone finally passed the Three Questions of the Heart?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"There have been a few in past trials, but none as young and with such boundless potential as this cultivator!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Truly exceptional! Legend has it that Hall Master Zhong Dao himself was like this in his youth, dedicating himself to upholding justice throughout the realm!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Perhaps what we're witnessing today is a historic moment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The elderly cultivator took a deep breath, striving to maintain his composure, and transmitted a message via divine sense to the others: "What do you all think? Does this youth deserve first place?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Someone immediately countered, "If such an outstanding junior doesn't deserve first place, who else could?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Another cultivator, unable to contain his impatience, declared, "First place belongs to him without a doubt!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Agreed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Agreed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Absolutely agreed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">No one voiced any dissent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The elderly cultivator nodded slightly, retrieved a token, and handed it to Ning Zhuo. "Well done, young man. You have passed. Congratulations on securing first place!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo nodded and immediately cupped his hands in a formal bow, expressing his gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The elderly cultivator continued, "As the first-place winner of the Demon Subjugation Hall's Rising Cloud Minor Trial, you will receive the highest reward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">As he spoke, the elderly cultivator solemnly produced a precious treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">All eyes were drawn to the treasure, its dazzling splendor impossible to ignore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">It was a miniature pagoda, exquisitely crafted and held in the palm of an elderly cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The pagoda rested upon a lotus pedestal made of azure-gold, its six tiers resembling cascading waves of jade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The pagoda's body was forged from Formless Thousand Buddha Glazed, its surface shimmering like crystalline ice. When illuminated, it radiated a golden aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Eighteen hundred Enlightened figures emerged from the depths of the glazed material, some forming demon-subduing mudras, others cradling relic pagodas, their Buddhist intent boundless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">At the pagoda's apex sat a lustrous, two-toned pearl. When white, it displayed the Heavenly Script Wheel, radiating meritous light. When black, it revealed the Rakshasa's fangs, capable of expelling sinful souls. This was the Karma Dharani Pearl!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The elderly cultivator explained to Ning Zhuo, "Since you wish to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, you should know of our sect's supreme treasure: the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"This treasure discerns good from evil, suppresses Qi imbalances, and has been entrusted to the Demon Subjugation Hall's master throughout the ages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"This miniature pagoda is a replica of the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda. Crafted from rare materials, it has achieved magic treasure status and is suitable for Golden Core cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Though you are only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, you can still manage to use it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"It can detect merit and sin, and possesses some power to protect one's personal Qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo was well aware that this was one of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's foundational treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Super sects, powerful clans, and cultivation nations invariably possessed precious artifacts to suppress their Qi and fortune. The Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda was one such treasure for the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The elderly cultivator's presentation of the pagoda came as no surprise to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Every cultivator who passed the Rising Cloud Minor Trial in the Hall of Execution received such a treasure. However, the standard reward was a Magic Artifact-grade Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Only the top performer earned a magic treasure-grade reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo had chosen the Hall of Execution precisely because he knew it distributed these pagodas. Yet the actual outcome far exceeded his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">A magic treasure-grade pagoda was naturally superior to a Magic Artifact-grade one. Ning Zhuo accepted the small pagoda with both hands, bowing deeply in gratitude once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The elderly cultivator specifically mentioned that the Hall of Punishment would soon hold a different Rising Cloud Minor Trial, urging Ning Zhuo to participate if interested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He genuinely admired Ning Zhuo's potential but remained remarkably principled. Even after gifting the magic treasure, he refrained from forcing Ning Zhuo into any binding contracts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo immediately proposed exchanging spiritual energy threads to enable mutual communication via flying messages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">This suggestion brought a genuine smile to the elderly cultivator's face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">After exchanging names and capturing each other's spiritual energy threads, Ning Zhuo added, "Senior Cai, I..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Having just arrived, I, due to my possession of a powerful Mechanism treasure, provoked the wrath of a Demonic Path cultivator. Unfortunately, his deep connections make him impossible to deal with directly, even though his subordinates have been taken care of."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Elder Cai, the elderly cultivator with the Cai surname, frowned deeply and immediately asked, "Who is this person?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo sighed, his expression a mix of helplessness and frustration. "His name is Ban Ji. He belongs to the Ban Clan but follows the Demonic Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Elder Cai's frown deepened further. After carefully considering his words, he said, "Our Myriad Manifestations Sect's rules are all-encompassing, like a vast ocean that accepts all rivers. Therefore, even those who follow the Demonic Path or other unorthodox practices are eligible to join. Of course, once they become disciples of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, they must restrain themselves and act according to the Righteous Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"This is a brilliant method for upholding justice and guiding others back to the righteous path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Why is the Flying Cloud Kingdom so peaceful and stable, unlike most other cultivation nations? A major reason is that with each large-scale recruitment, our Myriad Manifestations Sect draws elites from other factions and converts them into members of the Righteous Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Based on your account, Ban Ji still retains Demonic Cultivator habits but hasn't truly violated our sect's rules."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Consider this trouble a trial on your Dao Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Seeing the disappointment on Ning Zhuo's face, Elder Cai changed his tone. "Of course, if you formally join our Hall of Punishment..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"As a member of the Hall, Ban Ji will undoubtedly restrain himself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"If he continues to trouble you, it would be tantamount to challenging the Hall of Punishment itself. Do you understand?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo immediately bowed deeply. "This junior understands perfectly. Thank you for your guidance, Senior!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">With that, Ning Zhuo bid farewell to Elder Cai and departed under the watchful eyes of numerous cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">As Ning Zhuo's figure receded into the distance, Elder Cai communicated telepathically, his voice low and urgent: "Investigate Ning Zhuo's claims immediately."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He would not act without thorough investigation. Elder Cai had witnessed too much treachery and conspiracy in his long life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo felt no disappointment that Elder Cai had refused to intervene on his behalf. The elder's reaction had been precisely what he had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"The moment I leave, the Hall of Punishment will launch a full-scale investigation into me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Heh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Let them investigate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"What will Zhong Dao do when they discover I'm Meng Yaoyin's son?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo estimated that Zhong Dao would likely become a significant obstacle to any action against him by the sect's higher echelons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Of course, he couldn't be certain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">After all, the stakes surrounding the White Paper Immortal City were astronomically high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Faced with the sect's overwhelming interests, will Zhong Dao compromise?" Ning Zhuo found himself unable to answer this critical question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">His understanding of Zhong Dao was limited to publicly available information. Having never interacted with the man personally, he couldn't be sure of his stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He had no answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">His understanding of Zhong Dao was limited to publicly available information; he had never personally interacted with him and couldn't be certain of his true intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Leveraging Zhong Dao's influence had been Ning Zhuo's plan since he first reviewed the intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">However, it wasn't until he stood on the stone platform, facing the third question, that he finally made his decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Once the decision was made, Ning Zhuo wasted no time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">After leaving the Hall of Punishment, he immediately found the nearest registration point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Even after so many days, the line of cultivators waiting to register remained long and crowded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo, familiar with the process, walked straight to the front of the line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Hey, big-headed guy, get to the back of the line!" a cultivator shouted, noticing Ning Zhuo cutting ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The registration official's attention was drawn to the commotion. Seeing Ning Zhuo was unfamiliar, he was about to ask him to step aside when Ning Zhuo produced three tokens of first-place honors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"I'm here to exchange these for a stone tablet," Ning Zhuo stated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The official's expression changed dramatically. At this stage, possessing three first-place tokens was irrefutable proof of Ning Zhuo's exceptional talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Moreover, it demonstrated that he belonged to the most elite group of cultivators at this year's Flying Cloud Assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Realizing Ning Zhuo's immense potential, the supervising cultivator immediately stood up, his face beaming with a smile. "Fellow Daoist, I haven't had the pleasure of learning your name yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The cultivator's smile widened. "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, please wait a moment while we verify the authenticity of your credentials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"I'll do it! I'll do it!" His companion eagerly reached out to grab the credentials for testing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Several other companions joined in, nearly starting a scuffle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Seeing this, the long line of cultivators waiting to register behind Ning Zhuo fell into complete silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The entire hall became eerily quiet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The three cultivators responsible for testing moved swiftly, almost simultaneously declaring, "Authentic."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The cultivator facing Ning Zhuo burst into laughter, retrieved a stone token, and exchanged it for the wooden one Ning Zhuo had presented. "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, the Sect welcomes you warmly. There's just one final formality. After receiving your stone token, the Sect requires additional information for our records."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"Oh, I understand. What do you need to know?" Ning Zhuo asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">The cultivator quickly replied, "We need to record your Cultivation Art and current cultivation stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Prepared for this, Ning Zhuo immediately answered, "Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual. Currently mid-Foundation Establishment, at the Phenomena Seed Talisman stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The responsible cultivator quickly recorded the information on a Jade Slip: "I see. Thank you, Fellow Daoist. I've made a note of it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, this is my spiritual energy signature. If you exchange your token later, please come to me. I'll personally handle these trivial matters for you at full speed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">His companion immediately cast envious glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Cultivators assigned to such tasks were typically at the lower rungs of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Meeting someone like Ning Zhuo was a great honor for them, potentially altering their entire destiny.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ning Zhuo accepted the spiritual energy signature offered by the cultivator with a smile, but he didn't reciprocate with his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">This simple gesture immediately drew even more envious and even jealous gazes toward the responsible cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The cultivator himself beamed with joy, unable to contain his delight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, safe travels," the cultivator said, respectfully seeing him off. Ning Zhuo leisurely departed from the nameless peak where registration was held.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">As he flew back to his Azure Stone Cave Mansion, Ning Zhuo's expression remained impassive, his eyes closed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">He knew his actions would inevitably have far-reaching consequences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Information about him would now be highly valued and actively sought after by countless interested parties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"Then let them come."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
