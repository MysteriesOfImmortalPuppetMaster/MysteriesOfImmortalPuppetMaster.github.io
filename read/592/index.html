<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Sun Lingtong charged headlong at the paper general, only to slam into it like a child ramming into a stone wall. His head spun, and even his soul trembled in dizziness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">"Ouch, ouch, ouch!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="6">He grimaced in pain, and it took a long moment for his spirit to steady itself, his face gradually returning to normal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">"What's going on?" A sinking feeling crept into Sun Lingtong's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">Carefully, he stretched out his lotus-root-like arm, gently pressing against the paper general's chest. It felt as solid as rock beneath his touch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">Ning Zhuo, who observed closely through their Life Hanging by a Thread, quickly advised, "Take it easy, Boss. This isn't some kind of trap or formation-your soul cultivation is just insufficient. You aren't a soul cultivator. Ah, had I known earlier, I would have given you some ghostly nourishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">Sun Lingtong had already guessed the truth, rolling his eyes dramatically, "I'm the one who refused! The last body tempering boosted my physique substantially. If I boosted my soul now with ghostly nourishment, how would I possibly cross the crucial threshold of turning virtual into reality?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">Indeed, Sun Lingtong had reached the final stage of Foundation Establishment. Once he crossed this stage, he would form his Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">But this final step depended heavily on his underlying foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">To form the Golden Core, he needed his illusory core to fully solidify-this required perfect balance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">If one excessively strengthened their physical body or soul before this crucial step, achieving perfect balance would become nearly impossible, preventing the illusory core from solidifying properly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">Sun Lingtong had already faced setbacks due to the convenience methods he personally devised for Ning Zhuo and external pressures that significantly enhanced his physical cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">These factors had considerably delayed his progress towards achieving a true Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">The Thousand Peak Forest campaign in Two Note Kingdom had sparked a deep hunger in Sun Lingtong for quicker advancement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">Thus, despite the exceptional opportunities to enhance his soul cultivation in White Paper City, he restrained himself, aiming to first cross into the Golden Core realm properly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">After successfully entering Golden Core, it would be fine to strengthen his physical and spiritual foundations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">After all, Sun Lingtong's primary cultivation method was the Virgin Boy Technique, dedicated solely to cultivating the Sea of Consciousness, in which he had already achieved deep mastery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">One's primary cultivation method determined the true strength of their foundation. Advancing prematurely, even slightly below perfection, could degrade the quality of the Golden Core and destabilize one's foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">For Sun Lingtong, physical cultivation could wait without compromising his fundamental stability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">His planning was meticulous, yet who could have anticipated such a situation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">Currently, Sun Lingtong could only helplessly watch the Nascent Soul-level paper general, unable to enter it due to his insufficient soul strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">His frustration made his spiritual form appear visibly puffier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">"Infuriating!" After several failed attempts, Sun Lingtong bitterly shifted his attention elsewhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">He placed his tiny hand onto the deity-like paper soldiers upon the chariot-each possessed Golden Core-level strength-but his touch felt like pressing against sturdy armor, utterly impenetrable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Even more agitated, Sun Lingtong turned to survey other options.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">His gaze skipped past spear-and-shield soldiers and crossbowmen, finally settling upon a paper cavalryman atop a bull mount.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">Climbing onto the bull, he touched the paper cavalryman, feeling resistance as thin as a windowpane. With slight effort, he punctured through, instantly merging his spirit into the paper cavalryman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">The cavalryman immediately sprang to life, transforming dramatically from simple paper and wood into a robust Yin Soldier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">The soldier was large and burly, but his eyes sparkled mischievously, sharply contrasting his imposing physique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Sun Lingtong felt like he had donned an oversized cotton robe, quite uncomfortable and cumbersome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">Disappointedly, he realized he could control only the rider; the bull mount beneath him remained a lifeless paper construction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">Leaping down, he noticed his landing felt significantly shorter than usual, his body now considerably taller.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Shaking his shoulders, Sun Lingtong's earlier annoyance vanished rapidly, replaced by eager curiosity and anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">"Woo-hoo! Underworld, here I come!" Under Ning Zhuo's attentive watch, Sun Lingtong prepared to set out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">"Wait a moment, Boss. I'll use the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern to teleport you out. This spot is well-hidden; leaving openly would leave traces," Ning Zhuo suddenly reminded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">Sun Lingtong readily agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">Activating the palace lantern, Ning Zhuo swiftly sent Sun Lingtong ten miles away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">The Underworld stretched out, barren and desolate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">Sun Lingtong felt as though he were trudging through an endless wasteland, the monotonous scenery rapidly dampening his spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">"What's that sound?" His ears perked up, catching the faint trickle of running water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">Deciding quickly, he turned toward the sound. Anything was better than aimless wandering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Midway, the skies suddenly darkened as black snow began to fall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">Curious, Sun Lingtong stretched out his hand, discovering flakes of burned paper ash drifting down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">Surprisingly, as the ashes touched his paper-crafted body, they infused him with threads of strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">Alerted by the mysterious black snow, countless Underworld creatures emerged from hiding: ghost hounds, disembodied heads, and even bull-headed humanoid specters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">"Again! It's happening again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">"The Governor of Forgotten River really outdid himself this time, holding such a grand ceremony. We profit every day now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">"This one's mine-don't touch it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">The black snow didn't last long, but it was enough to ignite fierce competition among the creatures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">Suddenly, a pack of Blue Corpse Wolves surrounded many ghosts. Their leader, a behemoth larger than an elephant, roared intimidatingly. At Golden Core strength, it threatened, "Hand over your black snow or prepare to become our dinner!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">This outright robbery instantly sparked conflict. Chaos erupted as battles commenced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Sun Lingtong found himself caught up in the turmoil, forced to fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Three Qi Refining-stage Blue Corpse Wolves swiftly encircled him, charging in a triangular formation and leaving trails of eerie green phosphorescent flames behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Grinning lightly, Sun Lingtong waited until the wolves were nearly upon him before unleashing his true strength, revealing a sudden surge from Qi Refining directly to Peak Foundation Establishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">Unperturbed, the wolves pressed their attack. Sun Lingtong deftly sidestepped the frontal assault, then counterattacked sharply-his fists thundered through the air, crushing two wolf heads simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Pivoting quickly, he stomped heavily upon the third wolf's back, splitting its body cleanly in half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">Delighted, Sun Lingtong admired his fists, realizing the exquisite quality of this paper puppet body, clearly at the pinnacle of Foundation Establishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Seeing him effortlessly dispatch three Qi Refining wolves, a Foundation Establishment wolf leader-large as a calf-howled furiously and surged toward him. Employing ghostly techniques, its speed dramatically increased, trailing shadows behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">"Come at me!" Sun Lingtong, intrigued and excited, refused to dodge. Raising his arms, he met the wolf's fierce charge head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">With a decisive headbutt, he knocked the wolf's skull backward. Enraged, the wolf snapped viciously toward Sun Lingtong's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">Crunch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">The bite met only air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Anticipating this, Sun Lingtong had ducked low. His compacted form suddenly expanded as he drove upward, channeling immense force through his spine, delivering a powerful uppercut.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">The wolf leader flew skyward, then crashed heavily back onto the chaotic battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">This spectacle halted many fighters mid-motion. Even the Wolf King's gaze fixed on Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Growling commands, the Wolf King sent three more Foundation Establishment leaders charging toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Sun Lingtong flexed his fists, feeling numbness set in. He knew he'd sufficiently tested the paper puppet body's limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Sun Lingtong spotted the three Foundation Establishment-stage Azure Corpse Wolves, and when he saw the Wolf King staring at him with haunting eyes, he decisively turned around and fled!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Despite his considerable strength, the Azure Corpse Wolves were far faster. Before he could reach the battlefield's edge, they had already surrounded him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">"Thief Technique-Spatial Pass!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Sun Lingtong activated his signature technique, but the effect was limited, teleporting him only about a hundred steps away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">The three Azure Corpse Wolf leaders paused briefly, momentarily surprised, but quickly resumed their pursuit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Sun Lingtong felt dizzy, shaking his head vigorously before continuing his frantic escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">By the time the wolf leaders caught up to him again, he had already distanced himself from the chaotic battlefield. After several rounds of dangerous exchanges, Sun Lingtong seized an opening, employing his thief technique once more to break free from encirclement and continue his desperate flight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Battling and retreating repeatedly, Sun Lingtong eventually saw the Wolf King raise its head and howl sharply. Hearing this command, the three wolf leaders stopped without hesitation, swiftly abandoning their chase and returning to regroup with their main pack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Sun Lingtong wasn't the only one who had managed to escape; others had fled similarly. But many more were still embroiled in the fight, clearly destined for a grim fate under the organized, ruthless wolf pack attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">Cultivation, hunting, survival-the harsh realities of the present and the future unfolded abruptly before Sun Lingtong, teaching him a stark lesson.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">After escaping with his life, Sun Lingtong paused at a safe distance, gasping and panting heavily, battered and worn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">This ordeal had allowed him to gauge his true strength clearly. He was not a genuine soul cultivator, and his soul's foundation was inherently shallow. Even with his ability to use thief techniques, his current body was incompatible. His combat strength was limited to the Foundation Establishment level. In a direct confrontation against three wolf leaders of similar rank, he faced certain annihilation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Yet, narrowly escaping death brought forth a tingling exhilaration throughout his body, an excitement he found oddly intoxicating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">"Now this is cultivation-this is what life is all about!" Savoring the lingering thrill of the adventure, Sun Lingtong pressed onward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">Occasionally, black snow would fall, brief yet consistently triggering brutal battles among ghostly beings vying fiercely for each flake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">Having witnessed this repeatedly, Sun Lingtong felt increasingly conflicted. "They keep praising the Lord of Forgotten River, but isn't their frequent demise orchestrated by him? This ruler of the Underworld truly is cunning-he stirs up such intense slaughter yet his reputation only grows."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">The sound of flowing water steadily grew louder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">Finally, the expansive view of a great river entered Sun Lingtong's vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Flowing majestically from the northwest to the southeast, this river was over a hundred miles wide, its edges impossible to perceive horizontally. Vertically, the space appeared distorted, creating an awe-inspiring yet eerie ambiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">The river water was dark greenish-black, reminiscent of molten bronze, and despite its swift flow, it conveyed a heavy, oppressive feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">The riverbanks consisted of extensive black stone embankments, each stone intricately engraved with countless tadpole-shaped runes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Though it was his first visit, Sun Lingtong immediately recognized it: "The Forgotten River!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">He was correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">This was indeed the famed, foremost river of the Underworld-Forgotten River-frequently documented throughout various mortal texts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Upon approaching the riverbank, Sun Lingtong's eyes narrowed slightly: "Someone's here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">He spotted a burly ghost cultivator squatting on the stone embankment, fishing patiently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">The ghost cultivator was massive-even squatting, he loomed taller than Sun Lingtong's current form, suggesting that standing upright, he would undoubtedly appear as a giant among ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">His fishing rod was bizarrely crafted from a spine, refined into a crying-mourning staff artifact. The fishing line was grotesquely composed of numerous stitched-together baby umbilical cords.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Suddenly, there was a tug on the line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">The ghost cultivator laughed heartily, instantly awakening from his lazy daze, vigorously yanking up the rod.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Splash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">The water erupted gently, spraying waves as an object surfaced-astonishingly, it was a large bowl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"Nascent Soul level!" Sun Lingtong's pupils constricted sharply, immediately recognizing the powerful aura emitted by the ghost cultivator during his catch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">If it had been Ning Zhuo, he would have carefully kept his distance already. Yet Sun Lingtong couldn't resist lingering, his eyes locked curiously on the large bowl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">"What is that bowl?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">"Little Zhuo, I've never seen anyone fish up artifacts before!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">"If I could learn this fishing technique, wouldn't I get rich fishing by the river every day?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Just as Sun Lingtong was privately chatting with Ning Zhuo, the ghost cultivator who was fishing slowly turned his head, staring directly at Sun Lingtong. "You want it? Hehe, meeting is fate-here, I'll give it to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">As he spoke, he handed the bowl over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Even though they were clearly hundreds of steps apart, in the very next moment, Sun Lingtong found himself standing right before the ghost cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Sun Lingtong's heart jolted violently in shock and confusion, yet his hand reacted swiftly, reaching directly out to grasp the bowl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">It truly was a magical artifact!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">"This is a Dust-Cleansing Cup, meant for holding Granny Meng's Soup. The river has plenty. But since an artifact-level item is quite valuable to you, I'll simply give it away." The giant ghost cultivator generously showed goodwill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Sun Lingtong remained fully alert, respectfully clasping his hands in gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">The giant ghost cultivator casually remarked, "Fishing out a Dust-Cleansing Cup isn't difficult. The truly rare catch from this river is the Obsession Bone Carp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Sun Lingtong, intrigued, blurted out, "Senior, what's an Obsession Bone Carp?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">The giant ghost cultivator snorted lightly. "You should know that although the River of Oblivion is vast, very few beings can survive within it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">"The Obsession Bone Carp is one of those rare beings. It's born from the strongest, most stubborn emotions-obsessions, grievances, deep hatred, unresolved expectations, and lingering memories-that countless ghosts lose and drop into the river when they approach it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">"Look here in my fish basket-I have one right now!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
