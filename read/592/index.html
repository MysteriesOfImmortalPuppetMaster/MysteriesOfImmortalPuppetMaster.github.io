Bang!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong charged headlong at the paper general, only to slam into it like a child ramming into a stone wall. His head spun, and even his soul trembled in dizziness.<br/>
"Ouch, ouch, ouch!"<br/>
<br/>
He grimaced in pain, and it took a long moment for his spirit to steady itself, his face gradually returning to normal.<br/>
<br/>
"What's going on?" A sinking feeling crept into Sun Lingtong's heart.<br/>
<br/>
Carefully, he stretched out his lotus-root-like arm, gently pressing against the paper general's chest. It felt as solid as rock beneath his touch.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, who observed closely through their Life Hanging by a Thread, quickly advised, "Take it easy, Boss. This isn't some kind of trap or formation-your soul cultivation is just insufficient. You aren't a soul cultivator. Ah, had I known earlier, I would have given you some ghostly nourishment."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had already guessed the truth, rolling his eyes dramatically, "I'm the one who refused! The last body tempering boosted my physique substantially. If I boosted my soul now with ghostly nourishment, how would I possibly cross the crucial threshold of turning virtual into reality?"<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, Sun Lingtong had reached the final stage of Foundation Establishment. Once he crossed this stage, he would form his Golden Core.<br/>
<br/>
But this final step depended heavily on his underlying foundation.<br/>
<br/>
To form the Golden Core, he needed his illusory core to fully solidify-this required perfect balance.<br/>
<br/>
If one excessively strengthened their physical body or soul before this crucial step, achieving perfect balance would become nearly impossible, preventing the illusory core from solidifying properly.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had already faced setbacks due to the convenience methods he personally devised for Ning Zhuo and external pressures that significantly enhanced his physical cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
These factors had considerably delayed his progress towards achieving a true Golden Core.<br/>
<br/>
The Thousand Peak Forest campaign in Two Note Kingdom had sparked a deep hunger in Sun Lingtong for quicker advancement.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, despite the exceptional opportunities to enhance his soul cultivation in White Paper City, he restrained himself, aiming to first cross into the Golden Core realm properly.<br/>
<br/>
After successfully entering Golden Core, it would be fine to strengthen his physical and spiritual foundations.<br/>
<br/>
After all, Sun Lingtong's primary cultivation method was the Virgin Boy Technique, dedicated solely to cultivating the Sea of Consciousness, in which he had already achieved deep mastery.<br/>
<br/>
One's primary cultivation method determined the true strength of their foundation. Advancing prematurely, even slightly below perfection, could degrade the quality of the Golden Core and destabilize one's foundation.<br/>
<br/>
For Sun Lingtong, physical cultivation could wait without compromising his fundamental stability.<br/>
<br/>
His planning was meticulous, yet who could have anticipated such a situation?<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Sun Lingtong could only helplessly watch the Nascent Soul-level paper general, unable to enter it due to his insufficient soul strength.<br/>
<br/>
His frustration made his spiritual form appear visibly puffier.<br/>
<br/>
"Infuriating!" After several failed attempts, Sun Lingtong bitterly shifted his attention elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
He placed his tiny hand onto the deity-like paper soldiers upon the chariot-each possessed Golden Core-level strength-but his touch felt like pressing against sturdy armor, utterly impenetrable.<br/>
<br/>
Even more agitated, Sun Lingtong turned to survey other options.<br/>
<br/>
His gaze skipped past spear-and-shield soldiers and crossbowmen, finally settling upon a paper cavalryman atop a bull mount.<br/>
<br/>
Climbing onto the bull, he touched the paper cavalryman, feeling resistance as thin as a windowpane. With slight effort, he punctured through, instantly merging his spirit into the paper cavalryman.<br/>
<br/>
The cavalryman immediately sprang to life, transforming dramatically from simple paper and wood into a robust Yin Soldier.<br/>
<br/>
The soldier was large and burly, but his eyes sparkled mischievously, sharply contrasting his imposing physique.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt like he had donned an oversized cotton robe, quite uncomfortable and cumbersome.<br/>
<br/>
Disappointedly, he realized he could control only the rider; the bull mount beneath him remained a lifeless paper construction.<br/>
<br/>
Leaping down, he noticed his landing felt significantly shorter than usual, his body now considerably taller.<br/>
<br/>
Shaking his shoulders, Sun Lingtong's earlier annoyance vanished rapidly, replaced by eager curiosity and anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
"Woo-hoo! Underworld, here I come!" Under Ning Zhuo's attentive watch, Sun Lingtong prepared to set out.<br/>
<br/>
"Wait a moment, Boss. I'll use the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern to teleport you out. This spot is well-hidden; leaving openly would leave traces," Ning Zhuo suddenly reminded.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong readily agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Activating the palace lantern, Ning Zhuo swiftly sent Sun Lingtong ten miles away.<br/>
<br/>
The Underworld stretched out, barren and desolate.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt as though he were trudging through an endless wasteland, the monotonous scenery rapidly dampening his spirits.<br/>
<br/>
"What's that sound?" His ears perked up, catching the faint trickle of running water.<br/>
<br/>
Deciding quickly, he turned toward the sound. Anything was better than aimless wandering.<br/>
<br/>
Midway, the skies suddenly darkened as black snow began to fall.<br/>
<br/>
Curious, Sun Lingtong stretched out his hand, discovering flakes of burned paper ash drifting down.<br/>
<br/>
Surprisingly, as the ashes touched his paper-crafted body, they infused him with threads of strength.<br/>
<br/>
Alerted by the mysterious black snow, countless Underworld creatures emerged from hiding: ghost hounds, disembodied heads, and even bull-headed humanoid specters.<br/>
<br/>
"Again! It's happening again!"<br/>
<br/>
"The Governor of Forgotten River really outdid himself this time, holding such a grand ceremony. We profit every day now!"<br/>
<br/>
"This one's mine-don't touch it!"<br/>
<br/>
The black snow didn't last long, but it was enough to ignite fierce competition among the creatures.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a pack of Blue Corpse Wolves surrounded many ghosts. Their leader, a behemoth larger than an elephant, roared intimidatingly. At Golden Core strength, it threatened, "Hand over your black snow or prepare to become our dinner!"<br/>
<br/>
This outright robbery instantly sparked conflict. Chaos erupted as battles commenced.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong found himself caught up in the turmoil, forced to fight.<br/>
<br/>
Three Qi Refining-stage Blue Corpse Wolves swiftly encircled him, charging in a triangular formation and leaving trails of eerie green phosphorescent flames behind.<br/>
<br/>
Grinning lightly, Sun Lingtong waited until the wolves were nearly upon him before unleashing his true strength, revealing a sudden surge from Qi Refining directly to Peak Foundation Establishment.<br/>
<br/>
Unperturbed, the wolves pressed their attack. Sun Lingtong deftly sidestepped the frontal assault, then counterattacked sharply-his fists thundered through the air, crushing two wolf heads simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
Pivoting quickly, he stomped heavily upon the third wolf's back, splitting its body cleanly in half.<br/>
<br/>
Delighted, Sun Lingtong admired his fists, realizing the exquisite quality of this paper puppet body, clearly at the pinnacle of Foundation Establishment.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing him effortlessly dispatch three Qi Refining wolves, a Foundation Establishment wolf leader-large as a calf-howled furiously and surged toward him. Employing ghostly techniques, its speed dramatically increased, trailing shadows behind.<br/>
<br/>
"Come at me!" Sun Lingtong, intrigued and excited, refused to dodge. Raising his arms, he met the wolf's fierce charge head-on.<br/>
<br/>
With a decisive headbutt, he knocked the wolf's skull backward. Enraged, the wolf snapped viciously toward Sun Lingtong's head.<br/>
<br/>
Crunch!<br/>
<br/>
The bite met only air.<br/>
<br/>
Anticipating this, Sun Lingtong had ducked low. His compacted form suddenly expanded as he drove upward, channeling immense force through his spine, delivering a powerful uppercut.<br/>
<br/>
The wolf leader flew skyward, then crashed heavily back onto the chaotic battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
This spectacle halted many fighters mid-motion. Even the Wolf King's gaze fixed on Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Growling commands, the Wolf King sent three more Foundation Establishment leaders charging toward him.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong flexed his fists, feeling numbness set in. He knew he'd sufficiently tested the paper puppet body's limits.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong spotted the three Foundation Establishment-stage Azure Corpse Wolves, and when he saw the Wolf King staring at him with haunting eyes, he decisively turned around and fled!<br/>
<br/>
Despite his considerable strength, the Azure Corpse Wolves were far faster. Before he could reach the battlefield's edge, they had already surrounded him.<br/>
<br/>
"Thief Technique-Spatial Pass!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong activated his signature technique, but the effect was limited, teleporting him only about a hundred steps away.<br/>
<br/>
The three Azure Corpse Wolf leaders paused briefly, momentarily surprised, but quickly resumed their pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt dizzy, shaking his head vigorously before continuing his frantic escape.<br/>
<br/>
By the time the wolf leaders caught up to him again, he had already distanced himself from the chaotic battlefield. After several rounds of dangerous exchanges, Sun Lingtong seized an opening, employing his thief technique once more to break free from encirclement and continue his desperate flight.<br/>
<br/>
Battling and retreating repeatedly, Sun Lingtong eventually saw the Wolf King raise its head and howl sharply. Hearing this command, the three wolf leaders stopped without hesitation, swiftly abandoning their chase and returning to regroup with their main pack.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong wasn't the only one who had managed to escape; others had fled similarly. But many more were still embroiled in the fight, clearly destined for a grim fate under the organized, ruthless wolf pack attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivation, hunting, survival-the harsh realities of the present and the future unfolded abruptly before Sun Lingtong, teaching him a stark lesson.<br/>
<br/>
After escaping with his life, Sun Lingtong paused at a safe distance, gasping and panting heavily, battered and worn.<br/>
<br/>
This ordeal had allowed him to gauge his true strength clearly. He was not a genuine soul cultivator, and his soul's foundation was inherently shallow. Even with his ability to use thief techniques, his current body was incompatible. His combat strength was limited to the Foundation Establishment level. In a direct confrontation against three wolf leaders of similar rank, he faced certain annihilation.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, narrowly escaping death brought forth a tingling exhilaration throughout his body, an excitement he found oddly intoxicating.<br/>
<br/>
"Now this is cultivation-this is what life is all about!" Savoring the lingering thrill of the adventure, Sun Lingtong pressed onward.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, black snow would fall, brief yet consistently triggering brutal battles among ghostly beings vying fiercely for each flake.<br/>
<br/>
Having witnessed this repeatedly, Sun Lingtong felt increasingly conflicted. "They keep praising the Lord of Forgotten River, but isn't their frequent demise orchestrated by him? This ruler of the Underworld truly is cunning-he stirs up such intense slaughter yet his reputation only grows."<br/>
<br/>
The sound of flowing water steadily grew louder.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the expansive view of a great river entered Sun Lingtong's vision.<br/>
<br/>
Flowing majestically from the northwest to the southeast, this river was over a hundred miles wide, its edges impossible to perceive horizontally. Vertically, the space appeared distorted, creating an awe-inspiring yet eerie ambiance.<br/>
<br/>
The river water was dark greenish-black, reminiscent of molten bronze, and despite its swift flow, it conveyed a heavy, oppressive feeling.<br/>
<br/>
The riverbanks consisted of extensive black stone embankments, each stone intricately engraved with countless tadpole-shaped runes.<br/>
<br/>
Though it was his first visit, Sun Lingtong immediately recognized it: "The Forgotten River!"<br/>
<br/>
He was correct.<br/>
<br/>
This was indeed the famed, foremost river of the Underworld-Forgotten River-frequently documented throughout various mortal texts.<br/>
<br/>
Upon approaching the riverbank, Sun Lingtong's eyes narrowed slightly: "Someone's here."<br/>
<br/>
He spotted a burly ghost cultivator squatting on the stone embankment, fishing patiently.<br/>
<br/>
The ghost cultivator was massive-even squatting, he loomed taller than Sun Lingtong's current form, suggesting that standing upright, he would undoubtedly appear as a giant among ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
His fishing rod was bizarrely crafted from a spine, refined into a crying-mourning staff artifact. The fishing line was grotesquely composed of numerous stitched-together baby umbilical cords.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, there was a tug on the line.<br/>
<br/>
The ghost cultivator laughed heartily, instantly awakening from his lazy daze, vigorously yanking up the rod.<br/>
<br/>
Splash!<br/>
<br/>
The water erupted gently, spraying waves as an object surfaced-astonishingly, it was a large bowl.<br/>
<br/>
"Nascent Soul level!" Sun Lingtong's pupils constricted sharply, immediately recognizing the powerful aura emitted by the ghost cultivator during his catch.<br/>
<br/>
If it had been Ning Zhuo, he would have carefully kept his distance already. Yet Sun Lingtong couldn't resist lingering, his eyes locked curiously on the large bowl.<br/>
<br/>
"What is that bowl?"<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, I've never seen anyone fish up artifacts before!"<br/>
<br/>
"If I could learn this fishing technique, wouldn't I get rich fishing by the river every day?"<br/>
<br/>
Just as Sun Lingtong was privately chatting with Ning Zhuo, the ghost cultivator who was fishing slowly turned his head, staring directly at Sun Lingtong. "You want it? Hehe, meeting is fate-here, I'll give it to you."<br/>
<br/>
As he spoke, he handed the bowl over.<br/>
<br/>
Even though they were clearly hundreds of steps apart, in the very next moment, Sun Lingtong found himself standing right before the ghost cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's heart jolted violently in shock and confusion, yet his hand reacted swiftly, reaching directly out to grasp the bowl.<br/>
<br/>
It truly was a magical artifact!<br/>
<br/>
"This is a Dust-Cleansing Cup, meant for holding Granny Meng's Soup. The river has plenty. But since an artifact-level item is quite valuable to you, I'll simply give it away." The giant ghost cultivator generously showed goodwill.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong remained fully alert, respectfully clasping his hands in gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
The giant ghost cultivator casually remarked, "Fishing out a Dust-Cleansing Cup isn't difficult. The truly rare catch from this river is the Obsession Bone Carp."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, intrigued, blurted out, "Senior, what's an Obsession Bone Carp?"<br/>
<br/>
The giant ghost cultivator snorted lightly. "You should know that although the River of Oblivion is vast, very few beings can survive within it."<br/>
<br/>
"The Obsession Bone Carp is one of those rare beings. It's born from the strongest, most stubborn emotions-obsessions, grievances, deep hatred, unresolved expectations, and lingering memories-that countless ghosts lose and drop into the river when they approach it."<br/>
<br/>
"Look here in my fish basket-I have one right now!"</div></body></html></div>
