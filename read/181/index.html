<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"More money?" Zhu Xuanji laughed heartily, "That's negotiable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">However, when Zheng Shuangjun reported the specific amount of spirit stones, Zhu Xuanji's expression changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He looked astonished, his eyes askingâ€”are you serious?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Thus, the second negotiation fell through because Zheng Shuangjun's asking price was too high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Both parties agreed to reconsider and scheduled a third meeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"These local cultivation families..." Zhu Xuanji gritted his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After the recruitment order, his pressure increased exponentially.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">More and more cultivators were flooding into Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and the City Lord's Mansion had successfully recruited several Golden Core Stage cultivators with profound expertise in mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">These Golden Core Stage cultivators entered the Lava Immortal Palace, working closely together, catching up to Zhu Xuanji at a visible speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhu Xuanji knew very well that this was the Meng family's ploy, using this method to bring in reinforcements to help Meng Kui compete for the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Zheng family needed the Lava Immortal Palace to gain influence over Fire Persimmon Immortal City!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Zhu Xuanji's plan was to retrieve the lost Golden Core mechanical puppet demon general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Using the Tracing Origin Technique, he saw that the demon general puppet was lost deep within Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">That area was the royal court of the Fire Melting Apes, ruled by a Golden Core Stage demon ape king, with other Golden Core Stage demon apes present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In such a situation, Zhu Xuanji alone could not retrieve the puppet demon general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Therefore, he discussed with the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families, seeking the help of five Golden Core Stage cultivators to jointly attack the Fire Melting Apes' lair in Fire Persimmon Mountain and reclaim the puppet demon general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The first negotiation failed, and the second one also faced setbacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zhu Xuanji, being a divine constable, pondered for a while and realized, "The three families are stalling for time. After all, venturing into Fire Persimmon Mountain with me is a life-threatening risk."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"They want to confirm if there's another opportunity. If the opportunity is significant, they won't agree to risk their lives with me. This means the three families' reformation teams must be planning something big."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zhou Family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Underground hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">All members of the three families' reformation teams gathered, listening attentively to Zheng Hua teaching them the "Ghost Weapon Cultivation Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Remember, operating this technique will cut off thirty percent of your soul. During this period, you will experience extreme pain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Our clan has prepared corresponding pills for you. If you can't endure it, you can take one to alleviate the pain. But I don't recommend doing so."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Because the pain signifies the close connection between the soul fragments. Maintaining this connection is very helpful for forging the ghost martial weapon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"But if you take the pill, it will greatly weaken this connection. Even if the ghost martial weapon is forged, it won't be perfectly compatible with your body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Of course, if necessary, you must take the pill. Passing out from the pain would have even more severe consequences!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zheng Hua explained in detail and then took out his own ghost martial weapon to show everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Afterward, he had a Zhou family reformation team cultivator cut off a portion of his soul and use soul power to forge his own ghost martial weapon in front of everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">After understanding and mastering this unique forging technique, some began tempering their weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"It hurts, my heavens!" The first person to try, under countless eyes, did not take the pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">As a result, he rolled his eyes and fainted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Fortunately, Zheng Hua and others were closely monitoring and intervened in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The fainted cultivator quickly stabilized under their treatment, avoiding life-threatening backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Seeing this live example and the bloody lesson, the other reformation team cultivators chose a more conservative approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">If they couldn't endure the pain, they immediately swallowed the pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Ahâ€”!" Ning Yong screamed, his voice hoarse, but he didn't take the pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In contrast, Ning Chen, after experiencing a bit of the soul-cutting pain, immediately swallowed the pill hidden under his tongue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo carefully pondered the essence and did not act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He looked at the other geniuses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zheng Jian, a member of the Zheng family, had long used the Ghost Weapon Cultivation Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He displayed a ghost martial bow in front of everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhou Zhu, Zhou Zeshen operated the technique one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhou Zhu groaned, and Zhou Zeshen's brows furrowed, his face twisted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Both endured without taking the pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Xiaohui looked at Ning Zhuo and sneered, "How long will you wait? Are you afraid, Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo smiled, "You are the main branch of the Ning family, and I am just a collateral branch. Of course, I should let you go first. Otherwise, if you lose to me again, wouldn't it disgrace the entire main branch?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Provoked by Ning Zhuo, Ning Xiaohui laughed heartily this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">She displayed a ghost sword, "Open your dog eyes wide and see clearly what this is!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Seeing this, Zhou Zeshen's pupils shrank, confirming that the Ning and Zheng families were very close and had already cooperated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo was slightly surprised, then sneered, "You got the tempering technique early and used it for yourself, forgetting about the rest of our reformation team."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"You secretly forged it and took the pill without anyone knowing. Clever, well done."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Xiaohui's face turned pale with anger, "Insolent! You, a mere collateral branch, dare to slander the main branch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo: "Then prove to everyone that you didn't secretly take the pill while tempering the ghost martial weapon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Xiaohui was about to retort when Ning Xie finally couldn't stand it, "Enough! There's no need to argue over this. Ning Zhuo, why haven't you started?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Or do you need my help?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, stopped talking, and began operating the tempering technique in front of everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">His body trembled slightly, thirty percent of his soul was cut off, the pain was excruciating, but he only furrowed his brows, his eyes firm and unwavering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"I did it, I did it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Look at my ghost martial hammer, uh, why is it so small?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"I wanted to forge a sword, but why did I get a small knife?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zheng Jian, Zheng Hua, and others witnessed various results of the ghost martial tempering, their expressions unchanged, as they had expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"What?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"What's going on!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Ning Zhuo, you..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo successfully tempered a giant ghost axe floating in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The axe was enormous, like a door had been taken down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Such a huge ghost axe stood in stark contrast to the tiny ghost martial weapons around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zheng Jian, Ning Xiaohui's ghost martial weapons were instantly overshadowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Their ghost martial weapons were just normal-sized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Brother Zhuo is mighty!" Ning Yong was the first to cheer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Soon, the Ning family's collateral branch cultivators laughed and cheered, sincerely happy for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Zhou Zeshen looked at his normal-sized soul fan and couldn't help but ask, "Brother Ning, why is your soul so vast and abundant?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Thanks to the contributions of the Soul Devouring Sect cultivators," Ning Zhuo didn't reveal the truth, only saying, "I've recently realized that after each exploration of the Immortal Palace, my soul is consumed. When it fully recovers, it seems to be more abundant than before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Everyone was speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">After a few breaths of silence, someone suddenly asked, "Brother Ning Zhuo, what is your innate talent?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"I don't know either," Ning Zhuo spread his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">An undetected innate talent was his best and most convenient excuse!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly and turned her head away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">With the ghost martial weapons forged, Zheng Hua distributed various pills, mainly to heal the soul or accelerate its recovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Then, under the guidance of another Zheng family elder, everyone actively practiced using the ghost martial weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Afterward, they practiced mechanical constructs, tactical drills, and more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">After several days, the reformation team was completely transformed! Their combat power surged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The three family heads urged repeatedly, and the reformation team set off for the Immortal Palace without rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The puppets arrived at the first gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">They lined up orderly to receive their rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Everyone moved quickly and without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">This was because the reward options and quantities had been discussed and predetermined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Room one, room two, room three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"No mechanical apes found!" Everyone cheered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">They happily entered the first preparation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The cultivators divided their tasks, led by Ning Zhuo and Zheng Jian, working hard to create various mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Room four, room five, room six.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In the second preparation room, the cultivators bought higher-grade materials and made more constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Room seven, room eight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Finally encountered."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Room eight is much deeper than we imagined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"We will win this battle!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The three families united, their morale soaring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Yuan Dasheng roared and charged at the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The three families united, fully alert, as if facing a great enemy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Thunderbolt crossbows, fire!" Zheng Jin shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">In the team, eight bed crossbows instantly activated, arrows covered in lightning shot out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Eight bolts of lightning shot straight out, hitting the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng's movements halted, pierced by eight lightning-covered eight-foot-long arrows, the arrows embedded deep into the floor, pinning Yuan Dasheng in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Yuan Dasheng struggled, but the powerful electric currents made him convulse, broken mechanical parts spilling from his wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Success!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Hahaha, didn't expect a one-hit kill."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"The thunderbolt crossbows are amazing, even though they can only fire once, their power is extraordinary, truly worth it." Everyone cheered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Hurry, dismantle the mechanical ape."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Don't let the electric current damage the interior, we need more information!" Several cultivators rushed forward.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
