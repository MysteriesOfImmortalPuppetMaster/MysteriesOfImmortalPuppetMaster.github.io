<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"What's going on here?" Bai Liu, Kong, and the others were stunned, their gazes fixed on the Golden Core in Ning Zhuo's hand as if glued to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">With difficulty, they shifted their attention from the Golden Core to Ning Zhuo himself. Their expressions were now different from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo had revealed his true strength!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">After all, this was their first meeting. Respect was earned through appearance first, then through character.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo observed their changing expressions, knowing his strategy had succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"I won first place in the Flying Cloud Minor Trial and obtained the Intent Comprehension Brush, yet I am not a Confucian cultivator but an outsider."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"This situation could easily incite jealousy, envy, and resentment among the Confucian cultivators toward me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Therefore, I needed to demonstrate extraordinary strength, making them realize that even as an outsider, I am a formidable power. My victory was natural and unsurprising."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This was Ning Zhuo's calculated plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Of course, he genuinely intended to propose a trade as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Innate Talent Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This method used one's innate talent as a foundation, supplemented by specific techniques, to unlock even greater or more profound powers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Casting spells didn't rely solely on spiritual energy; many precious materials could also be used.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo's Weather Orb: Ice Crystal Snow, for example, could consume his Soul to summon a freezing blizzard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">During the Flying Cloud Minor Trial organized by Chu Xuangui, Ning Zhuo personally witnessed Kong Ran using his Early Wisdom Talent to cast spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Until then, Ning Zhuo had only used his Early Wisdom Talent in its most basic form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He had always wanted to develop his Early Wisdom Talent further, believing that with proper refinement, it could eventually evolve into a Divine Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Every Innate Talent requires development, and there are techniques for doing so. Once developed, it becomes a Divine Art, greatly benefiting cultivators!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo had long understood this principle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">However, in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he lacked the resources and qualifications to develop his Early Wisdom Talent. Moreover, doing so carried significant risks, as he needed to maintain his disguise, constantly suppress his true nature, and bide his time for the opportunity to seize the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">After the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace temporarily subsided, Ning Zhuo left Fire Persimmon Immortal City to travel the world. His primary goal was to revive his mother, leaving him with no time to focus on developing his Innate Talent. He even neglected his cultivation somewhat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Confucian cultivator's Minor Trial yielded four significant gains for Ning Zhuo: the Intent Comprehension Brush, the elevation of his reputation, making a dazzling debut within Confucian cultivator circles, his observation of Chu Xuangui's righteous methods, which he eagerly studied, and the revelation that Kong Ran possessed not only the Innate Talent for Early Wisdom but also the corresponding Innate Talent Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Kong Ran withdrew his gaze and slowly shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, the Myriad Manifestations Cradle is no simple matter!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo raised an eyebrow, secretly memorizing the name of this spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Kong Ran continued, "After using the Myriad Manifestations Cradle, I perceive all things in the world as if I were a newborn infant. It's like experiencing everything for the first time, allowing me to gain deeper insights and guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"As the saying goes: 'Man follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows itself.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"All things contain the Dao and Principle, offering guidance to cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"This is why some cultivators can observe landscapes and comprehend the Dao, even deriving world-shaking spells from a single mountain stone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Kong Ran shifted his focus back to his original point. "The true purpose of the Myriad Manifestations Cradle is to treat the universe as my cradle, with all things serving as sources of enlightenment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"I often use it to study the Confucian Classics, gaining fresh perspectives and profound insights each time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"It's an invaluable tool for learning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Kong Ran shook his head thoughtfully. "In truth, my family possesses more than just this Innate Talent Art. We have other methods developed around the Innate Talent for Early Wisdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">After this lengthy preamble, Kong Ran finally revealed his true intention. "If you sell me the Intent Comprehension Brush, I'll agree to trade you the Myriad Manifestations Cradle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Let's talk!" "Of course, we can discuss the specific details of the transaction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo shook his head without hesitation. "The Intent Comprehension Brush is not for sale."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Mr. Chu Xuangui has high expectations of me. How could I possibly let him down?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Absolutely not."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Liu Fushu chimed in, "If you ask me, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, you've already cultivated other methods. Unless you practice them concurrently..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Otherwise, you'll never possess a Literary Heart, Literary Palace, or Literary Qi. Without these, you can't truly be considered a Confucian cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"As for Mr. Chu Xuangui's expectations, I privately believe they're merely part of his own experiment. You shouldn't take them so seriously."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Seeing Liu Fushu speak on his behalf, Kong Ran immediately cast him a grateful glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He often lamented why cultivators couldn't practice more cultivation arts. Someone like him, who had cultivated only three, was already an extreme exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo was a diligent learner and genuinely wanted to experience what it felt like to become a Confucian cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">In truth, he also wanted to learn the Myriad Phenomena Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Unfortunately, all three of his dantian were already occupied by cultivation arts. Back in White Paper Immortal City, he had to have Sun Lingtong cultivate it concurrently on his behalf.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Snapping out of his thoughts, Ning Zhuo saw Kong Ran looking at him with anticipation. He shook his head again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Neither Liu Fushu nor Kong Ran knew the full story.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Currently, the Confucian cultivators of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, entrusted by Wen Ruanyu and acting in their own self-interest, were fully committed to supporting Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Chu Xuangui had already succeeded, at least in the Flying Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Under these circumstances, if Ning Zhuo were to falter now, how could he explain himself to the Confucian cultivators? How could he face Wen Ruanyu?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Although Ning Zhuo hadn't secretly communicated with Chu Xuangui through divine sense transmission during the entire process, he had personally witnessed Chu Xuangui's meticulous efforts. In response, Ning Zhuo felt compelled to demonstrate his utmost sincerity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo said, "Fellow Daoists, I, Ning Zhuo, intend to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect and dedicate myself to cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"If I were to rashly sell the Intent Comprehension Brush to someone else, what would Mr. Chu Xuangui think? What would the other Confucian cultivators of the sect think of me? Would they believe that an outsider like me disregards their sacred treasures?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"I wish to cultivate good karma, not antagonize the Confucian cultivators of the Myriad Manifestations Sect before even formally joining."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Kong Ran couldn't hide his disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo's tone shifted again. "Though I cannot sell it to Fellow Daoist Kongran, I can lend it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Lending you the brush could also aid your cultivation, wouldn't it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Before Kongran could reply, Liu Fushu interjected, "That won't work."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"The Intent Comprehension Brush isn't like ordinary magic treasures. It requires personal refinement to effectively emulate and comprehend its intent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo smiled. "That's a minor issue."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Each time I lend it, I'll voluntarily step back and assist Fellow Daoist Kongran in fully refining the treasure. Problem solved, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Liu Fushu paused, slightly taken aback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Kongran stared at Ning Zhuo, blurting out, "Aren't you afraid I'll refine it and never return it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo replied, "With ordinary cultivators, I'd be concerned, but Fellow Daoist Kongran is no ordinary person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Firstly, you're renowned as a prodigy and about to join the Confucian Sect - a true gentleman."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Secondly, you're the son of the Prime Minister. If you defaulted, I wouldn't even need to confront your father. Simply spreading the news would suffice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Thirdly, we can sign a contract. An extra layer of security never hurts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Kong Ran paused, slightly taken aback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Logically, Ning Zhuo's proposal made perfect sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But refining the brush after each use would be such a hassle... The thought surfaced in Kong Ran's mind, only to quickly dissipate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He realized, If I could actually borrow the Intent Comprehension Brush, I'd gladly endure ten times the trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Bai Jiyun spoke up from the side, "There's something I must remind you both."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Though the Intent Comprehension Brush is a magic treasure, it isn't particularly durable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"The Scholar's Four Treasures - brush, ink, paper, and inkstone - are all inherently consumable. It's just that brushes and inkstones withstand wear better than paper and ink."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"If you two share this brush, its lifespan will inevitably be shortened, preventing it from lasting long in this world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Kong Ran immediately shot Bai Jiyun a sidelong glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He had known this all along but had deliberately kept it to himself, fearing Ning Zhuo might change his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Kong Ran felt a surge of resentment toward Bai Jiyun, feeling betrayed that his friend was prioritizing the interests of an outsider.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo, however, reacted with delight rather than dismay. "Consuming a treasured brush to achieve success is a price worth paying."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"From another perspective, it's precisely this limitation that makes the Intent Comprehension Brush even more valuable, and why Fellow Daoist Kongran desires to trade for it even more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo turned to Kong Ran. "I'll lend you the brush. In return, you'll teach me the Innate Talent Method. What do you say?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Kong Ran's heart stirred. He was about to agree when Bai Jiyun interjected, "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, wouldn't lending out the Intent Comprehension Brush be a betrayal of Mr. Chu Xuangui's trust?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"What if you fail to meet the required standards and Mr. Chu Xuangui can't recommend you to attempt the Primordial Seal Stele?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">For the first time, Bai Jiyun displayed a sharpness he had never shown before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo smiled nonchalantly. "Thank you for your concern, Fellow Daoist Bai. It's simple: I'll just meet the standards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"While I currently have few clues about meeting Mr. Chu Xuangui's standards, I refuse to believe that using the Intent Comprehension Brush a few fewer times will disqualify me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Cultivation encompasses ten thousand methods, a thousand schools, a hundred arts, ten Daos, and one self!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Even relying solely on my innate talent and comprehension, I can still meet Mr. Chu Xuangui's standards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"The Intent Comprehension Brush, though important, has never been the key to success."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran were all stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Their gazes fixed on Ning Zhuo, they couldn't help but scrutinize him again. When they first met him, their strongest impression had been that he was an "outsider," and they had looked down on him for not knowing his place, for daring to participate in the Confucian Flying Cloud Minor Trial and trying to gain an unfair advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Later, when Ning Zhuo truly demonstrated exceptional talent, all three of them were quite surprised. By the time he ultimately won, their emotions had become complex: shock, resentment, doubt, admiration, recognition... a mix of everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Just moments ago, after accepting Ning Zhuo's invitation and engaging in conversation, their goodwill toward him had grown, and they had all assumed he was a scion of a great clan. But when Ning Zhuo produced the Ghost Path Golden Core, their hearts trembled, and they speculated that his current endeavor must be receiving the full backing of his family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Now, Ning Zhuo exuded extraordinary confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Had they met him for the first time under these circumstances, all three would have scoffed: Who do you think you are? You're not even a Confucian cultivator, yet you're confident you can meet the standard and then try your luck at the Primordial Seal Stele?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">But now, they were filled with admiration and speculation: Ning Zhuo's unparalleled confidence must stem from the meticulous cultivation he's received since childhood. He's clearly a genius from a great clan, having faced few setbacks, making him believe anything is possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Even if my father is the Prime Minister, the support I receive at home would never be enough to reach the Golden Core level." At that moment, even Kong Ran felt inferior to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Not to mention Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Born into poverty, Liu Fushu disliked Ning Zhuo's overflowing confidence. His pupils narrowed, and a secret anticipation of witnessing Ning Zhuo's downfall stirred within him, though he still offered a few flattering words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Bai Jiyun couldn't bring himself to say such things. He simply raised his head and took a few gulps of wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"This young man is brimming with confidence. On one hand, he must possess exceptional talent. On the other, his family's unwavering support has undoubtedly given him boundless assurance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"To casually offer a Golden Core as a deposit, his family's influence must be immense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Moreover, his proactive offer to lend Kong Ran the Intent Comprehension Brush carries deeper meaning - he's trying to cultivate connections with Kong Ran and establish ties with the Prime Minister's network."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Bai Jiyun saw through Ning Zhuo's intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">If Ning Zhuo's confidence had stung Liu Fushu, his ulterior motives left Bai Jiyun with a deep sense of unease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Bai Jiyun was also renowned as a genius, brimming with self-assurance. Yet, he preferred the life of a wandering recluse, indulging in the beauty of nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">After realizing that Ning Zhuo and he were not kindred spirits, Bai Jiyun's enthusiasm for deepening their acquaintance waned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Throughout the rest of the banquet, Kong Ran engaged Ning Zhuo in extensive discussions about pricing, showing genuine interest in the Intent Comprehension Brush transaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Liu Fushu and Bai Jiyun spent most of their time conversing with each other, occasionally interjecting to exchange remarks with Ning Zhuo and Kong Ran.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo keenly sensed the shift in Liu Fushu and Bai Jiyun's attitudes, but he remained unfazed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">I can't befriend everyone I meet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">There will always be trade-offs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Right now, engaging with Kong Ran is in my best interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">His life-and-death experiences on the battlefield had profoundly transformed Ning Zhuo, instilling in him a direct and efficient approach to interpersonal interactions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Of course, he hadn't forgotten his goal of securing transactions with Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Thank you, Fellow Daoists, for your insights. I now understand that using the Intent Comprehension Brush effectively requires more demanding requirements for the calligraphy models."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Do any of you possess rare and precious original works?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"If so, would you consider lending them to me for copying? I'm willing to negotiate fair compensation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">As Ning Zhuo spoke, he produced a second Ghost Path Golden Core and placed it on the table, startling the trio once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Bai Jiyun smiled faintly, indicating that he indeed possessed calligraphy by a renowned Confucian scholar, available for trade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Liu Fushu secretly envied them, lamenting his own lack of possessions as he could only drink and eat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Kong Ran puffed out his chest, proudly declaring that while he personally had nothing, his father's study was overflowing with such treasures. "We can discuss terms!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo then made simple agreements with Bai Jiyun and Kong Ran.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The banquet concluded with the host and guests in high spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Just as Kong Ran was about to leave, he suddenly stopped and turned to face Ning Zhuo. "Almost forgot - here, use this for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">He pulled a brush case from his robes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Opening the case, he removed his favorite writing brush and handed the empty case to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"This is my Cloud Han Resting Brush Case."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"I'm lending it to you for now. Use it to nurture the Intent Comprehension Brush. Take good care of it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Though they hadn't yet finalized the brush-lending agreement, Kong Ran already seemed more concerned about the Intent Comprehension Brush than Ning Zhuo himself.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
