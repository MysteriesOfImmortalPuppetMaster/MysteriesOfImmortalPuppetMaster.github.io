<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo carefully examined the Dao-Bearing Jade Page in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The ones produced by Xiao Juxia were far superior in quality to the ones Ning Zhuo had made during the Confucian cultivator minor trial!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">It was nine cun and nine fen long, six cun and six fen wide. It was as thin as a cicada's wing yet did not appear flimsy. Its four corners were not right angles, but slightly curved like unfurling clouds. A faint golden halo flowed along the edges, like the lining of the morning glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The base color of the paper was not pure white, but a blue-white gradient formed by the blending of "Sky Azure Mist" and "Moon Soul Silver."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo lightly stroked the paper's surface with his fingertips; it felt thirty percent warm and seventy percent cool. The warm parts felt like holding fine jade, while the cool parts were like touching autumn water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Pressing slightly harder, it felt like touching Tai Chi - supportive yet elastic, a perfect blend of hardness and softness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">When he infused spiritual energy into it, it was like throwing a stone into a deep pool; the spiritual energy was absorbed evenly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Finally, Ning Zhuo probed it with his divine sense, feeling only a sense of gentleness and inclusivity. He could faintly perceive the veins of the "Three Talents" within, cycling endlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"What a fine piece of spirit paper!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Xiao Juxia, is it..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">When Ning Zhuo had sent Gongsun Yan to purchase this kind of spirit paper, his expectations had actually been quite low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He hadn't expected the harvest to far exceed his anticipations. Not only had they found a cultivator willing to spend time making paper, but they had also directly purchased such outstanding spirit paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Just looking at these Dao-Bearing Jade Pages, I know Xiao Juxia's artifact refining standard is far above mine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Then why didn't he show it during the minor trial?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Could it be..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Combining this with Gongsun Yan's report, a glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he guessed a corner of the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"When I have time, I must personally pay a visit to Xiao Juxia."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He couldn't do it now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The third minor trial for the Confucian cultivators had made Ning Zhuo famous throughout the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate. He had also publicly returned the White Rainbow Righteous integrity Bone, leaving him with almost no breathing room before facing the Demon Subjugation Hall's second "Rising Cloud" minor trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo attached great importance to this and was full of confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Illusion-Heart Clarity Dew that Sun Lingtong had obtained from the gray-robed cultivator also seemed to be a sharp weapon in his arsenal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Rubbing the surface of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, Ning Zhuo calculated in his heart: "Since I have obtained the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages, I will attempt that route!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo shut himself in the cultivation chamber, sat cross-legged on a prayer mat, and began infusing spiritual energy and divine sense into the Dao-Bearing Jade Page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Dao-Bearing Jade Page hovered in mid-air, its blue-white gradient surface emitting a soft jade light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo closed his eyes, immersing himself in the divine sea within his Upper Dantian, excavating the Ice Element True Intent hidden within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Before long, strands of ice-blue flowing light, fine as hair, were extracted from Ning Zhuo's divine sea and infused into the Dao-Bearing Jade Page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">This wasn't the first time Ning Zhuo had received external True Intent. But this was his first time extracting his own True Intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A sense of emptiness constantly transmitted to him, making him clearly feel that his cultivation foundation was being pried at and excavated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">It felt like his strength was being drained, leaving him feeling powerless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">No, more accurately, it felt like his confidence and assurance were being drawn out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This was quite a novel sensation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">After the time it took to drink half a cup of tea, the majority of Ning Zhuo's Ice Element True Intent had been extracted and injected into the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">One Dao-Bearing Jade Page couldn't hold it all; it took a full five pages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">These five Dao-Bearing Jade Pages now had a distinct difference from the blank ones before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The color of the paper had turned a pale blue, and it was surrounded by an imperceptible, ethereal mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The tactile sensation of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page in hand was also vastly different. The originally warm and cool jade page was now silently emitting a bone-piercing chill at all times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">At the same time, it had become hard. When Ning Zhuo held it, it was like stroking a surface of ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">With a sudden thought, Ning Zhuo gently tapped two of the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages infused with Ice Element True Intent together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ding...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">A long, ringing sound, like ice crystals colliding, crisp and distant. The lingering sound echoed in the cultivation chamber for three breaths without dissipating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo turned his attention back to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He clearly felt that his understanding of principles related to "cold, ice," and so on had dulled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">A sense of weakness and emptiness welled up from the depths of his Dao foundation. It wasn't a depletion of spiritual energy, but a blankness brought about by a "lack of cognition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Subtleties he could once reach were now a blur.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But when he carefully recalled them, he could understand and remember the relevant cultivation arts, such as the Bitter Cold Sutra, the Ice Sculpture Secret Canon, and even every detail of the Proud Snow Scroll and Braving Frost Scroll were vivid in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">However...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">A strong sense of unfamiliarity lay between him and this Ice Element content. Before, he understood these thoroughly, reaching straight to the essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Now, it was as if he had memorized these contents by rote. Although they were carved into his brain and he wouldn't forget them, there was still a long distance from understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes and looked at the five Dao-Bearing Jade Pages again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">At this moment, he felt something different: a slight sense of urgency in his heart. His entire soul was silently urging him to absorb all the lost True Intent back and make himself "complete" again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The corners of Ning Zhuo's mouth tilted up slightly. Suppressing this reluctance, he revealed a faint smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Interesting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The Dao is lost from me, yet formed within the page. Wonderful..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After regulating his breath for a moment, Ning Zhuo fully digested the emptiness of his fallen realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He tapped his Storage Belt, releasing two mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The one on the left had a graceful figure, colorful armor, and six arms; it was Snow-Colored Maiden Hui. The one on the right shouldered a dragon head and wore six-cornered ice armor; it was Snow Pivot Guard Xie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo used his divine sense to manipulate objects, floating two Dao-Bearing Jade Pages toward the two mechanical puppets respectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Both mechanical puppets possessed spirituality. Under Ning Zhuo's command and control, they began to absorb the Ice Element True Intent from the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">For the first three breaths, everything went smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">But at the fourth breath, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui suddenly stiffened. Ning Zhuo instantly noticed that on the surface of the spiritual light orb within her body, countless fine ice patterns suddenly appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Reflecting on her external body, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's six arms began to tremble uncontrollably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Although the amplitude of this trembling was quite subtle, Ning Zhuo immediately terminated the infusion of True Intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Only ten percent of the True Intent in the Dao-Bearing Jade Page had vanished. However, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's spiritual light orb was thirty percent dimmer than before, and cracks like those on ice appeared on its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Her spirituality was damaged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">On the other side, Snow Pivot Guard Xie's situation was extremely similar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The damage to her spirituality was even more severe than Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"In the end... it doesn't work?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo muttered to himself, his voice drifting in the ice mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This result was within his expected possibilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Humans are the spirit of all living things; their spirituality is far, far more abundant than that of mechanical puppets, so they can accept the infusion of True Intent. But the spirituality within mechanical puppets is not sufficient to bear this True Intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"At least, that is the case for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Sigh, I need a wondrous method that can foster spirituality. Unfortunately, such methods are rare in the world, and it seems even the Myriad Manifestations Sect doesn't have one in its collection."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Never mind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo put away the two Ice Element mechanical puppets and the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He did not reabsorb the Ice Element True Intent. Instead, using Life Hanging by a Thread, he called out to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Shortly after, Sun Lingtong secretly rushed back to the Green Stone Cave Abode and sat cross-legged in front of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">His short, fleshy legs assumed the five-hearts-to-heaven posture, and his lotus-root-like arms rested on his knees. He held the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, examined it for a while, and then decisively triggered the True Intent within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ice-blue flowing light flew out from the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, infusing into the space between his eyebrows, into the divine sea of his Upper Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The whole process was very short. After a dozen breaths, the Dao-Bearing Jade Page in his hand became dull and lusterless, like ordinary paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Ice Element True Intent in the Dao-Bearing Jade Page had all fallen into his divine sea, becoming his cultivation foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sun Lingtong giggled, his eyes curving into crescents: "This feels really nice!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He proceeded to cast Ice Element spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He pointed a finger, and a chessboard-like grid of ice condensed on the ground, lines clear, vertical and horizontal orderly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He blew a breath, and snowflakes floated in the air, each one a standard hexagon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sticking out his tongue, a layer of fine ice armor instantly covered it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">After playing around for a bit, he turned to look at Ning Zhuo, finding the latter sitting on the prayer mat, holding a jade slip, immersed in study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo first read the Bitter Cold Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Before, he could see through the foundation at a glance. Like a master chef flipping through a recipe, one look and he knew "use gentle heat here," "add vinegar for flavor here," and he knew why it was done and what use it served. Even if he hadn't noticed it before, a little thought would make it clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Now, he was re-learning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Before, he was standing at the peak of an iceberg looking down at the wind and snow. Now, he was like someone at the foot of the mountain looking up at the glacier. Re-learning was like climbing again; every wisp of cold air truly scraped across his skin, bringing a faint stinging pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Re-understanding was naturally difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Putting down the Bitter Cold Sutra, Ning Zhuo opened the Ice Sculpture Secret Canon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"For ice blank selection, the most important thing is 'texture direction'. Carving with the grain yields twice the result with half the effort; carving against the grain leads to nine failures out of ten..." Ning Zhuo re-savored, understood, and accumulated these subtle points of knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Accumulating small amounts to make a large amount, after quantity triggered a qualitative change, he would be able to regain his previous depth and breadth of understanding of the Ice Sculpture Secret Canon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"It looks like reviewing, but it's completely different."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Regarding the Bitter Cold Sutra and the Ice Sculpture Secret Canon, I clearly know the results I once understood, or rather, the answers. But these answers and results feel quite strange. I still need to re-understand, accumulate step by step, and finally achieve mastery through comprehensive integration."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Once I achieve mastery, my Ice Element realm can be restored."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Maybe not completely, but restoring the majority is certain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In fact, just from this study, Ning Zhuo could clearly feel a strong trend - his Ice Element realm was rising rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"My Ice Element realm relies to a great extent on my profound Water Element realm, understanding by analogy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"The Bitter Cold Sutra and Ice Sculpture Secret Canon are my study materials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Oh, and Ling Mo's lifetime of memories and experience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Improving and refurbishing Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Snow Pivot Guard Xie provided valuable practice!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Although Ning Zhuo's Ice Element realm had fallen, the foundation remained and hadn't been completely extracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Retracing his steps gave his Ice Element realm a strong trend and efficiency in recovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"This is also related to the fact that my Ice Element realm wasn't super high to begin with. It was only at the Artisan level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">To use an analogy, it was like Ning Zhuo fell from a mountaintop and had to climb it again. The mountain wasn't high originally, and he was taking the old path with his memories, so reaching the summit was relatively quick and easy to achieve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo took out the Proud Snow Scroll and Braving Frost Scroll to look again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He got into the Braving Frost Scroll very quickly, immediately supplementing a large amount.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Huh?" When looking at the Proud Snow Scroll, Ning Zhuo had a different feeling than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Isn't the ancient plum tree in this painting the current me? Realm fallen, as if covered by ice and snow, branches burdened, seemingly struggling. But precisely because it is 'covered', it has no choice but to gather all its vitality inward and take root downward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo immersed himself even more than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">When he slowly opened his eyes again, his Ice Element realm had recovered to the Artisan level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">However, he wasn't overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Because the Proud Snow Scroll was much dimmer than before, and the image blurred significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Essentially, I just extracted a portion of the Ice Element sentiment from the Proud Snow Scroll and stuffed it into my own divine sea."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">This originally belonged to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He just moved it from one place to another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Seeing Ning Zhuo open his eyes, Sun Lingtong spoke up: "Little Zhuo, give me all the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages. I will infuse my Formation Dao True Intent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"With these, clearing the water formation is just around the corner!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Hee hee hee."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Things were developing much more smoothly than Sun Lingtong had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo also felt delighted: "Just these Dao-Bearing Jade Pages surely won't be enough. But I have already sent Gongsun Yan out again to discuss purchasing matters with Xiao Juxia."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"There is one more point..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Sun Lingtong waved his hand, interrupting him: "I know. You just focus on handling this second trial of the Demon Subjugation Hall first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">This was the top priority.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Hall Master Zhong Dao of the Demon Subjugation Hall thought so highly of Ning Zhuo, and not long ago there was a public political performance between him and Ning Zhuo (the public return of the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone), so Ning Zhuo could not afford to fail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="255"/>
<paragraph index="256">The next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">At the site of the Demon Subjugation Hall's second "Rising Cloud" trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">Use the hour of the Dragon (7-9 AM), the morning sun was just rising.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">"Activate - Formation - " The voice of the elderly cultivator manning the main formation was deep and resonant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">More than ten Golden Core-level cultivators occupied the formation eyes respectively, simultaneously performing hand seals and pouring spiritual energy into the magic formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">The formation patterns on the jade platform lit up one by one. First, the central Tai Chi diagram rotated, and black and white pillars of light shot straight into the clouds from the eyes of the Yin-Yang fish. Then, the Eight Trigrams directions lit up in sequence. The eight ancient seal characters for Heaven, Earth, Thunder, Wind, Water, Fire, Mountain, and Lake emerged in the void. Each character was as large as a house, shining with brilliant golden light, rotating slowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">Golden lights constantly rose into the sky like stars, scattering into nine thousand six hundred points, weaving into a grand golden star map covering the sky above the jade platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">The periphery of the star map draped down, slowly and firmly forming a spherical shape, creating a sealed space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">"Inject the Worldly Aspects Smoke Clouds!" The cultivator running the main formation commanded again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">Thirty-six bronze formation flags flapped in the wind, drawing a massive stream of strange smoke and clouds, which injected into the spherical space along the formation channels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">For a time, the cloud qi was like ten thousand galloping horses, or hundreds of waterfalls hanging upside down, a magnificent spectacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">Within the surging cloud qi, images would occasionally gather and form, then vanish in an instant, transforming into something else. There were profiles and figures of people, hazy outlines of cities, silhouettes of mountain ranges, as well as flowers, grass, birds, and beasts... complex and ever-changing, seeming both real and illusory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">Standing in the crowd, Ning Zhuo saw this scene and couldn't help but feel awestruck: "What a grand gesture!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">"The Demon Subjugation Hall has expanded the specifications of the second trial. They didn't hesitate to create a temporary Cloud Dream Marsh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">A moment later, the cloud qi calmed down. Presented before everyone was a gigantic, dreamlike ball of white cloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="286">"Demon Subjugation Second Trial, begin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="288">"Participants - enter the marsh - !"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
