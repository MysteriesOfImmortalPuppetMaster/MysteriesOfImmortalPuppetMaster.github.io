<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 311: Defeated and Fleeing?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji advanced with large strides, and within a few steps, he was upon Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo had already retreated, but his speed was far inferior to Zhu Xuanji's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zhu Xuanji extended his palm from above, striking downwards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">In an instant, Ning Zhuo's breath was stifled. Zhu Xuanji's attack was as fierce as a divine being descending, his hand covering the sky and earth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">In this critical moment, Ning Zhuo slapped his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">A gigantic ape suddenly appeared, using its chest to block Zhu Xuanji's palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This mechanical ape was precisely the Golden Core stage mechanical ape that Ning Zhuo had crafted by leveraging the situation. At the beginning of the second stage of the palace examination, Ning Zhuo had even lent it to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Although this mechanical ape was suppressed to the Foundation Establishment stage, Ning Zhuo had heavily invested in its materials, making it extremely sturdy and resilient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo controlled the mechanical ape to battle Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After a few exchanges, Zhu Xuanji suddenly employed the Golden Mountain Stance, releasing a portion of golden mystical light that directly pressed onto the mechanical ape, making its movements difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Zhu Xuanji bypassed the mechanical ape, heading straight for Ning Zhuo, the controller.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo hurriedly took out a silver-gray token and tossed it into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The token had the character "Azure Iron" on the front and "Warrior Armor" on the back. It quickly disassembled, expanded, and emitted dazzling silver-gray beams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">As the beams dissipated, the Azure Iron Warrior Armor floated silently in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo pushed backward, and the Azure Iron Warrior Armor instantly opened, enveloping him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The Foundation Establishment Pill hidden in the spine, full and round, activated swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In an instant, Ning Zhuo possessed Foundation Establishment level combat strength, and his speed surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zhu Xuanji's attack thus missed its mark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Failing to hit, Zhu Xuanji stood still, his gaze calm: "As expected, you are Chui Tiao Ke." As he spoke, he raised a single finger, his palm facing the retreating Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Martial Artâ€”Air Slash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">An invisible force suddenly erupted, striking Ning Zhuo in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Iron Garment Cold!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">At the critical moment, Ning Zhuo frantically urged the defensive formation of the Azure Iron Warrior Armor, pushing its capability to the maximum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">As a result, a mechanical technique erupted, cold air spreading, and the metallic nature becoming even more resilient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Even so, he was still heavily struck by the overwhelming palm force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo crashed into the wall, his back embedding into the wall itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo was so battered that he almost vomited blood, his vision blurred, and his ears rang. The mechanical ring on his finger suddenly tightened, jolting him awake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Mechanical Techniqueâ€”Wind and Thunder Movement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Spirit stones were consumed madly, transforming into immense spiritual power that poured into two palm-sized, intricately patterned wind and thunder talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The talismans each emitted wind and thunder power, intertwining along the internal formation patterns of the Azure Iron Warrior Armor, merging to form a blue-green electric light that surrounded the Azure Iron Warrior Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In the next moment, the invisible force struck again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo controlled the Azure Iron Warrior Armor, shooting away like lightning, leaving only a few strands of green electric light in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The palm force heavily covered the spot, extinguishing the green electric light completely, leaving a massive four-foot square palm imprint on the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Sun Lingtong urgently transmitted a message: "Ah Zhuo, be careful! Both the Golden Mountain Stance and the Jade Pillar Stance provide comprehensive enhancements to cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo had already realized Zhu Xuanji's prowess!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Despite being suppressed by the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities' restrictions, his cultivation was confined to the Foundation Establishment level. Yet, his divine abilities allowed him to fight beyond his level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo's recent sneak attack had triggered Zhu Xuanji's powerful state with three divine abilities enhanced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Rudie Niang needed to exert all her strength to unleash a quasi-Golden Core power. Yet, every strike from Zhu Xuanji surpassed the normal Foundation Establishment level, reaching quasi-Golden Core standards!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Let's attack him together!" Ning Zhuo shouted lowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Mechanical Techniqueâ€”Azure Dragon Soaring!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The armor plates on the back, shoulders, and elbows, and wrists of the Azure Iron Warrior Armor all flipped open, revealing hidden explosive talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">In the next moment, the talismans fully ignited, shining with brilliant white light, fully propelling Ning Zhuo's actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo seemed like a silver dragon, breaking through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He circled Zhu Xuanji, engaging in mid-range combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo's attacks landed on Zhu Xuanji, causing the golden mystical light to ripple, the golden branches and jade leaves on the mountain to clink continuously, yet failing to harm Zhu Xuanji in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In contrast, he was constantly dodging, occasionally blocking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhu Xuanji's attacks were powerful and heavy, quickly causing the Azure Iron Warrior Armor to struggle, cracks appearing all over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">This was already the strongest state of the Azure Iron Warrior Armor, yet it could only barely maintain its stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The mechanical ring frequently activated, allowing Ning Zhuo to evade multiple attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai retracted the ghost, leaned forward, and emitted a sound wave from his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In his throat, there was a mechanical component, the Soul-Shaking Throat Drum, whose sound could disturb souls. However, when it landed on Zhu Xuanji, it merely caused his golden branches and jade leaves to sway more gracefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo's pupils contracted, realizing that the three divine abilities were closely linked, making Zhu Xuanji's defense overwhelmingly strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"We must break the connection between the three divine abilities!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo had identified the key to the battle, but he couldn't think of any way to achieve it at the moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong dared not to engage in close combat, using blade techniques for long-range attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Golden Core mechanical ape and Ning Zhuo cooperated seamlessly, yet were continuously pushed back by Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Rudie Niang watched anxiously from the side, wanting to intervene but fearing harm to her allies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yang Chanyu stopped shooting poison arrows: "Our coordination is not smooth, severely lacking practice, and our combined strength is poor." She silently concealed her form, making a certain decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ancient Cicada Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Autumn Cicada's Last Cry!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The piercing sound of the autumn cicada suddenly rang out, and Yang Chanyu appeared behind Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">She wielded the Soul-Stealing Light Blade, piercing through the golden mystical light, breaking through the jade skin, intending to continue stabbing, but the blade was caught by Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhu Xuanji looked down at Yang Chanyu: "To make me bleed in this state, Yang Chanyu, you have reason to be proud." Yang Chanyu's heart was alarmed, and without hesitation, she abandoned the blade and retreated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Zhu Xuanji's left eye emitted a golden glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Innate Talentâ€”Golden Time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Spellâ€”Needle Blanket.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Innate Talent Spellâ€”Golden Eye Needle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In an instant, Yang Chanyu was enveloped in a layer of golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Within the light, golden rays condensed into needles, hundreds and thousands of golden needles shot forth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Piercing Yang Chanyu all over!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Yang Chanyu cried out in pain, urging her mana to activate defensive artifacts, fully supporting herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">But as long as she remained within Zhu Xuanji's line of sight, she would constantly suffer the barrage of hundreds of golden needles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Yang Chanyu attempted to use invisibility techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Zhu Xuanji pointed a finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Official Techniqueâ€”Lock Nation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Golden chains immediately formed on Yang Chanyu's body, binding her tightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zhu Xuanji's fingers continued to point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong, the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai, and the Golden Core mechanical ape were all successively hit, bound in place, struggling desperately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Only Ning Zhuo, relying on the mechanical ring's warning, escaped in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"This is in the Southern Bean Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Zhu Xuanji's official technique is immensely powerful, difficult to resist!" "What should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo avoided the Lock Nation technique, but exposed himself in Zhu Xuanji's line of sight, enveloped in a layer of light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Countless fine light needles constantly pierced his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo inwardly cursed, forced to fully defend. The Azure Iron Warrior Armor quickly deteriorated, its surface densely covered with needle holes, increasing in number!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Everyone was preoccupied, and Zhu Xuanji attacked again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Martial Artâ€”Mountain Separation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He struck with his hand, hitting the chest and abdomen of the mechanical ape. The powerful force penetrated the heavy armor, striking the intricate ice mechanism structure inside the ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">With a muffled sound, the intricate ice mechanism structure shattered completely under this strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Golden Core mechanical ape thus lost much of its power, its combat strength plummeting to the bottom, nearly paralyzed in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Zhu Xuanji then advanced towards the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai, slicing with his hand like a blade, splitting the latter from shoulder to waist in half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He charged towards Rudie Niang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Rudie Niang's face turned pale, screaming in terror!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The wings behind her erupted with power, forming countless twisted light lines, weaving into fragmented light and shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The light and shadow intertwined, rapidly expanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zhu Xuanji charged in, clearly moving in a straight line, yet in the light and shadow, he turned, bypassing Rudie Niang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"It's actually the Curved Light Weaving Formation!" Zhu Xuanji felt surprised, and also found it troublesome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">He temporarily abandoned Rudie Niang, advancing towards Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Yang Chanyu had to defend against the golden needles, unable to counter Zhu Xuanji, and was struck by his leg, severely injured, spitting blood. The mechanism activated, and she was instantly swallowed by a light ring, sent out of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Zhu Xuanji then targeted Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Boss, run!" Ning Zhuo rushed over at the critical moment, pushing Sun Lingtong away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sun Lingtong crashed to the ground, got up, and saw the door close at hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Run!" Ning Zhuo's voice echoed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Sun Lingtong turned to see Ning Zhuo being struck by Zhu Xuanji's heavy punch, the Azure Iron Warrior Armor on him shattering mostly, fragments flying with the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">But Ning Zhuo also used the force of the punch to fly backward, diving into Rudie Niang's Curved Light Weaving Formation, disappearing from Zhu Xuanji's sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Covered by light and shadow, Ning Zhuo no longer had the light halo on him, free from the crisis of golden needle barrages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">But in the next moment, a golden light pierced through the light and shadow, like a sharp sword, stabbing through Ning Zhuo's abdomen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo hurriedly fled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The light and shadow wove together, forming a strange black and white world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Golden swords occasionally shot through, each time accurately targeting Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo knew very well that he was being tracked and monitored by Zhu Xuanji's methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In just a few breaths, Ning Zhuo was already drenched in blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Little Zhuo!" Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth, but did not join the battle, instead rolling over, pushing the door open, and immediately running towards another door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Zhu Xuanji saw this and snorted disdainfully: "Ning Zhuo, see, this is the loyalty of a thief!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Your defeat is certain, there's no need to struggle further. Surrender voluntarily, and leave. Reflect well afterward, turn yourself in, and strive for leniency!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The black and white light and shadow filled the entire Secret Pavilion, overlapping continuously, making Zhu Xuanji's perception of Ning Zhuo increasingly vague.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">His persuasion received no response from Ning Zhuo, and he hesitated whether to enter the formation, when suddenly he lost all sense of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">In the next moment, he heard a message announcement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Ning Jiufan battles Zheng Shuangjun, Meng Chong, and the Meng Family's Golden Core true disciple. Ning Jiufan is defeated and eliminated, Zheng Shuangjun is defeated and eliminated!" Zhu Xuanji's brows furrowed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In the next moment, he received a second message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Zhu Xuanji battles Entry Standard, Yang Chanyu, and Ning Zhuo. Yang Chanyu is defeated and eliminated, Ning Zhuo surrenders and is eliminated." Zhu Xuanji's brows slowly relaxed, and after taking one last look at the Curved Light Weaving Formation, he turned and left.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
