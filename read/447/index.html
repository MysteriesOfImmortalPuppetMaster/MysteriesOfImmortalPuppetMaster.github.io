<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 447: "The Old Monster in the Stone" Takes Action!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The military power converged onto him, causing the Blood Dragon Saber to burst forth a gigantic blade of light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Guan Hong raised the Blood Dragon Saber in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Military Tactic —Single Saber Thrust!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The blade light was crimson like blood, incomparably sharp, severing the connection between the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect and the military power of the Camp of Three Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Triangular Arrow Formation suddenly accelerated, shaking off the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect overhead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In an instant, everyone in Thousand Peaks Forest was astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ma Feitui was stunned inside the Dharmic Aspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He frantically attacked, trying to break through the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect to trouble the Red Flower Camp. He shouted loudly, urging Chen Lingfeng and others to attack the Camp of Three Generals to help him escape quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">But Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and others did not do so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Although they all had divine decrees requiring them to go all out, even full-force combat requires attention to timing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Obviously, letting Ma Feitui and the Camp of Three Generals wear each other down, and waiting until both sides were exhausted before Chen Lingfeng and Wu Hen made their move —wouldn't that be better?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Firstly, the combat power of the Camp of Three Generals would drop to rock bottom, making them easier to deal with and safer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Secondly, Ma Feitui would also become weakened, making it more convenient for Chen Lingfeng and Wu Hen to seize battle merits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">As a result, the abrupt choice of the Camp of Three Generals truly exceeded everyone's expectations!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">They actually shook off the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect, which was the key item for imprisoning the Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Chen Lingfeng reacted the fastest; a chill rose in his heart, and he immediately flapped his wings, soaring into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But the Golden Core cultivators on the ground were a beat slower. Zhang Hei rushed over like a whirlwind, gently thrusting out the Black Serpent Spear in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Kill!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Black Serpent Spear seemed slow but was actually fast, directly piercing through the Golden Core cultivator's heart, killing him on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">That Golden Core cultivator wanted to dodge but was hindered by Ning Zhuo's spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Puff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Military Tactic —Speed Is of the Essence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">While using the tactic, Liu Er shouted loudly, "Quick, quick, quick!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Military Tactic —Speed Is of the Essence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Guan Hong also used the same tactic. The two stacked together, causing the soldiers of the Camp of Three Generals to run like the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After killing the enemy in one strike, Zhang Hei immediately returned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">As one of the sharp edges of the triangular formation, he could not stay away from the battle formation for long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Military Tactic —Speed Is of the Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He also knew this tactic, and upon using it, the soldiers of the Camp of Three Generals ran so fast that afterimages of their legs appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">While casting Five Elements spells, Ning Zhuo secretly envied, "If I also cultivated military tactics, it would be like adding wings to a tiger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The advantage of the military battle formation was manifested in this aspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Everyone casting the same spell could stack together. Although perfect stacking was unlikely due to inherent losses, this effect of uniting many into one made qualitative changes possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Strictly speaking, the Five Elements spells that Ning Zhuo cast did not quite fit with the military battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Because he consumed his own mana, the army's mana pool, and the absorption of natural spiritual energy from the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The reason why the Five Elements spells' power surged was that Ning Zhuo was in the formation, able to have national power, military power, and battle formation empower himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">If it were military tactics, the effect of military power's support would be much higher than now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Moreover, military tactics can directly consume military power, greatly reducing the cultivator's own mana consumption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">With Ning Zhuo's actions, the Golden Core cultivators' speed greatly decreased and were easily pursued and killed one by one by the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Chen Lingfeng only dared to circle in the high sky, constantly attacking from afar; Wu Hen even simply hid in some shadow, not daring to show himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Because they knew that they would next be facing a Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Although they gained rich battle merits one after another, Liu, Guan, and Zhang still had grim expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Neigh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Pegasus kicked hard with its hind hoof, finally breaking through the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The three generals had already been prepared, commanding the battle formation, and charged forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ma Feitui's eyes were blood-red, just about to kill to vent his anger. Seeing the Camp of Three Generals attacking, he neighed and directly charged over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">His body was huge like a small mountain; lowering his head, he charged, stirring up violent winds, causing the soldiers of the Camp of Three Generals to tremble with fear. Before they even engaged, their morale wavered, and military power dropped significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After all, the Camp of Three Generals was newly formed, not battle-hardened elite soldiers!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In this critical moment, Ning Zhuo shouted sharply and cast Five Elements spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">One could see golden blades flying, mist and smoke obscuring, vines entangling legs, fire snakes coiling around the body, and earthen bricks tripping feet; Five Elements spells came in waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo was clever, not causing wounds but focusing on restraint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">By now in the battle, he had determined that without using the Great Serpent Sickle, the offensives of the three generals were far sharper than his.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ma Feitui, subjected to continuous obstacles, even though he blocked the golden blade attacks, crushed earthen bricks, shook off the mist, broke free of vines, and let the fire snakes burn his body, his speed inevitably slowed down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Liu Er grasped the Xuanhuang Sword with both hands, flew out first, and collided head-on with Ma Feitui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ma Feitui took a small step back; Liu Er's grip tore, spitting blood from his mouth, and he flew back into the battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhang Hei roared loudly, "Take my spear!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ma Feitui glared at him, performed a demonic spell, attacking offense with offense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhang Hei's spear stabbed Ma Feitui but only left a mark; the horse's hide was tougher than imagined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">On the other hand, Zhang Hei was hit by the demonic spell; his entire chest caved in slightly, and the front of his armor completely shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ma Feitui was about to pursue, but Guan Hong had already swung his saber with full strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Military Tactic —Single Saber Thrust!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The bright red saber light was incomparably sharp, leaving a wound half a zhang (about 1.6 meters) long on Ma Feitui's back; blood spurted like a fountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ma Feitui was wounded; startled, he quickly performed demonic spells to heal, but the blood wouldn't stop no matter what. He could only suppress it from a fountain to a stream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Turns out, Guan Hong cultivated the demonic art Scarlet Face Blood Calamity Scripture; his mana carried mysterious power—once he caused a bleeding wound, without specific countermeasures, it was very difficult to completely stop the bleeding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The anger in Ma Feitui's heart was now overtaken by astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He kept retreating, easily pulling away, and tried various methods repeatedly but still couldn't stop the bleeding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Liu Er sighed deeply, watching the opportunity appear, but their side couldn't seize it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Although we have chosen the Triangular Arrow Formation, which is very fast, we are still at a disadvantage in speed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After Guan Hong's all-out attack, his aura dropped significantly; he retreated back into the battle formation to urgently adjust his breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"It seems this is going to be a battle of attrition!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Liu Er had also caught his breath, holding the Xuanhuang Sword, he went forward again to block the Pegasus's attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo had been constantly making moves, using various Five Elements spells to restrain Ma Feitui as much as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">When he was forced back, Zhang Hei would step up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The three generals had Liu Er mainly defending, Zhang Hei assisting, Guan Hong mainly attacking, with military advisor Ning Zhuo restraining; the more they fought, the more proficient they became, and their tacit understanding rapidly improved in the fierce battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Even though Ma Feitui was a Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator, he was wounded in many places and couldn't gain the upper hand in frontal combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The more he fought, the more surprised he became; he began to look at the Camp of Three Generals with new eyes: "These people are not simple! The three generals are all elites among Golden Core cultivators, and the cultivation methods they practice are all suitable for the battlefield. As for that Foundation Establishment mage, his Five Elements realm is extremely profound! Given time, when this group grows, they will certainly become very powerful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Earlier, he attacked in anger, just bullying the Camp of Three Generals for being weak, wanting to kill to vent his anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ma Feitui felt the desire to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He had joined the Thousand Peaks Forest side mainly to take revenge on the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">As a result, after frontal combat, they were about evenly matched, and it was hard for him to gain any advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">At this time, if only Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and others could cooperate, it would be good.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">But earlier, after the Camp of Three Generals abandoned the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect, they immediately attacked the Golden Core cultivators like Chen and Wu, killing several of them, making them terrified and fleeing in panic, thus eliminating this hidden danger in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Thinking of this, Ma Feitui directly turned around, flapped his wings, and flew up into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Forget it, why should I fight to the death with the Camp of Three Generals?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"My true enemy is the Red Flower Camp!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Don't run!" Zhang Hei became anxious, flew out of the battle formation, and wielded the Black Serpent Spear to pursue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Third Brother, don't chase!" Liu Er was shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">This is because he was still catching his breath; Guan Hong's recent strike had also caused military power to be in a low state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Zhang Hei, going into battle this time, could receive little support from the battle formation and military power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Eh?!" Seeing this, Ma Feitui was suddenly pleasantly surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He hadn't expected that just as he was about to retreat, the enemy army, which had been coordinating so well, would reveal such a huge flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ma Feitui suddenly turned around and spouted a blast of metallic qi from his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Qi Weapon —Cold Light Blazing Shadow Spear!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Martial Art —Turning Back Spear!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The metallic qi instantly condensed into a spear, shooting out like lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Under the enhancement of the "Turning Back Spear" martial art, it was extremely fast and fierce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Even Zhang Hei couldn't react in time, watching helplessly as the qi weapon spear shot over, brushing past him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Cold sweat seeped from Zhang Hei's forehead, and he was horrified; he then heard Guan Hong exclaim, "Not good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Liu Er shouted in alarm, but saw that Ma Feitui had shot off target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Liu Er realized and hurriedly turned back, "Military advisor, be careful!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">It turned out that Ma Feitui hadn't shot off target; he had aimed at Ning Zhuo, not Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This person was too annoying, occupying too much of his energy and attention, making him uncomfortable and constrained in battle, extremely frustrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">By comparison, the three Golden Core generals who fought head-on with hard attacks seemed much more tolerable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Fast, fast, fast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">As fast as lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The qi weapon had no physical form; Ma Feitui fired it with full power, and with the addition of the "Turning Back Spear," the qi weapon divine spear pierced through the battle formation and reached Ning Zhuo before the latter even reacted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">With a whoosh, the qi weapon directly pierced through the battle formation, killing more than a dozen cultivators along the way, and then stuck straight into the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">In the next moment, the qi weapon disintegrated, turning into a mass of icy light, carrying layers of blazing shadows, and flew back into the Pegasus's mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Military advisor!!!" Only then did Zhang Hei turn his head and saw in the dense battle formation a gap left after the qi weapon spear had pierced through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">For a moment, Zhang Hei was extremely angry, his killing intent soaring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Third Brother, calm down! The military advisor is not dead; before the attack reached him, his talisman was triggered, and he escaped." Liu Er hurriedly comforted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Zhang Hei's anger paused; he looked back at the Pegasus again: "You plague horse, sinister and vicious, almost took my military advisor's life; give me your life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Zhang Hei charged over again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Liu Er hurriedly commanded the soldiers to pursue all the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Fortunately, they had just caught their breath; the military power had recovered a lot, no longer as low as before, and could provide Zhang Hei with more support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ma Feitui, seeing that he hadn't killed Ning Zhuo, felt regret, and seeing Zhang Hei charging over, felt annoyed again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Without that annoying mage, I can exert my full strength!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"You mere Golden Core cultivators are too arrogant!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ma Feitui changed his mind again, deciding to stay and continue fighting, to give the three generals a profound lesson.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Directional Void Escape Talisman!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo suddenly appeared inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">After the sudden teleportation, his body staggered, almost falling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"So dangerous, so dangerous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo looked down and saw that the Directional Void Escape Talisman in his arms had just burned out, turning to ashes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">This kind of Directional Void Escape Talisman was something he had obtained from Ning Jiufan in the Immortal City of Fire Persimmon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Once encountering danger, the cultivator could actively activate it to lead the target object to escape through the void; it was a classic and common means of escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">But just now, the qi weapon attack exceeded Ning Zhuo's reaction limit; under normal circumstances, he wouldn't have had time to use his divine sense to activate the Directional Void Escape Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"Fortunately, thanks to the mechanism ring."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo's face was pale, filled with lingering fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">It turned out that, thinking that the battlefield was fraught with dangers, he had proactively constructed defensive and escape measures before the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">He connected the mechanism ring, which had the ability of "Piercing Insight," with the Directional Void Escape Talisman, constructing a simple formation. Once the spiritual intelligence in the ring perceived that Ning Zhuo's life was in danger, it would trigger the Directional Void Escape Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">It was this method that allowed Ning Zhuo to save his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Too dangerous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"This is what going to the battlefield is like."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"One moment, our side was pursuing victory; the next moment we were caught by a strong enemy exploiting a flaw, almost causing my death."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Little Zhuo, you're finally here!" Sun Lingtong sensed the movement and immediately came over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Zhuo wiped his broad forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">His forehead was covered with fine cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">He didn't know that Ning Zhuo had just been on the verge of life and death; at this moment, his face full of excitement: "Didn't expect to wait so long for you to come!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Hurry, what should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong carried divine decrees, needing to take action against the armies of the two Note Nations to satisfy the requirements of the divine decrees in order to survive this ordeal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Therefore, after the two of them discussed, they had Sun Lingtong take the mechanism Wandering Dragon away from the army, waiting for a good opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth: "Mu Lan is too unkind; shall we deal with them this time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Ning Zhuo immediately used his divine sense to inform Sun Lingtong of the latest battle situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ning Zhuo shook his head: "What profit is there in the Red Flower Camp? Their bones are still hard!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">He already had a target: "Let's go directly to the White Jade Camp; that group of high-born scions is the richest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Ning Zhuo was dissatisfied with Mu Lan but remained calm, not swayed by personal emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">He continued: "After participating in the battle for so long, I have confirmed from opponents like Chen Lingfeng that the clauses of the divine decrees are not very strict."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">"This time, we can play the role of the 'Old Monster in the Stone,' rob the White Jade Camp's military equipment and weapons, and that should be enough to deal with the divine decrees."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Sun Lingtong was already impatient, rubbing his hands repeatedly: "I'll go bring out the stone sphere; Little Zhuo, quickly recover a bit, we need to depart as soon as possible! If we're any later, we might miss the opportunity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Ning Zhuo's condition wasn't bad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">He took some pills to help himself recover, and went to the dragon head cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Sun Lingtong had already moved out the stone sphere, letting the mechanism Wandering Dragon hide inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Ning Zhuo opened his mouth and spat out the Earth Element Spleen Temple, making it merge with the stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">The three of them returned to their previous state; the "Old Monster in the Stone" reappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">The power of the divine decrees was instantly activated, like ropes tightening around the necks of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">With the "Old Monster in the Stone" complete, the divine decrees finally manifested their true binding power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">"Quick, let's go mess with the White Jade Camp!" Sun Lingtong rubbed his fists.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">The stone sphere sank into the ground and moved forward rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">With a thought, Ning Zhuo performed the Earth Walking Technique, making the stone sphere's speed increase dramatically, and making it extremely stealthy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">White Jade Camp Battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">Shuang Jing struggled to hold on, relying on military power to resist Lord Long. The deputy generals directed soldiers, sometimes assisting Shuang Jing, sometimes resisting attacks from external Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">The White Jade Camp suffered heavy casualties; the soldiers were subjected to internal and external attacks, suffering greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">If not for Mu Lan commanding the Red Flower Camp and arriving in time to help the White Jade Camp share much of the external pressure, the White Jade Camp would have already collapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">A stone sphere suddenly emerged from the ground, coming beside a mana pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">"Wh-what is that?!" The White Jade Camp soldiers guarding the mana pool were stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">The mana pool was swallowed by the stone sphere and disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">"Attack!" someone shouted; the people around awoke as if from a dream and began to take action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">But the main military power of the White Jade Camp was focused on dealing with Lord Long; these soldiers' attacks were like scratching an itch for the "Old Monster in the Stone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">The "Old Monster in the Stone" didn't linger in battle; the next moment, it directly burrowed into the ground and ran away!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
