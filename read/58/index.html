<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 58: Ning Zhuo vs Yuan Dasheng</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Yuan Yi said, “Don’t worry, humans like me don’t need to eat that much. We don’t get hungry easily.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Then he smiled. “We’re brothers, aren’t we? Thanks for protecting me before. In the future, those Beggar Gang guys might bully me again, so I can’t afford to let you go hungry!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But the ape opened its mouth and spit the food it hadn’t swallowed into its palm. Then, it held its hand out to Yuan Yi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Yuan Yi waved his hand. “No, no.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">But his throat bobbed involuntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The ape insistently stepped closer, pressing its palm near Yuan Yi’s mouth and letting out a cry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Hehe, then I won’t be polite.” Yuan Yi’s eyes were moist. Holding the ape’s hand, he bowed his head and quickly ate the last handful of leftovers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Delicious, delicious!” Yuan Yi laughed. He was all skin and bones, wearing ill-fitting clothes he’d gotten off someone else. Along with his messy hair and dirty face, he looked just like a human monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The ape laughed too, squeaking happily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">One man and one ape, immersed in happiness together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Uncle Dasheng, Uncle Dasheng…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">At last, Yuan Er awakened the ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">In the instant it opened its eyes, the ape almost mistook Yuan Er for its former master – that was how much the father and son resembled each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">As its vision cleared, the ape’s nose twitched, and its brows immediately furrowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It smelled something unpleasant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yuan Er swallowed nervously and hurriedly explained the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Halfway through listening, the ape stood up and walked out of the tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">It stood over one zhang tall, massive and muscular like a war elephant. The scars covering its body were medals of honor, proclaiming its countless victories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Greetings, Lord Monkey!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The elders all saluted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The ape didn’t even look at them. It only had eyes for the monkey corpses on the ground. After a brief silence, it suddenly raised its head and roared in fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The roar was deafening. The shockwave blasted several elders off their feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Yuan Dasheng’s eyes turned red—it was truly enraged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Every elder broke into a cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Yuan Er had been purposely hanging back. When he saw the elders groveling, he felt deeply satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Seeing that the time was ripe, he stepped forward. “Uncle Monkey, don’t worry. Now that such a huge disaster has occurred, we’ll find out who did this and punish them severely!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Yuan Dasheng slowly stopped roaring, looking down at Yuan Er. The familiar face helped it gradually calm down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">It slowly reached out a finger and gently tapped Yuan Er’s chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Yuan Er’s heart pounded. He took a small step back and nodded quickly, “Uncle Monkey, trust me. I won’t let you down!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“But right now, the gang is in big trouble. We absolutely must perform well at the Fire Persimmon Festival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Right now, we’re short on hands. Uncle Monkey, you’re the only one we can rely on.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Please rest well in the coming days. You are our pillar!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Yuan Dasheng didn’t respond. Slowly turned around, it went back into the tent and disappeared from view.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Yuan Er looked at the elders scattered on the ground, smiled faintly, and flicked his sleeves. “Rise.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">All the elders obeyed his commands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Once he left, the elders started whispering via sound transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Yuan Er is just riding on that monkey’s coattails. Does he have any leadership skills at all?” one said with disdain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Lord Monkey didn’t kill anyone. It seems its temper has softened.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“What, were you hoping for it to go berserk?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“I’m just saying, maybe it’s gotten old. Don’t you think it might have weakened?” an ambitious elder mused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Hearing this, the oldest elder sneered inwardly and turned to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The others knew nothing. He had seen Yuan Dasheng fight during an exploration of the Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“That Fire Snake’s power was almost a half-step into Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“But Yuan Dasheng ripped it apart…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Yuan Dasheng might be old, but its battle prowess is terrifying. It definitely has an innate talent, and at least a high-grade one at that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“The fact that it doesn’t have a cultivation technique is its only shortcoming, and also our gang’s greatest blessing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The chirping of birds echoed out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Stirred from his sleep, Ning Zhuo opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The chirping came from a mechanical parrot. A 一-shaped control rod protruded from its back, controlling its chirping to awaken Ning Zhuo on time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“It’s about time.” Ning Zhuo activated the imprint in his chest and entered the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He quickly assembled a puppet body and blew through the levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Along the way, he spotted traces left by others. After checking the surveillance mechanical component, he saw that Zhou Zhu and Zheng Jian were now cooperating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“For now, they’re not a big threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“The real problem is Yuan Dasheng. Even Meng Chong isn’t as big an issue.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo continued advancing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He could now wield over twenty spells with high proficiency. As long as his spiritual energy held out, clearing the challenges was easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Once he reached as far as he could, he stopped moving forward and started retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He came all the way to Room 8 before stopping and waiting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Before long, the door burst open, and a massive ape puppet walked in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“It’s here,” Ning Zhuo thought to himself, slowly rising to face the ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">When their eyes met, Yuan Dasheng immediately realized that the puppet in front of it wasn’t ordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">It examined the puppet Ning Zhuo, then scanned the rest of the room, considering whether there would be hidden traps aside from the visible ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Looks like it’s mistaken me for a gatekeeper puppet, like those kung fu puppets in earlier rooms.” Ning Zhuo nodded inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This was exactly the impression he wanted to give.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">His alias on the ranking list had done its job, making Yuan Dasheng believe that it was the only one in the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After a moment of observation, Yuan Dasheng began moving forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo struck immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Spell – Icy Embrace Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Mechanical component — Wandering Flight Hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Spell — One Gust of Air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Mechanical component — Air Ejection Ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">A mechanical arm shot toward Yuan Dasheng, cold air seeping out from its palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Normally, the chill would only harm on contact. But with the spinning Air Ejection Ring and One Gust of Air blowing the freezing aura outward, a fan-shaped wave of chilly air swept out across the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Yuan Dasheng quickly dodged. Although it avoided most of the cold air, frost still covered part of its left leg.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Yuan Dasheng’s eyes lit up with savagery!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">A gatekeeper puppet that could cast spells—this was a first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Without hesitation, Yuan Dasheng charged forward, rushing at Ning Zhuo with overwhelming ferocity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo leapt lightly and activated the One Gust of Air spell. Combined with the Air Ejection Rings on both his ankles, air burst out and propelled him backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">This quickly widened the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">And as he retreated, Ning Zhuo also attacked simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Over a dozen Wandering Flight Hands launched continuous attacks, casting spells like the Icy Embrace Art, Fiery Grasp Art, Metal Plucking Art, Wood Grafting Art, and more. All these spells turned into mid- to long-range attacks thanks to the power of One Gust of Air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Yuan Dasheng minimized its body’s surface area, using both arms to guard its face as it smashed through all the spells and charged at Ning Zhuo’s body at all costs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Tactically speaking, this choice was absolutely correct!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">But it couldn’t save Yuan Dasheng from being defeated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Moments later, Yuan Dasheng’s puppet body collapsed. Some parts were scorched, others frozen into ice blocks, some sprouting tangling trees and creating grand obstacles…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Just before shattering, Yuan Dasheng raised its head and roared. The sound was filled with reluctance, rage, and helplessness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Stifling, unbearably stifling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">This wasn’t its true strength at all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“I stopped it.” Ning Zhuo exhaled in relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The mechanical traps he had set were almost useless against Yuan Dasheng. Only by personally taking action could he bring the ape’s advance to a halt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
