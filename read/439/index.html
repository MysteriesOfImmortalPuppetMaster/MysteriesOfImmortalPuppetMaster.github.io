<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The deputy general was dumbfounded upon hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He was not a scion of a noble family; the White Jade Battalion also had newly recruited cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">At this moment, these people's emotions were quite complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">But in the White Jade Battalion, the majority were members of the great families from the capital, descendants of generations of military officials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Shuang Jing's words deeply resonated with them, leading to a quite successful consolidation of morale, boosting the army's spirits by at least thirty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Cultivators from the Barbarian Demon Battalion approaching the White Jade Battalion were all forcefully teleported back the way they came.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">More and more cultivators were teleported back, tragically slaughtered by the pursuing Golden Core cultivators from Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The cultivators of the Barbarian Demon Battalion rushed to the front of the formation, immediately triggering the Jade Wall Heavenly Chasm Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ripples spread through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Save us! We are on the same side!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Many people shouted in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">They quickly realized the harsh reality and began to curse loudly, using extremely foul language.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Someone in the White Jade Battalion heard this, frowned, directly activated a ballista, and shot dead a Foundation Establishment cultivator who was cursing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The cultivators of the Barbarian Demon Battalion were utterly terrified; the cursing and swearing voices suddenly decreased. They all turned around, trying to bypass the White Jade Battalion and flee in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">But as long as these people made a wrong move, they were instantly killed by the pursuing Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Shuang Jing's expression changed instantly, and he shouted to the entire army: "Who dares to act without my orders? The one who acted just now will receive thirty military canings after the battle, to serve as a warning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Watching others die without helping would lead to iron-blooded discipline, but taking action to kill friendly forces was wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After returning, he would certainly be reported and face punishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Although Shuang Jing felt secretly pleased, he immediately spoke up to distance himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The cultivator who had activated the ballista to kill a friendly cultivator heard the punishment but still held his head high: "So what if it's thirty military canings? I was the one that did it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">His identity and background were not simple at all, so he was not afraid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"That's our lord's style!" People around loudly praised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Seeing the White Jade Battalion's behavior, the Golden Core cultivators from Thousand Peaks Forest became somewhat at a loss, looking around in confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Especially Diao Ye and Wu Lan, who knew very well that their Great Priest had been secretly accompanying them, just waiting for him to make a decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">As the plan of Cave Master Mo Yuan was carried out, the actual outcomes increasingly deviated from expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">At this moment, the Poison-Belly Great Priest's brows were tightly knitted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">First, Xu Dali fought to the death without retreating; now, Shuang Jing was defending steadily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"The White Jade Battalion is mostly composed of sons of noble families. If they are overrun and become a routed army, the Golden Halberd Army will certainly have to come to their rescue."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"If they don't rescue them, when Sun Gan returns to the capital, even if he has established many military achievements, he won't be able to get any good out of it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">As Great Priest Tu Ming, who managed countless affairs of the Hundred Poisons Tribe and had considerable political acumen, he understood the subtlety of Cave Master Mo Yuan's plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Although the White Jade Battalion was certainly inferior to the Golden Halberd Army in combat power, it was nonetheless very important, being critical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">If this army became chaotic, the entire rear army would be in disorder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"It seems I must exert my full strength!" Tu Ming had deliberately held back before, but he had long been prepared in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Even without the resolve to sacrifice, the divine will upon him would help him establish the determination to go all out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">A foul wind suddenly arose, and layers of dark clouds gathered in the sky. After a few breaths, black clouds covered the sky!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Divine Ability â€”Ten Thousand Serpents Poison Stream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Drops of poisonous water fell from the black clouds, pattering to form a poisonous rain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The continuous drizzle quickly turned into a torrential downpour.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The poisonous rain enveloped the entire White Jade Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In the White Jade Battalion, the soldiers operated the Jade Wall Heavenly Chasm Formation, producing countless ripples in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The ripples were densely packed, countless, sending the poisonous rain back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">But this only lasted for a few breaths before Shuang Jing actively called for a stop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">There's no way around it; the cost of sending back the raindrops was too heavy. The White Jade Battalion could hardly sustain it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Shuang Jing took out a jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">On the surface of the jade slip were large vertical characters: "Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings"!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Shuang Jing held a military book in one hand and a general's seal in the other, fiercely pouring magical power into both.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Thus, he activated the full power of the Jade Wall Heavenly Chasm Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">With a loud noise, a huge jade stone wall as big as a mountain suddenly took shape, forming an illusion that covered the entire White Jade Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The poisonous rain fell on the jade wall, corroding violently with sizzling sounds, raising wisps of poisonous smoke, but only eroding the surface, unable to reach deep into the jade wall, let alone the soldiers sheltered beneath it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Tu Ming's expression changed dramatically: "They actually have a battle formation avatar?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Nascent Soul cultivators break the core to form the Nascent Soul. Soul Formation cultivators had their Nascent Soul grow into a god, called the Primordial Spirit, and can even split off a second Primordial Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Above the Soul Formation was the Void Refinement realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">At this stage, the Primordial Spirit became immensely powerful, forming a Dharma Image. The Dharma Image of a strong cultivator could support the heavens and step on the earth, possessing terrifying power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The battle formation avatar was the concrete manifestation of power condensed by the sages of military tactics and formations, who exhausted their minds to emulate the profundity of the Void Refinement stage, combining national power, formation power, military tactics, etc., to induce a qualitative change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Only elite soldiers and capable generals, after years of hard training and battlefield experience, can condense a battle formation avatar. How can the White Jade Battalion have one?!" Tu Ming couldn't believe the scene before him, took a deep breath, and applied another layer of his divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The poisonous rain fell, and the poisonous liquid gathered together, transforming into pitch-black poisonous snakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The poisonous snakes hissed, varying in size: the small ones only at the Qi Refining stage, the medium ones had Foundation Establishment level magical power aura, and the largest ones coiled like elephants, at Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Thousands of poisonous snakes gathered into an army, their bodies carrying streams of poisonous water, some slithering and attacking on the ground, others coiling and corroding on the jade stone wall's avatar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">White Jade Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A subordinate hurriedly reported: "Lord Shuang, this is bad; the Qi pool is consuming rapidly; one of them is already nearly depleted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Shuang Jing nodded and immediately ordered: "Deploy the Poison-Repelling Straw Man Dao Soldiers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">One by one, the cultivators received the order and took out palm-sized straw man puppets from their bosoms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">With the infusion of magical power, these straw man puppets grew with the wind, becoming the size of ten-year-old children, holding hands and rushing out of the jade wall together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The straw men giggled and laughed; wherever they went, the poisonous liquid was purified into clear water, and the poisonous snakes' bodies shrank dramatically, continuously collapsing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Tu Ming stared wide-eyed: "These are straw men woven from top-grade Poison-Repelling Grass, forming Dao Soldiers. The lowest are at Foundation Establishment level, Golden Core level, even Nascent Soul level Poison-Repelling Grass woven straw men!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Tu Ming gnashed his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The poisonous liquid was formed from his magical power; sustaining it until now had already consumed forty percent of his spirit energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He solemnly took out a pill and put it into his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After digestion, the medicinal power immediately converted into magical power, slowly restoring his reserves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">White Jade Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Those cultivators who had deployed the Poison-Repelling Straw Men had also expended a lot of spirit energy, appearing tired and listless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Shuang Jing ordered again: "Activate the Sage Light Universal Illumination Tower."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Illumination Tower activated, emitting beams of spiritual light. The light was extremely precise, hitting every one of their own cultivators who had greatly expended spirit energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">These cultivators were instantly revitalized, their spirit energy replenished to peak state, standing upright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The largest beam of light shone upon Shuang Jing himself. As a Nascent Soul cultivator, he also let out a long breath, his spirit energy instantly replenished, his spirits greatly lifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Release the Golden Light Sparrow for me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">A Nascent Soul level demon beast was released.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The national cultivation system could harness demon beasts; demon beasts could also receive official positions and become national beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Many high officials had national beasts sealed or lurking on their official robes. Once they encountered danger, they could release them to confront the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Golden Light Sparrow was extremely fast, like a golden rainbow, streaking across the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">A Golden Core cultivator from Thousand Peaks Forest only felt a flash of golden light before falling into endless darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">To outsiders, it appeared that this Golden Core cultivator had been lightly pecked by the Golden Light Sparrow, causing his head to explode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Golden Light Sparrow continued to attack, killing one and injuring another Golden Core cultivator from Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The injured one had a teleportation talisman; after narrowly escaping death, he fled frantically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Scattered Golden Core cultivators without battle formations, without national power's protection, without extraordinary talents, had no way to stand before a Nascent Soul level opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Golden Light Sparrow had keen senses; it then discovered Tu Ming and attacked him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Tu Ming cultivated in toxins; although his physical body had some foundation, it was not his main focus. How could he compare to a demon beast?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He could only maintain his divine ability while flying backward, using various means to resist the Golden Light Sparrow's attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">In the White Jade Battalion, Shuang Jing saw the opportunity and decisively ordered to switch the battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The outer layer of cultivators continued to operate and maintain the Jade Wall Heavenly Chasm Formation, while the inner layer of elite soldiers and personal guards formed the Dragon Tooth Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Aim at him! Fire the arrows!" Shuang Jing shouted loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Over a thousand white feathered arrows, bearing the might of the battle formation, flew out and immediately coalesced into a jade dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The divine dragon roared, using the transmission of the Heavenly Chasm Formation, instantly pounced on Tu Ming and swallowed him in one gulp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The next moment, Tu Ming broke through the illusion of the white dragon, spewing pitch-black poisonous blood all the way as he fled in a sorry state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Shuang Jing laughed heartily and said proudly: "The 'Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings' in my hand was personally written by the Void Refinement mighty General Gao; its market value is incalculable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"The Poison-Repelling Straw Men I distributed cost twenty-six million lower-grade spirit stones just for the purchase of the Poison-Repelling Grass. Including the fees for inviting temple priests to invoke divine power and refine the Dao Soldiers, the total cost is fifty-two million lower-grade spirit stones!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Each activation of the Sage Light Universal Illumination Tower consumes ten times more spirit stones than the cultivators would use to replenish themselves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"The feeding cost of the Golden Light Sparrow is about two hundred thousand lower-grade spirit stones per day."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"The over a thousand arrows just now, each one is a Foundation Establishment level weapon. This volley alone cost more than seven million lower-grade spirit stones. A Nascent Soul level cultivator's monthly income is only about this amount."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"What do you have to compare with me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Bah, you country bumpkin pauper!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">As if hearing Shuang Jing's words, Tu Ming, fleeing along the way, spat out another mouthful of black blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">*Three Generals Battalion.*</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Chen Lingfeng and other Golden Core cultivators frowned as they looked at the strictly disciplined Three Generals Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"When do we act?" The Golden Core cultivators, led by Chen Lingfeng, asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Chen Lingfeng said: "Be patient; Wu Hen has already infiltrated the army. As soon as he assassinates one of the three generals, we can launch the offensive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"If he can't find an opportunity, that military advisor Ning Zhuo, who can deduce ambushes, is also a target for elimination!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Wu Hen transformed into a shadow, hiding himself by using the soldiers' shadows cast on the ground, constantly leaping and shuttling through the army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Although the Three Generals Battalion was arrayed, as a newly formed army with insufficient military strength, it could block others but couldn't stop Wu Hen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">All because Wu Hen's cultivation method originated from the Night Rain Dynasty, something bizarre and incomprehensible to ordinary people!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
