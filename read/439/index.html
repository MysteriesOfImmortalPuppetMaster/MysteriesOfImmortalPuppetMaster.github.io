<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The deputy general was dumbfounded upon hearing this.<br/>
<br/>
He was not a scion of a noble family; the White Jade Battalion also had newly recruited cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, these people's emotions were quite complex.<br/>
<br/>
But in the White Jade Battalion, the majority were members of the great families from the capital, descendants of generations of military officials.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing's words deeply resonated with them, leading to a quite successful consolidation of morale, boosting the army's spirits by at least thirty percent.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators from the Barbarian Demon Battalion approaching the White Jade Battalion were all forcefully teleported back the way they came.<br/>
<br/>
More and more cultivators were teleported back, tragically slaughtered by the pursuing Golden Core cultivators from Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators of the Barbarian Demon Battalion rushed to the front of the formation, immediately triggering the Jade Wall Heavenly Chasm Formation.<br/>
<br/>
Ripples spread through the air.<br/>
<br/>
"Save us! We are on the same side!"<br/>
<br/>
Many people shouted in disbelief.<br/>
<br/>
They quickly realized the harsh reality and began to curse loudly, using extremely foul language.<br/>
<br/>
Someone in the White Jade Battalion heard this, frowned, directly activated a ballista, and shot dead a Foundation Establishment cultivator who was cursing.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators of the Barbarian Demon Battalion were utterly terrified; the cursing and swearing voices suddenly decreased. They all turned around, trying to bypass the White Jade Battalion and flee in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
But as long as these people made a wrong move, they were instantly killed by the pursuing Golden Core cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing's expression changed instantly, and he shouted to the entire army: "Who dares to act without my orders? The one who acted just now will receive thirty military canings after the battle, to serve as a warning!"<br/>
<br/>
Watching others die without helping would lead to iron-blooded discipline, but taking action to kill friendly forces was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
After returning, he would certainly be reported and face punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Although Shuang Jing felt secretly pleased, he immediately spoke up to distance himself.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivator who had activated the ballista to kill a friendly cultivator heard the punishment but still held his head high: "So what if it's thirty military canings? I was the one that did it."<br/>
<br/>
His identity and background were not simple at all, so he was not afraid.<br/>
<br/>
"That's our lord's style!" People around loudly praised.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the White Jade Battalion's behavior, the Golden Core cultivators from Thousand Peaks Forest became somewhat at a loss, looking around in confusion.<br/>
<br/>
Especially Diao Ye and Wu Lan, who knew very well that their Great Priest had been secretly accompanying them, just waiting for him to make a decision.<br/>
<br/>
As the plan of Cave Master Mo Yuan was carried out, the actual outcomes increasingly deviated from expectations.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the Poison-Belly Great Priest's brows were tightly knitted.<br/>
<br/>
First, Xu Dali fought to the death without retreating; now, Shuang Jing was defending steadily.<br/>
<br/>
"The White Jade Battalion is mostly composed of sons of noble families. If they are overrun and become a routed army, the Golden Halberd Army will certainly have to come to their rescue."<br/>
<br/>
"If they don't rescue them, when Sun Gan returns to the capital, even if he has established many military achievements, he won't be able to get any good out of it."<br/>
<br/>
As Great Priest Tu Ming, who managed countless affairs of the Hundred Poisons Tribe and had considerable political acumen, he understood the subtlety of Cave Master Mo Yuan's plan.<br/>
<br/>
Although the White Jade Battalion was certainly inferior to the Golden Halberd Army in combat power, it was nonetheless very important, being critical.<br/>
<br/>
If this army became chaotic, the entire rear army would be in disorder.<br/>
<br/>
"It seems I must exert my full strength!" Tu Ming had deliberately held back before, but he had long been prepared in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Even without the resolve to sacrifice, the divine will upon him would help him establish the determination to go all out!<br/>
<br/>
A foul wind suddenly arose, and layers of dark clouds gathered in the sky. After a few breaths, black clouds covered the sky!<br/>
<br/>
Divine Ability —Ten Thousand Serpents Poison Stream.<br/>
<br/>
Drops of poisonous water fell from the black clouds, pattering to form a poisonous rain.<br/>
<br/>
The continuous drizzle quickly turned into a torrential downpour.<br/>
<br/>
The poisonous rain enveloped the entire White Jade Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
In the White Jade Battalion, the soldiers operated the Jade Wall Heavenly Chasm Formation, producing countless ripples in the air.<br/>
<br/>
The ripples were densely packed, countless, sending the poisonous rain back.<br/>
<br/>
But this only lasted for a few breaths before Shuang Jing actively called for a stop.<br/>
<br/>
There's no way around it; the cost of sending back the raindrops was too heavy. The White Jade Battalion could hardly sustain it.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing took out a jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
On the surface of the jade slip were large vertical characters: "Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings"!<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing held a military book in one hand and a general's seal in the other, fiercely pouring magical power into both.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, he activated the full power of the Jade Wall Heavenly Chasm Formation.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
With a loud noise, a huge jade stone wall as big as a mountain suddenly took shape, forming an illusion that covered the entire White Jade Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
The poisonous rain fell on the jade wall, corroding violently with sizzling sounds, raising wisps of poisonous smoke, but only eroding the surface, unable to reach deep into the jade wall, let alone the soldiers sheltered beneath it.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming's expression changed dramatically: "They actually have a battle formation avatar?"<br/>
<br/>
Nascent Soul cultivators break the core to form the Nascent Soul. Spirit Transformation cultivators had their Nascent Soul grow into a god, called the Primordial Spirit, and can even split off a second Primordial Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Above the Spirit Transformation was the Void Refinement realm.<br/>
<br/>
At this stage, the Primordial Spirit became immensely powerful, forming a Dharma Image. The Dharma Image of a strong cultivator could support the heavens and step on the earth, possessing terrifying power.<br/>
<br/>
The battle formation avatar was the concrete manifestation of power condensed by the sages of military tactics and formations, who exhausted their minds to emulate the profundity of the Void Refinement stage, combining national power, formation power, military tactics, etc., to induce a qualitative change.<br/>
<br/>
"Only elite soldiers and capable generals, after years of hard training and battlefield experience, can condense a battle formation avatar. How can the White Jade Battalion have one?!" Tu Ming couldn't believe the scene before him, took a deep breath, and applied another layer of his divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
The poisonous rain fell, and the poisonous liquid gathered together, transforming into pitch-black poisonous snakes.<br/>
<br/>
The poisonous snakes hissed, varying in size: the small ones only at the Qi Refining stage, the medium ones had Foundation Establishment level magical power aura, and the largest ones coiled like elephants, at Golden Core level.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of poisonous snakes gathered into an army, their bodies carrying streams of poisonous water, some slithering and attacking on the ground, others coiling and corroding on the jade stone wall's avatar.<br/>
<br/>
White Jade Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
A subordinate hurriedly reported: "Lord Shuang, this is bad; the Qi pool is consuming rapidly; one of them is already nearly depleted."<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing nodded and immediately ordered: "Deploy the Poison-Repelling Straw Man Dao Soldiers."<br/>
<br/>
One by one, the cultivators received the order and took out palm-sized straw man puppets from their bosoms.<br/>
<br/>
With the infusion of magical power, these straw man puppets grew with the wind, becoming the size of ten-year-old children, holding hands and rushing out of the jade wall together.<br/>
<br/>
The straw men giggled and laughed; wherever they went, the poisonous liquid was purified into clear water, and the poisonous snakes' bodies shrank dramatically, continuously collapsing.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming stared wide-eyed: "These are straw men woven from top-grade Poison-Repelling Grass, forming Dao Soldiers. The lowest are at Foundation Establishment level, Golden Core level, even Nascent Soul level Poison-Repelling Grass woven straw men!"<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming gnashed his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
The poisonous liquid was formed from his magical power; sustaining it until now had already consumed forty percent of his spirit energy.<br/>
<br/>
He solemnly took out a pill and put it into his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
After digestion, the medicinal power immediately converted into magical power, slowly restoring his reserves.<br/>
<br/>
White Jade Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
Those cultivators who had deployed the Poison-Repelling Straw Men had also expended a lot of spirit energy, appearing tired and listless.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing ordered again: "Activate the Sage Light Universal Illumination Tower."<br/>
<br/>
The Illumination Tower activated, emitting beams of spiritual light. The light was extremely precise, hitting every one of their own cultivators who had greatly expended spirit energy.<br/>
<br/>
These cultivators were instantly revitalized, their spirit energy replenished to peak state, standing upright.<br/>
<br/>
The largest beam of light shone upon Shuang Jing himself. As a Nascent Soul cultivator, he also let out a long breath, his spirit energy instantly replenished, his spirits greatly lifted.<br/>
<br/>
"Release the Golden Light Sparrow for me!"<br/>
<br/>
A Nascent Soul level demon beast was released.<br/>
<br/>
The national cultivation system could harness demon beasts; demon beasts could also receive official positions and become national beasts.<br/>
<br/>
Many high officials had national beasts sealed or lurking on their official robes. Once they encountered danger, they could release them to confront the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Light Sparrow was extremely fast, like a golden rainbow, streaking across the sky.<br/>
<br/>
A Golden Core cultivator from Thousand Peaks Forest only felt a flash of golden light before falling into endless darkness.<br/>
<br/>
To outsiders, it appeared that this Golden Core cultivator had been lightly pecked by the Golden Light Sparrow, causing his head to explode.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Light Sparrow continued to attack, killing one and injuring another Golden Core cultivator from Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
The injured one had a teleportation talisman; after narrowly escaping death, he fled frantically.<br/>
<br/>
Scattered Golden Core cultivators without battle formations, without national power's protection, without extraordinary talents, had no way to stand before a Nascent Soul level opponent.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Light Sparrow had keen senses; it then discovered Tu Ming and attacked him.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming cultivated in toxins; although his physical body had some foundation, it was not his main focus. How could he compare to a demon beast?<br/>
<br/>
He could only maintain his divine ability while flying backward, using various means to resist the Golden Light Sparrow's attacks.<br/>
<br/>
In the White Jade Battalion, Shuang Jing saw the opportunity and decisively ordered to switch the battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
The outer layer of cultivators continued to operate and maintain the Jade Wall Heavenly Chasm Formation, while the inner layer of elite soldiers and personal guards formed the Dragon Tooth Formation.<br/>
<br/>
"Aim at him! Fire the arrows!" Shuang Jing shouted loudly.<br/>
<br/>
Over a thousand white feathered arrows, bearing the might of the battle formation, flew out and immediately coalesced into a jade dragon.<br/>
<br/>
The divine dragon roared, using the transmission of the Heavenly Chasm Formation, instantly pounced on Tu Ming and swallowed him in one gulp.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Tu Ming broke through the illusion of the white dragon, spewing pitch-black poisonous blood all the way as he fled in a sorry state.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing laughed heartily and said proudly: "The 'Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings' in my hand was personally written by the Void Refinement mighty General Gao; its market value is incalculable."<br/>
<br/>
"The Poison-Repelling Straw Men I distributed cost twenty-six million lower-grade spirit stones just for the purchase of the Poison-Repelling Grass. Including the fees for inviting temple priests to invoke divine power and refine the Dao Soldiers, the total cost is fifty-two million lower-grade spirit stones!"<br/>
<br/>
"Each activation of the Sage Light Universal Illumination Tower consumes ten times more spirit stones than the cultivators would use to replenish themselves."<br/>
<br/>
"The feeding cost of the Golden Light Sparrow is about two hundred thousand lower-grade spirit stones per day."<br/>
<br/>
"The over a thousand arrows just now, each one is a Foundation Establishment level weapon. This volley alone cost more than seven million lower-grade spirit stones. A Nascent Soul level cultivator's monthly income is only about this amount."<br/>
<br/>
"What do you have to compare with me?"<br/>
<br/>
"Bah, you country bumpkin pauper!!"<br/>
<br/>
As if hearing Shuang Jing's words, Tu Ming, fleeing along the way, spat out another mouthful of black blood.<br/>
<br/>
*Three Generals Battalion.*<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng and other Golden Core cultivators frowned as they looked at the strictly disciplined Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
"When do we act?" The Golden Core cultivators, led by Chen Lingfeng, asked.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng said: "Be patient; Wu Hen has already infiltrated the army. As soon as he assassinates one of the three generals, we can launch the offensive."<br/>
<br/>
"If he can't find an opportunity, that military advisor Ning Zhuo, who can deduce ambushes, is also a target for elimination!"<br/>
<br/>
Wu Hen transformed into a shadow, hiding himself by using the soldiers' shadows cast on the ground, constantly leaping and shuttling through the army.<br/>
<br/>
Although the Three Generals Battalion was arrayed, as a newly formed army with insufficient military strength, it could block others but couldn't stop Wu Hen.<br/>
<br/>
All because Wu Hen's cultivation method originated from the Night Rain Dynasty, something bizarre and incomprehensible to ordinary people!</div>
