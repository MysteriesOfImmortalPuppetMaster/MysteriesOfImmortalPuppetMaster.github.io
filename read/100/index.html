<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Four guards followed by Ning Zhuo’s side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Among them, two were at the Qi Refining stage and two were at Foundation Establishment stage, all dispatched by the Ning Clan to protect Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The current Ning Zhuo was someone of great importance, being an invaluable support for the Ning Clan’s exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace. The fact that the clan had given him these four guards was enough to show just how much they were investing in him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">After departing from Ning Xiaoren’s residence, Ning Zhuo didn’t go home right away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Instead, he went in and out of several stores, purchasing a large amount of specialized bricks, formation disks, and other materials used to set up formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Seeing all this, the four guards secretly exchanged voice transmissions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“This brat Ning Zhuo is planning to build his own cultivation chamber.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Any cultivation chamber will have decent defenses, as well as the ability to block divine sense. How are we supposed to monitor him then? Using a magic artifact might cause too much of a commotion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Let’s report this to the junior patriarch.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Still, you have to admit, this kid really has money.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“He’s currently favored by the junior patriarch, and is also receiving plenty of resources from the tri-clan alliance. Of course he’s got riches to spare.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">After he finished shopping, Ning Zhuo shelled out to hire a formation master to handle the arrangement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He had left the junior patriarch’s residence in the morning, and by the time afternoon came around, a small chamber had already been built inside his bedroom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The chamber was constructed entirely from stone bricks and had a stone door which could be opened or closed at will with the infusion of magical power and divine intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">However, the formation hadn’t been completed yet, so the small chamber’s current defensive prowess was almost nonexistent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The two Qi Refining guards patrolled the outer courtyard and beyond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Meanwhile, the Foundation Establishment cultivators took up different stations; one concealed his presence while the other stood at the rear entrance, eyes closed in meditation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Night fell, and then deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo opened his eyes and quietly got out of bed, flicking a switch and entering his underground workspace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Ah, youth.” One of the Foundation Establishment cultivators slowly opened his eyes, muttering with a knowing smile on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo nervously scanned the workspace, checking several key spots for any changes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He had arranged these spots for detection purposes. If an outsider had entered the workspace, changes in these locations would tip him off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">There were no signs of tampering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Under the watchful divine sense gazes of the two Foundation Establishment cultivators, Ning Zhuo let out a long sigh of relief. His slightly furrowed brows relaxed, and his entire demeanor gained a sense of ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He strolled around the workspace, touching this and that, full of the safety and comfort of someone who’d returned to their personal nest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sitting down in a chair, he stretched his body lazily and let out a long yawn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After a moment of rest, he stood back up, taking a meditation mat from his storage pouch and placing it in the center of the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Then, he sat down cross-legged and pulled out several bottles of medicinal pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Both the meditation mat and the medicinal pills drew envy from the two Foundation Establishment cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo was only at the Qi Refining stage, but because of his prominent position in the tri-clan alliance’s recultivation team, he received an overwhelming share of resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Before beginning his cultivation session, Ning Zhuo paused and took out a handkerchief from within his robes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The handkerchief was white as snow, soft to the touch and completely pure without any sort of patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo infused his magical power into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">White clouds slowly emerged from the handkerchief. Soon, Ning Zhuo was completely shrouded in dense layers of clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The two Foundation Establishment cultivators simultaneously furrowed their brows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">They started chatting through voice transmissions. “Is that a Floating Cloud Handkerchief?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Yes, that’s it. That’s a magic artifact originating from Flying Cloud Kingdom.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“How did Ning Zhuo get ahold of one?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Could be passed down from his mother. Don’t forget, according to the records, his mother Meng Yaoyin came from Flying Cloud Kingdom.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Right, I remember now! That must be it. But what now? We can’t see what he’s doing anymore.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“As they say, ‘floating clouds cover the eyes.’ The Floating Cloud Handkerchief is famous for its concealment abilities.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“Well, it doesn’t matter as long as we can ensure Ning Zhuo’s safety. Surveillance isn’t our top priority. Still, we’ll need to report this in the morning.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo had planned this all along, anticipating many possible scenarios.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As the two Foundation Establishment cultivators had guessed, the Floating Cloud Handkerchief was indeed an item left to him by his mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">This magic artifact produced floating clouds that were exceptionally good for concealment. Protected by these clouds, the details of his cultivation process would be difficult to see through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Even if someone with the Golden Pupils came to take a look, that would still cause the clouds to be consumed abnormally rapidly, alerting Ning Zhuo and giving him ample time to adjust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Of course, there were still risks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In the world of cultivation, new methods emerged without limit. Innate talents, spells, and countless other methods might have the capability of penetrating the clouds and observing Ning Zhuo’s true condition, perhaps even without giving him any warning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo had considered this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">But still, he had no choice. He’d already done everything he could.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The four major forces had vast amounts of resources. The average cultivation base of the recultivation team was constantly on the rise, and Ning Zhuo’s previous traps and measures would soon become obsolete.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Zhu Xuanji’s persistent investigations were also bringing mounting pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo was in a race against time!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The longer he waited, the more likely it was that he would be discovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Even though he had spent more than ten years building up layer after layer of protection, everything would collapse eventually.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He had to reach the Lava Immortal Palace before anyone else!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Thus, it was necessary for him to take some risks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique for refining essence blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation for channeling magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Incantation for bolstering divine intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He rotated through the three techniques, consuming rare and expensive medicinal pills one after another. Even the meditation mat he was sitting on was a supplemental magic artifact provided by the tri-clan alliance that could accelerate a person’s speed of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">His three techniques advanced together, each progressing at a visible rate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“There’s no problem with the cultivation techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“But I’ve reached the limit with my spells, and the newly acquired embryonic divine ability is the same.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Just thinking about the embryonic Life-Hanging Thread divine ability made Ning Zhuo itch with curiosity. He wanted to test it out, but under his current circumstances, he could only endure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain, surrounded by thick clouds and mist, Meng Chong was also cultivating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">His body floated in midair, and his eyes were closed. He was still unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Meng Kui, the current Fire Persimmon City Lord, hovered above Meng Chong and had his hand stretched out to cover Meng Chong’s head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He activated his magical power, mobilizing his essence and channeling it into Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">As Meng Kui’s grandson of the same bloodline, Meng Chong was actually able to absorb some amount of essence blood from his grandfather.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">And the boy quickly reaped benefits. His sunken eye sockets and protruding cheekbones began recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Meanwhile, Meng Kui grew obviously weaker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Although he was in the Nascent Soul stage, he was a spell-type cultivator and placed little attention on his physical cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Of course, even though he didn’t focus on the body, his physical foundation was still stronger than most Golden Core stage body cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The main issue here was the extreme lack of conversion efficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The essence blood Meng Kui provided had to be purified several times over. Only the tiniest fraction would actually enter Meng Chong’s body to be absorbed. Although this resulted in massive losses, this approach guaranteed that Meng Chong’s own essence blood would remain extremely pure, without any hint of foreign pollutants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Meng Kui originally hadn’t planned on going this far, but he was left with no other choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He knew that the tri-clan alliance had made significant progress in exploring the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Meanwhile, Meng Chong was stuck at Room 3, and had yet to regain consciousness after passing out last time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Thus, he was forced to take action personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Meng Chong, my grandson, you must become the new master of the Lava Immortal Palace. Why are you still asleep?” Meng Kui sent a voice transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Meng Chong slowly opened his eyes. “Grandfather, I...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Meng Kui sent another voice transmission telling him to close his eyes and focus on recovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A cultivator’s three treasures were jing, qi, and shen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Meng Kui fully replenished Meng Chong’s jing before finally stopping the essence blood transfusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">His own complexion had taken on a sickly yellow tone, and his gaze had dimmed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">With his body fully recovered, Meng Chong began recounting his experience in Room 3.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">At the current stage, Meng Kui couldn’t possibly imagine that Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was a trap laid by other competitors. Stroking his beard in thought, he finally said, “In terms of martial arts, you and that mechanical ape are too far apart. Even if you start special training, it would take a considerable amount of time to catch up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Your time is extremely precious. You must seize every moment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“I know a method that can help you quickly close the gap, but it will be extremely painful.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Meng Chong was overjoyed. “Grandfather, I don’t even know the meaning of the word pain! What kind of method is it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“Lightning strike,” Meng Kui replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Meng Chong blinked. “I strike what with lightning?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Meng Kui shook his head. “You get struck.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“Ah?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Meng Chong was about to say something when a sudden thunderclap rang out. A flash of blue light streaked through the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Meng Chong took a direct hit and was paralyzed on the spot. His whole body turned pitch black, his hair poofed outward, and wisps of dark smoke curled up from skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Boom, boom, boom...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Thunder echoed again and again amid the clouds and mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Meng Chong gritted his teeth and endured with sheer willpower, constantly replaying his fight with Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng in his mind. “I will master this. I must reclaim my pride!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">At the Ning estate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Xiaohui was also undergoing special training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">She reached both her hands into a basin filled with ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">A wave of bone-piercing cold surged through her body, turning her face pale and causing her to shiver uncontrollably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“Hang in there, Xiaohui.” Her grandmother stood sternly beside her, offering encouragement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“You have the Ice Jade Hands innate talent. It’s the best way to counter Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Ning Zhuo’s innate talent is still unidentified. Even if we figure out what it is, we may not have the proper methods to fully develop it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“But you are different. Your Ice Jade Hands have appeared many times in our clan’s history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“That’s the advantage of a clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“We have the same bloodline, cultivate the same techniques, and use the same kinds of resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“Many methods of cultivating the Ice Jade Hands have been developed by our ancestors over the generations.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Xiaohui had a resolute expression on her face. “I understand, Grandmother. The Ice Jade Hands have always been my greatest asset.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“Once I finish this special training, that trifling Ning Zhuo will be nothing to me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">In the Zhou Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Several tubes were inserted into Zhou Zeshen’s body, with medicinal liquid flowing into him ceaselessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">He was cultivating with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">In the Zheng Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Zheng Jian was relentlessly training with mechanical puppets, completely focused and lost in a trance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The struggle over the Lava Immortal Palace had already passed the opening stage and was entering an even more intense phase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The night deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Yuan Er tossed and turned, unable to sleep peacefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ever since Yuan Dasheng’s death, he had spent every night like this. His heart was full of emptiness and insecurity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">“Why isn’t Uncle Dasheng’s mechanical construct finished yet?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">“Tomorrow! Tomorrow, I’ll go and find Ning Zhuo!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Inside the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng crouched silently in Room 3. In this inactive state, it was indistinguishable from the surrounding bricks and stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
