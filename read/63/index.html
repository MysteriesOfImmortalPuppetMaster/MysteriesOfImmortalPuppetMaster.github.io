<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 63: I Want to Climb Up</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">After seeing Zhu Xuanji off, Fei Si didn’t leave. Instead, he turned around and went back into the Flying Disk Workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He stared at Chen Cha and Ning Zhuo, then fixed his gaze on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Suddenly, he released the pressure of the Golden Core stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Caught off guard, Ning Zhuo was forced to one knee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Chen Cha was shocked. “Sir Fei Si, what are you-”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Fei Si sneered. “The Monkey Head Gang has been suffering lately. Over thirty percent of their monkey pets have been poisoned to death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“After some investigation, we found out that someone’s been offering huge sums of money for the capture of wild monkeys since a long time ago. They even went to the black market and put up generous bounties for the Monkey Head Gang’s monkey pets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“That’s not all. The Monkey Head Gang’s current leader Yuan Er was targeted for assassination. The assassin was incredibly arrogant and even sent a letter before the assassination attempt. Although that caused the attack to end in failure, Yuan Er’s been scared witless. He now cowers in the gang’s headquarters, not daring to take a single step outside.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Fei Si stared at Ning Zhuo. “The one who did all this… Was it you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo felt like he was being crushed under the immense pressure of a Golden Core cultivator. His face went pale and sweat poured down as he struggled to resist. Laboriously opening his mouth, he said, “Sir Fei Si, if you ask me like this, I will obviously deny it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“I’ve already developed a new mechanical monkey with a new blueprint. I can produce more in a shorter period of time and fully meet the current demand!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Fei Si raised an eyebrow slightly, then turned to Chen Cha.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Out of worry for Ning Zhuo’s life, Chen Cha immediately nodded. “Sir Fei Si, that’s correct. But the new mechanical monkeys use poorer materials and the production process has been simplified, so the quality is much worse and they won’t last very long.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Fei Si pressed, “Can they still pick fire persimmons?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Chen Cha nodded. “That won’t be a problem.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Only then did Fei Si’s expression soften. He gradually withdrew his Golden Core pressure and looked down at Ning Zhuo, saying, “Rise.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“Thank you, Sir.” Ning Zhuo staggered to his feet, drenched in cold sweat. His lips were bloody from biting into them, and his nose was bleeding again. All in all, he was in a miserable state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Fei Si pointed a finger at Ning Zhuo. “You’re a bit clever. Ning Zhuo, right? I’ll remember you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo immediately revealed a hint of joy. “To be remembered by you, Sir, is a great honor. I guarantee that we will produce enough mechanical monkeys for the Fire Persimmon Festival – I’ll stake my life on it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Fei Si nodded in satisfaction at these words, his attitude softening further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo continued, “Sir, using my new blueprint, the best material for the mechanical monkeys will be real monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Didn’t the Monkey Head Gang just lose a batch of monkey pets? I would like to procure those corpses as raw materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Sir, please grant your permission!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Fei Si’s eyes narrowed, and he once again studied Ning Zhuo carefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He stroked his beard as a faint sense of appreciation grew in his heart. “This kid is young but vicious. He wants to completely destroy the Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“His vision is clear, and he knows that the sales of the explosive fire monkeys rely on the business of picking fire persimmons. Right now, it’s the Monkey Head Gang that has a handle on that business, so he plans to overthrow them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“He’s trying to use my authority to get the monkey corpses. Yuan Er can’t refuse, of course. But once he gives them up, what will happen to his authority in the gang?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“A cunning heart and skillful methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“He’s just like I was in my younger years.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">If Ning Zhuo’s cultivation base was in the Golden Core stage, or even just Foundation Establishment, then Fei Si might feel a little threatened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">But the current Ning Zhuo was just a low-level Qi Refining cultivator, and he was still a teenager. Fei Si felt no pressure at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Thinking to this point, Fei Si smiled mysteriously. “Interesting. How much do you think you should pay the Monkey Head Gang for the monkey corpses?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo said, “I’m willing to give up forty percent of the profits. From now on, forty percent of the profits from the sales of explosive fire monkeys will belong to you, Sir!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Fei Si feigned confusion: “What does this have to do with me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo immediately replied, “Sir Fei Si, you are the great official overseeing our Fire Persimmon Immortal City. How could anything in this city be unrelated to you?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“The Monkey Head Gang is full of heartless villains, hands stained with blood and leeching off the city’s resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“They should contribute more to our Fire Persimmon Immortal City and think for the sake of our great official Sir Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Those monkeys are already dead, and all they can do is bury them uselessly. It’s better to let us use the corpses for the sake of a successful Fire Persimmon Festival, for the sake of our Fire Persimmon Immortal City!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Fei Si burst out in laughter, jabbing his finger at Ning Zhuo repeatedly. “Good! Ning Zhuo, you’re very thoughtful. You have talent as a member of the righteous path!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“I’ll have my people demand the monkey corpses and deliver them to you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo bowed deeply. “Many thanks, Sir.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Chen Cha, who had been watching everything from the side, had a complicated look on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Once Fei Si left, Ning Zhuo turned to Chen Cha and spoke with a sincere expression. “Old Chen, I’m sorry. I had no choice but to do this!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Chen Cha sighed, unable to hide his resentment. “Since Sir Fei Si has given his approval, what else can I say?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He despised this sort of corner-cutting behavior from the bottom of his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">It was purely lusting after profits, with no respect for the mechanical creation and no respect for the creator himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo had already prepared for Chen Cha’s reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He immediately said, “Old Chen, from now on, I’ll be coming to the workshop more often. I’m going to get directly involved in the manufacturing of the mechanical monkeys!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“After all, I just staked my life in front of Sir Fei Si.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Hearing this, Chen Cha’s face filled with worry. “Brother Ning, this is too risky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Don’t make reckless promises like this in the future. What if something unexpected happens and you fail to fulfill it?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“You’re from the Ning Clan. There’s no need for you to bet your life. Even Sir Fei Si wouldn’t want to cause trouble over something like this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But Ning Zhuo clenched his fists and cut off Chen Cha’s words. “Old Chen, if I didn’t promise, how could I show my stance? How could I gain Sir Feit Si’s favor?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“The matter with the explosive fire monkey has made me see things clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“I understand now that this world is one where power rules all! Even if I invent something myself, that glory can easily be snatched away.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Old Chen was stunned. Deep guilt appeared on his face, and he opened his mouth to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But Ning Zhuo stopped him. “I’m not blaming you, Old Chen. I know you had no choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Over the past few days, I’ve been studying the Curved Snake Elastic Formation Collection, and have gained a lot from it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Old Chen, I understand you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“In fact, I have to thank you. Thank you for giving me your insights into formations, and thank you for showing me the true face of this world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“That’s why I must climb!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“I must climb up, I must rise above others!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Only after I reach a certain height will I be able to protect my own interests. I want a future where no one can rob me of my glory, where no one can steal my mechanical creations!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Chen Cha fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Looking at the young man before him, who was speaking righteously with ambition-filled eyes, Chen Cha’s heart filled with complicated emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Now he understood why Ning Zhuo’s attitude had changed so drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He no longer resented Ning Zhuo, nor did he feel any disdain or irritation toward him. On the contrary, he was full of guilt and remorse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The young man standing before him used to be pure and innocent. It was Chen Cha himself who caused him to change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“What right do I have to judge him now?” Chen Cha sighed deeply in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He walked up to Ning Zhuo and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Little Zhuo, I’ve really wronged you. Since things have come to this, I’ll give you my full support!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo beamed, a smile spreading across his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">When he heard Chen Cha stop calling him “Brother Ning” and switch back to “Little Zhuo”, he knew that he had succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
