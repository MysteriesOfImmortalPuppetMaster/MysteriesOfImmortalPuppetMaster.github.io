<paragraph index="1">Noble Qi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Confucian classics have long provided an accurate exposition: "It is difficult to explain. As for the Qi, it is most vast and most firm. If it is nourished with uprightness and not harmed, it will fill the space between heaven and earth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This passage clearly defines the two primary characteristics of Noble Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">First, its immense scale. Noble Qi can fill the heavens, the earth, and the entire universe, reaching far and wide without boundary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Second, its indestructibility. It is invincible and capable of resisting all external demonic influences and mental erosions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Noble Qi does not naturally exist within heaven and earth; among the thousand schools, only the Confucian school can cultivate it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">So, how does one cultivate Noble Qi?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Confucian classics also provide guidance on this- </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"It is the companion of righteousness and the Dao; without these, it withers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"It is produced by the accumulation of righteous deeds; it is not something that can be obtained by a sudden act of righteousness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Noble Qi cannot be inherited through bloodlines, nor can it be acquired through innate talent alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">It is nurtured and accumulated bit by bit by a Confucian cultivator every time they act in accordance with morality and justice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">If even a single deed leaves one with a guilty conscience, this Qi will "leak" and become weak and powerless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Therefore, Noble Qi is not spiritual energy, nor is it the Five Elements True Qi; it is never something that can be obtained by plundering the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It is the outward manifestation of a cultivator's internal sense of justice, morality, and responsibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Thus, Noble Qi "is the companion of righteousness and the Dao." It can only "grow" from the inside out through an internal adherence to the "Dao" and an external practice of "righteousness." Any thoughts of quick success or opportunistic shortcuts will become obstacles to nourishing this Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Consequently, while Noble Qi manifests as Qi, its essence is the spirit, will, and values of the cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">And when it comes to values, in the terminology of cultivation, that is - the Dao Path!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This is a flourishing age of cultivation. There are ten paths, a hundred arts, a thousand schools, and ten thousand methods! Confucianism is one of the thousand schools and has its own clear Dao Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Even though Gu Qing had only extracted a single wisp of Noble Qi, it allowed the surrounding cultivators to clearly sense the power of this "most vast and most firm" Qi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It was too unique, possessing an immense presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Even though the scale of Gu Qing's Literary Qi was a thousand times larger, that single wisp of Noble Qi remained distinct and conspicuous. The moment it appeared, it drew all outside attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"To think Gu Qing, at such a young age, could actually produce Noble Qi?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Impressive indeed. No wonder he is a renowned genius of the Huazhang Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"I am impressed! Although he is an outsider who never intended to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, this single wisp of Noble Qi is a clear testament to Gu Qing's character! A remarkable junior!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">In an instant, the expressions of many cultivators present changed, and their impression of him rapidly shifted in a positive direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Confucian technique - Investigating things to extend knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Within Gu Qing's Literary Palace, he had already thoroughly analyzed the various spiritual materials before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">A massive amount of Literary Qi carrying Noble Qi was poured directly into the wooden trough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Within the trough, the Cyan Jade Bamboo Pulp and the Purple Qi Morning Dew seemed to be gently stirred by a pair of invisible hands, mixing evenly without causing a single ripple. All spiritual energy was perfectly locked within the pulp, with none leaking out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Gu Qing took up the bamboo screen and dipped it into the trough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">As he slowly lifted it, a thin layer of paper pulp glowing with a faint purple light was evenly spread across the screen, thin as a cicada's wing yet without a single tear or uneven patch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Gu Qing activated his Literary Heart and spat out a mouthful of vital essence blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The vital essence blood transformed into a mist in mid-air, covering the thin pulp evenly. However, it only dyed the pulp red and failed to make it solidify.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">It wasn't until Gu Qing began to consume his own Noble Qi that the pulp underwent a qualitative change, transforming into a true piece of spirit paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Noble Xuan, successfully refined!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Watching this, Situ Feng nodded inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Among most spirit papers, the material cost of Noble Xuan was quite low, almost at the very bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The two main materials, Cyan Jade Bamboo Pulp and Purple Qi Morning Dew, were both quite cheap and easy to obtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The tools - the desk, mortar, bamboo screen, and wooden trough - could even be mundane objects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The truly critical material was Noble Qi. It had to be involved throughout the entire process; if it wasn't there from the start, a cultivator couldn't even create the pulp. To complete the final spirit paper, a solid amount of Noble Qi had to be consumed, or it would not succeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Kong Ran was also making paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">His small face was tense as he concentrated on using his Literary Palace to perform the art of investigating things to extend knowledge, analyzing the properties of the materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His father was a high official of the Flying Cloud Kingdom, and Kong Ran possessed innate wisdom and had been strictly trained since childhood. His basic skills were very solid, and the process of analyzing the materials was smooth and quick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Compared to the first two stages, the materials for Noble Xuan are much simpler to analyze."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"However, the Noble Qi..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Kong Ran smiled bitterly. He did indeed have Qi within him; besides Literary Qi, it was Righteous Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He had given snacks to beggars on street corners and pleaded for mercy for punished study boys... but these small deeds could only cultivate some Righteous Qi at most; they were still far from Noble Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Thus, Kong Ran's only option was the Noble Qi provided at the venue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He reached out his small hand, attempting to guide it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Noble Qi here originated from Situ Tong and did not belong to Kong Ran. This made controlling it feel like trying to drive a stubborn young beast; he could not achieve full submission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In the end, though he succeeded, the spirit paper barely took shape. Its spiritual light was dim, and its fibers were coarse, forming a sharp contrast with the one made by Gu Qing - it was like comparing rubble to fine jade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">It is very difficult for a cultivator to grasp and apply someone else's Noble Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">This was determined at the very root. Because Noble Qi stems from a Confucian cultivator's own Dao Path and their heart of justice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Situ Tong's gaze scanned the field, pausing for a moment on Kong Ran's lowest-quality Noble Xuan before moving on without any change in emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Kong Ran's situation was considered good; most cultivators in their first attempt tasted the bitter fruit of failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The difficulty of crafting Noble Xuan was much higher than the previous Mountain and River Page and Heavenly Star Note.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The reason Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng had placed the latter two first was to allow the participants of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial to generally achieve success first, gain benefits, and ensure the event's influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">If Noble Xuan had been placed first, many would likely have developed conspiracy theories after failing, believing the Confucian group was intentionally making things difficult for them rather than sincerely wanting to teach the methods of crafting spirit paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"I also failed the first time I refined Noble Xuan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"The greatest difficulty in refining this type of spirit paper lies in the Noble Qi. Whether or not one has their own Noble Qi makes a world of difference."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Ning Zhuo, I want to see how you handle this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Gu Qing spread his divine sense, landing on Ning Zhuo, wanting to watch him make a fool of himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">However, after Ning Zhuo finished analyzing the paper-making materials, he pulled a small section of bone from his Storage Belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Gu Qing: "?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">In an instant, his heart skipped a beat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">What was this familiar, terrible, and intense premonition?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo publicly brought out the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Years ago, when the Great Confucian Master Shoujie passed away, his Noble Qi shot forth like a white rainbow piercing the high heavens, lasting for a full forty-nine days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">His entire life's Noble Qi and unyielding spine had condensed, finally leaving behind this piece of spinal bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">It was about three inches long, not a bleak, withered bone, but possessed the texture of warm white jade. When still, it looked like a section of white jade bamboo with straight lines and clear joints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">When spiritual energy was channeled into it, it would emit a soft yet resilient white-gold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">If a demonic cultivator held it, they would surely suffer a severe backlash. But for a righteous cultivator, the white-gold glow would seep into the body, gradually merging with their own spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Once fully fused, the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone would temporarily disappear, becoming one with the person's spine. This would allow them to produce their own Noble Qi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"W-what is that thing?!" Seeing Ning Zhuo take out a magic treasure, Gu Qing's pupils shrank as the image of Ning Zhuo taking out the Dragon Qi Jade Pendant during the crafting of the Mountain and River Page flashed in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">His feeling of impending doom grew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Situ Xiang, meanwhile, narrowed her eyes at the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone in Ning Zhuo's hand, her expression becoming increasingly uncertain: "Could that be... no, impossible. Such a treasure has always been hidden deep within the Demon Subjugation Hall. How could it be in Ning Zhuo's hands? Wait... it looks exactly like it?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Meanwhile, the subordinate of Zhong Dao, who had specifically come to observe for a field inspection, stared intently at Ning Zhuo without blinking, thinking to himself: "It's starting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo's expression remained calm as he funneled his spiritual energy into the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">A white-gold radiance surged forth, like the warm sun in winter, quickly enveloping Ning Zhuo's entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Subsequently, more and more white-gold light poured out, almost forming a spherical orb of light that obscured Ning Zhuo's figure from outsiders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Though this anomaly only lasted for a dozen breaths, it still attracted even more attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The white-gold radiance completely retracted, penetrating into Ning Zhuo's spine and merging with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">And the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone in Ning Zhuo's hand had completely disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Seeing this, Zhong Dao's subordinate was shaken: "Ning Zhuo succeeded! How could he do it so easily?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone was a major treasure, one of the foundations of the Demon Subjugation Hall, and had always been highly valued by Zhong Dao and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Not everyone could use it, and seeing someone use it as effortlessly as Ning Zhuo, the subordinate had seen very few!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The reason was simple - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"I am the Righteous Path!!!!" Ning Zhuo shouted in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">From childhood to adulthood, Ning Zhuo had always believed this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Because the Ning Clan itself was a righteous power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">When he was very young, Sun Lingtong had wanted to introduce Ning Zhuo into the Void Sect. One must know that the latter was a Super Sect, its strength and foundation far exceeding those of the Ning Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">But Ning Zhuo had been very persistent since he was a child and had zero interest in joining the Void Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">In the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had once said solemnly to Sun Lingtong: "The Righteous Path isn't just something you use to get by. It is a positive attitude toward life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"You see, those people on the Demonic Path are always fighting and killing, risking their lives against each other. It's too risky, not good at all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"I look forward more to how people interact - seeking common ground while reserving differences. Even if there are conflicts, we can tolerate and bear with each other, coexist peacefully, and enjoy the beauty of cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">To help his fellow clansmen who were oppressed by the main branch, Ning Zhuo had taken the initiative to leave and, through hard work, established the Ning branch family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">To help poorer clansmen, he actively assisted them in solving their livelihoods and improved the level of mutual benefit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Coincidentally, with the help of these clansmen (their vital essence blood), his cultivation accelerated - a true mutual benefit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This was a win-win situation, a successful model of righteous cooperation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo had also been actively striking against evil forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">For instance, in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he had struck against the local criminal group, the Monkey Head Gang, indirectly helping Yuan Dasheng turn over a new leaf and become a better ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">In the Two Note Kingdom, he had also helped the half-demon Liu Er, completely disregarding racial differences. He had dealt heavy blows to the demonic forces causing chaos in the Thousand Peaks Forest and helped the female general Mu Lan. For this, he had even sacrificed himself, forced to become Mu Lan's husband. 'Sigh', he still hadn't found the time to resolve that trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">And in the White Paper Immortal City, for the sake of the city's commoners and to protect the myriad creatures of the Ghostly Black Marshlands, he had been willing to risk his life to charge into the Underworld and narrowly defeat the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. To end the future threat, he had even been forced to take away the Heavenly Gift of Drowning in No Return, making the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord abandon his evil designs!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Upon arriving at the Myriad Manifestations Sect, even though he was alone against demonic cultivators like Pi Fu and Ban Ji, he remained brave and fearless, tossing their deep backgrounds to the back of his mind. Especially during the minor trial in the Demon Subjugation Hall, his answers to the three heart-testing questions were resonant and powerful. Every action showcased Ning Zhuo's righteous style!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"I am a hero!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"If I am not the Righteous Path, then who is? Who else could possibly be the Righteous Path?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">From childhood to adulthood, from inside to out, Ning Zhuo believed he was the Righteous Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Because of the pressures of life, I did indeed act like a thief for a period of time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"But what choice did I have?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"I had to survive; I couldn't fail my mother's hopes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Besides, even when acting like a thief, I have always faced the light from beginning to end."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"The adventure in the White Paper Immortal City is enough to prove my persistence and my original intention. I am the Righteous Path, I am a hero of the Righteous Path!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"As for now..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo suddenly opened his eyes, a sharp light like lightning flashing within them as his aura surged abruptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Then let the world witness my Noble Qi!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Boom - !</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The next moment, a white-gold aura erupted forth like a white rainbow, soaring directly into the sky, smashing through the formation, and piercing deep into the firmament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">A white rainbow piercing the sun!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"What?!" In that instant, Situ Tong's eyes bulged as if someone were punching them from behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He was utterly shocked!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">He had toiled through almost a lifetime of cultivation to accumulate a massive amount of Noble Qi. In terms of scale, within the entire Confucian community, he only lost to Duanmu Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">But now, another person who surpassed him had appeared - and that was Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Situ Tong screamed in his heart: "The White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone, that's right, it must be that major treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"But even so, even so..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"To use the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone to produce Noble Qi, it still depends on the cultivator themselves!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"This young man Ning Zhuo... is so, so very Righteous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Among the observing crowd, Zhong Dao's subordinate could only squint his eyes into thin slits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The brilliance of the white rainbow was too intense, stinging his eyes until tears fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">At this moment, the subordinate's heart was filled with shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">He knew that his master Zhong Dao's investigation had finally reached its ultimate conclusion. He knew even more that, with this performance, Ning Zhuo was destined to become the top favorite in Zhong Dao's eyes!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
