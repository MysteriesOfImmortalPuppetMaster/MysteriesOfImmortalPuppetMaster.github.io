<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Myriad Manifestations Sect, Main Mountain Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A training hall within the Martial Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Liu Fu stood before his opponent, his face dark and stormy, and transmitted a message with his divine sense: "Chen Er, why are you doing this? What did Ning Zhuo offer you to make you risk offending Lord Yu Heye and stubbornly accept my challenge?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo had hired a group of cultivators to rent cave mansions on a massive scale, forcing Liu Fu to confess his crimes to Yu Heye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Yu Heye ordered his subordinates to harass the cultivators renting the cave mansions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">As this was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Main Mountain Gate, internal disputes between cultivators were typically resolved through the Martial Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Internal Affairs Hall primarily handled major conflicts among the sect's members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">For less serious disputes, the sect encouraged its disciples to settle matters privately through martial sparring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This system perfectly suited the Myriad Manifestations Sect's circumstances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The sect had an overwhelming number of members, and the resulting friction led to countless conflicts. Adopting the conventional management methods of a super-sect would require a massive workforce dedicated solely to resolving disputes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Such human-driven governance would inevitably breed corruption and even lead to wrongful convictions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">After all, the Myriad Manifestations Sect wasn't a cultivation nation. In such nations, officials could investigate and judge cases, relying on divine insight and official authority to cast spells, often uncovering the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">During the lead-up to the Flying Cloud Assembly, cultivators from all directions flooded the Main Mountain Gate, swelling the population even further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Vast numbers of non-sect cultivators would temporarily reside here, inevitably leading to a surge in disputes and conflicts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Myriad Manifestations Sect largely ignored these matters, leaving them to be resolved privately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This approach served two purposes: it minimized administrative costs and fostered a survival-of-the-fittest atmosphere within the sect. As a result, those who rose to prominence within the sect typically possessed formidable combat prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">With both high combat power and a large population, irreconcilable internal conflicts were inevitable. These factors made it impossible for the Myriad Manifestations Sect to confine itself to its established boundaries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">To prevent internal strife from escalating, the sect's leaders naturally shifted internal conflicts outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This strategy allowed them to secure more territory, providing room for internal maneuvering among their members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Over time, the Myriad Manifestations Sect's influence expanded relentlessly. Those who temporarily lost out in internal competition often established outposts beyond the sect's borders, hoping to turn the tide. This led to the sect's tentacles stretching further and further, extending its reach across the land.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">So, when Yu Heye discovered that someone had interfered with the mountain peak he had chosen, he naturally opted for a martial challenge to resolve the issue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Most of the cultivators Ning Zhuo had gathered chose to avoid conflict, unwilling to risk their lives for the ten mid-grade Spirit Stones. They voluntarily withdrew their cave mansion leases.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">However, a stubborn few accepted the challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Chen Er," standing before Liu Fu, was one of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Liu Fu had already learned that Ning Zhuo's rallying cry for these low-level cultivators was the promise of ten mid-grade Spirit Stones. Was Chen Er really willing to risk his life for such a paltry sum?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Fatalities during martial challenges were not uncommon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">What Liu Fu didn't know was that "Chen Er" was merely a temporary alias. His true identity was the Old Chef who served Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Old Chef remained silent, merely beckoning Liu Fu with a crooked finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Liu Fu flew into a rage. "Obstinate fool!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">With a wave of his hand, he unleashed ten talismans. The talismans ignited in mid-air, transforming into a barrage of water arrows that surged toward the Old Chef.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Old Chef's mind stirred, and he summoned a "shield" to block the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Simultaneously, he stamped his foot against the ground, activating a movement technique that propelled him forward with astonishing speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Bang! Bang! Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The shield proved remarkably agile, moving at his will to encircle the Old Chef and intercept every threatening water arrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Old Chef reached into his robe and scattered a handful of glutinous rice into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The rice grains swelled mid-air, transforming into massive, pale-yellow worms that swarmed toward Liu Fu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Liu Fu's heart leaped. "A Gu Cultivator?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He drew his signature Magic Artifact - a sword case he had acquired from the market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Channeling spiritual energy, he opened the case, unleashing a barrage of faint golden sword qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The razor-sharp sword qi pierced through the worms, their momentum carrying them back around for a second strike. After repeated strikes, a colossal worm finally succumbed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Old Chef smiled inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">A mistake. Liu Fu's decision to use sword qi against the giant worms was a grave error.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Old Chef had intended the worms merely as a distraction. By expending vast amounts of spiritual energy to conjure sword qi and focus solely on killing the worms, Liu Fu had surrendered the initiative in this battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Had the sword qi been directed at Old Chef, he would have been forced to defend with all his might, resulting in a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But now, with no external pressure, Old Chef could effortlessly turn his attention to Liu Fu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He produced a gourd and sprayed out a torrent of golden oil droplets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The hundreds of thousands of droplets formed a torrential downpour, engulfing Liu Fu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Having lost the advantage, Liu Fu could only activate a talisman, conjuring a Golden Bell Light Shield around himself for temporary protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Golden Bell Light Shield proved remarkably sturdy. Oil droplets crashed against it, shattering into fragments, and scattered remnants splashed in all directions. For a moment, the attack seemed impenetrable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"This is a Talisman Treasure," Shen Xi observed from the sidelines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">A mere martial arts demonstration would never have captured his attention. But this involved Ning Zhuo, and by extension, his own influence within the alliance, piquing his interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"What do you think, cousin?" Shen Xi asked, seizing the opportunity to test Su Lingkou's insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Su Lingkou replied without hesitation, "Liu Fu is no fighter. He made two critical errors: first, he surrendered the initiative, and second, while appearing steadfast, he turned himself into a sitting duck."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Especially that first mistake!" Su Lingkou shook her head, her face contorted with disdain. "Liu Fu actually used sword qi against those worms? Utterly foolish!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Shen Xi smiled faintly. "I can understand his reasoning. Gu Cultivators' methods are notoriously bizarre and unpredictable. Liu Fu likely chose to eliminate the worms first as a precaution."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"But his judgment failed him. Chen Er isn't a Gu Cultivator; he must have some culinary skills."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The observer sees clearest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Shen Xi noticed the subtle details, recognizing that what the Old Chef was scattering wasn't Gu insects, but glutinous rice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Liu Fu is about to lose," Su Lingkou observed. "This Chen Er must be Ning Zhuo's countermeasure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"He's hidden his true experts here. Yu Heye's subordinates won't take this defeat lying down. In the end, Yu Heye himself might even step in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Mm," Shen Xi nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Concentrating on the battle, he pointed at Old Chef. "Cousin, I need to investigate him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Shen Xi needed to determine whether Old Chef was a high-priced mercenary hired by Ning Zhuo or a subordinate Ning Zhuo had brought with him. The distinction was crucial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">As soon as he spoke, Old Chef unleashed a decisive strike, severely injuring Liu Fu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Despite his victory, Old Chef remained in the Martial Hall. The second and third matches were still to come.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Due to the concentrated challenge format, the Martial Hall had scheduled all the matches between Ning Zhuo and Yu Heye's subordinates together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The second match pitted a tall, muscular man against a short, agile one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The tall man roared, his arms bulging with muscles like gnarled tree roots, and slammed his fists into the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">An earth serpent erupted from the earth, lunging toward the shorter man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The short man chuckled, his movements lightning-fast. He leaped onto the serpent's back and charged straight at his towering opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The tall man snorted coldly and unleashed over a dozen talismans, which ignited instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The talismans transformed into a barrage of stone spikes that shot toward the short man. The short man's speed surged, leaving afterimages in his wake as he charged headfirst into the storm of stone spikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Weaving through the relentless barrage, he dodged every attack with uncanny agility, closing the distance to the tall man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The tall man, skilled in ranged spellcasting, quickly faltered under the short man's close-quarters assault with a dagger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sensing the dire situation, the tall man had no choice but to concede defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Third match, fourth match, fifth match...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Yu Heye's side lost every single one!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">This lopsided outcome left Su Lingkou utterly astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Shen Xi's eyes gleamed with sharp interest. "Where did Ning Zhuo find these skilled fighters? Cousin, investigate these people thoroughly and uncover their identities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Realizing he had underestimated Ning Zhuo's capabilities, he thought to himself, "I need to reassess my approach to this man."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">As evening approached...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"They were all defeated?" In the cultivation chamber, Yu Heye jerked his head up, his eyes widening as he stared at Liu Fu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Liu Fu's face was deathly pale as he stammered out the details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Finally, he handed Yu Heye another invitation card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The card was still from Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Yu Heye frowned deeply, staring at the invitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">After a moment of silence, his brow relaxed, and a faint smile appeared on his face. "A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator," he chuckled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">His impression of Ning Zhuo had begun to shift slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Though still just a minor cultivator in the Foundation Establishment Stage, Ning Zhuo seemed to command a force that warranted greater consideration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Of course, not too much consideration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Yu Heye knew very well that the cultivators who had attached themselves to him were far from exceptional in strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He cultivated the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art, and his physical condition deteriorated daily. Yet he still had to risk breaking through to the Nascent Soul Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Any true elite from the Foundation Establishment Stage seeking a powerful patron would never choose him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">A flame erupted from his palm, incinerating the invitation card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Yu Heye flicked his hand and turned to Liu Fu. "The enemy came prepared, catching you off guard. Your defeat was understandable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Instead of reprimanding them, he offered Liu Fu and the others a way to save face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"In that case, let's pull some strings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Ning Zhuo's plan to gather Loose Cultivators on a large scale and establish them here hinges on one crucial element: the Cultivator within the Internal Affairs Hall who is assisting him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Whether through warnings, threats, or bribery, neutralizing this key figure could effectively silence Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Yu Heye began to strategize.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Having long anticipated Ning Zhuo's methods, he immediately recognized this critical vulnerability. Disrupting it would severely hinder Ning Zhuo's operations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">But the next moment, Liu Fu offered a wry smile. "My lord, we've just identified the Internal Affairs Hall Cultivator collaborating with Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"His surname is Cao, and his name is Cao Gui."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Yu Heye's brow furrowed instantly. "The Cao?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Liu Fu was a veteran under his command; otherwise, Yu Heye wouldn't have entrusted him with the task of expelling the Cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Liu Fu nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Yu Heye's frown deepened. "It seems our opponent came prepared."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Years ago, Yu Heye had offended a prominent figure from the main peak - a member of the Cao Family. To resolve the matter, he had nearly exhausted his entire fortune.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Though the Cao Family hadn't directly retaliated, they had effectively blocked his path to becoming a Golden Core True Disciple. How could they possibly allow an enemy to become a True Inheritor of the sect?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo had gathered intelligence in advance; his money wasn't wasted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Since this approach failed, Yu Heye devised another plan. "It's strange that these people are working for Ning Zhuo. Investigate our opponents and try to bribe them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">With the Cao Family's involvement, Yu Heye dared not make any major moves. He preferred to spend money to avoid trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Liu Fu nodded and left to carry out the order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Half a day later, Su Lingkou reported to Shen Xi with disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Shen Xi raised an eyebrow. "You mean you couldn't find any information about them at all?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Su Lingkou nodded. "Yes, it's as if they appeared out of thin air."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">A grave expression settled on Shen Xi's face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Bringing outsiders to the Myriad Manifestations Sect was not uncommon. But since these weren't Loose Cultivators, it meant Ning Zhuo had the backing of a powerful force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">In Shen Xi's mind, Ning Zhuo immediately became shrouded in mystery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Liu Fu delivered a similar report to Yu Heye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">After dismissing Liu Fu, Yu Heye fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">This development wasn't a flaw in his plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Like Shen Xi, Yu Heye once again raised his assessment of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Why is this person going to such lengths to make things difficult for me? Just because I expelled him and made him lose face?" Yu Heye wondered, puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">To dispel his doubts, Yu Heye simply needed to confront Ning Zhuo face-to-face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">But...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He had burned all the invitation cards!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Just as Yu Heye began to regret his rashness, his gaze suddenly froze. Beside his hand lay an invitation card, placed there silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">What?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Yu Heye's shock was profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">He had no idea when the card had been placed there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">If the sender could deliver an invitation card undetected, couldn't they also approach him unnoticed and casually take his life?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Ning Zhuo, which faction is backing you?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Yu Heye unfolded the invitation card and quickly scanned its contents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The message was simple: Ning Zhuo requested an audience with Yu Heye to discuss the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Yu Heye scoffed in amusement. "A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator dares to discuss Dao with a late-stage Golden Core True Disciple like me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">He was displeased. This attitude of equal exchange irked Yu Heye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Yet this time, he refrained from tearing up the invitation card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">After careful consideration, he summoned Liu Fu again. "Arrange for Ning Zhuo to be hosted tomorrow. Prepare fine wine and delicacies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Liu Fu bowed. "As you command."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The next day, Ning Zhuo arrived at Solid Rock Cave Mansion precisely on time, as promised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">His impeccable manners and respectful address, referring to Yu Heye as "Senior," significantly eased the latter's mood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">After the customary pleasantries, Ning Zhuo stated plainly that he had originally intended to take the ten Spirit Stones and choose a more convenient cave mansion elsewhere. However, Shen Xi had sought him out with urgent matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">He briefly explained the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"I see," Yu Heye said, stroking his beard with an impassive expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"Therefore, Senior Yu, please rest assured," Ning Zhuo continued. "Though I've leveraged the Cao Family's influence, this matter isn't about them using me to trouble you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Words are often best understood in reverse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">In other words, if Ning Zhuo truly wanted to confront Yu Heye, he could have exploited this power far more deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Yu Heye gave Ning Zhuo a long, penetrating look. "What do you intend to do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Ning Zhuo deftly changed the subject. "This junior has recently been studying the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art and has encountered some perplexing questions. I would be honored to seek your guidance, Senior Yu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Yu Heye snorted coldly, impatient with Ning Zhuo's evasiveness. Yet he still stroked his beard and raised his chin slightly. "Speak your mind."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
