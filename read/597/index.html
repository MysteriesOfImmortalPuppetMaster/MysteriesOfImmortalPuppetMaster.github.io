<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 597: Ning Zhuo, Vice City Lord</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"What an outrageous rate of progress!" Even Ning Zhuo himself was secretly stunned by the speed of his soul cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"I previously consumed large amounts of spirit food for over ten days, and only then did I reach Thousand Man Soul."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"But now, using the four treasures in just two rounds, I’ve surged all the way to Ten Thousand Man Soul!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Such cultivation speed completely defied common sense, and it continued to accelerate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">But upon careful reflection, it was actually reasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The spirit food Ning Zhuo had consumed before were all of the Foundation Establishment level. But now the four treasures he was using were each of the Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul - this was the normal order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Now Ning Zhuo had directly skipped the Golden Core stage, using Nascent Soul grade resources on himself, even though he was merely a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This was definitely a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, an extravagant act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In a super sect, this kind of thing would be extremely rare. It would be like an inner disciple consuming cultivation resources meant for a true disciple, or even for sect elders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">While continuing his soul cultivation, Ning Zhuo also paid attention to the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">After the six Golden Core Ghost Generals were defeated, no one else dared to intrude. The ghost creatures that had stirred up slaughter within the city were also gradually eliminated thanks to Wen Ruanyu’s efforts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Through Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo observed Sun Lingtong’s surroundings and monitored the situation from the battlefield outside the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"The defenses of an immortal city are truly formidable!" Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong shared the same sentiment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The ghost army dispatched by Forgetful River Underworld Prefecture was an elite force, but after attacking the immortal city for a long time, they had lost troops and gained nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Not long after, the war flags wavered and the withdrawal signal was sounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The ghost army slowly retreated, voluntarily ending this siege.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">They had sacrificed thirty percent of their forces, and in return had only managed to scrape off a few layers of talisman paper from the city walls of the immortal city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">They withdrew in an orderly manner, several Golden Core Ghost Generals personally overseeing the formation, maintaining strict discipline.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Sun Lingtong blended in with them, moving in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">This ghost army did not retreat directly back to the underworld but instead camped ten li outside White Paper Immortal City, gradually constructing a military encampment in the wastelands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Since a strong assault had failed and the internal unrest within the city was subsiding, the ghost army’s commander had no choice but to pull back, secretly hoping the city’s defenders would pursue them into open battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Field battle?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Not a chance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Tie Guzheng knew perfectly well that their city guard could not employ military tactics, whereas the opposing side was a real army. If it came to open combat, without the strong defenses of White Paper Immortal City, their forces would be no match even for a small bite from the ghost army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Wen Ruanyu returned to the giant paper effigy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He slowly put away his self-portrait and looked at Ning Zhuo cultivating his soul, unable to hide his envy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">These four great soul cultivation Treasures were all of Nascent Soul grade. Wen Ruanyu had been in White Paper Immortal City for so long, but had never possessed so many at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine is a blend of soul cultivation and Confucian cultivation techniques. It draws in the energy of the underworld, condenses the essence of moonlight, and is brewed from spirit grain and immortal fruit aged over a hundred years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Nine Springs Rest Incense was crafted by the Sorrowful Ghost Melody Seer. Her cultivation in the Nine Springs Sound Art enabled her to make such incense. With her death, this art is now lost."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"The Hungry Ghost Backlash Cauldron was a grand gift from the Soul Devouring Sect to the City Lord. It was crafted with great care, inspired by the Soul Devouring Technique, though it reveals nothing of the sect’s core methods. Quite ingenious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The rarest is still the Underworld Punishment Codex. This is a national artifact of the Underworld. Who knows which generation of City Lord acquired it and from where."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Seeing Wen Ruanyu return, Ning Zhuo slowly stopped his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Wen Ruanyu smiled and first congratulated Ning Zhuo on his major contribution. White Paper City Lord had issued a generous reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Curious, Ning Zhuo asked what the reward was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">With a complex and indescribable expression, Wen Ruanyu took out a seal stamp and handed it to Ning Zhuo. "Jiao Ma, from this moment on, you are the Vice City Lord of our White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Even though Ning Zhuo had speculated about the reward, seeing it with his own eyes still shocked him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He knew very well that White Paper Immortal City rarely appointed a Vice City Lord. The only true leader here had always been the City Lord alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He never imagined White Paper City Lord would be so bold as to directly hand over the Vice City Lord seal stamp to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"White Paper City Lord trusts me that much?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Or is she convinced that I am the savior of this crisis? That would be too much honor for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Or perhaps, she is confident in the methods she has used on me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">White Paper City Lord had planted talismans in each of Ning Zhuo’s three dantians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Sun Lingtong had once suggested trying to steal them out, but later Ning Zhuo learned about his mother’s past with White Paper Immortal City and changed his mind about fleeing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">In such circumstances, the talismans could not be hastily removed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">In a way, they were the foundation of mutual trust between Ning Zhuo and the White Paper City Lord. Removing them now would be unwise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This was not the time to extract the talismans!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">After a moment’s thought, Ning Zhuo accepted the Vice City Lord seal stamp and began refining it while asking Wen Ruanyu about the fate of the Silent Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Wen Ruanyu replied that the five Golden Core Ghost Generals captured alive had all been imprisoned for interrogation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Speaking of which, there’s someone you should meet." As Wen Ruanyu recalled something, he directly pulled out a command token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He shook the command token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In the next moment, a ghost flew out from the token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This ghost quickly materialized into a solid form. He was thin and wiry, with three mouths on his face. It was an old acquaintance - Blabbermouth Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Unlike before, Blabbermouth Ghost General was now clad in a suit of paper armor. His skin was also inscribed with many white characters. These characters were very small, but they were interlinked to form chain-like patterns that covered his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"This humble one greets Young Master Jiao Ma." Blabbermouth Ghost General bowed on his own initiative. Clearly, he had been instructed in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Even without any prior instruction, Ning Zhuo’s terrifying performance on the battlefield had already deeply shocked Blabbermouth Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">So in front of Ning Zhuo, Blabbermouth Ghost General was timid and cautious, completely lacking the presence of a Golden Core level figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo gave him a brief glance, then turned his focus to Wen Ruanyu. "Is such a surrender truly reliable?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Reliable, reliable, reliable!" Blabbermouth Ghost General quickly pledged his loyalty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Shut up." Ning Zhuo glanced at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Blabbermouth Ghost General trembled and lowered his head immediately. "Yes, yes, yes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Wen Ruanyu gave a bitter smile. "Jiao Ma, do you know how much battle strength our city lost in this round of internal and external turmoil?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Wen Ruanyu reported the casualties, which moved even Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Wen Ruanyu continued, "This ghost tide is different from before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"In previous ghost tides, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord may have meddled, but it was always in secret. This time, however, he directly dispatched an army of ghost soldiers, clearly determined to seize victory."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Forgetful River Underworld Prefecture is comparable to a cultivation nation. Though the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord cannot enter the mortal realm, his forces are vast and overwhelming."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Therefore, this may become a prolonged war. We must maintain a fighting force in order to have any hope of enduring this tribulation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Wen Ruanyu first explained the necessity of recruiting enemy generals, then added, "Blabbermouth Ghost General is already quite trustworthy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"On one hand, the paper armor on him is a restriction cast by Madam City Lord. On the other hand, he also bears the Confucian technique, the ‘Amnesty and Alliance Policy’."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo was curious. "Amnesty and Alliance Policy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Wen Ruanyu explained, "It is a Confucian spell used to persuade and win over enemies. It’s very effective and quite reliable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo pressed further. "Was it cast personally by Senior Wen?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Wen Ruanyu shook his head. "No, but the caster is absolutely trustworthy. They are an elder left behind specifically by Senior Sister Meng Yaoyin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Back to the main issue."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Madam City Lord has also ordered the two of us to continue investigating the traitor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">At this, Ning Zhuo felt troubled, and his brow furrowed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Wen Ruanyu, however, had more confidence in Ning Zhuo than Ning Zhuo had in himself. "With Jiao Ma taking the lead, the traitor surely won’t stay hidden for long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "I can only gather clues and evidence, develop theories, and make deductions. If Sorrowful Ghost Melody Seer were still alive, then we’d have certainty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">At the mention of their deceased colleague, Wen Ruanyu’s face darkened, sorrow and grief welling up in his expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo knew he was not skilled in investigation, but there was no other way. He could only steel himself and push forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The matter was urgent, so Ning Zhuo paused his cultivation and turned his attention to the task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After some thought, he asked Wen Ruanyu about the origin of the ghost uprising within the city that had led to the slaughter of civilians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Wen Ruanyu told him that deep within the Ink River, someone had erected a temporary Ghost Gate. A great number of ghost creatures had poured out from it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo proposed, "Then let’s start investigating from the Ink River. What do you say?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Wen Ruanyu nodded without hesitation. "Madam City Lord has assigned me to act as your deputy, so you take the lead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">On the surface, Wen Ruanyu was still the primary figure, with Jiao Ma at his side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">As for the position of Vice City Lord, Ning Zhuo chose to keep it hidden. There was no need to draw attention and invite assassination from the enemy at such a critical moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Ink River was a waterway running through the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Its water was pitch black and carried a faint fragrance of ink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo arrived at the affected section of the river and, together with Wen Ruanyu, entered the water. They found only a few traces, with no valuable clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"This traitor covered their tracks well." Wen Ruanyu sighed. "We’ve already searched this area multiple times and are now checking all Ink River segments within the city."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo came ashore again, thought for a moment, and said to Wen Ruanyu, "The source of all these Ink Rivers is the Ink Pool. Sir Wen, you mentioned before that this Ink Pool was left behind by Senior Meng Yaoyin?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Indeed," Wen Ruanyu replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo was very interested in the Ink Pool itself. "Then let’s go take a look."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Ink Pool was located beneath White Paper Immortal City. Its water was as black as ink, but not murky. Instead, it gave off a deep, tranquil aura, as if it could reflect the heart. The surface was still, like a slab of black jade embedded in the ground, occasionally sending out faint ripples, as though it possessed spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">At the edge of the pool stood a stone stele with three words inscribed - "Wash the Heart".</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">As Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu approached, shadows rippled from the pool and formed a hunched figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He was a wizened old Confucian scholar, gaunt and bony, with white hair and beard, and wrinkles carved deep like ravines. His cloudy eyes occasionally glimmered with clarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He wore a pale, well-washed scholar’s robe of bluish-gray, and at his waist hung an old wooden plaque engraved with two words: "Ink Guardian."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo was slightly taken aback, realizing he had met this old Confucian cultivator before. He was the gate official who had recorded his name when he first entered the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Master Zheng, this Young Master Jiao Ma is skilled in strategy and investigation. He will act as my deputy in uncovering the traitor within White Paper Immortal City." Wen Ruanyu took the initiative to bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The old Confucian by the Ink Pool was surnamed Zheng. After being appointed by Meng Yaoyin, he had changed his name to Ink Guardian, meaning the one who watches over the Ink Pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He had never failed the trust of Meng Yaoyin and had remained dutiful ever since.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Because of his merit in guarding the Ink Pool and his outstanding virtue, even Wen Ruanyu, a Golden Core true disciple of Myriad Manifestations Sect, treated him with great respect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo, wanting to learn more about his mother, took the opportunity under the guise of investigation to ask him some questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The old man of the Ink Pool replied, "Back in those days, I survived only with my lady’s help. From then on, I swore to follow her, offering a lifetime of loyalty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"My mistress ordered me to guard the Ink Pool. All these years, I have never once slackened in my duty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"The Ink Pool is a Confucian cultural artifact, derived from the inkstone among the Four Treasures of the Study: brush, ink, paper, and inkstone. The water of the Ink Pool can enlighten the people, cleanse them of martial savagery and violent temper, and guide them to the path of culture and virtue."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Constructing the Ink Pool comes at a very high cost. But my mistress possessed great benevolence and spared no expense to build it, without taking a single coin of profit from White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"That White Paper Immortal City has survived and reached today's state of peace and order is largely due to the cultural education that the Ink Pool has inspired."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Just like Wen Ruanyu, the old Confucian scholar of the Ink Pool held Meng Yaoyin in the highest regard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Hearing this, Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, feeling proud in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Aside from guarding the Ink Pool, do you also take on other duties? I recall seeing you working as a gate officer before," Ning Zhuo asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Wen Ruanyu gave a faint smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The old scholar of the Ink Pool explained, "Maintaining the daily operation of the Ink Pool is not merely about guarding its safety."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"I must understand the sentiments of the people in order to properly tailor the process of cultural guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Therefore, in addition to serving as a gate officer, I often visit alleys and neighborhoods and participate in many aspects of everyday street life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo came to a realization. "I see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">He proceeded to ask many questions, which the old scholar answered one by one, with calm and steady speech that gave an impression of reliability and composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu each took turns inspecting the Ink Pool, but found no clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The old scholar then offered, "Perhaps there are some leads that may be of help to you two Sirs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Oh?" Ning Zhuo looked at the scholar with interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The old scholar said, "I have no special insight, but I have recently been involved in overseeing the prison and conducting interrogations, and that reminded me of the five Golden Core Ghost Generals that Sir Wen recently captured."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Perhaps they know something. We might be able to extract some useful information from them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Wen Ruanyu nodded. "That’s true... Even if they have no clues, if we can extract some military intel from them, it would still count as an achievement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The old scholar smiled. "I was just about to clock in for duty. You might as well come with me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The three of them left the Ink Pool and headed to the prison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The old scholar led them into an interrogation chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">As the one in charge, the moment he entered, subordinates came forward eagerly to report. They said that four of the Golden Core Ghost Generals had already started talking, though each to varying degrees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Only the Silent Ghost General remained unyielding, with an unwavering attitude. No matter how severe the torture, he had yet to utter a single word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Interesting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Then allow this old man to meet him." The old scholar slowly rolled up his sleeves and picked up a branding iron from the charcoal brazier.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
