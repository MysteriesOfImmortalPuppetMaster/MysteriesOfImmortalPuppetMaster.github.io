<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng could not help but fall into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Li Guanyu did not look favorably upon Ning Zhuo, believing he was not a match for Gu Qing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">There was good reason for this. The Rising Cloud Minor Trial was concerned with paper-making. This process required the participation of many Confucian cultivator methods, such as utilizing Literary Qi, Literary Heart, and even the Literary Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo was not an orthodox Confucian cultivator, but Gu Qing was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The latter was not only a Confucian cultivator but had been nurtured as one since childhood, receiving a classic Confucian education. His teacher was none other than the Great Scholar Zhao Hansheng! It could be said that in terms of Confucian cultivator cultivation, Gu Qing had received far more guidance than Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Now that he had come to participate in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, his advantage was clear at a glance - it was truly immense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Even though Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng were inclined toward Ning Zhuo, they could not deny this advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Furthermore, Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng could not possibly stop Gu Qing from participating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">There were many things that could only be done in secret; on the surface, fairness and impartiality had to be upheld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This was why the Profound Armor Cave faction had been so furious upon seeing Ban Jie bury traps and manipulate the minor trial. Ban Jie had paid a huge price afterward to obtain the forgiveness of the Profound Armor Cave faction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng could not show excessive bias toward Ning Zhuo; otherwise, the credibility and reputation of the Confucian cultivator community would be ruined!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">So, what should be done next?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After a moment of silence, Song Taosheng said, "Actually, this doesn't matter. We previously wanted to support Ning Zhuo because we didn't understand him. Now we know that Ning Zhuo is a first-rate genius. Relying on his own strength, he can make a name for himself in the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"In the previous two Confucian cultivator minor trials, he took first place in both. To be honest, this has already aroused considerable suspicion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"We only need to ensure that in the next two Confucian cultivator minor trials, we provide him with precise assistance. That will be enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Song Taosheng's meaning was very clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Even without their help, Ning Zhuo could rely on himself to seize the top spot in other Rising Cloud Minor Trials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Therefore, even if he did not become the head scholar in this specific Confucian cultivator minor trial, it did not matter!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In fact, there were benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">At the very least, it would verify that the Confucian cultivator community's minor trial was not designed exclusively for Ning Zhuo, completely dispelling potential suspicions and risks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Song Taosheng paused, then added, "With Gu Qing participating, I feel there are also quite a few benefits."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"This child comes from the Huazhang Kingdom and is a young genius known throughout the country. That he has come to participate in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial we organized signifies that we have allies outside the Myriad Manifestations Sect. This can greatly boost our reputation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Hearing this, Chu Xuangui and Li Guanyu nodded simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Chu Xuangui suddenly thought of Situ Gu. "Looking at it this way, Situ Gu almost actively joining this Rising Cloud Minor Trial earlier... he must have met with Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing beforehand, and perhaps even reached an agreement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Li Guanyu interjected, "If that's the case, then Gu Qing's intention is also clear. He wants to seize the top spot in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Confucian cultivators always had a few tricks up their sleeves when it came to politics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">During their discussion, the three easily saw through Situ Gu's stance and Gu Qing's intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Li Guanyu looked at the two before him with a teasing expression. "When a Great Scholar makes a move, it really is extraordinary. We worked hard to set up this layout, and in the end, someone comes from afar and tries to pick the fruit right away."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Song Taosheng smiled freely. "How can worldly affairs always go as we wish? In the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect, the three of us only possess Golden Core cultivation. And the entire Confucian academic group only possesses a certain amount of volume within the middle stratum of the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Chu Xuangui's expression was calm, his voice indifferent. "Zhao Hansheng is a Great Scholar on par with old Mr. Duanmu Zhang. It would be very difficult for us to obstruct him, and there is no need to."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Gu Qing is traveling the world, wanting to accumulate battle achievements everywhere; this is understandable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Since he wants this top spot so badly, it wouldn't be justifiable if he didn't pay some price, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">At this point, Chu Xuangui had already abandoned the original plan of supporting Ning Zhuo to charge for the top spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Since the matter was no longer feasible, they would go with the flow and modify the plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">In the end, the relationship between Chu Xuangui and Ning Zhuo was not that tight; it was more about appreciation and optimism. Within the entire Confucian cultivator community, the only one who would truly give more for Ning Zhuo was Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">However, that person was still under house arrest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo was ultimately not an orthodox Confucian cultivator. In the hearts of the Confucian cultivators, there was always a layer of separation between him and "their own."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Li Guanyu and Song Taosheng wore faint smiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">It was excellent that Chu Xuangui could change his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Li Guanyu laughed. "As a Great Scholar, Zhao Hansheng surely has substantial family assets. It is only right that he adds some luster to this Rising Cloud Minor Trial for the sake of his own student."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Haha, I'll participate in this good show as well. I'll go with you two to pay a visit to this Great Scholar who has traveled from afar."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng immediately expressed their welcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Song Taosheng said, "Once we have settled the discussion, we will spread the relevant news."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Li Guanyu nodded. "Given Ning Zhuo's attainments, he will naturally be able to understand the message we want to convey."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He had also gained a lot of understanding regarding Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The reason for this result was that Ning Zhuo's entire performance in the Profound Armor Cave had been recorded in Jade Slips and sold extensively through the Commerce Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">It was as if Li Guanyu had witnessed Ning Zhuo's various performances in the Profound Armor Cave minor trial with his own eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">What impressed him most was Ning Zhuo's grasp of the human heart. At the final critical moment, Ning Zhuo had used only words to persuade the others to actively back down. This even included Golden Core cultivators like Tie Zheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This behavior made Li Guanyu appreciate Ning Zhuo greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Because Confucian cultivators basically all advocated the policy of "a gentleman uses his mouth, not his hands."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo retreating the enemy with words happened to hit the behavioral preference of the Confucian cultivators right on the mark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Duanmu Zhang changing his view of Ning Zhuo previously also stemmed from this reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Green Stone Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo was studying painstakingly, comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">With the computational support of the Luo Shu, the blood meridians were continuously magnified, magnified again, until the most microscopic secrets were revealed within Ning Zhuo's Divine Sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This time, what he saw was no longer spirals, layers, and other complex structures, but the most basic element - Blood Qi Threads!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Constructing blood meridians is merely the result; it is the most outward appearance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">When a blood meridian was stretched purely and longitudinally, it did not simply become longer. Under the infusion of blood qi, countless Blood Qi Threads were like countless tightened bowstrings. This was the most fundamental principle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The simple action of pulling could accumulate terrifying recoil force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">And when this force erupted, it could be used anywhere in the body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">One Blood Qi Thread was very simple, but when two or three were interwoven, it became complex. Some threads provided the main power, called main lines. Others were responsible for guiding direction or restriction, called auxiliary lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Countless blood threads interwoven together formed the various structures of the blood meridians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">For example, layering: countless Blood Qi Threads arranged in parallel allowed the whole to withstand or accumulate pulling and recoil forces in a certain direction, appearing quite astonishing and manifesting a more macroscopic "toughness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Misalignment, on the other hand, involved countless tiny pulling and dragging lines continuously superimposing in a displaced manner within the space, causing the blood qi to be pressurized and refined within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The comprehension process this time was quite smooth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">To use an analogy, Ning Zhuo comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art before was like trekking through sand. Now, it was like sitting on a wooden board and sliding all the way down a sand dune.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Although Ning Zhuo was not surprised, he was happy. "My realm in Mechanism techniques has leaped to the master level. Comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art, I instantly captured the core."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"The core foundation is understood; next is to understand and memorize the various combination methods of the Blood Qi Threads."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Although this learning content was quite massive, Ning Zhuo only needed to proceed step by step, and he would not encounter learning obstacles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art is quite compatible with Mechanism techniques!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"By cultivating it, a cultivator can condense blood qi into blood meridians. These are alternative Mechanism parts that can be attached to flesh and bones. From this perspective, the Three Sects Immortal treated the human body as a Mechanism."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong quietly returned to the Green Stone Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Put them away safely, Little Zhuo. These are the Demonic Cultivator souls bought this time." He brought back a large number of Demonic Souls, including two at the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">There was no soul of Qin De.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">However, Ning Zhuo had known this for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">When Sun Lingtong was acting in the black market, Ning Zhuo had been observing through Life Hanging by a Thread. Once Sun Lingtong was in any danger, he would use his methods to quickly pull him away and escape the danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo had even watched the entire process of Sun Lingtong negotiating with the grey-robed cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun Lingtong : "I'm going back first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He had mostly been comprehending the Luo Shu formation recently and had made considerable progress. His comprehension was extremely high, and with the two Confucian techniques taught by Ning Zhuo, it was simply like adding wings to a tiger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"I'll strive to finish the Luo Shu formation within one or two months and collect this Dao Artifact!" Sun Lingtong left quietly after leaving this instruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Just as he left, bad news was delivered to Ning Zhuo's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Zhao Hansheng, Gu Qing..." Ning Zhuo frowned slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Someone was disrupting the situation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In Ning Zhuo's plan, the upcoming Confucian cultivator minor trial was equivalent to his guaranteed first place. He hadn't expected a problem to arise in this aspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing come with malice. First, to pick the peaches; second, they want to step on me to establish their reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"The greater my fame, the higher my value, and opponents like this will emerge one after another."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Back then, if Ning Zhuo had chosen to endure silently, there was a high probability that such events would not have happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">But by the same token, he would have suffered losses in other aspects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">There was no option in life that was perfect. There were always pros and cons; gaining something meant losing something else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Sigh, it's a pity. If I could have obtained the soul of the Demonic Dao Confucian cultivator Qin De, I would be more confident about this Confucian cultivator minor trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"I don't know why Zhong Dao suddenly attaches importance to Qin De and guards him strictly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo carefully pondered the intelligence and soon figured out the attitudes of Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Their attitude toward me has also undergone a subtle shift."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Facing Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing, the assistance they provided to Ning Zhuo would be greatly reduced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"In the final analysis, I am not truly one of their own."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo was not disappointed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">This move by the Confucian cultivator community was also reasonable and fair. They couldn't possibly throw away their own reputation just for Ning Zhuo, could they?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">In fact, if the Confucian cultivator community supported Ning Zhuo that strongly, Ning Zhuo would have felt troubled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The current situation was just right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This was a two-way choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo had also always regarded the Confucian cultivator community merely as one of his entry points into the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Refining these papers requires utilizing various Confucian cultivator resources."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Although for outsiders, anyone participating in this minor trial can be provided with these resources, it is ultimately not as good as using one's own."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Gu Qing possesses too great an advantage in this regard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Never mind that the Confucian cultivators don't favor me; even I feel that the hope of seizing the top spot is too slim."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo gave a wry laugh but still decided to participate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Even if he didn't get first place, as long as he could obtain the corresponding precious paper, it would be fine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Having settled his mood, Ning Zhuo began to utilize these Demonic Cultivator souls to commence his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Innate Talent True Self, Burning Boat Soul Ferrying Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Under the interplay of the two, the Demonic Cultivator souls howled miserably one after another, pouring the memories and experiences of a lifetime into Ning Zhuo's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Several hours later, Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Almost all the Demonic Cultivator souls had dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Exorcising demons and defending the Dao, we are duty-bound!" Ning Zhuo said with awe-inspiring righteousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">His eyes shone as he recalled the harvest this time, discovering that in the second round of purchasing, the quality of the souls was obviously not as good as the first wave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"It seems that the grey-robed cultivator's supply capability is not that great judging from this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"For the souls I need in the future, I still have to start with White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The memories and experiences of countless cultivators were like a massive amount of nutrition, covering many aspects of Cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">But for Ning Zhuo to digest them, there still had to be a process. Just like when he was in the Profound Armor Cave, facing various bronze weapons, he only rapidly digested the experiences and memories regarding Martial Art and truly turned them into his own through repeated sparring sessions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Most of the souls are either Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment. They just fill in the foundation, and there is a lot of overlap."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Continuing to absorb this type of soul in the future will yield lower and lower returns."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">What were truly useful were the experts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">What made Ning Zhuo's eyes light up the most this time was a Demonic Cultivator named Ling Mo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">This person was born in the North Wind Kingdom. His appearance was ordinary, he had no Innate Talent, but possessed an Ice Spiritual Root, so he joined a local small Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">A conspiracy led to the Sect being exterminated. He witnessed his benevolent teacher and Fellow Sect Members being slaughtered with his own eyes. During his escape, he was forced to flee into Frost Roar Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Inside Frost Roar Valley, he came close to death several times, struggling with difficulty while dragging his heavily injured body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Finally, with no way out, amidst extreme cold and despair, he relied on his astonishing talent and willpower to create a technique of his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">In the world of ice and snow, he used his own meridians as a furnace, Ten-Thousand-Year Profound Ice qi as material, and the obsession with revenge as the flame to re-forge his own Physical Body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">After the fact, he named this technique the Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Casting Demonic Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Traditional Ice Techniques often pursued changes in spells and long-range manipulation; Ling Mo discarded all of these. He used the power of cold ice to transform and enhance himself, making his own body the most powerful weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Frost Roar Valley..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo had once passed by there with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">It was a danger zone among danger zones, a desperate situation among desperate situations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">But Ling Mo was able to survive in it and even found a blessing in disguise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">And this Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Casting Demonic Art was precisely the reliance that allowed him to stay in Frost Roar Valley for a long time!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
