<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 165: First Take the Monkey Head</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Monkey Head Gang Headquarters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Xiangqian, Ning Xiangguo, and other former stewards of the Ning family marched forward with heads held high, directly storming the gates of the Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Stop, stop right there!" The gang guards, usually so arrogant, turned pale and shouted in panic upon seeing such a formidable group approaching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Xiangqian, Ning Xiangguo, and the others had all reached the Foundation Establishment Stage, qualifying them as stewards of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The main branch of the Ning family had dismissed many branch stewards, totaling nearly twenty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo, leveraging Ning Houjun's reputation, had gathered over a dozen people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">More than a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivatorsâ€”double the combat strength of the entire upper echelon of the Monkey Head Gang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Just seeing these Foundation Establishment cultivators made the gang members cower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Then, noticing the Ning family waist tokens hanging from each of them, their hearts sank. "The Ning family, one of the three great families! Why are they causing us trouble?" "Not good, not good, Boss!!" The gang members shouted in panic as they ran towards the back of the headquarters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The new leader of the Monkey Head Gang had not been in position for long, but with his seasoned tactics and stable relationships, he was far more secure in his position than Yuan Er ever was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Upon hearing the urgent report from his subordinates, his brows furrowed deeply, sensing the gravity of the situation. "The other side is coming with great momentum, clearly not with good intentions!" He stood up, thinking quickly, "Please, invite the heroes of the Ning family..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">In the next moment, the gate of the leader's courtyard was blasted apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The guards at the gate were sent flying, landing amidst the rubble and debris, groaning in pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Through the dust, the Ning family members strode into the courtyard with an air of arrogance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Even more imposing was a large, ornate mechanical carriage that crushed the debris under its wheels, stopping slowly in front of the Monkey Head Gang leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Xiangguo opened the carriage door from the outside, with several Foundation Establishment cultivators lined up behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">As Ning Zhuo stepped out of the carriage, all the Foundation Establishment cultivators bowed their heads in respect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The new leader of the Monkey Head Gang's pupils contracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He had expected at least an elder of the Ning family to be in the carriage, but it turned out to be a young cultivator at the third level of Qi Refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">However, the gang leader dared not be careless, putting on a smile and stepping forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Stop!" Ning Xiangqian intercepted him with a cold expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The gang leader dared not force his way through, standing in place and cupping his hands in greeting. "So it's Young Master Ning Zhuo gracing us with his presence. I apologize for not welcoming you sooner. Please forgive me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo looked at him and sneered, "It's good that you're here. Let's go inside; I'm here to settle accounts with you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The gang leader was shocked. "What do you mean by that? There must be some misunderstanding!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo, impatient with further conversation, waved his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Foundation Establishment cultivators beside him immediately formed a small encirclement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Killing intent filled the air, and a chilling aura spread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The gang leader felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave, his face filled with panic. "Misunderstanding, this must be a misunderstanding! Someone, anyone!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The commotion caused by Ning Zhuo had alarmed the entire Monkey Head Gang, and many Foundation Establishment elders of the gang hurried over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">But they did not step forward, only watching cautiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Too terrifying!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo had brought nearly twenty Foundation Establishment cultivators, a force capable of sweeping through the Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">More crucially, it was their identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Ning family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">One of the three great families, possessing Golden Core Stage combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Compared to them, the Monkey Head Gang was like an egg against a boulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo scanned the gathered gang members with a sharp gaze and shouted, "Yuan Er was my friend. Though we didn't meet often, our bond was deep. When Yuan Dasheng died, Yuan Er entrusted his body to me. I went all out to refine a mechanical apeâ€”Tree Martial Apeâ€”for him. You all know this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"But even with the Tree Martial Ape, my friend still died, right here in the gang's headquarters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Now, someone among you has reported to me, and I suspect this wasn't a simple revenge killing but a conspiracy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">For a moment, the gang members looked at each other, their anger and fear greatly alleviated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo's reasoning was very legitimate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Some gang elders' pupils contracted, their morale plummeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">They knew the truth: the elders were dissatisfied with Yuan Er's performance and had used Bao Qiu to stage an assassination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"But when did Ning Zhuo and Yuan Er become so close?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Hard to say! Yuan Er did entrust Yuan Dasheng's body to Ning Zhuo, and Ning Zhuo did send the Tree Martial Ape to protect Yuan Er."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"During that time, Ning Zhuo even sent two Ning family envoys to support Yuan Er."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The gang elders communicated secretly, realizing Ning Zhuo's words were true.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The new gang leader was filled with regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He was indeed the mastermind behind Yuan Er's assassination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Initially, he was wary of Ning Zhuo, so after Yuan Er's death, he didn't rush to take the position but waited to see the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Seeing no reaction from Ning Zhuo, and with the other gang elders' intentions unclear, he finally took the position, becoming the third-generation leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He cherished his hard-earned position, reforming many gang issues, increasing rewards for members, and sacrificing his own interests to win over other elders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Since taking office, he had worked tirelessly, sleeping only two hours a day, dedicating himself fully to stabilizing the gang and fostering a positive atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">And now, Ning Zhuo had come knocking!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He couldn't fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He couldn't provoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The gang leader wanted to yield, but Ning Zhuo wouldn't allow it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo declared he was avenging his friend, leaving the gang leader feeling extremely aggrieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"If you were going to do this, why didn't you come earlier?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Did you wait for me to become the leader just to cause trouble?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Even if that's the case, why didn't you come when I first took office?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Why wait until I've almost finished my work and stabilized things?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"What do you mean by this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"I haven't even enjoyed a single day yet!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Looking at Ning Zhuo, the gang leader dared not express his anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo sneered at the gang leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Xiangqian reported, "Young Master Zhuo, the house has been checked, no issues."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Good." Ning Zhuo looked at the gang leader. "Let's go inside. You'd better confess everything!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo then commanded, "Uncle Xiangqian, take some people inside with me. Uncle Xiangguo, take some people and guard the entrance. See if any other elders report their leader."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Let's go!" Ning Xiangqian and four Foundation Establishment cultivators approached the gang leader, their expressions and tones icy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The gang leader gritted his teeth. "I'm innocent, I'm innocent!" He looked around, hoping for support from the elders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">But he was left in despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">With a heart full of despair, the gang leader returned inside, only to see Ning Zhuo sitting directly in the main seat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Kneel!" Ning Xiangtu kicked him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Already terrified, the gang leader's legs went weak, and he knelt with a thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The next moment, driven by humiliation and anger, he tried to stand, but two Foundation Establishment cultivators pressed down on his shoulders, white frost quickly spreading and freezing his shoulders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Still resisting?" Ning Zhuo sneered. "Then I'll grant you death."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The gang leader, terrified, dared not move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo continued, "Yuan Er was my friend. He's dead, and you're the culprit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The gang leader took a deep breath, barely calming himself. "Lord Ning Zhuo, you say I'm the culprit. Do you have any evidence? If you can present it, I'll admit it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo chuckled coldly. "Of course, I have evidence. The evidence is in your hands. Hand it over."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The gang leader was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"W-What do you mean?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He looked at Ning Zhuo with wide eyes. "You want me to present evidence to incriminate myself?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo nodded. "Incriminate you? Depends on your performance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The gang leader trembled with rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He had never encountered such unreasonable and domineering behavior!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">No evidence, yet acting so righteous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Is the Ning family still righteous?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Bringing a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators, storming into someone's headquarters, and forcing the leader to present evidence against himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Such behavior was too outrageous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Too arrogant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Is there no law?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo seemed to understand the gang leader's thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He squinted and sneered, "You seem to misunderstand something."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"I'm not an official, nor a divine enforcer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"I don't need evidence to act."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Now, my friend is dead, assassinated. You benefited the most from his death, so you're the culprit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Because you gained the most."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, leaning back in his chair, pointing at the gang leader. "I never said I needed evidence. You brought it up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The gang leader broke into a cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">His face turned ashen. "Lord Ning Zhuo, does this mean I'm doomed today?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"No, no, no, I just took the leader's position not long ago!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Please, spare my life, spare my life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"From now on, I'll pay tribute to you every year, a generous protection fee!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Whatever you want, as long as I have it, I'll give it to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Please, don't kill me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"I just became the leader, really not long ago!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo smiled, his tone softening. "Hmm, not bad."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"You're a smart man."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Sparing your life is possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"But from now on, I want you to work for me. I want the entire Monkey Head Gang to work for me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The gang leader's pupils contracted sharply, and he hurriedly shouted, "Understood, understood. From now on, I will follow your lead!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Hahaha!" Ning Zhuo laughed wildly, triumphant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">He suddenly stopped laughing, his eyes sharp as an eagle's, locking onto the gang leader. "Since that's the case, hand over all the evidence of Yuan Er's murder."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The gang leader was stunned again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">His heart turned cold, fully understanding: he had to hand over everything!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Only then would Ning Zhuo trust him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Because if he ever betrayed, Ning Zhuo could simply release the evidence, and he would lose his position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The gang leader, as if turned to stone, struggled for a few breaths, finally taking a deep breath and bowing to Ning Zhuo. "Yes, I obey."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
