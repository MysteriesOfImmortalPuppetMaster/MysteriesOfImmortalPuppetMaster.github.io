<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 165: First Take the Monkey Head</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Monkey Head Gang Headquarters.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian, Ning Xiangguo, and other former stewards of the Ning family marched forward with heads held high, directly storming the gates of the Monkey Head Gang.<br/>
<br/>
"Stop, stop right there!" The gang guards, usually so arrogant, turned pale and shouted in panic upon seeing such a formidable group approaching.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian, Ning Xiangguo, and the others had all reached the Foundation Establishment Stage, qualifying them as stewards of the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
The main branch of the Ning family had dismissed many branch stewards, totaling nearly twenty.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, leveraging Ning Houjun's reputation, had gathered over a dozen people.<br/>
<br/>
More than a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators‚Äîdouble the combat strength of the entire upper echelon of the Monkey Head Gang!<br/>
<br/>
Just seeing these Foundation Establishment cultivators made the gang members cower.<br/>
<br/>
Then, noticing the Ning family waist tokens hanging from each of them, their hearts sank. "The Ning family, one of the three great families! Why are they causing us trouble?" "Not good, not good, Boss!!" The gang members shouted in panic as they ran towards the back of the headquarters.<br/>
<br/>
The new leader of the Monkey Head Gang had not been in position for long, but with his seasoned tactics and stable relationships, he was far more secure in his position than Yuan Er ever was.<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing the urgent report from his subordinates, his brows furrowed deeply, sensing the gravity of the situation. "The other side is coming with great momentum, clearly not with good intentions!" He stood up, thinking quickly, "Please, invite the heroes of the Ning family..."<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the gate of the leader's courtyard was blasted apart.<br/>
<br/>
The guards at the gate were sent flying, landing amidst the rubble and debris, groaning in pain.<br/>
<br/>
Through the dust, the Ning family members strode into the courtyard with an air of arrogance.<br/>
<br/>
Even more imposing was a large, ornate mechanical carriage that crushed the debris under its wheels, stopping slowly in front of the Monkey Head Gang leader.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangguo opened the carriage door from the outside, with several Foundation Establishment cultivators lined up behind him.<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo stepped out of the carriage, all the Foundation Establishment cultivators bowed their heads in respect.<br/>
<br/>
The new leader of the Monkey Head Gang's pupils contracted.<br/>
<br/>
He had expected at least an elder of the Ning family to be in the carriage, but it turned out to be a young cultivator at the third level of Qi Refining.<br/>
<br/>
However, the gang leader dared not be careless, putting on a smile and stepping forward.<br/>
<br/>
"Stop!" Ning Xiangqian intercepted him with a cold expression.<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader dared not force his way through, standing in place and cupping his hands in greeting. "So it's Young Master Ning Zhuo gracing us with his presence. I apologize for not welcoming you sooner. Please forgive me!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked at him and sneered, "It's good that you're here. Let's go inside; I'm here to settle accounts with you!"<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader was shocked. "What do you mean by that? There must be some misunderstanding!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, impatient with further conversation, waved his hand.<br/>
<br/>
The Foundation Establishment cultivators beside him immediately formed a small encirclement.<br/>
<br/>
Killing intent filled the air, and a chilling aura spread.<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave, his face filled with panic. "Misunderstanding, this must be a misunderstanding! Someone, anyone!!"<br/>
<br/>
The commotion caused by Ning Zhuo had alarmed the entire Monkey Head Gang, and many Foundation Establishment elders of the gang hurried over.<br/>
<br/>
But they did not step forward, only watching cautiously.<br/>
<br/>
Too terrifying!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had brought nearly twenty Foundation Establishment cultivators, a force capable of sweeping through the Monkey Head Gang.<br/>
<br/>
More crucially, it was their identity.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family!<br/>
<br/>
One of the three great families, possessing Golden Core Stage combat power.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to them, the Monkey Head Gang was like an egg against a boulder.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo scanned the gathered gang members with a sharp gaze and shouted, "Yuan Er was my friend. Though we didn't meet often, our bond was deep. When Yuan Dasheng died, Yuan Er entrusted his body to me. I went all out to refine a mechanical ape‚ÄîTree Martial Ape‚Äîfor him. You all know this."<br/>
<br/>
"But even with the Tree Martial Ape, my friend still died, right here in the gang's headquarters."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, someone among you has reported to me, and I suspect this wasn't a simple revenge killing but a conspiracy."<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the gang members looked at each other, their anger and fear greatly alleviated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's reasoning was very legitimate.<br/>
<br/>
Some gang elders' pupils contracted, their morale plummeting.<br/>
<br/>
They knew the truth: the elders were dissatisfied with Yuan Er's performance and had used Bao Qiu to stage an assassination.<br/>
<br/>
"But when did Ning Zhuo and Yuan Er become so close?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hard to say! Yuan Er did entrust Yuan Dasheng's body to Ning Zhuo, and Ning Zhuo did send the Tree Martial Ape to protect Yuan Er."<br/>
<br/>
"During that time, Ning Zhuo even sent two Ning family envoys to support Yuan Er."<br/>
<br/>
The gang elders communicated secretly, realizing Ning Zhuo's words were true.<br/>
<br/>
The new gang leader was filled with regret.<br/>
<br/>
He was indeed the mastermind behind Yuan Er's assassination.<br/>
<br/>
Initially, he was wary of Ning Zhuo, so after Yuan Er's death, he didn't rush to take the position but waited to see the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing no reaction from Ning Zhuo, and with the other gang elders' intentions unclear, he finally took the position, becoming the third-generation leader.<br/>
<br/>
He cherished his hard-earned position, reforming many gang issues, increasing rewards for members, and sacrificing his own interests to win over other elders.<br/>
<br/>
Since taking office, he had worked tirelessly, sleeping only two hours a day, dedicating himself fully to stabilizing the gang and fostering a positive atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
And now, Ning Zhuo had come knocking!<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't fight.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't provoke.<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader wanted to yield, but Ning Zhuo wouldn't allow it.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo declared he was avenging his friend, leaving the gang leader feeling extremely aggrieved.<br/>
<br/>
"If you were going to do this, why didn't you come earlier?"<br/>
<br/>
"Did you wait for me to become the leader just to cause trouble?"<br/>
<br/>
"Even if that's the case, why didn't you come when I first took office?"<br/>
<br/>
"Why wait until I've almost finished my work and stabilized things?"<br/>
<br/>
"What do you mean by this?"<br/>
<br/>
"I haven't even enjoyed a single day yet!"<br/>
<br/>
Looking at Ning Zhuo, the gang leader dared not express his anger.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sneered at the gang leader.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian reported, "Young Master Zhuo, the house has been checked, no issues."<br/>
<br/>
"Good." Ning Zhuo looked at the gang leader. "Let's go inside. You'd better confess everything!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then commanded, "Uncle Xiangqian, take some people inside with me. Uncle Xiangguo, take some people and guard the entrance. See if any other elders report their leader."<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go!" Ning Xiangqian and four Foundation Establishment cultivators approached the gang leader, their expressions and tones icy.<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader gritted his teeth. "I'm innocent, I'm innocent!" He looked around, hoping for support from the elders.<br/>
<br/>
But he was left in despair.<br/>
<br/>
With a heart full of despair, the gang leader returned inside, only to see Ning Zhuo sitting directly in the main seat.<br/>
<br/>
"Kneel!" Ning Xiangtu kicked him.<br/>
<br/>
Already terrified, the gang leader's legs went weak, and he knelt with a thud.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, driven by humiliation and anger, he tried to stand, but two Foundation Establishment cultivators pressed down on his shoulders, white frost quickly spreading and freezing his shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
"Still resisting?" Ning Zhuo sneered. "Then I'll grant you death."<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader, terrified, dared not move.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Ning Zhuo continued, "Yuan Er was my friend. He's dead, and you're the culprit!"<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader took a deep breath, barely calming himself. "Lord Ning Zhuo, you say I'm the culprit. Do you have any evidence? If you can present it, I'll admit it."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo chuckled coldly. "Of course, I have evidence. The evidence is in your hands. Hand it over."<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader was stunned.<br/>
<br/>
"W-What do you mean?"<br/>
<br/>
He looked at Ning Zhuo with wide eyes. "You want me to present evidence to incriminate myself?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. "Incriminate you? Depends on your performance."<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader trembled with rage.<br/>
<br/>
He had never encountered such unreasonable and domineering behavior!<br/>
<br/>
No evidence, yet acting so righteous!<br/>
<br/>
Is the Ning family still righteous?<br/>
<br/>
Bringing a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators, storming into someone's headquarters, and forcing the leader to present evidence against himself.<br/>
<br/>
Such behavior was too outrageous!<br/>
<br/>
Too arrogant!<br/>
<br/>
Is there no law?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo seemed to understand the gang leader's thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
He squinted and sneered, "You seem to misunderstand something."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm not an official, nor a divine enforcer."<br/>
<br/>
"I don't need evidence to act."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, my friend is dead, assassinated. You benefited the most from his death, so you're the culprit!"<br/>
<br/>
"Because you gained the most."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, leaning back in his chair, pointing at the gang leader. "I never said I needed evidence. You brought it up."<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader broke into a cold sweat.<br/>
<br/>
His face turned ashen. "Lord Ning Zhuo, does this mean I'm doomed today?"<br/>
<br/>
"No, no, no, I just took the leader's position not long ago!"<br/>
<br/>
"Please, spare my life, spare my life!"<br/>
<br/>
"From now on, I'll pay tribute to you every year, a generous protection fee!"<br/>
<br/>
"Whatever you want, as long as I have it, I'll give it to you."<br/>
<br/>
"Please, don't kill me."<br/>
<br/>
"I just became the leader, really not long ago!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled, his tone softening. "Hmm, not bad."<br/>
<br/>
"You're a smart man."<br/>
<br/>
"Sparing your life is possible."<br/>
<br/>
"But from now on, I want you to work for me. I want the entire Monkey Head Gang to work for me!"<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader's pupils contracted sharply, and he hurriedly shouted, "Understood, understood. From now on, I will follow your lead!"<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha!" Ning Zhuo laughed wildly, triumphant.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly stopped laughing, his eyes sharp as an eagle's, locking onto the gang leader. "Since that's the case, hand over all the evidence of Yuan Er's murder."<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader was stunned again.<br/>
<br/>
His heart turned cold, fully understanding: he had to hand over everything!<br/>
<br/>
Only then would Ning Zhuo trust him.<br/>
<br/>
Because if he ever betrayed, Ning Zhuo could simply release the evidence, and he would lose his position.<br/>
<br/>
The gang leader, as if turned to stone, struggled for a few breaths, finally taking a deep breath and bowing to Ning Zhuo. "Yes, I obey."</div>
