<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Shen Lingshu and Zhu Xuanji stood side by side, gazing at the sky where Ning Zhuo had departed, and sighed: "It's the same as the previous calculation results - his destiny is quite ordinary."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji frowned: "Given his impressive achievements at Lava Mountain and Myriad Medicine Sect, his destiny must be flourishing. How could it be ordinary?"<br/>
<br/>
"Could it be that the Buddha Heart Demon Seal has the power to suppress and disguise destiny?"<br/>
<br/>
During the final moments of the Magma Immortal Palace battle, Zhu Xuanji had witnessed firsthand how the Buddha Heart Demon Seal had embraced Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu: "It's hard to say."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji: "Since the ruler sent you to calculate and investigate, he must have considered this point. Just tell me your findings directly. Are you worried that my connection with Ning Zhuo is too deep, to the point where I might abandon country and family?"<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu sighed again: "I'm not deceiving you; the calculation results are indeed as such."<br/>
<br/>
"Before I came, I specifically retrieved a spiritual treasure from the national treasury to guard against the Buddha Heart Demon Seal."<br/>
<br/>
"Now we've discovered that while the Buddha Heart Demon Seal does suppress destiny, it cannot disguise it."<br/>
<br/>
"Suppressing destiny ensures Ning Zhuo's fortune maintains a relatively high baseline, preventing it from falling too drastically or suffering terrible misfortune."<br/>
<br/>
"However, as his Ning family branch grows larger and stronger, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal's suppressive effect on destiny becomes increasingly dispersed and thin."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded: "This is to be expected. Items that can suppress destiny are rare. Ning Zhuo is quite fortunate to have one."<br/>
<br/>
"Given the Buddha Heart Demon Seal's grade, although the Ning family branch is developing rapidly, it's still just beginning. Their destiny can still be suppressed well, without too much fluctuation."<br/>
<br/>
"Ultimately, does Ning Zhuo possess the Royal Mandate or the Life-Thread Connection technique?"<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu spread his hands, expressing helplessness: "These are my calculation results, and I've told you everything."<br/>
<br/>
"Regarding this question, my answer is uncertain."<br/>
<br/>
"Uncertain?" Zhu Xuanji raised his eyebrows.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu stroked his beard: "Let's talk about his Royal Mandate first. Though there are many different types of immortal talents, they often share a common trait - before the Royal Mandate manifests, they appear ordinary or even inferior. As they say, 'the dragon hides among fish, the hidden dragon bides its time.'"<br/>
<br/>
"Only after destiny awakens and the Mandate manifests do they show their true potential. Only then can we diviners confirm it."<br/>
<br/>
"This is precisely why a Royal Mandate is hard to discover early on - true dragons are difficult to find."<br/>
<br/>
After pausing briefly, Shen Lingshu continued: "Now, let's discuss the Life-Thread Connection technique."<br/>
<br/>
"This technique can connect with other living beings, creating a connection in destiny. If we compare a person's fate and destiny to water in a cup, someone with strong fate and flourishing destiny would have a large cup with much water. Someone with strong fate but weak destiny would have a large cup with little water. The same applies to other combinations of strong and weak fate and destiny."<br/>
<br/>
"The Life-Thread Connection technique connects the bottoms of many cups together."<br/>
<br/>
"As a result, the water levels in all connected people's cups remain equal and balanced."<br/>
<br/>
"This has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that connected destinies won't fall too low, maintaining a stable baseline - effectively suppressing destiny."<br/>
<br/>
"The disadvantage is that it becomes extremely difficult for individual destiny to flourish, as it gets pulled down by others with average or weak destiny."<br/>
<br/>
"However, overall, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded, agreeing with this assessment.<br/>
<br/>
Destiny, destiny - the surface meaning of this word refers to the number of breaths, representing survival. Maintaining a stable baseline for destiny means maintaining the ability to breathe, to survive.<br/>
<br/>
Life and death are crucial matters!<br/>
<br/>
As long as one lives, there is hope for everything.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu said: "I don't possess the Life Hanging by a Thread technique. According to information left by the Grand Emperor, only those who master this technique can see the life threads with their own eyes."<br/>
<br/>
"Therefore, to determine whether Ning Zhuo has the Life-Thread Connection, we mainly work backward from its effects on destiny."<br/>
<br/>
"I've calculated for you, Ning Jiufan, Lin Shanshan, and secretly investigated Han Zhou and Hua Guzi, finding that your destinies are quite closely intertwined with Ning Zhuo's."<br/>
<br/>
"However, when I calculated for Lin Bufan, Su Gu, and Linghu Jiu, I found their destinies weren't closely connected."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji remained silent, listening intently. Divination has always been esoteric, remaining quite mysterious among the hundred arts of immortal cultivation. Zhu Xuanji had little experience in this area and could only wait for Shen Lingshu to continue.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu analyzed: "If Ning Zhuo had already planted life threads in you, Ning Jiufan, Lin Shanshan, Han Zhou, and Hua Guzi, then the close entanglement of destinies would be evidence."<br/>
<br/>
"The problem is, these people are already closely associated with Ning Zhuo naturally. Ning Jiufan is Ning Zhuo's ancestor, who values him greatly and sees him as the family's future. This time, just one letter from Ning Zhuo brought him here to help."<br/>
<br/>
"Lin Shanshan and Hua Guzi are close to Ning Zhuo - the former helped him to the point of being confined, while the latter's infatuation is obvious. Their destinies being intertwined is normal."<br/>
<br/>
"Your close connection with Ning Zhuo at the Magma Immortal Palace explains your destiny's entanglement. As for Han Zhou, he has maintained regular sparring with Ning Zhuo, and this time was persuaded by Ning Zhuo to arrange matters at Jade Steel Mountain. This also explains the appearance of destiny entanglement."<br/>
<br/>
"Regarding Lin Bufan and the old Ape, both are at the Nascent Soul. According to the Grand Emperor's information, the Life-Thread Connection cannot cross two major realm boundaries, at most one. After reaching higher levels of cultivation, it can only cross minor realm boundaries."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo is currently only at the Foundation Establishment level, so he could at most plant threads in those at the Golden Core level. Therefore, it's reasonable that his destiny isn't closely connected with Lin Bufan and the monkey."<br/>
<br/>
"Finally, there's Linghu Jiu... his destiny isn't deeply entangled with Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing this, Zhu Xuanji raised his eyebrows: "Oh?"<br/>
<br/>
His eyes flashed with golden light: "If I were Ning Zhuo and possessed the Life-Thread Connection technique, I would certainly try my best to plant threads in important figures from the Medicine Sect alliance."<br/>
<br/>
"Both Lin Shanshan and Linghu Jiu would certainly qualify."<br/>
<br/>
"The fact that Linghu Jiu's destiny isn't closely connected indicates that even if Ning Zhuo has mastered the Life-Thread Connection technique, he hasn't planted it in Linghu Jiu."<br/>
<br/>
"I've also read the Grand Emperor's legacy information - back then, she would plant threads in everyone she met, quickly establishing her power. Ning Zhuo is young - if he hasn't planted a thread in Linghu Jiu, it goes against human nature."<br/>
<br/>
"Based on this reasoning, the possibility of Ning Zhuo possessing the Life-Thread Connection technique isn't high."<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu smiled slightly: "Brother Zhu Xuanji, have you noticed that you're defending Ning Zhuo? Both in Lava Immortal City and just now."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji froze, then immediately shook his head: "I'm merely analyzing, and quite rationally and calmly at that."<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu said: "Of course. I'm not denying that."<br/>
<br/>
"However, once someone is planted with a life thread and destinies are connected, it causes all actions of the person with the planted thread to unconsciously benefit the main subject. This is true even if the person with the planted thread seeks revenge against the main subject."<br/>
<br/>
"Your analysis of Linghu Jiu aligns with human nature, but your own behavior proves that Ning Zhuo has planted a life thread in you."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji shook his head again, laughing: "I'm more inclined to believe I was planted with a thread by the Three Sect Elder."<br/>
<br/>
"Regarding this point, Elder, I had doubts before. To the point where for a time, I could hardly sleep, suspecting everything."<br/>
<br/>
"Now I've come to understand that regardless of whether I've been planted with a thread or whether the threads exist at all, I should just act according to my own methods."<br/>
<br/>
"The situation with Linghu Jiu is evidence that Ning Zhuo either doesn't possess or hasn't used the Life-Thread Connection!"<br/>
<br/>
"As for my case, it's easy to prove."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo has now left the country, so my destiny's entanglement with his will surely plummet. At that time, we can ask Elder to observe again, and won't the truth become clear?"<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu nodded: "Correct, this is my plan. To detect the answer to this question, these few days aren't enough - we need longer observation."<br/>
<br/>
"However, right now, there's an even better subject for investigation."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji showed surprise: "Oh?"<br/>
<br/>
After thinking for a moment, this famous detective of the South Bean Country immediately thought of a certain figure and blurted out: "You mean the Deputy Mountain God of Caiyin Mountain? Oh no, she's now the proper Mountain God, and the only Mountain God of Cloud Concealment Mountain."<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu nodded again: "Correct."<br/>
<br/>
"This Fox God hadn't been in contact with Ning Zhuo for long, but under Ning Zhuo's lucky extortion, she actually gave him the Spirit-Hiding Willow!"<br/>
<br/>
"This act is quite suspicious."<br/>
<br/>
"After all, a treasure like the Spirit-Hiding Willow, if kept at Cloud Concealment Mountain, would greatly help build her power. If the Fox God had offered it to South Bean Country, she could have exchanged it for redemption and protection. Yet she gave it directly to Ning Zhuo, which seems strange upon closer examination."<br/>
<br/>
"But if Ning Zhuo had influenced the Fox God through the Life-Thread Connection at that time, it would make sense."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded: "Good, then next, we'll go to Cloud Concealment Mountain."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Jiufan is going there too."<br/>
<br/>
"However, we don't need to reveal ourselves, we can just investigate the Cloud Concealment Mountain God separately."<br/>
<br/>
Near Cloud Concealment Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
A formation had been secretly arranged.<br/>
<br/>
Three cultivators, all at the Golden Core level, were hidden within the formation space, sitting quietly in meditation.<br/>
<br/>
A flying message skillfully entered the formation, bringing news: Ning Jiufan had departed from Medicine Valley yesterday. In a few days, he would arrive at Yugang Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
"The divination results come from Master Zhuge, they won't be wrong."<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it, this old fellow has finally come!"<br/>
<br/>
"Much faster than I imagined, I thought we'd have to sit here waiting for a year or more."<br/>
<br/>
"Not necessary! He has already promised Lord Meng to retrieve the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence. If he leaves to avoid battle, it would be a major blow to the Ning family's and his own prestige!"<br/>
<br/>
"Good, after taking Ning Jiufan's life and completing this job, we'll flee the country."<br/>
<br/>
The three Golden Core cultivators communicated through divine sense for a while, then fell back into meditation.</div>
