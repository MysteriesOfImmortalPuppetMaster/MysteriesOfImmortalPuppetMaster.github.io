<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 322: I Am Not a Child Without a Mother's Love!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div><paragraph index="0">After a brief daze, Meng Yaoyin regained her senses and realized she was no longer in Fire Persimmon Immortal City but deep within the Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="2">She looked within herself, seeing the depths of her spirit, where a surge of purple energy had already condensed into a solid form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"The injury has worsened again..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">She sighed softly but didnâ€™t rush to return to the immortal city. Instead, she continued deeper into the mountain, entering the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Dao injuries wear away memories. Over time, my spirit will also fade," she murmured to herself. "In the end, Iâ€™ll revert to the Buddha Physician and willingly return to the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">From that point on, Meng Yaoyin deliberately reduced her time spent with Ning Zhuo and subtly hinted at their eventual separation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo curled up in bed, sobbing softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong came to the bedside, curious, and asked, "Why are you crying? Why aren't you asleep yet?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Little Ning Zhuo poked his big head out from under the covers. "I... I miss my mother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"I can't sleep. Whenever I couldnâ€™t sleep, my mother would sing to me. Can you sing me a song?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Sun Lingtong had no choice but to awkwardly sing to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Hidden from view, Buddha Physician Meng Yaoyin watched from behind, feeling a mix of gratitude and relief. She never expected that the person Ning Zhuo had saved, despite being from an evil faction, had such a kind heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Sun Lingtong had been secretly investigating the Ning familyâ€™s territory, helping Ning Zhuo resist the intrusion of his greedy relatives, and Meng Yaoyin saw everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Time flew by.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"It's late, you should go to bed now, or you wonâ€™t grow taller, and your mind will get sluggish, Little Zhuo," Meng Yaoyin appeared softly, reminding Ning Zhuo as he was still reading by lamplight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Surprised, Ning Zhuo looked up joyfully. "Mom! You're back!" He raised the book in his hands, excitedly saying, "Mom, Iâ€™ll definitely master mechanism techniques and help you heal. Last time you came back, your arm was injured."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Meng Yaoyin's eyes tightened slightly, and she subconsciously moved her arm back a little. The child had grown and was now much more observant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Her arm had been injured while slaying a scarlet flame beast deep inside Fire Persimmon Mountain. At that time, she had lost her mind and memory, only acting according to the preset orders of the Buddha Physician to protect the Lava Immortal Palace. Slaying beasts was one of those tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Good child," Meng Yaoyin was deeply touched and couldnâ€™t help but pull Ning Zhuo into a hug.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo hugged his mother tightly. Though her body was hard, like a puppet, he still felt boundless warmth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He glanced at the lamp on the table, his eyes filled with hopeful light, and murmured, "Mom, I will become the greatest mechanism master in the world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Iâ€™ll cure your sickness, and weâ€™ll be together forever!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Meng Yaoyin's body trembled slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">For a moment, overwhelming sadness surged within her, making it hard to contain her emotions. She tightly closed her eyes, but no tears fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Is this the Orphanage?" Little Ning Zhuo looked up at the tall building, filled with trepidation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">But thinking of his mother, he gritted his teeth and slipped into the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Hiding in a corner, he watched the mechanism masters on stage, desperately trying to learn their puppet control techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He had studied a lot of theory about mechanisms, but controlling them required a mentorâ€™s guidance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Meng Yaoyin's condition worsened, and she cherished her clear moments of consciousness, unwilling to spend precious time teaching Ning Zhuo the finer details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo watched Li Leifengâ€™s control techniques, his small fingers moving quickly under his sleeves as his large eyes stared unblinkingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">His mind worked so hard that by the end of the puppet show, he was starving. His vision blurred, and his ears buzzed with hunger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He scavenged leftover pastries from the guests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"So... so delicious!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Finally, Ning Zhuo was taken in by his uncle, Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He entered school.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">His classmates, aware of his background, bullied him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Wild child! Wild child!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Big-headed freak! Big-headed freak!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Born with a mother but no one to raise him, just an orphan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo suddenly turned around, his eyes red, fists clenched as he growled, "I have a mother!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The classmates were startled at first, but quickly resumed their taunts, even more vicious than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo screamed in anger and charged at them, fighting wildly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He returned home with bruises all over his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The parents of the children he fought with came to demand answers. Ning Ze, ever timid, barely managed to respond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Turning back, Ning Ze harshly punished Ning Zhuo, forcing him to kneel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Youâ€™ve got guts, daring to beat the clan elderâ€™s grandson!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo knelt until nightfall, without dinner. He was so hungry that his vision blurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Meanwhile, his cousin, Ning Ji, walked over with a smug smile, the smell of his dinner still lingering in the air as he circled Ning Zhuo, gloating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Mom, where are you?..." Ning Zhuo silently wept in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Buddha Physician Meng Yaoyin walked through the tunnels of Fire Persimmon Mountain, her every step measured, her movements mechanical, and her eyes devoid of emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">At dusk, after school, Ning Zhuo blended into the crowd, leaving the academy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He paused at a street corner when he saw a classmate happily holding his parentsâ€™ hands, laughing with joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Big-headed freak!" a voice suddenly shouted from behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Before Ning Zhuo could react, someone pushed him to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He got up, furious and ready to retaliate, only to see a few classmates laughing mockingly as they ran away in different directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He didnâ€™t know who to chase after.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">When they were far away, the same classmates stood at a distance, taunting, "Motherless wild child! Big-headed freak!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo roared in anger and chased after them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">By the time he returned home late, Wang Lan had locked him out of the house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">In a fit of rage, Ning Zhuo suppressed his anger and turned to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He left Ning Zeâ€™s house, heading toward his family's small courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">On the deserted, dimly lit path, a familiar figure suddenly appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Mom!" Ning Zhuo called out softly, happily rushing forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Buddha Physician Meng Yaoyin looked at him gently. She was draped in a thick, wide robe, pitch black, making it easier to walk at night and hiding her injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Meng Yaoyin took Ning Zhuoâ€™s hand in hers, and they walked together, chatting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"How is life at school?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Everything is fine. The teachers are kind, and my classmates love to play with me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Why didnâ€™t you stay at your uncleâ€™s house tonight?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I just suddenly felt homesick..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Meng Yaoyin's heart ached. She wasnâ€™t unaware of Ning Zhuoâ€™s hardships, but after much thought, she chose to watch from the sidelines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Only when Ning Zhuo was in real danger would she intervene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Though they walked in darkness, and though his mother's hand was wooden, Ning Zhuo felt as though he held the entire world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Yet, Meng Yaoyin gradually stopped speaking, her footsteps becoming precise and rhythmic. Her gaze turned dull, like a puppet, her gentle maternal presence consumed by the surrounding darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo bowed his head, sensing the change in his mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He squeezed her hand tighter, tears welling up in his eyes, and choked out, "Mom, donâ€™t worry."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"I am not a child without a mother's love!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
