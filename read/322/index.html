<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 322: I Am Not a Child Without a Mother's Love!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent">After a brief daze, Meng Yaoyin regained her senses and realized she was no longer in Fire Persimmon Immortal City but deep within the Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
She looked within herself, seeing the depths of her spirit, where a surge of purple energy had already condensed into a solid form.<br/>
"The injury has worsened again..."<br/>
<br/>
She sighed softly but didn‚Äôt rush to return to the immortal city. Instead, she continued deeper into the mountain, entering the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
"Dao injuries wear away memories. Over time, my spirit will also fade," she murmured to herself. "In the end, I‚Äôll revert to the Buddha Physician and willingly return to the Lava Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
From that point on, Meng Yaoyin deliberately reduced her time spent with Ning Zhuo and subtly hinted at their eventual separation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo curled up in bed, sobbing softly.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong came to the bedside, curious, and asked, "Why are you crying? Why aren't you asleep yet?"<br/>
<br/>
Little Ning Zhuo poked his big head out from under the covers. "I... I miss my mother."<br/>
<br/>
"I can't sleep. Whenever I couldn‚Äôt sleep, my mother would sing to me. Can you sing me a song?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had no choice but to awkwardly sing to him.<br/>
<br/>
Hidden from view, Buddha Physician Meng Yaoyin watched from behind, feeling a mix of gratitude and relief. She never expected that the person Ning Zhuo had saved, despite being from an evil faction, had such a kind heart.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had been secretly investigating the Ning family‚Äôs territory, helping Ning Zhuo resist the intrusion of his greedy relatives, and Meng Yaoyin saw everything.<br/>
<br/>
Time flew by.<br/>
<br/>
"It's late, you should go to bed now, or you won‚Äôt grow taller, and your mind will get sluggish, Little Zhuo," Meng Yaoyin appeared softly, reminding Ning Zhuo as he was still reading by lamplight.<br/>
<br/>
Surprised, Ning Zhuo looked up joyfully. "Mom! You're back!" He raised the book in his hands, excitedly saying, "Mom, I‚Äôll definitely master mechanism techniques and help you heal. Last time you came back, your arm was injured."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin's eyes tightened slightly, and she subconsciously moved her arm back a little. The child had grown and was now much more observant.<br/>
<br/>
Her arm had been injured while slaying a scarlet flame beast deep inside Fire Persimmon Mountain. At that time, she had lost her mind and memory, only acting according to the preset orders of the Buddha Physician to protect the Lava Immortal Palace. Slaying beasts was one of those tasks.<br/>
<br/>
"Good child," Meng Yaoyin was deeply touched and couldn‚Äôt help but pull Ning Zhuo into a hug.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hugged his mother tightly. Though her body was hard, like a puppet, he still felt boundless warmth.<br/>
<br/>
He glanced at the lamp on the table, his eyes filled with hopeful light, and murmured, "Mom, I will become the greatest mechanism master in the world."<br/>
<br/>
"I‚Äôll cure your sickness, and we‚Äôll be together forever!"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin's body trembled slightly.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, overwhelming sadness surged within her, making it hard to contain her emotions. She tightly closed her eyes, but no tears fell.<br/>
<br/>
"Is this the Orphanage?" Little Ning Zhuo looked up at the tall building, filled with trepidation.<br/>
<br/>
But thinking of his mother, he gritted his teeth and slipped into the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
Hiding in a corner, he watched the mechanism masters on stage, desperately trying to learn their puppet control techniques.<br/>
<br/>
He had studied a lot of theory about mechanisms, but controlling them required a mentor‚Äôs guidance.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin's condition worsened, and she cherished her clear moments of consciousness, unwilling to spend precious time teaching Ning Zhuo the finer details.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo watched Li Leifeng‚Äôs control techniques, his small fingers moving quickly under his sleeves as his large eyes stared unblinkingly.<br/>
<br/>
His mind worked so hard that by the end of the puppet show, he was starving. His vision blurred, and his ears buzzed with hunger.<br/>
<br/>
He scavenged leftover pastries from the guests.<br/>
<br/>
"So... so delicious!"<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Ning Zhuo was taken in by his uncle, Ning Ze.<br/>
<br/>
He entered school.<br/>
<br/>
His classmates, aware of his background, bullied him.<br/>
<br/>
"Wild child! Wild child!"<br/>
<br/>
"Big-headed freak! Big-headed freak!"<br/>
<br/>
"Born with a mother but no one to raise him, just an orphan!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo suddenly turned around, his eyes red, fists clenched as he growled, "I have a mother!"<br/>
<br/>
The classmates were startled at first, but quickly resumed their taunts, even more vicious than before.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo screamed in anger and charged at them, fighting wildly.<br/>
<br/>
He returned home with bruises all over his face.<br/>
<br/>
The parents of the children he fought with came to demand answers. Ning Ze, ever timid, barely managed to respond.<br/>
<br/>
Turning back, Ning Ze harshly punished Ning Zhuo, forcing him to kneel.<br/>
<br/>
"You‚Äôve got guts, daring to beat the clan elder‚Äôs grandson!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo knelt until nightfall, without dinner. He was so hungry that his vision blurred.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, his cousin, Ning Ji, walked over with a smug smile, the smell of his dinner still lingering in the air as he circled Ning Zhuo, gloating.<br/>
<br/>
"Mom, where are you?..." Ning Zhuo silently wept in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Buddha Physician Meng Yaoyin walked through the tunnels of Fire Persimmon Mountain, her every step measured, her movements mechanical, and her eyes devoid of emotion.<br/>
<br/>
At dusk, after school, Ning Zhuo blended into the crowd, leaving the academy.<br/>
<br/>
He paused at a street corner when he saw a classmate happily holding his parents‚Äô hands, laughing with joy.<br/>
<br/>
"Big-headed freak!" a voice suddenly shouted from behind.<br/>
<br/>
Before Ning Zhuo could react, someone pushed him to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
He got up, furious and ready to retaliate, only to see a few classmates laughing mockingly as they ran away in different directions.<br/>
<br/>
He didn‚Äôt know who to chase after.<br/>
<br/>
When they were far away, the same classmates stood at a distance, taunting, "Motherless wild child! Big-headed freak!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo roared in anger and chased after them.<br/>
<br/>
By the time he returned home late, Wang Lan had locked him out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
In a fit of rage, Ning Zhuo suppressed his anger and turned to leave.<br/>
<br/>
He left Ning Ze‚Äôs house, heading toward his family's small courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
On the deserted, dimly lit path, a familiar figure suddenly appeared.<br/>
<br/>
"Mom!" Ning Zhuo called out softly, happily rushing forward.<br/>
<br/>
Buddha Physician Meng Yaoyin looked at him gently. She was draped in a thick, wide robe, pitch black, making it easier to walk at night and hiding her injuries.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin took Ning Zhuo‚Äôs hand in hers, and they walked together, chatting.<br/>
<br/>
"How is life at school?"<br/>
<br/>
"Everything is fine. The teachers are kind, and my classmates love to play with me."<br/>
<br/>
"Why didn‚Äôt you stay at your uncle‚Äôs house tonight?"<br/>
<br/>
"I just suddenly felt homesick..."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin's heart ached. She wasn‚Äôt unaware of Ning Zhuo‚Äôs hardships, but after much thought, she chose to watch from the sidelines.<br/>
<br/>
Only when Ning Zhuo was in real danger would she intervene.<br/>
<br/>
Though they walked in darkness, and though his mother's hand was wooden, Ning Zhuo felt as though he held the entire world.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, Meng Yaoyin gradually stopped speaking, her footsteps becoming precise and rhythmic. Her gaze turned dull, like a puppet, her gentle maternal presence consumed by the surrounding darkness.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo bowed his head, sensing the change in his mother.<br/>
<br/>
He squeezed her hand tighter, tears welling up in his eyes, and choked out, "Mom, don‚Äôt worry."<br/>
<br/>
"I understand."<br/>
<br/>
