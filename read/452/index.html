<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 452: It’s the Old Monster in the Stone!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Flames soared into the sky, and scorching heat waves rose.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
The wooden giant transformed from Lord Long, towering five to six zhang high, suddenly fell backward with its head up, crashing heavily onto the ground!<br/>
<br/>
The originally vast and majestic life force, which had been his advantage, now, under the burning of the Wusheng Fire, had instead become his fatal weakness.<br/>
<br/>
All things arise and restrain one another. Extreme existences were easily restrained by another extreme —this was the principle of nature!<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the cultivation world was harmonious and unified.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong pressed his hand to his forehead and sighed, “Too miserable, really too miserable.”<br/>
<br/>
“Lord Long made the biggest splash, and also took the fiercest beating.”<br/>
<br/>
“The people of Two Note Kingdom really threw every trick they have at him.”<br/>
<br/>
“Even an iron-hard warrior can’t withstand it!”<br/>
<br/>
As if hearing Sun Lingtong’s sigh, the giant in the fire suddenly crackled, making sounds like firewood burning.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long’s mighty body still trembled slightly from time to time in the flames.<br/>
<br/>
It was indeed extremely tragic.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo raised his head, his gaze seeming to pierce through the mechanical dragon formation and the Old Monster in the Stone’s corpse, piercing through the sky, seeing above the cloud layers.<br/>
<br/>
“Two Note Kingdom’s side actually still has ambushers!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo once again summoned images from the Wandering Dragon over Ten Thousand Miles, carefully observing that line of fire just now.<br/>
<br/>
From that line of fire, he sensed a strong hint of military strategy.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.<br/>
<br/>
“Wusheng Fire, that I can understand. But Lord Long’s condition is very strange. He was burned into unconsciousness —there must be a reason for this.”<br/>
<br/>
“In the battle formation manifestations of the Fire Cloud Battalion, there is a certain variant move known as ‘Fire Tongue Point General.’”<br/>
<br/>
“What kind of methods did that army in the high sky use?”<br/>
<br/>
At that thought, Ning Zhuo suddenly recalled a piece of intelligence about the Fire Cloud Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
“This move concentrates the entire power of the battle formation manifestation onto a single point, specifically targeting individuals on the battlefield.”<br/>
<br/>
“Especially those powerful generals!”<br/>
<br/>
However, relying solely on this Fire Tongue Point General move wouldn’t be enough to make Lord Long fall into such a strange unconscious state.<br/>
<br/>
So-called divine arts were various methods cast primarily with spirit and will as the carriers.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued observing, repeatedly using scouting methods in his hands.<br/>
<br/>
Very soon, his eyes brightened, having discovered the truth.<br/>
<br/>
“This is the "Rapid Fire Attacks the Heart" technique!”<br/>
<br/>
“This is a divine sense attack method, a divine art.”<br/>
<br/>
The Rapid Fire Attacks the Heart technique —able to plunge the target into anxiety and irritability, igniting a blaze of anxious fire in their sea of consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
If the afflicted cultivator couldn't calm their anxious and irritable emotions, they couldn't extinguish this flame.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, all forms of anxiety and worry would only fuel this urgent fire.<br/>
<br/>
The stronger the fire, the more negative emotions of anxiety and irritability it induced.<br/>
<br/>
This thus formed a vicious cycle.<br/>
<br/>
“So, Lord Long appears unconscious, but in fact, his upper dantian in the sea of consciousness is filled with urgent fire.”<br/>
<br/>
“As the saying goes, ‘fire attacking the heart’ has left him so agitated that he can’t move at all!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing, whose armor was already in tatters, also raised his head to look into the sky at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
“Fire Cloud Battalion, it must be the Fire Cloud Battalion!”<br/>
<br/>
His expression was rather complicated.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, he couldn’t help cursing Sun Gan in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
All along, he had believed the Fire Cloud Battalion remained in Green Forest Immortal City. It turned out that the Fire Cloud Battalion was actually marching secretly in high altitude.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing, priding himself on his status, never expected that even he had not been informed of this arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
His heart was filled with a vexation at having been kept in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand, he had to admit that Sun Gan’s move was wise.<br/>
<br/>
“The enemy’s intelligence-gathering ability is very strong. They grasped the timing and route of our rear army’s march.”<br/>
<br/>
“If Sun Gan hadn’t concealed it, I’m afraid the Fire Cloud Battalion would also have been targeted.”<br/>
<br/>
“It is precisely because he kept it secret from even his own people that we now have this decisive trump!”<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, Shuang Jing couldn’t help gritting his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
He gazed at the ruined camp, where corpses lay everywhere, walls and ramparts destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
“What a heavy loss!” Shuang Jing, who once was full of grand ambitions, now found all his high hopes turned into sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing lamented: “If the Fire Cloud Battalion’s march had not been secret, this army would definitely have been the enemy’s priority target.”<br/>
<br/>
But soon he steadied himself, his eyes fixed fiercely on the giant in the flames.<br/>
<br/>
“In that case, I wouldn’t have become the main target of focus fire.”<br/>
<br/>
“My losses wouldn’t have been so heavy!”<br/>
<br/>
Thinking this, Shuang Jing’s heart ached as if dripping blood.<br/>
<br/>
A sharp glint flashed in his eyes, lifting his spirits: “If we can keep Lord Long alive, then all our losses are worth it!”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long had once been at the peak of the Nascent Soul level. Later, as he aged, his cultivation declined to the late Nascent Soul stage.<br/>
<br/>
Yet once he began fighting, using various spells and divine arts to strengthen himself, his combat strength could easily return to the Nascent Soul peak.<br/>
<br/>
He could even faintly surpass the limit of the Nascent Soul stage and reach quasi Soul Formation Level level.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long’s combat prowess was truly enormous.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Lord Long’s defeat held great political significance.<br/>
<br/>
Because he served as a temple caretaker of the Dragon King Temple —an important representative of the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King in the human world.<br/>
<br/>
If he died or was captured alive by Two Note Kingdom’s side, the morale boost and blow to each side would be huge.<br/>
<br/>
Military morale and spirit, though intangible, were extremely important.<br/>
<br/>
These factors could manifest directly on the battlefield, specifically in the strength or weakness of an army.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of the Old Monster in the Stone, Shuang Jing, this descendant of a high-ranking house, gnashed his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
“Right, the Old Monster in the Stone!”<br/>
<br/>
“That shameless old thing, where did he go?”<br/>
<br/>
“If we can capture him, we can recover at least half of our losses!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were currently en route to the Red Flower Battalion. The two looked at Lord Long’s body, engulfed in raging flames, and then at the Red Flower Battalion’s side.<br/>
<br/>
With Lord Long down, the Red Flower Battalion’s morale soared, and their military strength rose severalfold accordingly!<br/>
<br/>
If Sun and Ning went to provoke them now, it would be quite inappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
The firelight illuminated Mulan’s pale face. She rarely smiled, but now she did softly and said, “Uncle Zhang, I’ve won my bet!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi sighed, “Yes, you won. We all won. But the risk was too great.”<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he thought of something and asked immediately, “General Mu… did you know the Fire Cloud Battalion was hidden above in the sky?”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan shook her head: “Even Shuang Jing didn’t know, of course I wouldn’t either.”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s just that I seized a potential opportunity and went all-in with all my strength.”<br/>
<br/>
“My father taught me, this so-called warfare is about finding the path you believe most favorable to victory, and then daring to stake everything on it!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi’s expression was complicated: “Though the White Jade Battalion suffered heavy casualties, the most severely injured among the main and deputy generals still have a breath of life. I will do my best to save them later.”<br/>
<br/>
“Moreover, we were the first army to come to their aid. Even if the nobles and high houses in the capital investigate later, they will only remember our merit.”<br/>
<br/>
“Before we have even truly participated in the main grand battle, we have already gained such an excellent strategic advantage. General Mu, your goal of revitalizing your family’s name can be considered more than half accomplished.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan nodded: “A good start, very smooth.”<br/>
<br/>
“But not enough.”<br/>
<br/>
“I still need to show the strength of the Mu family in direct confrontations. In short, the more battle merits I achieve, the more hope there is to revive the family.”<br/>
<br/>
While the two conversed, the four Nascent Soul cultivators of the Six Cave Sect also arrived at the periphery of this scene.<br/>
<br/>
“Lord Long?!”<br/>
<br/>
“This is... Wusheng Fire?”<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Shadow Cave Master and the Poison Scorpion Cave Master exclaimed one after the other.<br/>
<br/>
The Demon Heart Cave Master looked at Lu Hongtu: “No wonder the Great Cave Master retreated in time; it turns out our situation was already precarious!”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu smiled bitterly: “Dangerous is an understatement. Lord Long used the Dragon King’s root whiskers, and the vast life force instead boosted the power of the Wusheng Fire. With such monstrous flames, who among us can enter to save him?”<br/>
<br/>
“So should we… retreat?” The Demon Heart Cave Master hesitated, using only divine sense to communicate.<br/>
<br/>
“Who could pull off such a feat?”<br/>
<br/>
All three of the Nascent Soul cultivators, Demon Heart and the others, went pale.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu’s face was gloomy. He was about to nod when suddenly his gaze froze, revealing a look of shock.<br/>
<br/>
Because he saw a perfectly round stone sphere, with unprecedented determination and a reckless, self-sacrificing posture, charge straight into the monstrous flames!<br/>
<br/>
