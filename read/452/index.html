<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 452: It’s the Old Monster in the Stone!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Flames soared into the sky, and scorching heat waves rose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The wooden giant transformed from Lord Long, towering five to six zhang high, suddenly fell backward with its head up, crashing heavily onto the ground!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The originally vast and majestic life force, which had been his advantage, now, under the burning of the Wusheng Fire, had instead become his fatal weakness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">All things arise and restrain one another. Extreme existences were easily restrained by another extreme —this was the principle of nature!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Therefore, the cultivation world was harmonious and unified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong pressed his hand to his forehead and sighed, “Too miserable, really too miserable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Lord Long made the biggest splash, and also took the fiercest beating.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“The people of Two Note Kingdom really threw every trick they have at him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Even an iron-hard warrior can’t withstand it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">As if hearing Sun Lingtong’s sigh, the giant in the fire suddenly crackled, making sounds like firewood burning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Lord Long’s mighty body still trembled slightly from time to time in the flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">It was indeed extremely tragic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo raised his head, his gaze seeming to pierce through the mechanical dragon formation and the Old Monster in the Stone’s corpse, piercing through the sky, seeing above the cloud layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“Two Note Kingdom’s side actually still has ambushers!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo once again summoned images from the Wandering Dragon over Ten Thousand Miles, carefully observing that line of fire just now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">From that line of fire, he sensed a strong hint of military strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Wusheng Fire, that I can understand. But Lord Long’s condition is very strange. He was burned into unconsciousness —there must be a reason for this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“In the battle formation manifestations of the Fire Cloud Battalion, there is a certain variant move known as ‘Fire Tongue Point General.’”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“What kind of methods did that army in the high sky use?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">At that thought, Ning Zhuo suddenly recalled a piece of intelligence about the Fire Cloud Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“This move concentrates the entire power of the battle formation manifestation onto a single point, specifically targeting individuals on the battlefield.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Especially those powerful generals!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">However, relying solely on this Fire Tongue Point General move wouldn’t be enough to make Lord Long fall into such a strange unconscious state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">So-called divine arts were various methods cast primarily with spirit and will as the carriers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo continued observing, repeatedly using scouting methods in his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Very soon, his eyes brightened, having discovered the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“This is the "Rapid Fire Attacks the Heart" technique!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“This is a divine sense attack method, a divine art.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Rapid Fire Attacks the Heart technique —able to plunge the target into anxiety and irritability, igniting a blaze of anxious fire in their sea of consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">If the afflicted cultivator couldn't calm their anxious and irritable emotions, they couldn't extinguish this flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Moreover, all forms of anxiety and worry would only fuel this urgent fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The stronger the fire, the more negative emotions of anxiety and irritability it induced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This thus formed a vicious cycle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“So, Lord Long appears unconscious, but in fact, his upper dantian in the sea of consciousness is filled with urgent fire.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“As the saying goes, ‘fire attacking the heart’ has left him so agitated that he can’t move at all!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Shuang Jing, whose armor was already in tatters, also raised his head to look into the sky at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Fire Cloud Battalion, it must be the Fire Cloud Battalion!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">His expression was rather complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">On one hand, he couldn’t help cursing Sun Gan in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">All along, he had believed the Fire Cloud Battalion remained in Green Forest Immortal City. It turned out that the Fire Cloud Battalion was actually marching secretly in high altitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Shuang Jing, priding himself on his status, never expected that even he had not been informed of this arrangement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His heart was filled with a vexation at having been kept in the dark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But on the other hand, he had to admit that Sun Gan’s move was wise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“The enemy’s intelligence-gathering ability is very strong. They grasped the timing and route of our rear army’s march.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“If Sun Gan hadn’t concealed it, I’m afraid the Fire Cloud Battalion would also have been targeted.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“It is precisely because he kept it secret from even his own people that we now have this decisive trump!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Thinking of this, Shuang Jing couldn’t help gritting his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He gazed at the ruined camp, where corpses lay everywhere, walls and ramparts destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“What a heavy loss!” Shuang Jing, who once was full of grand ambitions, now found all his high hopes turned into sorrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Shuang Jing lamented: “If the Fire Cloud Battalion’s march had not been secret, this army would definitely have been the enemy’s priority target.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But soon he steadied himself, his eyes fixed fiercely on the giant in the flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“In that case, I wouldn’t have become the main target of focus fire.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“My losses wouldn’t have been so heavy!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Thinking this, Shuang Jing’s heart ached as if dripping blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">A sharp glint flashed in his eyes, lifting his spirits: “If we can keep Lord Long alive, then all our losses are worth it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Lord Long had once been at the peak of the Nascent Soul level. Later, as he aged, his cultivation declined to the late Nascent Soul stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Yet once he began fighting, using various spells and divine arts to strengthen himself, his combat strength could easily return to the Nascent Soul peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He could even faintly surpass the limit of the Nascent Soul stage and reach quasi Soul Formation Level level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Lord Long’s combat prowess was truly enormous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Moreover, Lord Long’s defeat held great political significance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Because he served as a temple caretaker of the Dragon King Temple —an important representative of the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King in the human world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">If he died or was captured alive by Two Note Kingdom’s side, the morale boost and blow to each side would be huge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Military morale and spirit, though intangible, were extremely important.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">These factors could manifest directly on the battlefield, specifically in the strength or weakness of an army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Thinking of the Old Monster in the Stone, Shuang Jing, this descendant of a high-ranking house, gnashed his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Right, the Old Monster in the Stone!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“That shameless old thing, where did he go?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“If we can capture him, we can recover at least half of our losses!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were currently en route to the Red Flower Battalion. The two looked at Lord Long’s body, engulfed in raging flames, and then at the Red Flower Battalion’s side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">With Lord Long down, the Red Flower Battalion’s morale soared, and their military strength rose severalfold accordingly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">If Sun and Ning went to provoke them now, it would be quite inappropriate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The firelight illuminated Mu Lan’s pale face. She rarely smiled, but now she did softly and said, “Uncle Zhang, I’ve won my bet!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Zhang Zhongyi sighed, “Yes, you won. We all won. But the risk was too great.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Suddenly, he thought of something and asked immediately, “General Mu… did you know the Fire Cloud Battalion was hidden above in the sky?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Mu Lan shook her head: “Even Shuang Jing didn’t know, of course I wouldn’t either.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“It’s just that I seized a potential opportunity and went all-in with all my strength.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“My father taught me, this so-called warfare is about finding the path you believe most favorable to victory, and then daring to stake everything on it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Zhang Zhongyi’s expression was complicated: “Though the White Jade Battalion suffered heavy casualties, the most severely injured among the main and deputy generals still have a breath of life. I will do my best to save them later.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Moreover, we were the first army to come to their aid. Even if the nobles and high houses in the capital investigate later, they will only remember our merit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Before we have even truly participated in the main grand battle, we have already gained such an excellent strategic advantage. General Mu, your goal of revitalizing your family’s name can be considered more than half accomplished.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Mu Lan nodded: “A good start, very smooth.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“But not enough.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“I still need to show the strength of the Mu family in direct confrontations. In short, the more battle merits I achieve, the more hope there is to revive the family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">While the two conversed, the four Nascent Soul cultivators of the Six Cave Sect also arrived at the periphery of this scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Lord Long?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“This is... Wusheng Fire?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Blood Shadow Cave Master and the Poison Scorpion Cave Master exclaimed one after the other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Demon Heart Cave Master looked at Lu Hongtu: “No wonder the Great Cave Master retreated in time; it turns out our situation was already precarious!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Lu Hongtu smiled bitterly: “Dangerous is an understatement. Lord Long used the Dragon King’s root whiskers, and the vast life force instead boosted the power of the Wusheng Fire. With such monstrous flames, who among us can enter to save him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“So should we… retreat?” The Demon Heart Cave Master hesitated, using only divine sense to communicate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“Who could pull off such a feat?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">All three of the Nascent Soul cultivators, Demon Heart and the others, went pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Lu Hongtu’s face was gloomy. He was about to nod when suddenly his gaze froze, revealing a look of shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Because he saw a perfectly round stone sphere, with unprecedented determination and a reckless, self-sacrificing posture, charge straight into the monstrous flames!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">It was the Old Monster in the Stone!!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
