<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 472: Fate Pointing?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The old demon-cultivator continued to question Liu Er about Ning Zhuo and finally understood the reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“Ning Zhuo temporarily relied on Liu Er because of a family feud.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“He himself also had traveling goals, so after this great battle, he would leave.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Moreover, as soon as the war did not go favorably, and he saw no hope of revenge, he would depart midway.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“As for the support he and the Ning Family gave to Liu Er, on one hand it was because Ning Zhuo himself had a good relationship with Liu Er, on another hand it was due to the family feud, and finally it was for the profit from the spoils of war.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“After all, war profits were often the most violently lucrative.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Thinking of this, the old demon-cultivator no longer paid attention to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">When Liu Er saw his master behave this way, he knew the old demon-cultivator was skilled in divination. He could not help feeling a stir in his heart and probed, “Teacher, is Ning Zhuo unrelated to my destiny?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The old demon-cultivator spoke sternly, “Liu Er, you must immediately abandon such thoughts!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Although you possess a king’s destiny, you must understand that nothing in a king’s destiny is absolutely certain to happen.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“A king’s destiny is only a great tendency, and it can be changed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Therefore, even if Ning Zhuo and your destiny have no connection, you can still alter that through your own efforts, turning no connection into a connection, making him your subordinate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“If Ning Zhuo was fated to be connected to you, yet you repeatedly give up opportunities, causing the loss of talent, then it is your fault. If you cannot seize destined opportunities, it is all in vain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Do you understand?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">By the time the old demon-cultivator finished, his tone had already changed, scolding harshly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Liu Er hurriedly knelt, respectfully thanked his master for the reprimand, and promised to remember these words in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“Mm.” Only then did the old demon-cultivator nod, his expression easing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Precisely because a king’s destiny could be altered, the old demon-cultivator had personally come to protect this key node.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In Liu Er’s early development, Mu Lan was particularly important, the most crucial stepping stone that would allow Liu Er to blend into the officialdom of the Two Note Country in a positive manner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Otherwise, if he relied solely on his half-demon status to struggle, he would never be accepted by the mainstream upper echelons. Even if he had talent, it would remain buried for many years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The old demon-cultivator changed the subject: “Regarding the matter of the ownership of the spoils of war, Liu Er, how have you considered it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Liu Er wore a solemn expression and bowed: “This disciple sees two major drawbacks.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“First, it might harm our reputation for trustworthiness. Such a reputation needs to be cherished. Mingling in the righteous path requires it. My identity is awkward, and without trustworthiness and many other righteous virtues, I would find it nearly impossible to take even a single step.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Second, our army’s expenses are mostly sponsored by Ning Zhuo, and in the future they might be entirely funded by him. If we take back the rights to the spoils, it would be as if the entire army is living off the Ning Family’s provisions and pay. If this continues for a long time, will the Three Generals Battalion still be ours or will it belong to the Ning Family?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Observing the old demon-cultivator’s expression, seeing him stroke his beard and nod in satisfaction, Liu Er grew bolder and continued, “Previously, this disciple wanted to ask about the fate between the king’s destiny and Ning Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“In fact, it was also to consider this matter.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“If Ning Zhuo and I have no destined affinity, then while accepting the Ning Family’s aid at this time, I might act more boldly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“After all, the Ning Family is in Souther Bean Country, not in the Two Note Country.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Seeing that Liu Er still wanted to speak, the old demon-cultivator decisively raised his hand: “Enough, just handle it that way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“This time I called you here for another matter, one a thousand times more important than Ning Zhuo or the spoils of war!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Liu Er, since you want to pursue Mu Lan, then be resolute, bold, proactive, and open.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Mu Lan was a tiger’s daughter from a general’s family and admired battlefield heroes above all. If you behave like someone who sneaks and schemes, even if you finally defeat Shuang Jing and Sun Gan, Mu Lan would not be moved by you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Liu Er was taken aback: “This... Teacher, this disciple does have a heroic spirit and wishes to display it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“It’s just that the enemy’s forces were great, and my Three Generals Battalion had only just been established. This small enterprise could easily be crushed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The old demon-cultivator raised his hand again, stopping Liu Er’s explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Go now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The old man waved in the direction of the Three Generals Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Liu Er was surprised, but soon understood. As he left, he said, “Teacher, I understand your meaning.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“After returning, I will act openly and grandly to pursue Mu Lan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">When Liu Er looked up again, he found that the old demon-cultivator had already vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Teacher is still so mysterious and unfathomable,” Liu Er sighed and turned back toward the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The old demon-cultivator had not left, but remained where he was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">It was just that the old man’s illusion techniques were extraordinary, having deceived Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The old demon-cultivator’s face was deathly pale, blood spurted from his seven orifices, and a large amount of essence and lifespan flowed with the blood, rapidly consumed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The old man endured bitterly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The agony of both mind and body made him feel worse than death, every moment like a year.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">In the end, the pain gradually diminished, and blood no longer flowed from his seven orifices.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This was the drawback of divination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Everything had two sides, benefit and harm, a natural balance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Divination often could predict future trends, which was the great benefit of this cultivation art. But its drawbacks were far more numerous and severe than those of other cultivation techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">What the old demon-cultivator had just experienced was the result of using divination to guide a key figure, causing a violent fluctuation in destiny and making him endure this backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">And this still did not count as a critical reminder!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A critical reminder was also called fate pointing, and it was extremely difficult. It required the diviner to have a strong spirit of sacrifice, as one might die from the backlash of leaking heavenly secrets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">What the old demon-cultivator had just given was not a critical reminder, not fate pointing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">If previously, before Liu Er had learned about Mu Lan’s dual cultivation and other key information, before he even considered pursuing Mu Lan, the old demon-cultivator had clearly reminded him of this matter, that would have been fate pointing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">After receiving valuable guidance from his teacher, Liu Er acted decisively upon his return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He summoned Guan Hong, Zhang Hei, and Ning Zhuo, and publicly announced the retraction of some people’s rights to the spoils of war, but only for a portion of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Since these people no longer want this right, we will increase their provisions and pay to draw them in.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“As for those who still want to keep their right to the spoils, we will let them keep it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“We must count these two groups of people. The work is complicated, the tasks numerous, so we must rely on the adviser.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo quickly said it was his duty, praising Liu Er’s arrangement as mature, steady, and far more comprehensive and excellent than his own suggestion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After that, Liu Er announced that he would openly and grandly pursue Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">As expected, this decision met with the simultaneous opposition of the other three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">But Liu Er displayed a fearless masculine courage and an unyielding will, which stirred Guan Hong’s and Zhang Hei’s blood. They both pledged their firm support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo could not help but wonder what trump card Liu Er had to be so confident!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">However, since the three generals had already agreed, Ning Zhuo, though curious, also decisively expressed his compliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“In this way, the situation of the Three Generals Battalion would worsen sharply, becoming even more difficult than that of the Red Flower Battalion.”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
