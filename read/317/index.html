<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji frowned deeply, "Within the Lava Immortal Palace, there are three Golden Core stage mechanical puppets: the Demon General, the Dao Master, and the Buddha Healer." The Dao Master always remained within the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The damaged puppet was abandoned outside, eventually acquired, repaired, and returned to the Lava Immortal Palace by Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Only the whereabouts of the Buddha Healer remained unknown...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Now, Zhu Xuanji had found clues regarding the Buddha Healer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"It has already been acquired by someone else! Who could it be?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The mystery deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zhu Xuanji originally thought he could find some clues about the mechanical scythe from the Fourth Golden Furnace. If he could discover its flaws, that would be even better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">But there were none.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The situation was tense, leaving him no time for careful consideration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhu Xuanji could only memorize this clue and press forward with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Secret Pavilion of Opportunities stirred once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The buzzing sound of electricity echoed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Another minor opportunity had already occurred, and this time it was a major opportunity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Minor opportunities widened the gap between the cultivators in the palace examination, while major opportunities did the opposite, increasing the likelihood of clashes among cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Zhu Xuanji!!" The Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator shouted, "Where do you think you're going?" Zheng Danlian revealed a twisted smile, "Why do you keep avoiding battle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhu Xuanji snorted coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He was not afraid of battle but had seen through the schemes of the City Lord's Mansion. On one hand, they wanted to use Zheng Danlian and the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator to hold Zhu Xuanji back. On the other hand, they aimed to leave more steps for Meng Chong, increasing his chances of breaking through the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After all, with each opportunity, everyone only had thirty-six door attempts to take.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zhu Xuanji retreated, continuing his previous tactics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Behind him, Meng family's Golden Core  cultivator and Zheng Danlian pursued relentlessly, greatly slowing Zhu Xuanji's pace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Very well. It's better to deal with you two first." Zhu Xuanji turned around, expressionless, and faced Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator and Zheng Danlian head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zheng Danlian laughed wantonly, "Wouldn't it have been better to do this earlier, Lord Zhu?" He wielded his scythe and slashed fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">At the same time, the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator attacked from the left, his fist breaking through the air with immense force, carrying terrifying power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">After a violent collision, Zheng Danlian and the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator spewed blood and were sent flying backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The two quickly adjusted their stances and landed on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">They saw Zhu Xuanji enveloped in the light of a golden mountain, with a forest of golden branches and jade leaves swaying gracefully, jingling melodiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Three divine abilities?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Golden Mountain Stance, Jade Pillar Body... This is outrageous! Aren't you a divine constable?" Zheng Danlian and the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator exclaimed in succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zhu Xuanji remained expressionless, clenching his fists and launching an attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Boom boom...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The clash at the Golden Core stage caused the Secret Pavilion, serving as the battlefield, to tremble violently, its amplitude growing increasingly larger, almost to the point of madness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was directing the charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">After the major opportunity, it excitedly discovered that Meng Chong's position was not far from the exit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"The door on the left." "The door straight ahead." "The door above!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Under the guidance of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Meng Chong finally reached a Secret Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Apart from the door Meng Chong entered through, there was only one other door in the Secret Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">A massive door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The door was covered with numerous wooden blocks, which were interlocked and constrained within the door frame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Each wooden block bore inscriptions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit continued to transmit messages, "Use these blocks to piece together a correct version of the 'Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique,' and you can open the door and leave the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities!" Meng Chong was overjoyed, rubbing his hands together as he ran to the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The next moment, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit transmitted another message, "Be careful! The enemy has arrived."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Meng Chong felt a sudden sense of danger and turned around abruptly, only to see the small door he had entered through being pushed open and then closed again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Who is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"A coward hiding in the shadows!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Meng Chong cast a spell, immediately covering the area around the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Under normal circumstances, Ning Zhuo could evade the spell's attack, but Meng Chong, when casting the spell, also combined it with the Innate Talent Wild Sprint Thunderclap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">As a result, the spellcasting speed increased dramatically, enveloping Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo chuckled softly, enduring the spell and revealing his true form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Ning Zhuo?" Meng Chong was surprised; he had thought it was Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"You've returned here because you're unwilling to give up, right? But if it were me, I would do the same!" Meng Chong nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Then, he showed a fierce expression, "However, if you think you can stop me, you're just dreaming. Stand aside; this is not the second stage of the palace examination's arena."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">With that, he raised his fist towards Ning Zhuo. Lightning crackled around his fist, a sign of the Innate Talen Wild Sprint Thunderclap being activated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo smiled and stepped forward, saying only, "Let's fight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Meng Chong laughed heartily, "Ha! Then I'll finish you in ten breaths!" In a flash of lightning, he charged towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">However, before his fist could land on Ning Zhuo's cheek, frost flowers bloomed on the surface of his body. Especially on the leading fist, a layer of ice formed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Mechanical Ice Snow Weather Sphere!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Interesting." Meng Chong temporarily retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Grasp Fire Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He was enveloped in flames, dispelling the frost, and his body became hot and agile once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Innate Talent—Wild Sprint Thunderclap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He charged forward, only to be knocked back again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">A massive mechanical ape appeared beside Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Golden Core stage mechanical construct!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo gently patted the mechanical ape beside him, "I've named it Heavy Armored Blood Ape, please appreciate it, Brother Meng." Meng Chong once again assessed Ning Zhuo, his expression different from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"You are a worthy opponent, haha, let's fight!" Meng Chong charged forward once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">In the Lava Immortal Palace's inner circle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zheng Shuangjun spat blood as he ran, frantically transmitting messages to Ning Jiufan, "Clan Leader Ning, Brother Ning! Return the Moon Hook to me, and I'll agree to any conditions you set!" Ning Jiufan snorted coldly, "Despicable scoundrel, launching a sneak attack, what face do you have to negotiate with me? No return!" The refusal plunged Zheng Shuangjun into deep despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">With just a single hook, he was no match for the two Golden Core cultivators of the Great Purity Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He was already in a desperate situation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Even if I die, I won't let you have it easy!" In his despair, Zheng Shuangjun charged towards Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Jiufan laughed heartily in anger and decisively cast an attack spell, targeting Zheng Shuangjun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Zheng Shuangjun's body froze from the cold, revealing a massive flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The experienced Golden Core cultivators of the Great Purity Palace, working in perfect harmony, pursued Zheng Shuangjun and struck him down mercilessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Zheng Shuangjun let out a tragic cry and fell on the spot!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He was the first Golden Core cultivator to die on the battlefield since the great chaos began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He was only the first, certainly not the last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Subsequently, more Golden Core cultivators either died or fled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The intensity of the battle was simply too great, and the battlefield was too chaotic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Those who were once revered as sect leaders and ancestors became as insignificant as grass in this chaotic battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The scarlet flame beast tide continued to press forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The Golden Core cultivators were engaged in fierce internal strife, and the three families and the City Lord's Mansion had dispatched a large number of low-level elites into the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, leaving the inner circle's defenses empty and unable to withstand the beast tide's impact, causing them to collapse one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The three Nascent Soul-level scarlet flame beasts were still being held back by Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But in the next breath, the five-tailed fire fox of the Great Purity Palace reappeared, unleashing five flying flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The flying flames were as swift as shooting stars, with Meng Kui's mana hand blocking three of them, but two still fell into the inner circle of the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">One flying flame landed on the Medical Pavilion, where Ning Jiufan happened to be nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The flying flame exploded with a roar, and fierce flames spread in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Jiufan found himself in a Nascent Soul-level sea of fire, desperately trying to save himself. But the ice and frost melted away, unable to resist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"My life is over!" As Ning Jiufan lamented, a mother ape suddenly scooped him up and swiftly carried him out of the sea of fire to safety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Seeing the Nascent Soul-level Fire Fusion Demon Ape that saved him, Ning Jiufan's expression was extremely complex!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Another flame struck the main hall, absorbed by the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities that surrounded it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">In the explosion, the fire burned, destroying large swathes of the purple-blue current, revealing empty spaces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">A large portion of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities was engulfed in flames, with countless cultivators inside suffering casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The related restrictions were thus greatly weakened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"We can go in!" A Golden Core cultivator noticed this and immediately dove into the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">His success immediately sparked a wave of imitators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Book Master, the Golden Core true disciples of the Purple Dawn Pavilion, Luo Shang, Yang Chanyu, many Golden Core cultivators of the Meng family, and several Shadow Demon Cultivators all charged into the Secret Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The addition of Golden Core reinforcements saved the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator and Zheng Danlian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">With three divine abilities, Zhu Xuanji maintained a firm upper hand in this confrontation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The mechanical scythe, however, was selective, allowing Zhu Xuanji to endure multiple attacks, but Zheng Danlian was too weak. In terms of martial skills, he was far inferior to Zhu Xuanji. Even with a sharp weapon, he struggled to make an impact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator was in an even more miserable state, with multiple fractures and a swollen face, barely clinging to life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Zhu Xuanji, don't be arrogant!" "Attack together, no need to hold back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Several Golden Core cultivators unleashed spells and magical artifacts, converging into a torrential downpour of attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Zhu Xuanji fully activated his three divine abilities, the golden mountain's mysterious light surged, the golden branches and jade leaves clanged, and the jade pillar body remained unmoved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">While enduring the relentless bombardment from numerous enemies, he also harnessed his innate talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Innate Talent—Golden Time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Spell—Weapons of War.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Innate Talent Spell—Sharp Will Golden Weapons!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Golden weapons surged upstream, cutting through thorns and brambles, their sharpness unmatched. They accurately struck their respective enemies, causing the Golden Core cultivators to fall one after another, severely injured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The ferocity of the assault on Zhu Xuanji was thus greatly reduced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Hahaha, die, all of you!!" Zheng Danlian's eyes turned blood-red as he suddenly threw the mechanical scythe in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The scythe transformed rapidly in mid-air, becoming a massive mechanical snake, launching a surprise attack on the Meng family's Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">It opened its maw wide and swallowed a Golden Core cultivator whole!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Then, it turned its deadly attention to the other Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The Meng family's Golden Core cultivators had not anticipated Zheng Danlian's madness, attacking his own allies. By the time they reacted, the second victim's leg had already been bitten and swallowed by the mechanical snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">In their shock and anger, the Meng family's Golden Core cultivators launched a frenzied assault on the mechanical snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">But this Night Rain Demon Weapon withstood the terrifying attacks and devoured the second victim!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">It then lunged at the third Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The Meng family's Golden Core cultivators scattered in panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Zheng Danlian wore a bloodthirsty smile and immediately pursued with the mechanical snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">His gaze was filled with madness, sending chills down Zhu Xuanji's spine.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
