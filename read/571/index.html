<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong streaked across the sky, each pushing their Sky Iron Heroic Armors to the limits as they raced and chased one another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“Faster, faster!” Sun Lingtong shouted excitedly. Despite maxing out the capabilities of his armor, he still couldn’t shake off Ning Zhuo. After all, both suits were crafted by the same hand, identical in design and material, and thus nearly equal in performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A cunning gleam flashed through Sun Lingtong's eyes as he turned towards Ning Zhuo, “Little Zhuo, our Sky Iron Heroic Armor can go even faster, can't it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">His tone was certain. Having studied the mechanical manuals left by Ning Zhuo’s mother, Sun Lingtong possessed considerable expertise in mechanics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“That's true,” Ning Zhuo responded candidly. “Since the armor covers our bodies, I set safety limitations on it. Within these safe limits, no matter how recklessly we use it, the armor remains stable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“However,” he continued seriously, “if we surpass the safety threshold, we'll be risking structural integrity.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong urged impatiently, “Enough chatter! Quick, Little Zhuo, how do I unlock this limit?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">A faint smile spread across Ning Zhuo's face. “It's simple. Channel your spiritual energy into the eye of the Two Extremes Formation, and simultaneously use your divine sense to activate the bird-shaped glyph on the Golden Core Rotation Wheel. That will release the restrictions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The moment Ning Zhuo finished speaking, a thunderous explosion rang out. Sun Lingtong shattered the sound barrier in front of him, generating shockwaves as he rapidly accelerated, instantly putting hundreds of steps between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Ha ha ha!” Sun Lingtong laughed wildly. “This is incredible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“You’ll be eating my dust, little brother!” he boasted, his excitement palpable. Then, just to flaunt his newfound advantage, he circled back around Ning Zhuo, shouting gleefully, thoroughly enjoying the moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo snorted softly, smirking. “Elder Brother, I can also break the limit.” With that, he swiftly removed the safety restrictions as well, causing his Sky Iron Heroic Armor to surge dramatically in performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Sun Lingtong cried out in mock surprise before quickly fleeing ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo chased closely behind, calling out with a playful determination, “Just watch me catch you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Both cultivators soared through the skies, their speeds escalating rapidly. The wind resistance grew increasingly intense, leaving Ning Zhuo struggling to breathe. He promptly activated his spiritual power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“White Tiger Army-Breaking Formation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">As Ning Zhuo initiated the formation, his armor’s Golden Swallow Wings shone brilliantly with platinum radiance, slicing through the air, creating a continuous, sharp tearing sound. The armor at the front of his body began to heat up, glowing faintly red from the friction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In response, Ning Zhuo activated the Earth Shield Formation in his helmet. Immediately, a semi-transparent, yellowish barrier enveloped him, bolstering his defenses severalfold. The redness and heat from the armor subsided quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">However, comfort was short-lived. As his speed increased further, a tremendous pressure bore down upon him, constricting his breathing. To counter this, Ning Zhuo pushed the Two Extremes Flow Formation inside the armor to its utmost limit, finally balancing the internal and external pressures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“This is my first time flying at such speed,” Ning Zhuo thought, his mind taut with concentration as he continuously monitored the armor’s internal status. He noticed the Golden Core on the Five Elements wheel glowing intensely, with its spiritual energy consumption more than tripling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Despite the White Tiger Army-Breaking Formation cutting through the wind resistance, Ning Zhuo still needed considerable personal effort to sustain this speed and maintain stability. Any slight miscalculation in posture could alter his entire flight trajectory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">In front, Sun Lingtong flailed energetically, his flight path erratic, twisting and turning wildly as though dancing clumsily in mid-air. Yet, he was thoroughly enjoying himself, his joyous shouts echoing back to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">In stark contrast, Ning Zhuo brought his legs tightly together, hands by his sides, locked rigidly into place by mechanical clamps, adopting an aerodynamic posture. Like an arrow released from a bow, he hurtled forward, his head slightly lowered to further minimize air resistance, causing his speed to increase even more rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Additionally, fins extended from his armor’s lower legs, resembling fish fins, assisting in steering and stabilizing his flight path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong, startled by Ning Zhuo's swift and controlled movements, shouted frantically and careened into a cloud, completely disoriented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Taking advantage, Ning Zhuo surged past him, laughing loudly, “Elder Brother, I’ve surpassed you now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Don’t get cocky, brat!” Sun Lingtong shot back, quickly regaining composure and emerging from the clouds, adopting a similar streamlined posture to Ning Zhuo’s. Flames erupted from his palms and soles, leaving a dazzling, fiery trail stretching several meters behind him as he pursued with fierce determination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong's speed suddenly surged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo felt a quick flutter in his chest and hurriedly transmitted a spiritual thought, cautioning, "Boss, take it easy! I've never been tested like this before!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Sun Lingtong grinned mischievously, "Isn't that the whole point? Little Zhuo, brace yourself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As he spoke, he charged straight towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Reacting swiftly, Ning Zhuo dodged to the side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Sun Lingtong shot past like a roaring tempest, the powerful gust knocking Ning Zhuo back several dozen steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong's laughter echoed, bold and unrestrained, "Little Zhuo, can you still keep up?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Inside his armor, Ning Zhuo's eyes sharpened with competitive fervor, "Hmph! Boss, did you forget? This Sky Iron Heroic Armor is my own creation! Losing to you is impossible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Provoked, Ning Zhuo ignited a blazing tail of flames several meters long, swiftly chasing after Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun Lingtong didn't even glance back; his divine sense was extensive and sharp, immediately detecting Ning Zhuo's rapid approach. A satisfied smile curled at his lips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Little Zhuo, you've truly changed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"The old you would never have been this spirited."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Your journey, especially through the harshness of the Two Note Kingdom's battlefield, has awakened your bravery and iron spirit. At sixteen, this is exactly the passion you should have."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The old Ning Zhuo would have quietly endured, maintaining a low profile, avoiding such flamboyant displays.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo's speed continuously accelerated, faster than he had ever been.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The sensation was exhilarating, sending tingling excitement through his scalp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">His Golden Core disc shone brilliantly, vibrating slightly due to the extreme exertion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The entire Five Elements Golden Core Wheel, having reached its operational limit from manipulating and transforming his Golden Core energy, had become scorching hot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Even the Yin-Yang Confluence Formation responsible for balancing internal and external pressure flickered erratically, seemingly gasping under strain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">His armor emitted a strained hum, clearly pushed to its limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Suddenly, Sun Lingtong rocketed upward, ascending steeply into the higher skies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Refusing to be outdone, Ning Zhuo followed suit, ascending sharply. His joints and limbs pressed tightly against the armor’s inner walls, his face distorted by the intense pressure. Teeth chattering uncontrollably, he clenched his jaw shut tightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">His Golden Swallow Wings quivered violently at the sudden directional shift, emitting alarming creaks from the intense stress at their bases.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Boss, slow down a bit," Ning Zhuo advised through gritted teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But Sun Lingtong merely laughed joyously, "This is exhilarating!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In the next instant, Ning Zhuo saw Sun Lingtong's armor erupt with flames once more, now an intense orange-red rather than mere red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Clearly, the temperature had spiked dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Not wanting to concede defeat, Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth and pushed himself further, maxing out his Li-Fire Tongue Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">A powerful force suddenly tripled, slamming him forward. The cushioning air film from the Yin-Yang Confluence Formation was flattened to almost paper-thin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The blunt ache of his bones pressing against the armor’s interior was relentless, every inch of him burdened as though by mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Without warning, they burst into the cloud layer above.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Instantly, Ning Zhuo’s vision went white, obscured entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Sky Iron Armor rapidly cooled, tiny frost crystals briefly appearing on his thigh before vanishing instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Three breaths later, Ning Zhuo’s vision cleared, unveiling a boundless sky bathed in sunlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He was soaring above a sea of clouds, ascending vertically. Narrowing his eyes against the glaring sun, he gazed around, chest swelling with exhilaration. A youthful, spirited shout escaped his lips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"The sky is vast, the earth expansive - let me soar freely!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Where's the boss?” Ning Zhuo halted his roaring, glancing around curiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Sun Lingtong transmitted his voice, amused, "Little Zhuo, come over here and see what I've found."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Slowing his blazing aura, Ning Zhuo adjusted his trajectory and plunged into the sea of clouds. Upon piercing through the clouds, he reunited smoothly with Sun Lingtong, witnessing an impressive hunting spectacle below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Two Golden-Plumed Black Eagles, one noticeably larger than the other, circled gracefully overhead. On the mountainside, a nervous herd of sheep huddled protectively behind their leader, a robust ram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The smaller eagle was precisely the one they'd frightened earlier, causing it to cry out like a crow. The larger eagle, presumably its father, possessed a head as massive as an ox's skull, featuring an imposing iron-grey hooked beak over two feet long. Its feathers transitioned beautifully from deep black to gleaming gold on its nape, standing erect like a majestic crown of dark gold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Spreading its immense wings, spanning nearly sixty feet, it cast an ominous shadow of death across the mountainside grassland. Its eagle claws resembled polished bronze, with leg bones as thick as a grown man's waist. Each talon was akin to a short sword, gleaming chillingly in the sunlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Every wing beat revealed powerful muscles rippling beneath feathers, like molten iron shaped into mountainous forms, exuding overwhelming might. The feathers on its back aligned like sharpened arrows, and its twelve tail feathers extended beyond ten feet, glowing vividly with concentrated golden radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This was undoubtedly a Golden Core-level adult Golden-Plumed Black Eagle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">With eyes of dark gold, the eagle zeroed in on the sheep below. Suddenly retracting its wings, it dove earthward like a meteor, green wind pressure spiraling between its talons. The ram leader bravely lifted its head, releasing a surprisingly swift stream of fiery breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The eagle merely tilted slightly, evading effortlessly, and swept into the herd, instantly snatching two sheep in its grasp. Soaring skyward again, a gentle squeeze of its talons transformed both sheep into gruesome fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Blood and shattered remains scattered across the grass, deepening the flock's terror. The adult eagle paused, issuing a commanding cry, encouraging the smaller eagle to follow suit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Mimicking its father, the young eagle attempted its hunt but was repeatedly thwarted by bursts of flame from the vigilant ram. The frustrated adult eagle released a fierce cry, its powerful wings whipping up furious winds, forcing the sheep to the ground, trembling closely together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Bolstered by its father's intervention, the young eagle regrouped, finally capturing a female sheep and triumphantly ascending skyward, leaving the sheep's mournful cries behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“Now that's interesting,” Ning Zhuo observed, thoroughly entertained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong's eyes sparkled mischievously. "Little Zhuo, let's use our Azure Iron Battle Armor and test ourselves against this Golden-Plumed Black Eagle, shall we?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Without waiting for Ning Zhuo's agreement, Sun Lingtong boldly charged at the adult eagle. The eagle, already wary of their presence, swiftly retaliated by spewing a beam of golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Displaying remarkable agility, Sun Lingtong dodged the attack. Right as collision seemed inevitable, he adjusted sharply, narrowly skimming past the eagle. Sparks flew as the earth shield violently scraped against the eagle’s tough feathers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“I’m roasting a bird tonight!” Sun Lingtong laughed boldly, opening his palm and unleashing a fierce blast of Lihuo flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The eagle roared in pain, furiously flapping its wings to send Sun Lingtong spiraling away. But Sun Lingtong's golden wings sliced through the gale like blades, quickly returning to continue the fierce battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Seeing its father under assault, the young eagle angrily rushed to join, but Ning Zhuo moved even quicker, intercepting the smaller eagle. Soon, the skies were alive with furious exchanges, an intense ballet of attack and defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The adult eagle, a Golden Core beast adept in wind and metal attributes, boasted a near-impenetrable defense with feathers resembling a suit of golden armor. Yet Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo’s Azure Iron Battle Armor matched its strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Relentless assaults from Li Fire and golden wings soon inflicted injuries upon the adult eagle, causing blood to drip freely from its wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Seeing no advantage in further combat, the great eagle grabbed its offspring in defeat and hastily retreated, disappearing swiftly into the horizon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Ning and Ning Zhuo hovered quietly in midair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Aren't we going to chase them?" Sun Lingtong asked, turning to Ning Zhuo in mild puzzlement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo slowly shook his head, his eyes softening slightly. "Let's leave it be. Their bond as father and child is sincere."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sun Lingtong chuckled lightly and chose to follow his companion’s lead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Having lost his father early in life and his mother at the tender age of two, Ning Zhuo had even plotted against a Nascent Soul cultivator in a desperate bid to save his mother. Now, his journeys across the land were primarily driven by the quest to find his mother's belongings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Such acts spoke volumes about Ning Zhuo's deep yearning for familial affection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">People often crave and pursue precisely what they've lacked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Childhood deficiencies can leave lifelong scars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thus, the two remained floating silently, watching as the golden eagle father and son disappeared into the distant sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Baa, baa, baa."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">At that moment, the ram leader approached beneath them, lifting its head with a gentle bleat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Both Sun and Ning turned their attention downward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The ram leader respectfully lowered its head. Its abdomen contracted visibly as it spat out a brightly glowing orb onto the grass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">After placing the orb on the ground, the ram knelt on its front knees, bowing deeply three times to Sun and Ning before rising and quietly walking away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Is this a gift for us?" Ning Zhuo was surprised, not expecting such a turn of events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Curiosity sparked in him as he inquired, "What exactly is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Sun Lingtong examined it closely, then laughed aloud. "It's the Fierce Sun Essence. When encountering Yin energy, it becomes heavy as a mountain, but when exposed to Yang energy, it turns light as a feather!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"This is an extraordinary tonic for enhancing Yang energy," Sun teased, a mischievous glint in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo immediately lost interest, shrugging dismissively. "My primal Yang energy remains untouched, abundant beyond measure. Why would I need such a thing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Since our tests are complete, let's continue onwards to White Paper City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Sun Lingtong nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Without further delay, the pair swiftly boarded their Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon vessel, speeding onward to their next destination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Black Water Mountain, White Paper City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Inside the City Lord’s mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer knelt trembling, forcing herself to speak despite her fear. "City Lord, this subordinate failed miserably! The male consort I gathered for you was intercepted halfway."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The City Lord, hair disheveled and body restrained by over a dozen artifact-grade chains, roared furiously, "I'm losing control. Yang energy - I must have more Yang energy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"You have ten days to gather three hundred more male consorts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Any more mistakes, and I'll have your head immediately!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Yes, yes, my Lord!" Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer hurriedly kowtowed repeatedly, expressing gratitude for her mercy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">She exited the mansion in panic, immediately shouting commands: "Quickly, gather more men for the City Lord! The stronger their Yang energy, the better!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
