<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The two armies confronted each other!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Dark clouds rolled in the sky, as if stained with ink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This was the remaining force from the previous battle between Lei Qingyang and the Blood Shadow Cave Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The battle between Li Jiuqu and Mo Yecheng continued on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">At Lord Long’s command, nearly ten Nascent Soul-level cultivators went out together, all shouting challenges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In Two Note Nation’s main camp, a female cultivator flew out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">She wore a mask, and her right arm was replaced by a mechanical arm. Her long gray‐white hair showed she was not young.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">She swiftly ascended into the air, beneath the dark clouds, her robes fluttering, her visage like iron, and she challenged loudly: “You all come at me together!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Around her, over a hundred flying mechanical fairies circled, continuously fluttering, protecting her at the center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Facing such provocation, nearly ten Nascent Soul-level cultivators of the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance halted in place, exchanging glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">It was impossible to really charge in all at once!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The tactic of issuing challenges was like this: it was best to have one-on-one duels between opponents of equal level, for only such outcomes could shake morale and the spirit of the army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">If many fought against few, even if they won, the impact on morale and military spirit would be limited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Conversely, if the few defeated the many, if the weak overcame the strong - for instance, a Golden Core triumphing over a Nascent Soul - the effect on morale would be even more dramatic and fierce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Therefore, if these Nascent Soul cultivators really charged en masse, even if they defeated the Mechanism Princess, they would gain little benefit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">They all knew where their own advantages lay, and would not commit a large number of men against Shuang Ling. In this way, the numerical advantage of high-level cultivators would not be exploited at all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">After a brief exchange of glances, everyone communicated quickly through their spiritual senses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Cangyue Tribe, Lone Fang is here!” the blue-haired barbarian general shouted, and was pushed forward by the others, stepping up to confront Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He dashed through the air, drew out the giant wolf-toothed club from his back, invoked spells, and condensed hundreds of phantom mountain wolves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The mountain wolf pack charged fiercely at the mechanical fairies; the wolves bit while the fairies wielded their silks to execute strangulation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Soon, the wolf pack suffered heavy losses, but the mechanical fairies retained their numbers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Countless gazes were fixed on the confrontation between the two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Just as before, the generals in Two Note Nation’s main camp were wary of Li Jiuqu, and many cultivators of the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance were likewise cautious of Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Shuang Ling - the Mechanism Princess!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Her fame was in no way weaker than Li Jiuqu’s, perhaps even stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">She was the flagship figure of Two Note Nation at the Nascent Soul stage, representing the honor of a cultivation realm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Within the mechanical dragon dance, both Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong paid strong attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo was even more concentrated, his eyes not blinking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Although Shuang Ling and he had clashed in the past, as a renowned mechanical cultivator, Ning Zhuo, with a humble attitude, intended to learn well from Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">In the initial probe, Lone Fang was obviously no match, immediately presenting a clear weakness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Shuang Ling’s brows slightly furrowed, yet she was not satisfied with this outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">She knew in her heart that her side had a serious disadvantage, and if the enemy truly leveraged their numerical advantage of Nascent Soul cultivators, it would have a grave impact on the entire battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Therefore, she had to exhibit even greater might to prompt other cultivators to join the fight with her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The opportunity was right in front of her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Once the others thought that Lone Fang could, on his own, engage in a war of attrition with Shuang Ling, then these onlookers would undoubtedly continue to issue challenges immediately, putting Two Note Nation’s main army in a dilemma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">So at the next moment, Shuang Ling snorted coldly and unleashed twenty suspended flying repeating crossbows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The crossbows formed a formation on her right side, arranged neatly and squarely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The next moment, the dark golden seal script on the crossbow box suddenly shone brightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Departing Fire Arrow, release!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The bowstrings trembled like a zither’s music; in a few breaths, each crossbow fired ten slender arrows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The arrows interwove, forming bursts of arrow rain that shot into the back half of the wolf pack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">It was too fast - Lone Fang had only just begun to cast a defensive spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Under the arrow rain, the wolf pack quickly perished, leaving a large gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Lone Fang’s face turned ashen, his own safety in jeopardy; he swung his wolf-toothed club continuously, deflecting the numerous arrows shot at him, looking quite disheveled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The arrow rain kept coming, and Lone Fang could only retreat continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He cast defensive spells to safeguard himself, while continuously swinging his wolf-toothed club with both hands, repeatedly summoning phantom wolves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">But for every phantom wolf he released, that many were shot down by the arrows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The mechanical fairies still encircled Shuang Ling, and did not pursue the advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Lone Fang roared angrily, his form suddenly expanding by three degrees, summoning three head wolves of the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The head wolves charged recklessly, their wolf claws treading the wind, and with continuous howls, they helped their master alleviate much of the pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Only then did Lone Fang regain his footing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Seeing this, Shuang Ling immediately unleashed twelve suspended Taixu bell guardians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">These bronze puppets all had human forms, with three heads and six arms, each holding a large bell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The large bell was inverted, its opening facing upward, and its surface was inscribed with one complex star map after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Clang clang clang……</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The six arms continuously waved, with fists and palms striking the bell, emitting a series of chimes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Meanwhile, from the bell’s opening, waves of indigo air surged forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The air-waves, along with the bell sounds, swept through the surrounding area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Not only did they envelop Lone Fang, but they also encompassed the remaining Nascent Soul cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The footing that Lone Fang had just stabilized collapsed once again in the bell chimes and air-waves, leaving him in a state of panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Most of the cultivators, aware of Shuang Ling’s strategy, snorted coldly, unwilling to be trapped, and retreated one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Bi Tengyi, whose nature was strong-willed, was incited to anger: “Mechanism Princess, if you want to court your own death, then I, this old woman, will grant you that wish!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Bi Tengyi snarled, and a vast expanse of vines extended from her body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The cyan-green vines spiraled and coalesced in the high air, forming nine vine pythons that charged toward Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Wherever the vine pythons moved, they scattered countless azure-scaled toxins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">After charging into the mechanical fairies’ defensive line, the azure-scaled toxins immediately infected them, causing the mechanical fairies to fall from the sky like dumplings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Seeing the line waver, Shuang Ling took out two batches of mechanisms from her storage treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The first batch consisted of twenty-four ice-fire knife mantises; on their forelimb blades, the left side emanated frost while the right burned with red flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The mechanical knife mantises were extremely agile, charging toward Lone Fang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After joining the fray, they immediately slashed and killed Lone Fang’s three Golden Core head wolves, leaving him to retreat frantically, the situation critical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The second batch was thirty-six Xuanji armor plates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The armor plates spun rapidly before Shuang Ling, like a fan, forming a huge suction force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The next moment, almost all the azure-scaled toxins were sucked onto the plates, dyeing them a green, oily hue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The plates quickly assembled together, forming a giant shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The tortoise shell patterns on the giant shield shone with silvery light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Mechanical Art - Xuan Turtle Heavenly Light Shield Return!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The next moment, a huge beam of light burst out violently from the shield’s surface, carrying with it all the concentrated azure-scaled toxins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The light column was incredibly powerful, directly severing one of the vine pythons, aiming at Bi Tengyi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Bi Tengyi’s expression changed dramatically; with a shriek, she took out her treasured vine staff and swung it forcefully before her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">In the next instant, from the tip of the vine staff, a gigantic man-eating demon flower grew frantically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Its flower mouth gaped wide, like that of a giant beast, and it just so happened to swallow the entire light column.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After swallowing, the man-eating demon flower’s body swelled more than tenfold, and its purple-red demonic flesh began to turn green all over as it struggled to digest this astonishing blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The assembled giant shield reverted to its normal form, then disassembled once more, transforming into armor plates that guarded around Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Shuang Ling extended her mechanical right arm and ejected twelve mechanical copper spheres inscribed with thunder patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The copper spheres flew swiftly, with arcs of electric light swirling about them, interweaving into a net that formed an electric mesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Mechanism art - Electric Net, Insect Awakening!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The electric net enveloped Bi Tengyi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Bi Tengyi continuously executed techniques, and all manner of spells that struck the electric net were negated by it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Bi Tengyi retreated in a disheveled manner, not daring to test its might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“No wonder she is the nation’s Nascent Soul luminary - her techniques are outstanding!” Gao Cuo, seeing this, sighed in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">A deep, aged voice resounded within him: “The prospects of this grand battle are unclear; the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King has not confirmed his participation, and yet we are besieging the enemy’s frontline main camp. You must know that in that main camp, Du Tiechuan is recuperating.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Gao Cuo, this is not a place to stay for long.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“You should withdraw from here; now is a good opportunity!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Gao Cuo nodded: “Old Sword is right, I am leaving.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">His expression became solemn, and with firm resolve, he advanced loudly, stepping up to Shuang Ling: “Mechanism Princess, I am Gao Cuo, here to receive the lesson of your superior moves!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Seeing the third Nascent Soul cultivator attack, Shuang Ling was not alarmed but rather pleased; this demonstrated that she had exhibited enough menace to make the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance side unable to hold back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Gao Cuo’s form flickered, splitting into a hundred and ten phantom images that suddenly dispersed, attacking Shuang Ling from all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The phantom images executed various spells - some genuine, some illusory, some strong, some weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">For a moment, the battlefield was filled with multicolored sounds and lights, exceedingly gorgeous and varied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This scene made Lin Bufan, who was watching from a hidden corner, have a slight change in expression; he felt as though he had seen it before, yet could not confirm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Shuang Ling’s face darkened slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Because this illusion was quite troublesome, she consecutively employed three methods, yet failed to see through it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Once unable to pierce it, she had to defend fully, greatly increasing her consumption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Old Sword, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately called out: “Gao Cuo, reserve some strength!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Gao Cuo immediately retracted his strength in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Then Shuang Ling’s spirit lifted, and she finally found a way to see through the illusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">She uttered a low shout and took out a mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The mechanism, resembling an armillary sphere and named Star Dial, emitted the light of the stars, illuminating the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Any false illusion quickly dissipated in the starlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">In an instant, the dazzling barrage of spells on the field vanished, leaving only two or three solitary genuine spells as the true offensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Shuang Ling took a deep breath, fixed her gaze on Gao Cuo’s true body, and unleashed seven North Star swordsmen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Her right arm fired seven tethering threads, which shot out like electricity, connecting precisely to the doll’s body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Under the control of the threads, the North Star swordsmen immediately formed a Big Dipper Seven Stars formation and charged toward Gao Cuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Gao Cuo engaged with them and soon was defeated, his body drenched in blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Seeing his dire situation, the Demon Heart Cave Master immediately took action and joined the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Gao Cuo gritted his teeth and, at the critical moment, activated a Void Escape Talisman, shuttling through the void with blood splattering in the air, and retreated from the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Demon Heart Cave Master cursed bitterly and had no choice but to reluctantly take his place to counter the onslaught of the North Star swordsmen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The Demon Heart Cave Master was far more powerful than Gao Cuo, stirring his demonic arts, unleashing various demonic spells, and exchanging attack for attack with astonishing might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">He would rather sustain sword wounds than leave more than half of the seven North Star swordsmen intact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The Mechanism Princess, seeing this, smiled faintly; for every swordman lost, she immediately supplemented the same number.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Seeing that the Demon Heart Cave Master’s fighting spirit was soaring and his offense was wild, she directly tossed out the mechanical Star Dial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The Star Dial hung high, scattering starlight that shone on the mechanical dolls of the North Star swordsmen, causing their combat power to surge, their speed to greatly increase, and their sword edges to become even sharper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The combat power of the seven mechanical figures surged simultaneously, greatly increasing the pressure on the Demon Heart Cave Master, who was suddenly put at a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">“No wonder she is the Mechanism Princess!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">“Fighting one against four, she had already repelled Gao Cuo - his fate now uncertain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Many of the cultivators watching the battle focused their attention on Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">This princess of Two Note Nation displayed a formidable combat power, making her impossible to ignore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Watching as she, with the strength of one, suppressed three cultivators, the Thousand Peaks Forest Allied forces had no choice but to dispatch additional Nascent Soul cultivators to encircle Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">One, two, three!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Six Nascent Soul-level cultivators all fought Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">With her own strength, Shuang Ling took on enemy forces six times as strong, thereby alleviating a considerable part of the pressure on Two Note Nation’s main army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Zhao Xi exhaled a deep breath of relief and calmly dispatched Nascent Soul cultivators to confront the remaining enemy cultivators issuing challenges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">For a time, in the central zone of the two armies’ standoff, six or seven battle groups formed, each fighting one-on-one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Li Jiuqu gained the advantage while Mo Yecheng barely held his ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Mechanism Princess Shuang Ling dominated the six Nascent Soul cultivators, her own formation remaining steadfast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The other battle groups engaged in one-on-one melees, each with their own dazzling displays.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The warriors on both sides were left awestruck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Within the mechanical dragon, both Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong were equally dazzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">This kind of Nascent Soul-level combat opened their eyes, providing them with a grand visual feast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Usually, battles between Nascent Souls were rarely seen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">But now, not only did they see it, they were overwhelmed by it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">For them, merely watching the battle was a rare opportunity to witness the demeanor of higher levels, clarify their own direction, and judge advantages and disadvantages more precisely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Ning Zhuo’s eyes sparkled with brilliance as he exclaimed in awe, “So strong, truly so strong!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">“Is this the demeanor of a mechanical cultivator?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">“Fighting one against many, effortlessly. I can tell that Shuang Ling still has reserves!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Sun Lingtong then analyzed, “Although the art of mechanisms is the culmination of a hundred arts, it is simply that mastering, refining, and perfecting it requires too much and the standards are too high.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">“Once truly cultivated, its combat power is remarkably over the standard!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">“A mechanical cultivator can form an army by himself; someone like Shuang Ling not only employs the art of mechanisms but also utilizes military tactics, leveraging the force of an army to obtain even greater leverage and stronger combat power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">An ordinary cultivator in a duel can only display his inherent combat power or employ only a low leverage ratio.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">But mechanical cultivators are different; the creation of mechanisms is costly and involves techniques such as refining, alchemy, formation setting, talisman making, and so on - simply the act of creation itself fully utilizes resources, leveraging tremendous combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">On these mechanical creations, mechanical cultivators can also work extensively, deploying the art of mechanisms, military strategy, and more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Leverage upon leverage is not a simple addition but an exponential surge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Battle opportunity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Suddenly, Shuang Ling unleashed her power, and the knife mantises exploded, forming a deadly offensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Lone Fang was panic - stricken, already bearing severe injuries, and it looked as if he was about to perish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Seeing this, Bi Tengyi no longer held back and dramatically executed her trump card move!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Divine Art - The Withering Bi-Lin Curse!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">The verdant phosphorus fire, sparse and scattered, was of unparalleled power; wherever it reached, mechanical creations were destroyed, transforming into even more phosphorus fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Within the phosphorus fire, ghostly skeletal silhouettes appeared, with murderous intent and a morbid aura spreading madly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">The defensive line surrounding Shuang Ling immediately largely collapsed, threatening her life safety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">The alliance side’s spirit was greatly bolstered. This was the first offensive in the clash that truly threatened Shuang Ling!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Shuang Ling chuckled and said, “Come!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Divine Art - Xuanji World Purification Wheel!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">Three hundred and sixty specially made World-Purifying Lotus Platforms were released in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">The bronze lotus platforms were vividly lifelike, with lotus petals carved with the “Expulsion of Evil” section from the Huangdi Neijing, and at the center of each platform was inlaid a Kunlun cold jade bead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">The next moment, from the bottom of the lotus platforms, cyan-white flames burst forth, and from the openings, three thousand six hundred Heavenly Physician golden needles were fired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">The flames and golden needles mixed and scattered, instantly dispersing the phosphorus fire, and then, riding the momentum, they struck, causing Bi Tengyi to let out a wailing, miserable scream and lose her life on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
