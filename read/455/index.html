<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Sun and Ning both had their hearts sink slightly.<br/>
<br/>
They wanted to leave, but were stopped by Lord Long’s voice.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long wore a smile on his face as he looked at the large stone sphere on the ground: “Friend Shi, if I am not mistaken, you gained quite a lot of spoils in this battle.”<br/>
<br/>
“These enemy troops’ equipment was all very fine, whereas our Thousand Peaks Forest side is greatly lacking in that regard.”<br/>
<br/>
“Why not sell these spoils to our alliance?”<br/>
<br/>
“Not to mention anything else, just that copy of ‘The Lost Writings of Gao Sheng’ is extremely crucial. Even if it’s incomplete, it is still a treasured military tome, perfectly suited for our army’s use.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt slightly relieved; just a moment ago he had thought he was exposed.<br/>
<br/>
In only that short time, a thin layer of sweat had already formed on his back.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, so that’s it,” Ning Zhuo said casually, “No need to rush, I will consider it.”<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that the radiance from the old monster in the stone as he invoked his Earth-Walk technique grew ever stronger, Lord Long hurriedly said: “Friend Shi, how should I contact you?”<br/>
<br/>
After speaking, he controlled the stone sphere and directly sank into the ground, disappearing before everyone’s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo snorted coldly: “Once I’ve made up my mind, I will naturally contact you!”<br/>
<br/>
Earth-Walk Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Cave Master Mo Yuan narrowed his eyes slightly, thinking inwardly: “The old monster in the stone’s use of Earth-Walk Technique was even more effortless than before, containing a true charm of simplifying complexity.”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long remained silent, gazing deep into the ground where the old monster in the stone had just lingered, his expression profound.<br/>
<br/>
“His strength truly had undergone a tremendous improvement!”<br/>
<br/>
He did not speak, and the others did not dare to say a word.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the cultivators silently retreated together in that quiet atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
Midway through their return:<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long suddenly used divine sense to ask Lu Hongtu: “I heard that you gifted a piece of the Western Pure Land to that old monster in the stone?”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu was instantly alarmed!<br/>
<br/>
He was greatly shocked: “At that time, only the old monster in the stone and my three people were present. How could Lord Long know?!”<br/>
<br/>
The more he thought about it, the more suspicious Lu Hongtu became.<br/>
<br/>
Because this very likely indicated that there was an informer among Demon Heart and Blood Shadow.<br/>
<br/>
If that were true, why would Lord Long openly ask him, thus directly exposing the presence of a mole?<br/>
<br/>
“Or could it be that the old monster in the stone leaked the information?”<br/>
<br/>
For a while, Lu Hongtu did not respond, countless thoughts surging in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long snorted coldly: “Cave Master Lu, in this battle your side emerged unscathed, yet achieved many merits.”<br/>
<br/>
“You managed to delay the Golden Halberd Army for a time and even rescued people like Red Vine Doctor.”<br/>
<br/>
“You are truly farsighted and quite impressive!”<br/>
<br/>
Hearing what was behind his words, Lu Hongtu immediately understood Lord Long’s displeasure.<br/>
<br/>
He hastily showed humility: “Our meager achievements were all established under your guidance, Lord Long. The true credit naturally belongs to you, Lord Long.”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long snorted again: “I will not waste words with you. I will ask you one question, and you must answer honestly, or face the consequences!”<br/>
<br/>
“This old monster in the stone... has he advanced to the Soul Formation stage?”<br/>
<br/>
During their underground journey with the old monster in the stone, Lord Long had sensed a trace of Soul Formation aura on the stone sphere.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, his heart shook wildly, but he held his silence.<br/>
<br/>
Once safe, the old monster in the stone’s utterly unceremonious attitude made Lord Long’s suspicions grow heavier and heavier.<br/>
<br/>
Cave Master Mo Yuan almost failed to maintain his composure.<br/>
<br/>
He secretly clenched his teeth, recalling the battle against the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King many years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Although that battle had happened long ago, he remembered it as if it were yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu carefully chose his words: “Soul Formation? Lord Long, what prompts such a thought? Why do you have this kind of suspicion?”<br/>
<br/>
“My gifting of the Western Pure Land was merely because I considered the old monster in the stone’s origins. Such a grand gift holds great meaning for him.”<br/>
<br/>
“Only by offering such a heavy gift could I entice a master of his caliber to join the fight.”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long fixed Lu Hongtu with a deep look, then turned his gaze forward and continued transmitting with divine sense: “You invested a lot of your own resources to convince Nascent Soul and Golden Core level cultivators to participate in this ambush. This is a credit to you.”<br/>
<br/>
“But if you concealed major information, these merits would not offset your crime. You must think this through!”<br/>
<br/>
“What good would it do you to hide it from me?”<br/>
<br/>
“When you face the Dragon King in person, you can try lying then.”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu took a deep breath and finally furrowed his brows, revealing a hint of worry.<br/>
<br/>
After thinking it over, he ultimately decided to speak frankly via divine sense: “Very well.”<br/>
<br/>
“At that time, the reason I gifted the Western Pure Land was because I detected a hint of Soul Formation aura on the old monster in the stone.”<br/>
<br/>
“From this I deduced that even if he hadn’t successfully broken through, he must have been extremely close to the Soul Formation stage.”<br/>
<br/>
“In fact, judging from his age, the old monster in the stone is much older than either of us, isn’t he? His accumulation should be very deep.”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long was silent for a moment, then continued to ask: “After seeing the old monster in the stone this time, what did you sense?”<br/>
<br/>
“Do you think he has reached Soul Formation level now?”<br/>
<br/>
Cave Master Mo Yuan smiled bitterly: “How could I possibly judge that accurately?”<br/>
<br/>
“I am merely a Nascent Soul cultivator. How can I fathom the capabilities of the Soul Formation realm?”<br/>
<br/>
“I can only say what I observed: when we met this time, the Soul Formation aura on the old monster in the stone was far less than before.”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long was extremely forceful, and Cave Master Mo Yuan’s family and foundation, including the entire Six Caves Sect, were all within the Thousand Peaks Forest, so he could not run away.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, after assessing the situation, Cave Master Mo Yuan could only be honest.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing his reply, Lord Long’s pupils contracted sharply, and he could not help pondering in his heart: “The old monster in the stone’s true body was unharmed, yet his aura diminished. Does this indicate that after advancing to the Soul Formation stage, he became even better at controlling his power, hiding his presence more thoroughly?”<br/>
<br/>
No wonder he would think this way.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, Ning Zhuo’s attitude was right there for all to see. On the other hand, all the wondrous methods displayed by the “old monster in the stone” in this ambush surpassed his past self.<br/>
<br/>
“If the old monster in the stone is already Soul Formation, then he naturally has the ability to resist the Dragon King’s divine decree.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thus, in the recent ambush battle, he did not use his full strength at all and remained unscathed. The divine decree’s restraint had no effect.”<br/>
<br/>
“He does not want to return to the Thousand Peaks Forest because he does not want to face the Dragon King, fearing that his true cultivation level would be exposed?”<br/>
<br/>
“But if he is already Soul Formation, he could negotiate with the Dragon King as an equal. Why would he go out of his way to avoid him?”<br/>
<br/>
“Is it that although he succeeded in advancing, he is injured?”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long guessed many things, yet could not figure it out clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, he believed he had a good grasp of the old monster in the stone’s temperament and abilities. The latter’s origins were strange, but he was taciturn, not good at socializing, and though well-grounded in his foundation, he did not seem particularly threatening.<br/>
<br/>
After this battle, Lord Long’s old impression of the old monster in the stone was completely overturned.<br/>
<br/>
“This fellow appears dull on the outside but is cunning inside, loyal on the surface but treacherous at heart!”<br/>
<br/>
“In the entire ambush, he was the one who gained the most. Even the Dragon King owes him a significant reward now.”<br/>
<br/>
“Alas, the situation is too complicated.”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long sighed bitterly in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
In his view, this ambush could be considered a minor, risky victory, but compared to the old monster in the stone’s true cultivation, the outcome of the war was of no importance at all!<br/>
<br/>
“Even if I report this major piece of intelligence, the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King might choose to keep silent?”<br/>
<br/>
Under normal circumstances, the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King would be extremely wary of a second cultivator potentially reaching Soul Formation and would try to probe or suppress him.<br/>
<br/>
But now the Twin Rivers Kingdom’s armies were pressing in, a powerful enemy at their doorstep, so the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King could not dare to start a conflict rashly.<br/>
<br/>
If they fought, the Twin Rivers Kingdom’s side would probably die laughing.<br/>
<br/>
“So, the best strategy is to temporarily unite with the old monster in the stone, combining our strengths to defeat the Twin Rivers Kingdom’s army first.”<br/>
<br/>
“If this is the case, then the reward for the old monster in the stone will likely surpass standard measures!”<br/>
<br/>
After all, the treatment for a Soul Formation cultivator was naturally different from that of a Nascent Soul cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
“Is the old monster in the stone truly Soul Formation or not?”<br/>
<br/>
“Forget it, I’ll leave this problem for the Dragon King to worry about.”<br/>
<br/>
Earth-Walk Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo activated this spell and returned near the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The “old monster in the stone” did not emerge from the ground but completed the handover deep underground.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo withdrew his Earth-Walk Spleen Temple. Sun Lingtong carried the stone sphere back into the Ten-Thousand-Mile Roaming Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo wrapped the Ten-Thousand-Mile Roaming Dragon around his waist like a belt and hurried back to the army.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the two of them traveled through the void using the Mechanical Dragon, returning to the surface.<br/>
<br/>
On the devastated battlefield, Sun Gan wore a grim face as he looked at his heavily wounded troops. He harshly rebuked Shuangjing, Xu Dali, and other officers: “If not for my earlier preparations, ordering the Fire Cloud Camp to march secretly, our losses would have been even more severe!”<br/>
<br/>
After scolding them, he relaxed his expression slightly and said to Liu, Guan, and Zhang: “You three generals fought bravely, capturing a Nascent Soul-level demonic cultivator. That is a great achievement indeed! I will truthfully report this to the court and request commendations for you.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er clasped his hands, humbly thanking him, stating that it was all thanks to Lord Sun Gan’s command.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong stroked his beard without speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei grinned silently.<br/>
<br/>
Nearby, Mulan glanced at the three generals, her eyes showing envy.<br/>
<br/>
After that, Liu Er mentioned Mulan, thanking her for her assistance. At the critical moment, she threw the battle formation’s Red Flower to the three generals’ camp, while she led the Red Flower Camp to support the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan reached out his hand: “General Mulan’s action was wise. It shows she trusted you three generals enough to entrust you with this heavy responsibility.”<br/>
<br/>
“From the outcome, you did not betray that trust. You captured Ma Feitui alive, truly remarkable!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan also studied military strategy, and from his perspective, he fully approved of Mulan’s decision.<br/>
<br/>
In reality, the Red Flower Camp had indeed played a key role. If not for their timely arrival to help ease the pressure brought by Red Vine Doctor and others on the White Jade Camp, the White Jade Camp would likely have collapsed long ago.<br/>
<br/>
After a round of admonitions, Sun Gan ordered a brief rest right on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
The rest time was very short.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back to their own camp, Liu Er and the others discussed Ning Zhuo. They did not know where the strategist was, or whether he could return in time.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as they returned to their camp, they learned from the guards that Ning Zhuo had already returned.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was overjoyed and rushed forward.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo, he spread his arms wide and hurried toward him with abandon.<br/>
<br/>
He ran up to Ning Zhuo and grasped him firmly: “Strategist, fortunately we had you!”<br/>
<br/>
“Strategist, you are safe and sound, that is truly wonderful!”<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong and Zhang Hei also arrived quickly.<br/>
<br/>
When Zhang Hei saw Ning Zhuo, he grinned widely.<br/>
<br/>
Even Guan Hong gave Ning Zhuo a slight smile.<br/>
<br/>
During the ambush, Ning Zhuo displayed powerful combat strength, making the three generals look at him in a new light. The camaraderie formed by defeating a strong enemy also greatly shortened the distance between the three generals and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
“Strategist, Lord Sun Gan specifically mentioned you too.”<br/>
<br/>
“Your divination this time really helped us a lot.”<br/>
<br/>
“According to Lord Sun Gan, he wants you to divine once more!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: “Ah?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei interjected: “Strategist, you’ve made quite a name for yourself this time. Your prophetic poem was too accurate. No wonder even that fellow Sun Gan is tempted!”</div>
