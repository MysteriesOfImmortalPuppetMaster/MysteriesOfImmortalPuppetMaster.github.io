<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Sun and Ning both had their hearts sink slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">They wanted to leave, but were stopped by Lord Long’s voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Lord Long wore a smile on his face as he looked at the large stone sphere on the ground: “Friend Shi, if I am not mistaken, you gained quite a lot of spoils in this battle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“These enemy troops’ equipment was all very fine, whereas our Thousand Peaks Forest side is greatly lacking in that regard.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Why not sell these spoils to our alliance?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Not to mention anything else, just that copy of ‘The Lost Writings of Gao Sheng’ is extremely crucial. Even if it’s incomplete, it is still a treasured military tome, perfectly suited for our army’s use.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo felt slightly relieved; just a moment ago he had thought he was exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In only that short time, a thin layer of sweat had already formed on his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Oh, so that’s it,” Ning Zhuo said casually, “No need to rush, I will consider it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Seeing that the radiance from the old monster in the stone as he invoked his Earth-Walk technique grew ever stronger, Lord Long hurriedly said: “Friend Shi, how should I contact you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After speaking, he controlled the stone sphere and directly sank into the ground, disappearing before everyone’s eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo snorted coldly: “Once I’ve made up my mind, I will naturally contact you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Earth-Walk Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Cave Master Mo Yuan narrowed his eyes slightly, thinking inwardly: “The old monster in the stone’s use of Earth-Walk Technique was even more effortless than before, containing a true charm of simplifying complexity.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Lord Long remained silent, gazing deep into the ground where the old monster in the stone had just lingered, his expression profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“His strength truly had undergone a tremendous improvement!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He did not speak, and the others did not dare to say a word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Thus, the cultivators silently retreated together in that quiet atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Midway through their return:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Lord Long suddenly used divine sense to ask Lu Hongtu: “I heard that you gifted a piece of the Western Pure Land to that old monster in the stone?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Lu Hongtu was instantly alarmed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He was greatly shocked: “At that time, only the old monster in the stone and my three people were present. How could Lord Long know?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The more he thought about it, the more suspicious Lu Hongtu became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Because this very likely indicated that there was an informer among Demon Heart and Blood Shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">If that were true, why would Lord Long openly ask him, thus directly exposing the presence of a mole?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Or could it be that the old monster in the stone leaked the information?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">For a while, Lu Hongtu did not respond, countless thoughts surging in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Lord Long snorted coldly: “Cave Master Lu, in this battle your side emerged unscathed, yet achieved many merits.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“You managed to delay the Golden Halberd Army for a time and even rescued people like Red Vine Doctor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“You are truly farsighted and quite impressive!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Hearing what was behind his words, Lu Hongtu immediately understood Lord Long’s displeasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He hastily showed humility: “Our meager achievements were all established under your guidance, Lord Long. The true credit naturally belongs to you, Lord Long.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Lord Long snorted again: “I will not waste words with you. I will ask you one question, and you must answer honestly, or face the consequences!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“This old monster in the stone... has he advanced to the Soul Formation stage?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">During their underground journey with the old monster in the stone, Lord Long had sensed a trace of Soul Formation aura on the stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">At that time, his heart shook wildly, but he held his silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Once safe, the old monster in the stone’s utterly unceremonious attitude made Lord Long’s suspicions grow heavier and heavier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Cave Master Mo Yuan almost failed to maintain his composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He secretly clenched his teeth, recalling the battle against the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King many years ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Although that battle had happened long ago, he remembered it as if it were yesterday.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Lu Hongtu carefully chose his words: “Soul Formation? Lord Long, what prompts such a thought? Why do you have this kind of suspicion?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“My gifting of the Western Pure Land was merely because I considered the old monster in the stone’s origins. Such a grand gift holds great meaning for him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Only by offering such a heavy gift could I entice a master of his caliber to join the fight.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Lord Long fixed Lu Hongtu with a deep look, then turned his gaze forward and continued transmitting with divine sense: “You invested a lot of your own resources to convince Nascent Soul and Golden Core level cultivators to participate in this ambush. This is a credit to you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“But if you concealed major information, these merits would not offset your crime. You must think this through!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“What good would it do you to hide it from me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“When you face the Dragon King in person, you can try lying then.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Lu Hongtu took a deep breath and finally furrowed his brows, revealing a hint of worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">After thinking it over, he ultimately decided to speak frankly via divine sense: “Very well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“At that time, the reason I gifted the Western Pure Land was because I detected a hint of Soul Formation aura on the old monster in the stone.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“From this I deduced that even if he hadn’t successfully broken through, he must have been extremely close to the Soul Formation stage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“In fact, judging from his age, the old monster in the stone is much older than either of us, isn’t he? His accumulation should be very deep.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Lord Long was silent for a moment, then continued to ask: “After seeing the old monster in the stone this time, what did you sense?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Do you think he has reached Soul Formation level now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Cave Master Mo Yuan smiled bitterly: “How could I possibly judge that accurately?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“I am merely a Nascent Soul cultivator. How can I fathom the capabilities of the Soul Formation realm?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“I can only say what I observed: when we met this time, the Soul Formation aura on the old monster in the stone was far less than before.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Lord Long was extremely forceful, and Cave Master Mo Yuan’s family and foundation, including the entire Six Caves Sect, were all within the Thousand Peaks Forest, so he could not run away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Therefore, after assessing the situation, Cave Master Mo Yuan could only be honest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Hearing his reply, Lord Long’s pupils contracted sharply, and he could not help pondering in his heart: “The old monster in the stone’s true body was unharmed, yet his aura diminished. Does this indicate that after advancing to the Soul Formation stage, he became even better at controlling his power, hiding his presence more thoroughly?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">No wonder he would think this way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">On one hand, Ning Zhuo’s attitude was right there for all to see. On the other hand, all the wondrous methods displayed by the “old monster in the stone” in this ambush surpassed his past self.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“If the old monster in the stone is already Soul Formation, then he naturally has the ability to resist the Dragon King’s divine decree.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Thus, in the recent ambush battle, he did not use his full strength at all and remained unscathed. The divine decree’s restraint had no effect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“He does not want to return to the Thousand Peaks Forest because he does not want to face the Dragon King, fearing that his true cultivation level would be exposed?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“But if he is already Soul Formation, he could negotiate with the Dragon King as an equal. Why would he go out of his way to avoid him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Is it that although he succeeded in advancing, he is injured?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lord Long guessed many things, yet could not figure it out clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Previously, he believed he had a good grasp of the old monster in the stone’s temperament and abilities. The latter’s origins were strange, but he was taciturn, not good at socializing, and though well-grounded in his foundation, he did not seem particularly threatening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After this battle, Lord Long’s old impression of the old monster in the stone was completely overturned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“This fellow appears dull on the outside but is cunning inside, loyal on the surface but treacherous at heart!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“In the entire ambush, he was the one who gained the most. Even the Dragon King owes him a significant reward now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“Alas, the situation is too complicated.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Lord Long sighed bitterly in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">In his view, this ambush could be considered a minor, risky victory, but compared to the old monster in the stone’s true cultivation, the outcome of the war was of no importance at all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“Even if I report this major piece of intelligence, the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King might choose to keep silent?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Under normal circumstances, the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King would be extremely wary of a second cultivator potentially reaching Soul Formation and would try to probe or suppress him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But now the Two Note Kingdom’s armies were pressing in, a powerful enemy at their doorstep, so the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King could not dare to start a conflict rashly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">If they fought, the Two Note Kingdom’s side would probably die laughing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“So, the best strategy is to temporarily unite with the old monster in the stone, combining our strengths to defeat the Two Note Kingdom’s army first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“If this is the case, then the reward for the old monster in the stone will likely surpass standard measures!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After all, the treatment for a Soul Formation cultivator was naturally different from that of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Is the old monster in the stone truly Soul Formation or not?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Forget it, I’ll leave this problem for the Dragon King to worry about.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Earth-Walk Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo activated this spell and returned near the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The “old monster in the stone” did not emerge from the ground but completed the handover deep underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo withdrew his Earth-Walk Spleen Temple. Sun Lingtong carried the stone sphere back into the Ten-Thousand-Mile Roaming Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo wrapped the Ten-Thousand-Mile Roaming Dragon around his waist like a belt and hurried back to the army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Then, the two of them traveled through the void using the Mechanical Dragon, returning to the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">On the devastated battlefield, Sun Gan wore a grim face as he looked at his heavily wounded troops. He harshly rebuked Shuangjing, Xu Dali, and other officers: “If not for my earlier preparations, ordering the Fire Cloud Camp to march secretly, our losses would have been even more severe!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">After scolding them, he relaxed his expression slightly and said to Liu, Guan, and Zhang: “You three generals fought bravely, capturing a Nascent Soul-level demonic cultivator. That is a great achievement indeed! I will truthfully report this to the court and request commendations for you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Liu Er clasped his hands, humbly thanking him, stating that it was all thanks to Lord Sun Gan’s command.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Guan Hong stroked his beard without speaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Zhang Hei grinned silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Nearby, Mu Lan glanced at the three generals, her eyes showing envy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">After that, Liu Er mentioned Mu Lan, thanking her for her assistance. At the critical moment, she threw the battle formation’s Red Flower to the three generals’ camp, while she led the Red Flower Camp to support the White Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Sun Gan reached out his hand: “General Mu Lan’s action was wise. It shows she trusted you three generals enough to entrust you with this heavy responsibility.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“From the outcome, you did not betray that trust. You captured Ma Feitui alive, truly remarkable!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sun Gan also studied military strategy, and from his perspective, he fully approved of Mu Lan’s decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">In reality, the Red Flower Camp had indeed played a key role. If not for their timely arrival to help ease the pressure brought by Red Vine Doctor and others on the White Jade Camp, the White Jade Camp would likely have collapsed long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">After a round of admonitions, Sun Gan ordered a brief rest right on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The rest time was very short.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">On the way back to their own camp, Liu Er and the others discussed Ning Zhuo. They did not know where the strategist was, or whether he could return in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">As soon as they returned to their camp, they learned from the guards that Ning Zhuo had already returned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Liu Er was overjoyed and rushed forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Seeing Ning Zhuo, he spread his arms wide and hurried toward him with abandon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He ran up to Ning Zhuo and grasped him firmly: “Strategist, fortunately we had you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Strategist, you are safe and sound, that is truly wonderful!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Guan Hong and Zhang Hei also arrived quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">When Zhang Hei saw Ning Zhuo, he grinned widely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Even Guan Hong gave Ning Zhuo a slight smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">During the ambush, Ning Zhuo displayed powerful combat strength, making the three generals look at him in a new light. The camaraderie formed by defeating a strong enemy also greatly shortened the distance between the three generals and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“Strategist, Lord Sun Gan specifically mentioned you too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“Your divination this time really helped us a lot.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“According to Lord Sun Gan, he wants you to divine once more!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo: “Ah?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Zhang Hei interjected: “Strategist, you’ve made quite a name for yourself this time. Your prophetic poem was too accurate. No wonder even that fellow Sun Gan is tempted!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
