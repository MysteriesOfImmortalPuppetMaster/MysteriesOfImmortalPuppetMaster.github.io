<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 443: The Light Mountains and Heavy Mist Painting</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Seeing one of their own Golden Core cultivators instantly killed, Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and the others immediately scattered, striving to distance themselves from the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">At this moment, the battle formation fully displayed its mighty power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The formation ingeniously integrated the strength of everyone, including the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang, Ning Zhuo, and nearly three hundred cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Therefore, Zhang Hei's seemingly ordinary attack was actually incredibly powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">If a Golden Core cultivator fought alone, they would be no match at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"General Zhang is so brave!" the soldiers shouted, their morale soaring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">With such tight cohesion, the battle formation operated more smoothly, and the military strength surged. Everything began to cycle positively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The triangular arrow formation was like a prehistoric fierce beast, moving its massive body to start a sweeping advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">An awkward situation arose: the vast forest that Ning Zhuo had previously conjured now became an obstacle to their march.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Boom...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Wherever the Three Generals Camp passed, trees toppled, rocks shattered —their momentum was astonishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Having passed the vulnerable period of changing formation, the Three Generals Camp displayed fierce divine might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and other Golden Core cultivators no longer had their previous arrogant posture; they retreated repeatedly, focusing on long-range attacks and not daring to get close.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Neigh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">A pure white Pegasus as big as a small mountain descended from the sky, stomping down fiercely with its hooves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Red Flower Camp had already formed their formation —a perfect circle, as if a big red flower was blooming on the earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Among all the armies, the Red Flower Camp had the smallest scale of external recruitment. On one hand, their military pay was limited and the treatment was not high, making it difficult to attract others. On the other hand, Mu Lan carefully selected them intentionally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Most of the soldiers in the Red Flower Camp were veterans —the legacy of Old General Mu in the army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Mu Lan inherited them all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">At this moment, surrounding the main general Mu Lan, the core was her personal guards, the middle circle was elite soldiers, the outer circle was veterans, with new soldiers mixed among them —orderly and cooperating tacitly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The battle formation's dharma image condensed, forming a huge red flower that enveloped the entire camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This was the battle formation the Red Flower Camp was best at; even the army's name came from this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Pegasus roared, its hooves continuously trampling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">But the immense power was perfectly resisted by the red flower dharma image.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Except for some casualties at the beginning due to the surprise attack, everyone else in the Red Flower Camp was safe and sound, and their fighting spirit was high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After all, he was just a physician; this was his first time on the battlefield, and his experience was very shallow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhang Chongyi stood beside Mu Lan, frowning tightly, with a heavy expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"A Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator, and he has transformed into his original form, going all out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"But Mu Lan is only at the Golden Core stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">At this time, a subordinate rushed over to convey the latest military intelligence to Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Barbarian Demon Camp was defeated, the White Jade Camp had gained a foothold, the Golden Halberd Army was besieged, the whole army missing, and the Three Generals Camp was being fiercely attacked by several Golden Core cultivators —the situation was critical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Upon hearing this, Zhang Chongyi's heart sank to the bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">When he heard the detailed battle situation of the Three Generals Camp, he couldn't help but exclaim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Ah..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Horse hooves trample the fallen flowers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Wind rises, shadows sink into the sand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"It's coming true; Ning Zhuo's prophetic poem is coming true!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Mu Lan suddenly turned her head and sternly interrupted, "Shut up!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhang Chongyi was startled and immediately fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At this moment, he seemed to see Old General Mu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Mu Lan's attitude did not anger Zhang Chongyi; instead, he felt self-blame and was greatly relieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Mu Lan raised her head, looking at the huge Pegasus trampling with all its might in the sky, and said in a deep voice, "This Pegasus is named Ma Fei-tui, and he has an old grudge with my father."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Years ago, he led his own tribe causing chaos on our country's borders. My father was ordered to suppress the bandits and defeated his entire clan, almost annihilating them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"He escaped by luck, and since then, he has been wandering around, constantly opposing our Mu General's House."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"This time, he must have heard that I took my father's place in the army and actively joined the Thousand Peaks Forest to oppose us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"I know his methods well. With my General's Seal and Flower Formation, it's more than enough to counter him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Pausing for a moment, Mu Lan continued to analyze, "Our army has been under attack for so long, yet there are still only a few enemies. Led by Ma Fei-tui, the only Nascent Soul-level, and several other Golden Core cultivators, each with considerable fame in the Thousand Peaks Forest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"This indicates that only strong cultivators have formed small teams to ambush us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Therefore, the real key lies with the Golden Halberd Army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"To be able to conceal and make the Golden Halberd Army disappear is definitely not something an ordinary Nascent Soul can achieve, and certainly requires more than one Nascent Soul cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"If the Golden Halberd Army remains stalemated with the enemy, then the key to this ambush battle is the White Jade Camp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The White Jade Camp is the best equipped and strongest in strength. More importantly, among them are too many scions of noble families."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"If they are defeated and pursued, the Golden Halberd Army will have to go all out to rescue them!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Mu Lan analyzed the situation extremely thoroughly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Seeing her strategizing demeanor, Zhang Chongyi couldn't help but feel reassured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Golden Halberd Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Gan was in the center of the battle formation, looking around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He saw all around: mountain mist lingering, light and ethereal, draping the mountains with a layer of light ink; contours blurred, seeming to exist or not, floating or sinking, ethereal like a dream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">In the mountain mist, surrounded by mountains, the lush green almost like ink. The mountain shapes were staggered—near and far, high and low—all forming a harmonious blend of light and dark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Looking closely at the mountains, ancient trees were vigorous, rocks rugged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">From afar, the mountains stretched for thousands of miles, connected by clouds and mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The mountains and rocks appearing and disappearing in the mist, along with the undulating layers, gave a feeling of lightness like feathers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">And the ethereal mountain mist was densely accumulated, exuding a profound artistic conception even heavier than the surrounding peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"The 'Light Mountains and Heavy Mist Painting'!" Sun Gan recognized it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This formation diagram, close to the Soul Formation level, was the Six Caves Sect's treasure! It was meticulously crafted over hundreds of years by the Ink Abyss Cave Master, Lu Hongtu, using various Soul Formation-level ink materials. Just the Nascent Soul-level brushes used were as many as six.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">This was Lu Hongtu's greatest trump card!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">War was perilous and fraught with danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Since he was on the battlefield, Lu Hongtu did not intend to hold back, directly employing his strongest array deployment methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Using the "Light Mountains and Heavy Mist Painting" as the array diagram, the four cave masters of the Six Caves Sect occupied the four directions as the array's base. As for the array's core, it was mysterious and unpredictable, hidden deep within the painting; outsiders had never known about it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">After the ambush began, with the help of the array diagram, Lu Hongtu and others attacked with all their might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Nascent Soul-level spells bombarded the Golden Halberd Army one after another, to little effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Golden Halberd Army formed their formation extremely quickly, and their equipment was the most luxurious among the rear army, with absolutely no flaws.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The cultivators of the Six Caves Sect felt helpless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Among them, the Blood Shadow Cave Master, after attacking for a long time without success and even suffering backlash from the nation's power, causing his combat strength to decline, couldn't help but say dejectedly, "Such a tight battle formation —relying on spells alone for long-range attacks cannot break their formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"In my opinion, we still need strong individuals to charge their formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"The Golden Halberd Army is known for counterattacks and sharpness; throughout our Thousand Peaks Forest, perhaps only the current Elephant King could successfully charge their formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Elephant King mentioned by the Blood Shadow Cave Master was the new king of the Pale Barbaric Elephant Herd. He was mighty and robust, terrifyingly strong, and with thick skin and flesh —making him the perfect choice for charging formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Poison Scorpion Cave Master hesitated and said, "Great Cave Master, the Golden Halberd Army has been accumulating the power of their formation all along. Are we just going to let them be?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Once they finish accumulating and activate it, it will surely be earth-shattering, with unparalleled power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"By then, our sect's formation diagram might not be able to conceal them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Lu Hongtu smiled slightly, maintaining a composed demeanor, and transmitted through divine sense, "Wait."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Soon, the four Nascent Soul cultivators of the Six Caves Sect received the latest intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Barbarian Demon Camp was successfully defeated; this was good news. Xu Dali was still alive but was no longer a concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The problem was with the White Jade Camp; Tu Ming actually fled! The dignified High Priest of the Hundred Poisons Tribe —how could he be so incompetent?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">However, after the jade slips recording the battle situation were passed around, the four cave masters were speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Tu Ming's defeat was not unjustified!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The key was, who could have known how many trump cards these scions of noble families had in their hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">This White Jade Camp is really too wealthy!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">For a moment, the three cave masters all felt admiration for the Ink Abyss Cave Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Demon Heart Cave Master even directly flattered, "At the beginning, Great Cave Master, you took the initiative to choose the Golden Halberd Army as our target, specifically picking the hardest bone. Deep inside, I had doubts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Now, these doubts have vanished."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Great Cave Master, your foresight is much clearer and deeper than ours."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Poison Scorpion Cave Master said, "Great Cave Master, the White Jade Camp does not retreat. The Three Generals Camp and Red Flower Camp are insignificant. Are we to forcefully attack the Golden Halberd Army?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Ink Abyss Cave Master slowly shook his head, "We have already poured out all our strength, madly attacking the Golden Halberd Army for a long time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"In this ambush battle, we still have powerful figures who haven't made a move yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The three cultivators suddenly realized, "You mean... Lord Long?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Lu Hongtu smiled slightly, revealing a confident radiance, "Lord Long is the supervising army and also the leader of this ambush."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"The ambush is about to succeed, but it's stuck here at the White Jade Camp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"I don't believe he won't take action!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"If he doesn't act, how will he explain to the Ginseng-beard Dragon King when he returns?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Just as the Ink Abyss Cave Master predicted, in the high clouds, Lord Long sighed deeply, tore off his upper garment, revealing his aged upper body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Then, he took a deep breath; the clouds under his feet dissipated, and he fell straight down toward the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">As he fell, his aura grew stronger and stronger; his body swelled, transforming from a skinny, slightly hunched, and wrinkled old man into a muscular, vigorous middle-aged man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Even his white hair and beard regained a black, glossy sheen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Divine Art —Rejuvenation of the Ginseng Essence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Lord Long stared intently at the White Jade Camp on the ground, watching it grow larger and larger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He slowly extended his left hand, palm facing the White Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The next moment, a dragon's roar sounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Martial Art —Dragon Roar Palm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The dragon's roar shook the heavens, driving the airflow around Lord Long, transforming into a faint flying dragon's phantom, enveloping him as he shot down from the depths of the white clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Not good!" Shuangjing realized something was wrong, hurriedly using techniques to attack the high sky, trying to intercept in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">But whether it was shooting arrows, firing cannons, or using Golden Light Sparrows to entangle, none could stop Lord Long's descent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Boom!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">With a loud bang, Lord Long's palm struck the battle formation's dharma image.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The jade wall as big as a small mountain collapsed with a boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Lord Long continued to fall, crashing into the very center of the White Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The White Jade Camp was thrown into chaos —people and horses overturned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">On the ground, in a huge crater, Lord Long, with his palm pressed to the ground, exhaled a breath of turbid air and withdrew his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Amidst the dust and the neighing of horses, the half-kneeling Lord Long slowly straightened up, looking down on all sides, "Little brats, you've been too lively. Now, meet your death."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
