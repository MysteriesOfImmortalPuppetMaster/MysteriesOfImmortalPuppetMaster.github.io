<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Seeing one of their own Golden Core cultivators instantly killed, Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and the others immediately scattered, striving to distance themselves from the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the battle formation fully displayed its mighty power.<br/>
<br/>
The formation ingeniously integrated the strength of everyone, including the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang, Ning Zhuo, and nearly three hundred cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Zhang Hei's seemingly ordinary attack was actually incredibly powerful.<br/>
<br/>
If a Golden Core cultivator fought alone, they would be no match at all.<br/>
<br/>
"General Zhang is so brave!" the soldiers shouted, their morale soaring.<br/>
<br/>
With such tight cohesion, the battle formation operated more smoothly, and the military strength surged. Everything began to cycle positively.<br/>
<br/>
The triangular arrow formation was like a prehistoric fierce beast, moving its massive body to start a sweeping advance.<br/>
<br/>
An awkward situation arose: the vast forest that Ning Zhuo had previously conjured now became an obstacle to their march.<br/>
<br/>
Boom...<br/>
<br/>
Wherever the Three Generals Camp passed, trees toppled, rocks shattered —their momentum was astonishing.<br/>
<br/>
Having passed the vulnerable period of changing formation, the Three Generals Camp displayed fierce divine might.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and other Golden Core cultivators no longer had their previous arrogant posture; they retreated repeatedly, focusing on long-range attacks and not daring to get close.<br/>
<br/>
Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Neigh!<br/>
<br/>
A pure white Pegasus as big as a small mountain descended from the sky, stomping down fiercely with its hooves.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Camp had already formed their formation —a perfect circle, as if a big red flower was blooming on the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Among all the armies, the Red Flower Camp had the smallest scale of external recruitment. On one hand, their military pay was limited and the treatment was not high, making it difficult to attract others. On the other hand, Mulan carefully selected them intentionally.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the soldiers in the Red Flower Camp were veterans —the legacy of Old General Mu in the army.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan inherited them all.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, surrounding the main general Mulan, the core was her personal guards, the middle circle was elite soldiers, the outer circle was veterans, with new soldiers mixed among them —orderly and cooperating tacitly.<br/>
<br/>
The battle formation's dharma image condensed, forming a huge red flower that enveloped the entire camp.<br/>
<br/>
This was the battle formation the Red Flower Camp was best at; even the army's name came from this.<br/>
<br/>
The Pegasus roared, its hooves continuously trampling.<br/>
<br/>
But the immense power was perfectly resisted by the red flower dharma image.<br/>
<br/>
Except for some casualties at the beginning due to the surprise attack, everyone else in the Red Flower Camp was safe and sound, and their fighting spirit was high.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he was just a physician; this was his first time on the battlefield, and his experience was very shallow.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi stood beside Mulan, frowning tightly, with a heavy expression.<br/>
<br/>
"A Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator, and he has transformed into his original form, going all out!"<br/>
<br/>
"But Mulan is only at the Golden Core stage."<br/>
<br/>
At this time, a subordinate rushed over to convey the latest military intelligence to Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
The Barbarian Demon Camp was defeated, the White Jade Camp had gained a foothold, the Golden Halberd Army was besieged, the whole army missing, and the Three Generals Camp was being fiercely attacked by several Golden Core cultivators —the situation was critical.<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing this, Zhang Chongyi's heart sank to the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
When he heard the detailed battle situation of the Three Generals Camp, he couldn't help but exclaim.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah..."<br/>
<br/>
"Horse hooves trample the fallen flowers."<br/>
<br/>
"Wind rises, shadows sink into the sand!"<br/>
<br/>
"It's coming true; Ning Zhuo's prophetic poem is coming true!"<br/>
<br/>
Mulan suddenly turned her head and sternly interrupted, "Shut up!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi was startled and immediately fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, he seemed to see Old General Mu.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan's attitude did not anger Zhang Chongyi; instead, he felt self-blame and was greatly relieved.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan raised her head, looking at the huge Pegasus trampling with all its might in the sky, and said in a deep voice, "This Pegasus is named Ma Fei-tui, and he has an old grudge with my father."<br/>
<br/>
"Years ago, he led his own tribe causing chaos on our country's borders. My father was ordered to suppress the bandits and defeated his entire clan, almost annihilating them."<br/>
<br/>
"He escaped by luck, and since then, he has been wandering around, constantly opposing our Mu General's House."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, he must have heard that I took my father's place in the army and actively joined the Thousand Peaks Forest to oppose us!"<br/>
<br/>
"I know his methods well. With my General's Seal and Flower Formation, it's more than enough to counter him."<br/>
<br/>
Pausing for a moment, Mulan continued to analyze, "Our army has been under attack for so long, yet there are still only a few enemies. Led by Ma Fei-tui, the only Nascent Soul-level, and several other Golden Core cultivators, each with considerable fame in the Thousand Peaks Forest."<br/>
<br/>
"This indicates that only strong cultivators have formed small teams to ambush us."<br/>
<br/>
"Therefore, the real key lies with the Golden Halberd Army."<br/>
<br/>
"To be able to conceal and make the Golden Halberd Army disappear is definitely not something an ordinary Nascent Soul can achieve, and certainly requires more than one Nascent Soul cultivator."<br/>
<br/>
"If the Golden Halberd Army remains stalemated with the enemy, then the key to this ambush battle is the White Jade Camp."<br/>
<br/>
"The White Jade Camp is the best equipped and strongest in strength. More importantly, among them are too many scions of noble families."<br/>
<br/>
"If they are defeated and pursued, the Golden Halberd Army will have to go all out to rescue them!"<br/>
<br/>
Mulan analyzed the situation extremely thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing her strategizing demeanor, Zhang Chongyi couldn't help but feel reassured.<br/>
<br/>
Golden Halberd Army.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan was in the center of the battle formation, looking around.<br/>
<br/>
He saw all around: mountain mist lingering, light and ethereal, draping the mountains with a layer of light ink; contours blurred, seeming to exist or not, floating or sinking, ethereal like a dream.<br/>
<br/>
In the mountain mist, surrounded by mountains, the lush green almost like ink. The mountain shapes were staggered—near and far, high and low—all forming a harmonious blend of light and dark.<br/>
<br/>
Looking closely at the mountains, ancient trees were vigorous, rocks rugged.<br/>
<br/>
From afar, the mountains stretched for thousands of miles, connected by clouds and mist.<br/>
<br/>
The mountains and rocks appearing and disappearing in the mist, along with the undulating layers, gave a feeling of lightness like feathers.<br/>
<br/>
And the ethereal mountain mist was densely accumulated, exuding a profound artistic conception even heavier than the surrounding peaks.<br/>
<br/>
"The 'Light Mountains and Heavy Mist Painting'!" Sun Gan recognized it.<br/>
<br/>
This formation diagram, close to the Soul Formation level, was the Six Caves Sect's treasure! It was meticulously crafted over hundreds of years by the Ink Abyss Cave Master, Lu Hongtu, using various Soul Formation-level ink materials. Just the Nascent Soul-level brushes used were as many as six.<br/>
<br/>
This was Lu Hongtu's greatest trump card!<br/>
<br/>
War was perilous and fraught with danger.<br/>
<br/>
Since he was on the battlefield, Lu Hongtu did not intend to hold back, directly employing his strongest array deployment methods.<br/>
<br/>
Using the "Light Mountains and Heavy Mist Painting" as the array diagram, the four cave masters of the Six Caves Sect occupied the four directions as the array's base. As for the array's core, it was mysterious and unpredictable, hidden deep within the painting; outsiders had never known about it.<br/>
<br/>
After the ambush began, with the help of the array diagram, Lu Hongtu and others attacked with all their might.<br/>
<br/>
Nascent Soul-level spells bombarded the Golden Halberd Army one after another, to little effect.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Halberd Army formed their formation extremely quickly, and their equipment was the most luxurious among the rear army, with absolutely no flaws.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators of the Six Caves Sect felt helpless.<br/>
<br/>
Among them, the Blood Shadow Cave Master, after attacking for a long time without success and even suffering backlash from the nation's power, causing his combat strength to decline, couldn't help but say dejectedly, "Such a tight battle formation —relying on spells alone for long-range attacks cannot break their formation."<br/>
<br/>
"In my opinion, we still need strong individuals to charge their formation."<br/>
<br/>
"The Golden Halberd Army is known for counterattacks and sharpness; throughout our Thousand Peaks Forest, perhaps only the current Elephant King could successfully charge their formation."<br/>
<br/>
The Elephant King mentioned by the Blood Shadow Cave Master was the new king of the Pale Barbaric Elephant Herd. He was mighty and robust, terrifyingly strong, and with thick skin and flesh —making him the perfect choice for charging formations.<br/>
<br/>
The Poison Scorpion Cave Master hesitated and said, "Great Cave Master, the Golden Halberd Army has been accumulating the power of their formation all along. Are we just going to let them be?"<br/>
<br/>
"Once they finish accumulating and activate it, it will surely be earth-shattering, with unparalleled power."<br/>
<br/>
"By then, our sect's formation diagram might not be able to conceal them."<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu smiled slightly, maintaining a composed demeanor, and transmitted through divine sense, "Wait."<br/>
<br/>
Soon, the four Nascent Soul cultivators of the Six Caves Sect received the latest intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
The Barbarian Demon Camp was successfully defeated; this was good news. Xu Dali was still alive but was no longer a concern.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was with the White Jade Camp; Tu Ming actually fled! The dignified High Priest of the Hundred Poisons Tribe —how could he be so incompetent?<br/>
<br/>
However, after the jade slips recording the battle situation were passed around, the four cave masters were speechless.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming's defeat was not unjustified!<br/>
<br/>
The key was, who could have known how many trump cards these scions of noble families had in their hands.<br/>
<br/>
This White Jade Camp is really too wealthy!!<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the three cave masters all felt admiration for the Ink Abyss Cave Master.<br/>
<br/>
The Demon Heart Cave Master even directly flattered, "At the beginning, Great Cave Master, you took the initiative to choose the Golden Halberd Army as our target, specifically picking the hardest bone. Deep inside, I had doubts."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, these doubts have vanished."<br/>
<br/>
"Great Cave Master, your foresight is much clearer and deeper than ours."<br/>
<br/>
The Poison Scorpion Cave Master said, "Great Cave Master, the White Jade Camp does not retreat. The Three Generals Camp and Red Flower Camp are insignificant. Are we to forcefully attack the Golden Halberd Army?"<br/>
<br/>
The Ink Abyss Cave Master slowly shook his head, "We have already poured out all our strength, madly attacking the Golden Halberd Army for a long time."<br/>
<br/>
"In this ambush battle, we still have powerful figures who haven't made a move yet."<br/>
<br/>
The three cultivators suddenly realized, "You mean... Lord Long?"<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu smiled slightly, revealing a confident radiance, "Lord Long is the supervising army and also the leader of this ambush."<br/>
<br/>
"The ambush is about to succeed, but it's stuck here at the White Jade Camp."<br/>
<br/>
"I don't believe he won't take action!"<br/>
<br/>
"If he doesn't act, how will he explain to the Ginseng-beard Dragon King when he returns?"<br/>
<br/>
Just as the Ink Abyss Cave Master predicted, in the high clouds, Lord Long sighed deeply, tore off his upper garment, revealing his aged upper body.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he took a deep breath; the clouds under his feet dissipated, and he fell straight down toward the ground.<br/>
<br/>
As he fell, his aura grew stronger and stronger; his body swelled, transforming from a skinny, slightly hunched, and wrinkled old man into a muscular, vigorous middle-aged man.<br/>
<br/>
Even his white hair and beard regained a black, glossy sheen.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Art —Rejuvenation of the Ginseng Essence!<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long stared intently at the White Jade Camp on the ground, watching it grow larger and larger.<br/>
<br/>
He slowly extended his left hand, palm facing the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, a dragon's roar sounded.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Art —Dragon Roar Palm!<br/>
<br/>
Roar!<br/>
<br/>
The dragon's roar shook the heavens, driving the airflow around Lord Long, transforming into a faint flying dragon's phantom, enveloping him as he shot down from the depths of the white clouds.<br/>
<br/>
"Not good!" Shuangjing realized something was wrong, hurriedly using techniques to attack the high sky, trying to intercept in advance.<br/>
<br/>
But whether it was shooting arrows, firing cannons, or using Golden Light Sparrows to entangle, none could stop Lord Long's descent.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!!<br/>
<br/>
With a loud bang, Lord Long's palm struck the battle formation's dharma image.<br/>
<br/>
The jade wall as big as a small mountain collapsed with a boom.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long continued to fall, crashing into the very center of the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The White Jade Camp was thrown into chaos —people and horses overturned.<br/>
<br/>
On the ground, in a huge crater, Lord Long, with his palm pressed to the ground, exhaled a breath of turbid air and withdrew his hand.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the dust and the neighing of horses, the half-kneeling Lord Long slowly straightened up, looking down on all sides, "Little brats, you've been too lively. Now, meet your death."</div>
