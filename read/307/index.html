<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After suffering the attack, the main hall had suddenly developed a crack on its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The crack quickly spread, almost extending from the base to the roof!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This time, the cultivators within the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities also felt the impact of the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The pavilion shook violently, as if the earth itself was trembling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Once the tremors subsided, the frightened cultivators were shocked to find that the restrictions suppressing them had weakened significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"My connection with the outside world has been largely restored!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Though there are still restrictions, my cultivation has returned to the Foundation Establishment level!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Not only that, but I can also use the artifacts I carry!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">At this moment, the Golden Core cultivators were overjoyed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was cornered.  It shrunk into its shell, enduring the strikes of the fire whip as it grew weaker. As the spirit of the Lava Immortal Palace, it was closely linked to the palace. With the palace suffering such a heavy blow, it was naturally affected as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">However, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was delighted! It discovered that it could secretly send messages to every cultivator in the trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">It quickly sent a message to Meng Chong, warning him of the drastic changes and that Yang Chanyu was about to recover her combat strength to the Foundation Establishment level, urging him to retreat quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Meng Chong was startled and instinctively chose to heed the warning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Yang Chanyu snorted coldly, appearing hesitant: "He runs fast! Should I chase him down?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong shook his head: "Not good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Something drastic must have happened outside. Perhaps a beast tide has already breached the Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"The Lava Immortal Palace is like a spent force, showing signs of decline."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"The restrictions are gradually failing and our advantage is rapidly diminishing. We must quickly rendezvous with Ning Zhuo!" Sun Lingtong was worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">His cultivation had returned to the Foundation Establishment level, but even with Yang Chanyu, the two of them only had a slight advantage in pursuing Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Meng Chong had developed the Wild Sprint Thunderclap deeply, and with his innate talent, he could already fight at a higher level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"If the situation continues to worsen and Golden Core level power is restored, Meng Chong will be of no concern."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Little Zhuo, where are you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"With the restrictions weakened, can you sense me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong had the Life Hanging by a Thread planted by Ning Zhuo on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">As if hearing Sun Lingtong's call, Ning Zhuo, in another Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, stopped in his tracks, a gleam flashing in his eyes: "The restrictions have weakened?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo secretly activated the Life Hanging by a Thread and suddenly his senses heightened, detecting Sun Lingtong's location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Wonderful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Now with the correct direction understood, he immediately quickened his pace and pushed open the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">[...]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Cough, cough, cough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Zheng Danlian was half-kneeling on the ground, half-bent over, and spitting out mouthfuls of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Three cultivators surrounded him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The surrounding mechanical traps had all been destroyed by the three, leaving Zheng Danlian with no chance to utilize them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zheng Danlian had tried to retreat, but his various methods were either seen through or neutralized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Book Master had a broad perspective, Song Fuli had a wealth of techniques, and the Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple was the main attacker. He displayed his innate talent, the Purple Lightning Force, with every move carrying an attack of purple lightning, causing Zheng Danlian to suffer greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The drastic changes also affected this battle group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The cultivators all sensed the weakening of the restrictions, and they all regained some of their strength, with the maximum cultivation power only suppressed to the Foundation Establishment level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Is this the mechanism change naturally part of the third stage trial? Or is the Lava Immortal Palace unable to hold on?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"I'm afraid the situation outside isn't good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Let's finish him off quickly and decide the position of the palace master. Otherwise, if we drag on too long and the Immortal Palace gets too damaged, the value of becoming the palace master will be greatly diminished."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The three finished exchanging messages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple launched a decisive strike!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The purple lightning was fierce and domineering, blasting forward -- but Zheng Danlian blocked it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">This surprised the three cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">As the dust settled, Zheng Danlian remained very weak, half-kneeling on the ground, but in front of him suddenly appeared a mechanical black snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Hehehe, hahahaha!" Zheng Danlian, with disheveled hair, slowly raised his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">His pupils were bloodshot, looking at the mechanical black snake with fanaticism and obsession: "Finally, I can be with you again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Night Rain Demon Weapon!" The faces of the Book Master and the others changed instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Previously, during the Golden Core melee in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, it was this mechanical scythe that instantly killed the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace, its ferocity reaching its peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The three cultivators did not expect that Zheng Danlian, at the Foundation Establishment level, could wield this mechanical scythe!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">For them, with only Foundation Establishment cultivation, it was difficult to activate a magical artifact. Additionally, even if they managed to use the magical artifact, they would only be able to exert a fraction of its power, making its usage less effective than using a regular artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Die, you all must die!!" Zheng Danlian screamed with a face full of hatred and madness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The mechanical black snake hissed, its figure suddenly disappearing from its original spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Be careful!" The Book Master quickly warned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But in the next moment, the mechanical black snake appeared in front of the Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple, biting down on his arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">With a light force and a cracking sound, the mechanical black snake bit off the Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core's arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core retreated rapidly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Blood gushed from the severed arm!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His face was full of shock: "Be careful, this is no ordinary Night Rain Demon Weapon!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Zheng Danlian laughed wildly: "Hahaha, kill them!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The mechanical black snake lunged at the Book Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Book Master's face was solemn: "I'll hold it off!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Alright!" Song Fuli directly charged at Zheng Danlian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">[...]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">In the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit continuously sent messages to Meng Chong, guiding him along the correct path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Before long, Meng Chong pushed open a door and saw, across the Secret Pavilion, the last remaining Golden Core cultivator of the Meng family also entering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Young Master Meng Chong! I finally found you!!" The Meng family's Golden Core cultivator was overjoyed to see Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Meng Chong nodded at him, increasingly convinced that the information was correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Quickly tell me, where are the two from the Void Sect?" Meng Chong asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Meng family's Golden Core cultivator looked puzzled: "Huh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Meng Chong waved him off: "I'm not asking you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit paused, quickly contemplating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">It indeed also wanted to weaken Ning Zhuo's forces and ultimately eliminate him. Clearly, dealing with the two from the Void Sect, Sun and Yang, in advance would be a significant blow to Ning Zhuo's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"But, do Meng Chong and the Meng family's Golden Core really have an advantage against Ning Zhuo and Sun Yang?" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was uncertain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Although it could send messages inside, that was its limit. The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit still couldn't lie or expose the trial cultivators' information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">It simply continued to send messages to Meng Chong, directing him to proceed, mapping out the safest route for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Meng Chong, however, believed that following the information would lead him to catch up with Sun and Yang. Excited at that prospect, he charged ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Young master, wait for me." The Meng family's Golden Core cultivator hurriedly followed behind Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit wore a worried expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">It realized that Ning Zhuo was rapidly approaching Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Is it the Life Hanging by a Thread's sensing ability?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gritted its teeth and sent a message to Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Zhu Xuanji's expression changed slightly upon hearing it: "Choose the door on the left? This message is suspicious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"But never mind, I want to see what's going on!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">With great skill and courage, Zhu Xuanji chose to follow the message, quickening his pace, passing through several Secret Pavilions, and encountered...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Sun Lingtong, Yang Chanyu!" Zhu Xuanji took a deep breath and chuckled, "Very well, very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Sun Lingtong cursed: "Such bad luck."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Yang Chanyu squinted: "Lord Zhu, don't be overconfident. Even with the weakened restrictions, we both have Foundation Establishment level combat power. We are two, you are one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">As she spoke, she transmitted a message, asking Sun Lingtong: "What now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong pursed his lips: "What else? Retreat for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Brother Ning, it's your turn to choose the door next. Which one do you think we should take?" Zheng Shuangjun asked with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">A battle had just concluded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Jiufan and Zheng Shuangjun had joined forces to slay the Scarlet Flame Beast guarding the area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The Foundation Establishment level beast was initially challenging for Zheng Shuangjun and Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">But with the restrictions weakened, the two cultivators suddenly regained their Foundation Establishment level, changing the battle's outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Jiufan was dismantling the Scarlet Flame Beast, carefully collecting its hide, tendons, bones, and blood. He kept some for himself and shared the rest with Zheng Shuangjun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">After meeting, they had been progressing together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">While gathering the spoils, Ning Jiufan said, "It doesn't matter which door we choose. Hmm, the door straight ahead looks pleasing to me, let's go with that one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zheng Shuangjun nodded: "Alright."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Before he finished speaking, the door ahead was suddenly pushed open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Meng Chong charged in with high spirits, followed closely by the Meng family's Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The two groups stared at each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">After a moment of silence, both sides quickly reacted, assuming battle stances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Zheng Shuangjun and Ning Jiufan faced off against Meng Chong and the Meng family's Golden Core!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">[...]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo's pace quickened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Something's wrong!" As he continued to sense, he realized that Sun Lingtong's position hadn't moved for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Now, with the restrictions weakened, the cultivators' strength had partially returned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The difficulty of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities had significantly decreased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Boss Sun shouldn't be stuck in one place for so long. He might have encountered a formidable enemy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"I must reunite with him quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Hold on, Boss!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">[...]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Under the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's influence, two battles had sparked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Now, the earlier battle had reached its conclusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The Book Master was lying on the ground, covered in blood, panting heavily, with only his upper body remaining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">He stared fixedly at the mechanical black snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The mechanical black snake was swallowing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">It was swallowing the lower half of the Book Master's body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"To think I was defeated by a weapon!" The Book Master was shaking his head, his face full of desolation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">He weakly spoke: "I concede."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">In the next moment, a teleportation circle appeared out of thin air, quickly engulfing him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Zheng Danlian hunched forward while looking at Song Fuli: "Now, only you are left."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Hehehe, hahaha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"Snake, go eat him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Damn it!" Song Fuli, severely injured, saw the mechanical black snake lunging at him. He pushed his palms forward, releasing a cloud of smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The mechanical black snake plunged into the smoke, missing its target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Its body was covered in resilient cloud threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The mechanical black snake struggled wildly, breaking the threads one by one, quickly regaining its freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">In the midst of this, Song Fuli had seized this opportunity and had desperately fled, crashing through a door into the next pavilion room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"You can't escape! Snake, let's chase!! Hahaha!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Zheng Danlian's former despondency had vanished, replaced by glowing excitement that could be seen on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">After regaining the use of his tools, he had consumed many pills and healed up most of his injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The battle thereafter finished swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The related information reached the ears of other cultivators —</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Zheng Danlian has defeated the Book Master, Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple, and Song Fuli. The Book Master and Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple are eliminated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
