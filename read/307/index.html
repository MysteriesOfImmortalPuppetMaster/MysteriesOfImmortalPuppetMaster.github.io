<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Crack.<br/>
<br/>
After suffering the attack, the main hall had suddenly developed a crack on its surface.<br/>
<br/>
The crack quickly spread, almost extending from the base to the roof!<br/>
<br/>
This time, the cultivators within the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities also felt the impact of the attack.<br/>
<br/>
The pavilion shook violently, as if the earth itself was trembling.<br/>
<br/>
Once the tremors subsided, the frightened cultivators were shocked to find that the restrictions suppressing them had weakened significantly.<br/>
<br/>
"My connection with the outside world has been largely restored!"<br/>
<br/>
"Though there are still restrictions, my cultivation has returned to the Foundation Establishment level!"<br/>
<br/>
"Not only that, but I can also use the artifacts I carry!"<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the Golden Core cultivators were overjoyed!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was cornered.  It shrunk into its shell, enduring the strikes of the fire whip as it grew weaker. As the spirit of the Lava Immortal Palace, it was closely linked to the palace. With the palace suffering such a heavy blow, it was naturally affected as well.<br/>
<br/>
However, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was delighted! It discovered that it could secretly send messages to every cultivator in the trial.<br/>
<br/>
It quickly sent a message to Meng Chong, warning him of the drastic changes and that Yang Chanyu was about to recover her combat strength to the Foundation Establishment level, urging him to retreat quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong was startled and instinctively chose to heed the warning.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu snorted coldly, appearing hesitant: "He runs fast! Should I chase him down?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shook his head: "Not good!"<br/>
<br/>
"Something drastic must have happened outside. Perhaps a beast tide has already breached the Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
"The Lava Immortal Palace is like a spent force, showing signs of decline."<br/>
<br/>
"The restrictions are gradually failing and our advantage is rapidly diminishing. We must quickly rendezvous with Ning Zhuo!" Sun Lingtong was worried.<br/>
<br/>
His cultivation had returned to the Foundation Establishment level, but even with Yang Chanyu, the two of them only had a slight advantage in pursuing Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong had developed the Wild Sprint Thunderclap deeply, and with his innate talent, he could already fight at a higher level.<br/>
<br/>
"If the situation continues to worsen and Golden Core level power is restored, Meng Chong will be of no concern."<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, where are you?"<br/>
<br/>
"With the restrictions weakened, can you sense me?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had the Life-Hanging Thread planted by Ning Zhuo on him.<br/>
<br/>
As if hearing Sun Lingtong's call, Ning Zhuo, in another Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, stopped in his tracks, a gleam flashing in his eyes: "The restrictions have weakened?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo secretly activated the Life-Hanging Thread and suddenly his senses heightened, detecting Sun Lingtong's location.<br/>
<br/>
"Wonderful!"<br/>
<br/>
Now with the correct direction understood, he immediately quickened his pace and pushed open the door.<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
"Cough, cough, cough."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian was half-kneeling on the ground, half-bent over, and spitting out mouthfuls of blood.<br/>
<br/>
Three cultivators surrounded him.<br/>
<br/>
The surrounding mechanical traps had all been destroyed by the three, leaving Zheng Danlian with no chance to utilize them.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian had tried to retreat, but his various methods were either seen through or neutralized.<br/>
<br/>
The Book Master had a broad perspective, Song Fuli had a wealth of techniques, and the Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple was the main attacker. He displayed his innate talent, the Purple Lightning Force, with every move carrying an attack of purple lightning, causing Zheng Danlian to suffer greatly.<br/>
<br/>
The drastic changes also affected this battle group.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators all sensed the weakening of the restrictions, and they all regained some of their strength, with the maximum cultivation power only suppressed to the Foundation Establishment level.<br/>
<br/>
"Is this the mechanism change naturally part of the third stage trial? Or is the Lava Immortal Palace unable to hold on?"<br/>
<br/>
"I'm afraid the situation outside isn't good."<br/>
<br/>
"Let's finish him off quickly and decide the position of the palace master. Otherwise, if we drag on too long and the Immortal Palace gets too damaged, the value of becoming the palace master will be greatly diminished."<br/>
<br/>
The three finished exchanging messages.<br/>
<br/>
The Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple launched a decisive strike!<br/>
<br/>
The purple lightning was fierce and domineering, blasting forward -- but Zheng Danlian blocked it.<br/>
<br/>
This surprised the three cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
As the dust settled, Zheng Danlian remained very weak, half-kneeling on the ground, but in front of him suddenly appeared a mechanical black snake.<br/>
<br/>
"Hehehe, hahahaha!" Zheng Danlian, with disheveled hair, slowly raised his head.<br/>
<br/>
His pupils were bloodshot, looking at the mechanical black snake with fanaticism and obsession: "Finally, I can be with you again."<br/>
<br/>
"Night Rain Demon Weapon!" The faces of the Book Master and the others changed instantly.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, during the Golden Core melee in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, it was this mechanical scythe that instantly killed the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace, its ferocity reaching its peak.<br/>
<br/>
The three cultivators did not expect that Zheng Danlian, at the Foundation Establishment level, could wield this mechanical scythe!<br/>
<br/>
For them, with only Foundation Establishment cultivation, it was difficult to activate a magical artifact. Additionally, even if they managed to use the magical artifact, they would only be able to exert a fraction of its power, making its usage less effective than using a regular artifact.<br/>
<br/>
"Die, you all must die!!" Zheng Danlian screamed with a face full of hatred and madness.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical black snake hissed, its figure suddenly disappearing from its original spot.<br/>
<br/>
"Be careful!" The Book Master quickly warned.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, the mechanical black snake appeared in front of the Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple, biting down on his arm.<br/>
<br/>
With a light force and a cracking sound, the mechanical black snake bit off the Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core's arm.<br/>
<br/>
The Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core retreated rapidly!<br/>
<br/>
Blood gushed from the severed arm!!<br/>
<br/>
His face was full of shock: "Be careful, this is no ordinary Night Rain Demon Weapon!"<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian laughed wildly: "Hahaha, kill them!"<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical black snake lunged at the Book Master.<br/>
<br/>
The Book Master's face was solemn: "I'll hold it off!"<br/>
<br/>
"Alright!" Song Fuli directly charged at Zheng Danlian.<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
In the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit continuously sent messages to Meng Chong, guiding him along the correct path.<br/>
<br/>
Before long, Meng Chong pushed open a door and saw, across the Secret Pavilion, the last remaining Golden Core cultivator of the Meng family also entering.<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Meng Chong! I finally found you!!" The Meng family's Golden Core cultivator was overjoyed to see Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong nodded at him, increasingly convinced that the information was correct.<br/>
<br/>
"Quickly tell me, where are the two from the Void Sect?" Meng Chong asked.<br/>
<br/>
The Meng family's Golden Core cultivator looked puzzled: "Huh?"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong waved him off: "I'm not asking you."<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit paused, quickly contemplating.<br/>
<br/>
It indeed also wanted to weaken Ning Zhuo's forces and ultimately eliminate him. Clearly, dealing with the two from the Void Sect, Sun and Yang, in advance would be a significant blow to Ning Zhuo's side.<br/>
<br/>
"But, do Meng Chong and the Meng family's Golden Core really have an advantage against Ning Zhuo and Sun Yang?" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
Although it could send messages inside, that was its limit. The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit still couldn't lie or expose the trial cultivators' information.<br/>
<br/>
It simply continued to send messages to Meng Chong, directing him to proceed, mapping out the safest route for him.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong, however, believed that following the information would lead him to catch up with Sun and Yang. Excited at that prospect, he charged ahead.<br/>
<br/>
"Young master, wait for me." The Meng family's Golden Core cultivator hurriedly followed behind Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit wore a worried expression.<br/>
<br/>
It realized that Ning Zhuo was rapidly approaching Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
"Is it the Life-Hanging Thread's sensing ability?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gritted its teeth and sent a message to Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's expression changed slightly upon hearing it: "Choose the door on the left? This message is suspicious."<br/>
<br/>
"But never mind, I want to see what's going on!"<br/>
<br/>
With great skill and courage, Zhu Xuanji chose to follow the message, quickening his pace, passing through several Secret Pavilions, and encountered...<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Lingtong, Yang Chanyu!" Zhu Xuanji took a deep breath and chuckled, "Very well, very well."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong cursed: "Such bad luck."<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu squinted: "Lord Zhu, don't be overconfident. Even with the weakened restrictions, we both have Foundation Establishment level combat power. We are two, you are one."<br/>
<br/>
As she spoke, she transmitted a message, asking Sun Lingtong: "What now?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong pursed his lips: "What else? Retreat for now."<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Ning, it's your turn to choose the door next. Which one do you think we should take?" Zheng Shuangjun asked with a smile.<br/>
<br/>
A battle had just concluded.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan and Zheng Shuangjun had joined forces to slay the Scarlet Flame Beast guarding the area.<br/>
<br/>
The Foundation Establishment level beast was initially challenging for Zheng Shuangjun and Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
But with the restrictions weakened, the two cultivators suddenly regained their Foundation Establishment level, changing the battle's outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was dismantling the Scarlet Flame Beast, carefully collecting its hide, tendons, bones, and blood. He kept some for himself and shared the rest with Zheng Shuangjun.<br/>
<br/>
After meeting, they had been progressing together.<br/>
<br/>
While gathering the spoils, Ning Jiufan said, "It doesn't matter which door we choose. Hmm, the door straight ahead looks pleasing to me, let's go with that one."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun nodded: "Alright."<br/>
<br/>
Before he finished speaking, the door ahead was suddenly pushed open.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong charged in with high spirits, followed closely by the Meng family's Golden Core cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
The two groups stared at each other.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment of silence, both sides quickly reacted, assuming battle stances.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun and Ning Jiufan faced off against Meng Chong and the Meng family's Golden Core!<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's pace quickened.<br/>
<br/>
"Something's wrong!" As he continued to sense, he realized that Sun Lingtong's position hadn't moved for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Now, with the restrictions weakened, the cultivators' strength had partially returned.<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities had significantly decreased.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss Sun shouldn't be stuck in one place for so long. He might have encountered a formidable enemy!"<br/>
<br/>
"I must reunite with him quickly."<br/>
<br/>
"Hold on, Boss!"<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
Under the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's influence, two battles had sparked.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the earlier battle had reached its conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
The Book Master was lying on the ground, covered in blood, panting heavily, with only his upper body remaining.<br/>
<br/>
He stared fixedly at the mechanical black snake.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical black snake was swallowing.<br/>
<br/>
It was swallowing the lower half of the Book Master's body!<br/>
<br/>
"To think I was defeated by a weapon!" The Book Master was shaking his head, his face full of desolation.<br/>
<br/>
He weakly spoke: "I concede."<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, a teleportation circle appeared out of thin air, quickly engulfing him.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian hunched forward while looking at Song Fuli: "Now, only you are left."<br/>
<br/>
"Hehehe, hahaha."<br/>
<br/>
"Snake, go eat him!"<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it!" Song Fuli, severely injured, saw the mechanical black snake lunging at him. He pushed his palms forward, releasing a cloud of smoke.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical black snake plunged into the smoke, missing its target.<br/>
<br/>
Its body was covered in resilient cloud threads.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical black snake struggled wildly, breaking the threads one by one, quickly regaining its freedom.<br/>
<br/>
In the midst of this, Song Fuli had seized this opportunity and had desperately fled, crashing through a door into the next pavilion room.<br/>
<br/>
"You can't escape! Snake, let's chase!! Hahaha!" <br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian's former despondency had vanished, replaced by glowing excitement that could be seen on his face.<br/>
<br/>
After regaining the use of his tools, he had consumed many pills and healed up most of his injuries.<br/>
<br/>
The battle thereafter finished swiftly.<br/>
<br/>
The related information reached the ears of other cultivators ‚Äî<br/>
<br/>
"Zheng Danlian has defeated the Book Master, Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple, and Song Fuli. The Book Master and Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple are eliminated!"<br/>
