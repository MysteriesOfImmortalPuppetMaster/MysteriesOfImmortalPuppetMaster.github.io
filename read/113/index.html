<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 113: Ning Xiaoren and the Suspended Thread</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Uncle Xiaoren, that's the situation," Ning Zhuo reported to Ning Xiaoren after returning to the family, detailing what Zheng had mentioned about exploring the Immortal Palace. "I thought it would be inappropriate to agree on the spot since I am from the Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"That's why I'm seeking your opinion. Should I agree or not?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"You trust me enough to share such an important matter and seek my decision. It makes me very happy!" Ning Xiaoren patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder, letting out a long sigh with a pleased expression. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He was genuinely gratified by Ning Zhuo's sensible and considerate behavior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">In reality, Ning Xiaoren was already aware of the decision agreed upon by the three families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">It was inevitable that Ning Zhuo would be sent to participate. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">On one hand, maintaining Ning family's influence in the three-family alliance required continuous contribution to ensure the current share distribution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">On the other hand, according to the agreed contract, Ning Zhuo's complete combat power necessitated his participation; otherwise, it wouldn't make sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo actually had no choice in the matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Whether he agreed or not, he had to agree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Of course, Ning Xiaoren would not say this outright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">What pleased Ning Xiaoren the most was Ning Zhuo's decision to consult him rather than making the decision alone, demonstrating a level of obedience that Ning Xiaoren found very satisfying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He felt that the efforts and costs he had invested in winning Ning Zhuo over were entirely worthwhile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Since everyone values you so highly, you should go," Ning Xiaoren said. "Perform well, and soon the Ning family will have its third peak-level Third Layer cultivator. This time, you represent our Ning family alone. Don't be afraid; remember, the entire Ning family is your backing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After a pause, Ning Xiaoren continued, "Although you are appointed as the leader, you won't have fellow clansmen to support you directly. However, Zheng family cultivators should willingly align with us. It's the Zhou family you need to be wary of. They have the largest numbers and may not follow your commands. Be prepared for this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo showed a look of surprise and was genuinely a bit astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">From Ning Xiaoren's words, Ning Zhuo quickly realized that this young family head had a keen sense of power and foresight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">His analysis of the internal dynamics of the three-family alliance was spot on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Although the action had not officially started, he had already foreseen the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This coincided perfectly with Ning Zhuo's own expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">On further reflection, it made sense that Ning Xiaoren possessed such insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"The Ning family has always implemented a policy of strengthening the main lineage while weakening the branches. Ning Xiaoren actively suppresses many collateral lines, whereas the patriarch remains in the background. Only when matters escalate beyond control does he step in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Ning Xiaoren has always been on the front lines. Without the ability to navigate power struggles, how could he have held the position of young patriarch for so many years?" Ning Zhuo bowed and saluted, saying, "Uncle Xiaoren, I will remember your advice!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"If such a situation arises, what should I do?" Ning Zhuo asked with a sincere and innocent expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Xiaoren pondered and said, "On one hand, you need to take good care of the Zheng family cultivators, giving them tangible support. On the other hand, you need to achieve success. If you can lead them deep into the Lava Immortal Palace and achieve breakthroughs, others will naturally rally around you. Even the Zhou family will acknowledge your strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo nodded, "I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Then, if I lead them to a successful exploration, will there be any rewards from the family?" The young patriarch was taken aback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Since taking his position, he had never encountered such a straightforward request.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">A surge of disgust and resentment welled up in Ning Xiaoren's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">However, he maintained his smile and pointed at Ning Zhuo, "Aren't you already quite wealthy? I heard that you're even generous enough to share spiritual food with others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Xiaoren spoke casually, as if it were no big deal, but deep down, he was very wary of Ning Zhuo's actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">What did this signify? It indicated forming factions and engaging in favoritism!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">If Ning Zhuo were not in the Qi Refining stage but in the Foundation Establishment stage, and if he were not so valued by the Ning family, Ning Xiaoren would have acted against him long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo had prepared his response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He scratched his head and said, "Uncle Xiaoren, they are my classmates, and I genuinely want to help them. Especially Ning Chen and Ning Yong, who have been through life and death with me. I help them, and they help me. We trust each other. As for money, I've never felt particularly wealthy. I never think I have enough money!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Xiaoren deeply related to this sentiment; he had never felt he had enough money either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo's love for money seemed reasonable to Ning Xiaoren, and he never doubted it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Intelligence reports indicated that Ning Zhuo had lived a poor life for many years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Such an upbringing would certainly make him frugal and create a pathological desire and obsession for resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Xiaoren gave a vague answer: the family would not forget Ning Zhuo's contributions and would definitely reward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo had anticipated this response and immediately pressed on, "Uncle Xiaoren, I have read Zhou family's 'On Spirituality,' and it was very enlightening. Does our family have similar texts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Xiaoren chuckled, "Of course, we do! Our Ning family was an old and powerful cultivation family in the Northern Wind Kingdom, much stronger than the Zhou family, almost dominating an entire city. Our family has a long history and even produced Nascent Soul level individuals. Unfortunately, during the Northern Wind Kingdom era, we were betrayed and had to move the entire clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Little Zhuo, if you perform outstandingly this time and bring great honor to our Ning family, I will risk my reputation to petition for you to access the relevant secret texts and tomes for study." Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly and said, "Uncle Xiaoren, I heard that Ning Xiaohui used the Flowing Cloud Symbol, which greatly enhanced her strength. Can I also have one?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">A sharp glint flashed in Ning Xiaoren's eyes, and his feelings of disgust surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He thought to himself, "The Flowing Cloud Symbol! Even I, the young patriarch, can't afford to use it. What right or face do you, a mere branch family member, have to ask for it?" Ning Xiaoren suppressed his disdain and anger, speaking kindly, "The Flowing Cloud Symbol is a spiritual talisman, containing a trace of heaven and earth's spirituality, making it extremely rare. The entire clan has only one, given to Ning Xiaohui in a special emergency case. Even I don't dare to hope for it. However, you still have a chance, Little Zhuo! As long as you break through the palace's barriers and make contributions so great that the entire clan is proud of you and acknowledges you, then it will be natural for you to use this precious symbol."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo appeared encouraged and said, "Uncle Xiaoren, I'm a bit short on spirit stones recently. I've almost used up the ones I had. Could you lend me some spirit stones?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Xiaoren took a deep breath, maintaining his smile with effort, "The three-family subsidy was just distributed a few days ago, wasn't it? Little Zhuo, have you used it all so quickly? How about this: I'll personally approve an advance on your subsidy. How does that sound?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"That would be great! Thank you, Uncle Xiaoren." Ning Zhuo showed a look of great joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Xiaoren couldn't help but advise, "Little Zhuo, you shouldn't spend money so lavishly. Some spiritual foods aren't necessary; pills are cheaper and also very effective."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo looked as if he was taking the advice to heart, "Alright, Uncle Xiaoren, I'll eat less from now on." He glanced at the top of Ning Xiaoren's head, where a human life thread had already descended, connecting him to Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">This back-and-forth was deliberately prolonged by Ning Zhuo to plant the embryonic form of his divine ability in Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He found that although the human life thread was difficult to connect in combat, it could be maintained for a long time once planted in daily life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">As for how long it could last, Ning Zhuo hadn't yet tested its limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In any case, through this encounter, Ning Xiaoren also became an object of his divine ability's connection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Watching Ning Zhuo's departing figure, Ning Xiaoren fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo possessed abundant cultivation resources, and crucially, he was willing to share them! In a short time, he had gathered a group of people around him, almost all of whom were from branch families. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Whether or not this was intentional on Ning Zhuo's part, this behavior had already aroused Ning Xiaoren's vigilance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Ning family's branch lines had always lacked a unifying figure, causing them to remain scattered over the years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo's emergence filled this void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He displayed peak third-level cultivation, making a big impression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The family's public testing of his potential earned him widespread acclaim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Now, everyone in the clan knew that Ning Zhuo had potential, even if it hadn't been fully measured yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">His future seemed bright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">People naturally gravitate towards benefits and avoid harm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Many people thought this way: by investing in Ning Zhuo while he was still weak, once he soared to great heights in the future, he would remember their kindness and give them a helping hand, which would surely bring great returns!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Xiaoren was well aware that the branches of the Ning family had already begun to revolve slowly around Ning Zhuo as the central point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"The problem lies in Ning Xiaohui being injured, leaving the main lineage unable to hold down the reform team."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Ning Zhuo has already begun to gather momentum. If he continues to succeed, the influence around him will only grow stronger and stronger. Fortunately, the difficulty of the Lava Immortal Palace is extremely high, with numerous obstacles. In the short term, even if Ning Zhuo can pass through, it will be at most one or two gates."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"This time should be enough for Ning Xiaohui to recover and join the exploration of the palace, regaining the power she lost from Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Thinking of this, Ning Xiaoren's slightly tense mood relaxed a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo returned to his uncle's house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Wang Lan brought over some fruit, seizing the opportunity to ask, "Little Zhuo, I heard you just came back from the young patriarch. Did you...?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Oh, don't worry, Aunt. I specifically asked Uncle Xiaoren to plead for my uncle," Ning Zhuo replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Wang Lan immediately showed a look of joy, "Then, did the young patriarch say when he would release your uncle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo shook his head, "Uncle Xiaoren didn't mention that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Aunt, I need to start my cultivation now," Ning Zhuo said, motioning to close the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Wang Lan suppressed her anger and forced a smile, "Alright, Little Zhuo, you go ahead and cultivate. I'll leave now, I'll leave now!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
