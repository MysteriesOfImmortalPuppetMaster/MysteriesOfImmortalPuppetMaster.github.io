<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The sparring match between Tie Zheng and Ao Pan drew the attention of nearly everyone present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Both were Golden Core-level cultivators, though the Formation here suppressed their cultivation, reducing their displayed power to the peak of Foundation Establishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Yet their actual combat prowess remained among the highest of all participants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">One was a Martial Cultivator, the other a Body Cultivator, making them naturally suited for the Profound Armor Cave's Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Including Lu Zeng, all three Golden Core cultivators were potential victors. Perhaps this clash between Tie Zheng and Ao Pan would foreshadow the final winner!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Tie Zheng and Ao Pan stood facing each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Tie Zheng's bronze beast-head mask glinted sharply, his eyes blazing with intensity. The twelve beast-head bronze bells at his waist trembled slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ao Pan, hunched over with a face as sharp as a blade, possessed mismatched eyes - one large, one small - hinting at some peculiar ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ao Pan's gaze swept over Tie Zheng, then abruptly fixed on the joints of his opponent's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">With a low growl, his hunched frame coiled like a compressed spring, suddenly unleashing a burst of explosive force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ao Pan lunged forward, initiating the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">As he moved, a Profound Armament Armor flew from his sleeve, rapidly transforming into a bronze sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The sword tip trembled slightly, like a viper poised to strike. Its blade radiated an eerie green glow, carrying a bone-chilling aura that pierced straight toward Tie Zheng's heart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">A chorus of gasps erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">This bronze weapon not only possessed energy but also radiated an artistic aura, unmistakably the seventh Profound Armament Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ban Ji watched, his breath catching in his throat, consumed by envy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"If I had a sword like that, my chances of victory would skyrocket!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">But he didn't.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">His final acquisition was a bronze saber, his fifth Profound Armament Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">By the sixth, he had indeed obtained a sword. However, having exhausted too much energy, he was forced into a stalemate, unable to secure it before the third trial began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">A bitter disappointment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Beneath the Iron Ferocious Beast's mask, Tie Zheng's gaze sharpened. He clenched his fist in the Void, and his own Profound Armament Armor flew forth, transforming into... a cleaver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The cleaver was heavy, its blade gleaming with a cold, hard, profound light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Tie Zheng raised the cleaver high, meeting the sword's radiance with a ferocious downward chop!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">His technique was simple and direct, the blade's glow restrained, yet radiating an aura of unwavering strength and sharpness, capable of cleaving through any material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Another wave of gasps swept through the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">For this cleaver, too, was the seventh Profound Armament Armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"A cleaver!" Ban Ji's pupils dilated instantly, greed surging within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Even a cleaver is still a blade!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Such a fine blade... if only I had one like that..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In the next instant, blade met blade. A piercing, metallic shriek tore through the cavern air, shredding the eardrums of the spectators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The air exploded, unleashing a shockwave of golden light and blade energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ao Pan and Tie Zheng both retreated, their feet digging into the cavern floor, cracking the stone inch by inch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Their gazes locked with even greater intensity as they lunged at each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">A rapid series of blade clashes erupted like popping beans, sparks flying in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The battle reached a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Both combatants wielded seventh-grade Profound Armament Armor, their durability roughly equal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">During the fierce exchange, Ao Pan's eyes narrowed slightly. He noticed fine chips and cracks appearing on his bronze sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In contrast, Tie Zheng's cleaver remained gleaming and pristine, showing almost no signs of wear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"We both have the same Profound Armament Armor, forged from Azure Flow Copper. Why is his weapon so much more durable?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Is it enhanced by his Innate Talent? Or is it due to the inherent toughness of his martial arts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Realizing he was at a disadvantage in direct clashes, Ao Pan shook his body, unleashing three more Profound Armament Armor pieces. Each transformed into a weapon and attacked Tie Zheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Tie Zheng responded in kind, launching three Profound Armament Armor pieces of his own, using offense as defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Though taciturn, once engaged in combat, he displayed a savage, bestial aggression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The watching cultivators were riveted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo was no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Concentrating intently, he secretly assessed: Tie Zheng and Ao Pan's martial arts realms both exhibit characteristics of master-level practitioners, surpassing my own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"In close combat, I can't match them. This aligns with my expectations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"As for their control over the armaments, it leaves much to be desired."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Tie Zheng is a Martial Cultivator, while Ao Pan is a Body Cultivator, neither of whom specializes in Mechanism Art. Ning Zhuo's mastery of Mechanism Art has reached the level of a renowned master, surpassing both of them. He immediately recognized numerous flaws in their techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ban Ji snorted coldly. His understanding of Mechanism Art far exceeded Ning Zhuo's, so he naturally saw the shortcomings of Tie Zheng and Ao Pan as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The sparring continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Gradually, Ao Pan gained the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">While his weapon couldn't match Tie Zheng's cleaver in direct clashes, his skill in commanding the Profound Armament Armor far surpassed Tie Zheng's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The more the Profound Armament Armor was utilized, the more Ao Pan's advantage became apparent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo quickly assessed the situation: "Both of them have acquired the seventh Profound Armament Armor. There likely isn't an eighth one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">According to the intelligence he had gathered, the sixth Profound Armament Armor consumed spiritual energy, the seventh emanated an aura of intent, and the eighth would allow the user to manipulate momentum, creating a battlefield perfectly suited to their strengths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Profound Armament Armor grew increasingly powerful with each successive piece.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Based on historical records, very few cultivators have ever managed to subdue the eighth Profound Armament Armor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"If Tie Zheng and Ao Pan possessed the eighth Profound Armament Armor, they would have revealed it during this crucial sparring match."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The eighth Profound Armament Armor possessed immense combat power, making it unnecessary to conceal. Deploying it immediately could very well determine the outcome of the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Clang! Clang! Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Six or seven weapons orbited Tie Zheng and Ao Pan, swords clashing against blades, staffs parrying spears, the chaotic battle dazzling the eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Using divine sense, the two secretly agreed to retreat simultaneously, abruptly ceasing their combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Both maintained their composure, avoiding a deadly clash from the outset.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">As Tie Zheng had stated, this was merely a "sparring match."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The arena wasn't empty; other Foundation Establishment cultivators and a Golden Core cultivator were present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">If the two fought to the death, wouldn't Lu Zeng simply reap the benefits as the victor?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Neither Tie Zheng nor Ao Pan was foolish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">They approached Lu Zeng together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Lu Zeng's expression turned grave, sensing something ominous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Tie Zheng spoke first, his tone stiff: "Fellow Daoist, have you obtained the seventh weapon? If so, you might as well reveal it now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ao Pan nodded in agreement. "Indeed, there's no need for further sparring."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">After their brief exchange, they realized the Profound Armament Armor was surprisingly fragile against cultivators of their level, already riddled with dents and scratches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">They had just used their only opportunity to repair and maintain their Profound Armament Armor during the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">With the third round barely underway, they couldn't afford to be the first to find themselves without usable armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Lu Zeng frowned deeply at their question. "Fellow Daoists, who will strike first? Whoever attacks first will be my primary target!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Lu Zeng couldn't produce a seventh set of Profound Armament Armor because he had failed to create it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">In this desperate situation, he could only maintain his position by projecting a fierce demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">But in the next moment, Tie Zheng and Ao Pan exchanged glances, both recognizing the other's intention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"If that's the case..." Ao Pan smiled faintly and bowed slightly to Lu Zeng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Tie Zheng added, "Forgive us, Fellow Daoist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">After agreeing on a plan, they attacked simultaneously!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Lu Zeng sighed helplessly and braced himself for the fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">From the start, Tie Zheng and Ao Pan gained the upper hand. Not only did they have a numerical advantage, but as Body Cultivators and Martial Cultivators, they excelled in close combat. Lu Zeng, a true Mechanism Cultivator, could only retreat again and again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo watched the back-and-forth clash, his eyes reflecting the trio's movements. He analyzed inwardly, "Tie Zheng and Ao Pan's combat prowess here is likely among the very best."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"For the strongest and second strongest to join forces against the third strongest is a wise decision."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"If I were in their position, I would do the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">As he watched the sparks fly from the three-way battle, the cave walls crumble under their shifting movements, and stone fragments rain down, Ning Zhuo assessed his own combat capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Lu Zeng's mastery of Mechanism Art is at least at the Grandmaster level! If he also possesses a seventh piece of Profound Armament Armor, the situation will become far more complex. It could even lead to the three Golden Core cultivators uniting to eliminate the other cultivators first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Each of them is stronger than me. This current situation is actually advantageous to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The three Golden Core cultivators were each hundreds of years old, while Ning Zhuo was barely in his teens - a mere fraction of their age.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Close-quarters combat had never been Ning Zhuo's specialty, so it was only natural that he couldn't match them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Lu Zeng's defeat seems inevitable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Once he's eliminated, will the remaining two Golden Core cultivators join forces against us, or will they turn on each other?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo tried to analyze Tie Zheng and Ao Pan's personalities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Tie Zheng is a solitary figure, hunting and living alone in the mountains. Ao Pan favors a long whip, his fighting style emphasizing evasion and using flexibility to counter brute force."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Neither of them are the type to care about saving face. There's a very high chance they'll team up against us Foundation Establishment cultivators!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo's mind raced as he swiftly scanned his surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The Foundation Establishment cultivators exchanged glances, already restless and eager to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth. "The best strategy right now would be for us Foundation Establishment cultivators to unite and fight the two Golden Core cultivators together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"But... that's unlikely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">His gaze locked onto Ban Ji, who glared back fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Kill him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Let's attack together and take him down first!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Whoever hesitates is a coward! If you join the Myriad Manifestations Sect later as a Fellow Sect Member, I'll despise you for life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Many cultivators shouted at each other, forming a makeshift alliance and charging toward... Zhang Wangxing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Zhang Wangxing: ???!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Relying on his primary cultivation technique, the Flesh Transformation Sutra, Zhang Wangxing had achieved early victories. However, by the fourth Profound Armament Armor, he had suffered severe losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">By the sixth armor, he could only barely defend himself, passively enduring attacks until the third trial began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">When he arrived at the cavern, he was nothing more than a pool of mud-like flesh, barely concealing a few bronze artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Fortunately, this period was specifically designated for rest and weapon repairs, prohibiting cultivators from attacking each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Zhang Wangxing seized the opportunity to reshape his body and take a deep, ragged breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He hadn't anticipated that when the free-for-all began, he would become the first target of concentrated fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"No... I got beaten up in the second round, and now I'm getting beaten up again in the third?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"In the second round, only one weapon attacked me. Now, five or six cultivators and twenty or thirty weapons are all targeting me?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Do you really think I'm that easy to bully?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Zhang Wangxing's eyes turned bloodshot as he roared in fury, activating his five pieces of Profound Armament Armor to retaliate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The crowd grew excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Look, he only has five pieces!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Zhang Wangxing roared: "You only have five pieces too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"He's the weakest one here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Zhang Wangxing bellowed: "You're the weak one! You're the weakest!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Take him down first! Take him down first!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Zhang Wangxing bluffed: "Come on, come on! Whoever attacks first will get a beating they won't forget!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Fellow Daoist Zhang, why don't you just concede? I hate ganging up on you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Zhang Wangxing, enraged: "Hypocrite! You're the one hitting the hardest!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Several heavy bronze battle axes crashed down, while razor-sharp bronze swords struck with cunning precision. A bronze hammer swung in a wide arc, carrying a violent gust of wind as it aimed for Zhang Wangxing's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">None of the cultivators held back. The Profound Armor Cave's Grand Formation effectively prevented serious injuries and fatalities, a fact repeatedly proven throughout countless Rising Cloud Minor Trials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">In moments, Zhang Wangxing's newly donned, wide-sleeved gray robe was pierced and slashed into tattered rags, barely clinging to his body like scraps of cloth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Forced to bare his smooth, muscular legs, Zhang Wangxing sprinted frantically through the cavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">He darted from left to right, then back again, a swarm of Cultivators hot on his heels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Thwack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">A bronze longsword pierced his left chest with brutal precision, but Zhang Wangxing's heart wasn't there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Two bronze battle-axes fell almost simultaneously! One aimed for his exposed nape, revealed by a cave-in, while the other targeted his abdomen. With no escape, Zhang Wangxing violently bent his upper body to the right at the last possible moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">His spine cracked with a sickening snap, as if crushed by an invisible giant hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The axe aimed at his nape merely shaved off a few strands of hair. But the axe targeting his abdomen buried itself deep into his left ribs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Zhang Wangxing struggled to maintain his desperate sprint, but a bronze hammer slammed into his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Pfft!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Zhang Wangxing coughed violently, spewing a mouthful of blood mixed with fragments of his internal organs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Just then, he stumbled near Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"Young Master Ban Ji, help me! Help me just this once! I'll repay you, I swear I will!" Zhang Wangxing pleaded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Ban Ji retreated without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Undeterred, Zhang Wangxing tried to close the distance, but the Rust Disaster Craftsman ruthlessly forced him back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Cornered, Zhang Wangxing had no choice but to change direction and continue his desperate flight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">He barely escaped with his life, fleeing to Ning Zhuo's vicinity and crying out in a gravely wounded voice, "Young Master Ning Zhuo! Young Master! Save me, please save me! I'll be your slave, I'll help you deal with Ban Ji for free!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">"Just lend me a hand, just one hand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"I can't accept defeat now, I refuse to accept it!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Ning Zhuo shook his head silently and immediately moved aside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">He remembered their first encounter outside Profound Armor Cave, when Zhang Wangxing had demanded a high price and even threatened Ning Zhuo, implying that Ban Ji might hire him instead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Now the situation had devolved into this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">It was truly awkward!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Zhang Wangxing's reputation was poor, and Ning Zhuo certainly wouldn't risk public outrage to defend a cultivator he'd only just met.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">However, just as Ning Zhuo began to retreat, Zhang Wangxing suddenly unleashed a burst of spiritual energy and flung a chain toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">"Ning Zhuo, where do you think you're going?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Simultaneously, several of the cultivators pursuing him from behind also attacked Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">It was a trap!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
