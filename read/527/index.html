<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">At the edge of the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In an uninhabited mountain valley, there was a hidden thatched hut.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Lin Bufan was sitting on a low stool made from wooden stakes in the open space before the thatched hut, leisurely sipping tea while gazing at the distant mountains under the clear sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">A ripple ran through the air, and soon the figure of Zhu Xuanji penetrated the illusory formation and appeared before Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Lin Bufan was momentarily taken aback, then promptly set his cup down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ever since he had been “drafted” by Zhu Xuanji and drawn into his side, the two of them had secretly established multiple camps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This was just one of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Lin Bufan liked the scenery here, so he often resided in this place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">As for Zhu Xuanji, he was like a divine dragon -visible only fleetingly -and rarely lingered in these secret camps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Lin Bufan knew full well: according to the national conditions of the Two Note Nation, Southern Bean Country was inevitably closely connected with Thousand Peaks Forest. Zhu Xuanji had been dispatched here to maintain close contact with the Southern Bean-aligned forces hidden in Thousand Peaks Forest. Indeed, there were even personnel and forces directly planted by Southern Bean Country within the forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The matter of the Two Note Nation newly forming a great army, dispatching Du Tiechuan to campaign against Thousand Peaks Forest, from the very beginning was not an internal matter of the Two Note Nation, but was already entangled with other countries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">When Lin Bufan saw Zhu Xuanji coming to find him, he understood that there was an important matter that required his attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sure enough, Zhu Xuanji tossed a jade slip to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Using his divine sense to manipulate objects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The jade slip floated before Lin Bufan and slowly landed in his outstretched palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Lin Bufan swept his divine sense over it, and a strange expression immediately appeared on his face: “I didn’t expect that the first thing I had to do would still be related to that kid Ning Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The latest intelligence in the jade slip recorded that Ning Zhuo was marching with the army to attack the Ten Li Burning Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zhu Xuanji said, “Ning Zhuo’s safety is linked to the fate of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and therefore the implications are significant -there can be no mistakes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Friend Lin, you might as well go and secretly protect him. The Three Generals’ Camp is not important; you only need to ensure Ning Zhuo’s life and freedom.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Lin Bufan shook his head with a bitter smile, “That kid still doesn’t know that he has already been targeted by the Old Monster in the Stone and the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“The Old Monster in the Stone is suspected to be at the Soul Formation level, with extremely deep scheming and utterly mysterious whereabouts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“The Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth are powerful figures from the Soul Devouring Sect, renowned far and wide and known among all nations. With Ning Zhuo’s current combat strength -even with the assistance of mechanized troops -he would undoubtedly be doomed against the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“If I were him, I would definitely hunker down obediently in the frontline camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Having said that, Lin Bufan picked up his cup, took a sip of tea, and sighed, “Alas, this task is not easy to handle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zhu Xuanji laughed, “The Ning family and your Myriad Medicine Sect cooperate very closely, and I’ve also heard that Miss Lin from your sect is very close to Ning Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Perhaps in the future, you might even become one family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Lin Bufan glared, “Don’t go saying things like that!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“That kid Ning Zhuo is already married -to the heir of a nation’s top general’s mansion. Tsk tsk...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Lin Bufan looked toward Zhu Xuanji and said with a hint of mockery, “Speaking of which, ever since Ning Zhuo appeared in Green Forest Immortal City, he has repeatedly declared in public that he has a marriage arrangement with your Zhu family. Now that he’s pulled this stunt, does your Zhu family have no response at all?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“That kid…” Zhu Xuanji shook his head with a wry smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Regarding Ning Zhuo spreading such rumors, he did not refute them -not even showing any anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">It was because in Fire Persimmon Immortal City he had deeply experienced Ning Zhuo’s ability to endure, be cunning, and disguise himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Seeing that he could not extract any more intelligence, Lin Bufan drained his tea and stood up, saying, “To speak bluntly, whether it is the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth or the Old Monster in the Stone, I can’t defeat them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“If necessary, I will abandon Ning Zhuo to save myself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zhu Xuanji nodded, “Of course.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“If Ning Zhuo is injured here, it will be his destined doom.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“You must put your own survival first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“As for your current operation, and the future possible rewards, go ask Ning Zhuo for them. That kid can now sponsor the Three Generals’ Camp and the Red Flower Camp -he’s rich enough to have oil flowing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Lin Bufan nodded, immediately got up, left this secret camp, and hurried to the Ten Li Burning Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He concealed his presence and flew at a low altitude while pondering every word Zhu Xuanji had just spoken and every change in his expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“I previously thought that Ning Zhuo’s marriage alliance with the Zhu family was just his boastful claim. But Zhu Xuanji didn’t deny it just now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Furthermore, although Zhu Xuanji mentioned ‘destined doom,’ it made me feel that he had considerable confidence in Ning Zhuo!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Strange.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Although Ning Zhuo was highly gifted and full of potential, in such circumstances, why did Zhu Xuanji still have full confidence in him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Near the frontline camp of the Two Note Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth lurked in a dark corner, as still as a mountain rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">One after another, ghostly creatures occasionally returned to their side to give detailed reports.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Hmm?” Suddenly, the white-clad ghost cultivator Tian Shuang raised his eyebrow slightly and immediately transmitted a mental message with his divine sense to the black-clad ghost cultivator Di Hui, “We have received news from the alliance: the Three Generals’ Camp has suddenly left the main camp and set out to campaign in the Ten Li Burning Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Di Hui immediately responded, “That kid Ning Zhuo is also among them?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Tian Shuang said, “The intelligence did not specify that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">When the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth returned to the frontline battlefield, they had just missed the departure of the Three Generals’ Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">After all, they were outsiders; apart from the results they had personally scouted, the intelligence they received was basically second-hand from the alliance. Therefore, there was a delay in timing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Di Hui thought for a moment and said, “If Ning Zhuo continues to hunker down in the main camp, we will have no way of dealing with him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Now is a good opportunity!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Whether he has set out with the army or not, this opportunity is enough for us to move out and investigate further.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Tian Shuang said, “I think so too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“The only concern is, what if Ning Zhuo stays behind in the main camp? After the two of us leave this place, he might go out alone to harvest Ginseng Dragon Wiskers. Wouldn’t that mean we miss an opportunity?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Di Hui thought for a moment, then shook his head immediately, “Thousand Peaks Forest contains Soul Formation Level combat power; the two of us must not split arbitrarily. Then let’s choose one option: I suggest we leave here and head to the Ten Li Burning Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Even if we find nothing, we can still wipe out the Three Generals’ Camp, causing over half of Ning Zhuo’s forces to be depleted.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">But unexpectedly, Tian Shuang shook his head, “Not acceptable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“That kid Ning Zhuo is no slouch; he has hooked up with Mu Lan and become husband and wife.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“If the Three Generals’ Camp is wiped out by us, Ning Zhuo will most likely join the Red Flower Camp. The Red Flower Camp can form battle array formations, which are much harder to deal with than the Three Generals’ Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Di Hui was stunned for a moment, then realized, “That is true. So what should we do next...?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Before Di Hui could finish speaking, a flying message was delivered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth immediately sensed it and quickly accepted the flying message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Oh? Someone is interested in the Threefold Treasure we displayed, wanting to join forces to seize the treasure!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“I did not expect that there would be three Nascent Soul cultivators, one of whom is even the Red Sleeve Immortal.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">They also attached considerable importance to this female cultivator, who possessed the mountain-moving divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">With that, the scales in their hearts immediately tilted heavily in favor of staying in this place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">After all, by staying here, they would have the opportunity to obtain three heavy treasures. Even if the treasures could not be collected, if they were expelled by the main force of the Two Note Nation, they would have a chance to acquire their companions’ souls to create ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">In comparison, Ning Zhuo was merely at the Foundation Establishment stage; even if he possessed Golden Core combat power, or even mastered bizarre methods, in the eyes of the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, he was not worth worrying about.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Their reason for taking on this sect task was simply that they happened to come to Thousand Peaks Forest -a convenient matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ten Li Burning Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The soldiers of the Three Generals’ Camp cheered in unison, their morale surging noticeably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The swarms of mice and mayflies retreated on their own, allowing their first skirmish to be a victory and further boosting their confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Liu Er, Guan, Zhang, and Ning showed not the slightest trace of smugness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">They knew the intelligence well: the Fire Fur Mice and the Red Refined Mayfly swarms in the Ten Li Burning Forest were specially bred, not for defensive combat, but to assist in artifact forging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Fire Fur Mice were scavengers with a wide-ranging diet; they could not only ingest shattered tree bark and roots but also devour the remnants left behind by large-scale artifact forging and the like.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">After they died, the indigestible residuals in their bodies could be further refined, often yielding valuable materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Red Refined Mayfly swarms, on the other hand, would be attracted in groups whenever a cultivator needed to inscribe array patterns or talismans during artifact forging. By manipulating them with divine sense, the mayflies would land on a magical instrument or artifact, arranging themselves into the shapes of talismans or arrays. By sacrificing the mayflies one by one and stamping imprints, talismans and arrays were quickly formed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“This is merely the enemy’s probe. All troops, obey orders and continue marching!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">After Liu Er and the others heard a round of cheers from the entire army, he shouted loudly to halt them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The entire army continued to advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">After marching another two li, the soldiers had to stop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The surrounding raging flames suddenly transformed drastically, turning into walls of fire that encircled the entire army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Subsequently, these fire walls burned higher and higher, connecting sky and earth, forming a heavenly curtain, like a giant crimson bowl inverted and placed over the Three Generals’ Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The soldiers were thrown into panic and commotion for a moment, but when they saw that the three generals-Liu, Guan, and Zhang -remained calm, they quickly recovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Flowing Flame Immortal, who presided over the formation, stood in front of the Vermilion Bird Incense Furnace, exerting herself fully to mobilize the formation’s power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Immediately, a huge image of a Vermilion Bird appeared on the heavenly curtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The ambient air temperature quickly soared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Waves of flames surged toward the Three Generals’ Camp, the ground became scorching hot, and countless fire sparks emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The sparks quickly grew, turning the area into a sea of flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The entire Three Generals’ Camp was immersed in a sea of fire, and the frost-white talismans on their bodies were being rapidly consumed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Seeing this, Liu Er immediately ordered, “Transform into the Iron Barrel Formation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Guan Hong and Zhang Hei immediately cooperated, both executing their military tactics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Speed was of the essence in warfare!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The soldiers moved with extreme agility, generally remaining calm, and very few made mistakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Soon, the Iron Barrel Formation was successfully established.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Once the battle formation was complete, it immediately provided strong protection to the entire army. The soldiers immediately felt that the temperature had dropped significantly, and the rate at which the frost-white talismans were being consumed on their bodies had also decreased considerably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Their morale stabilized once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">However, the soldiers could still sense that the surrounding temperature was slowly rising, and their protective frost-white talismans continued to wear down, though at a rate no less than three times slower than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning immediately realized that if they defended for too long, they would surely lose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Zhang Hei, impulsive by nature, took the initiative, brandishing the Black Snake Spear once again and executing the tactic of overwhelming the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Black Water soldiers surged forth again, but before they could charge into the Red Fire Heavenly Curtain, they were burned and melted halfway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Guan Hong waved the Blood Dragon Blade in his hand, releasing a massive blade aura as he hacked at the heavenly curtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The heavenly curtain flickered for a moment, then quickly stabilized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Liu Er held the Xuanhuang Sword but did not strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Each of the three generals had their own focus; Guan Hong’s attacking method was potent yet restrained and very concentrated. In the current situation, it was just right to break through with a pinpoint strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">By contrast, even if Liu Er struck, he might not achieve such an effective result. Military strength was precious; although it could be quickly restored, its consumption came from the soldiers’ combat power, physical strength, and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Guan Hong continued his assault, hacking three times in succession and carving a huge gap in the heavenly curtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Seeing this, Liu Er took advantage of the moment while Guan Hong was catching his breath and added another sword strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">That strike was just right -it broke through the limit that the heavenly curtain could bear, splitting it apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The heavenly curtain immediately dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The soldiers cheered once again, enabling them to continue their advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">There was reason behind naming the Ten Li Burning Forest as such; its front-to-back distance was approximately ten li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">However, the Three Generals’ Camp did not need to traverse the full ten li; if they marched five li, they could roughly break through to the central area and see the Fire Crown Divine Cedar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">This divine tree was the king of trees in the Ten Li Burning Forest-a signature giant tree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The Three Generals’ Camp had already advanced three li, leaving only the final two li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">However, the journey ahead suddenly became significantly more difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Layer upon layer of fire curtains appeared in succession, enveloping the Three Generals’ Camp and making their movement extremely difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Although Guan Hong could hack through the fire curtains, such frequent assaults greatly drained him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">He was at the Golden Core level and was already extremely fatigued, and the rest of the soldiers were even worse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The closer they got to the center of the Burning Forest, the more vigorous the flames became, and with the rising temperature, the consumption of the Three Generals’ Camp increased rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Everyone had to replenish their talismans more and more frequently, and the soldiers’ physical energy was largely depleted -even though they consumed some pill-like provisions and military rations along the way, their strength still fell short.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">When they were nearly four li in, a loud bell sound suddenly resounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The bell sound reverberated, arousing raging flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The soldiers’ armor, talismans, and even their weapons began to crack and quickly disintegrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">In this crisis, Liu Er hurriedly deployed military tactics to fortify their position, buying critical time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Taking advantage of this, the soldiers quickly replenished their talismans, and Ning Zhuo also cast spells to try to alleviate the predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">During the arduous process of resisting the bell sound, Ning Zhuo’s thoughts made a sudden turn -a flash of spiritual light streaked through his divine sea, and he exclaimed in astonishment, “Could it be the Heavenly Art Forging Sound Score?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Zhang Hei asked, “What?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Guan Hong looked equally puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">But Liu Er’s eyes lit up, “That’s right -it must be this method.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Yan Jin, who specialized in the Heavenly Art Forging Sound Score, was the chief craftsman of the Ten Li Burning Forest. At that moment, he stood in front of a huge bronze bell; each time he swung his fists and palms, he forcefully pounded the bell, eliciting a resounding, mighty sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The bell sound could forge iron into steel, turning the entire Three Generals’ Camp into raw ore for forging!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The Three Generals’ Camp was plunged into a predicament, and the three generals -Liu, Guan, and Zhang -were at a loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">It was all because the bell sound was hard to defend against; no matter what methods they employed, they could not change the passive situation of taking blow after blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">“They were delaying our advance through layer upon layer of fire curtains, and then using the bell sound forging technique to kill us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Ning Zhuo looked around and saw that many soldiers had blood oozing from their mouths and noses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Their internal organs could not withstand the bell sound -they were already suffering massive internal bleeding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">“The Heavenly Art Forging Sound Score is an artifact forging method that amplifies its power through the great bell. As long as we destroy the great bell, this move can be neutralized.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“According to the intelligence, the forest chief of the Ten Li Burning Forest is the Nascent Soul cultivator Luo Chen. He has never made an appearance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">“The Three Generals’ Camp is marching slowly and relies on the Iron Barrel Formation for defense; switching to other formations would be tantamount to suicide. The three generals -Liu, Guan, and Zhang -are only at the Golden Core level; once they leave the Iron Barrel Formation to go destroy the great bell, they would inevitably suffer an attack from Luo Chen.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">“It is time for me to act.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo rotated his mechanical ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The ring had no reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">He immediately sent his divine sense into his storage belt and took out one mechanized puppet after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The mechanized army had appeared!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
