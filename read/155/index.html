<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"What? Ning Zhuo actually broke through to the eighth level in one go?!" Ning Xiaohui exclaimed in disbelief upon hearing the news.<br/>
<br/>
After confirming it multiple times, Ning Xiaohui's face turned ashen and gloomy.<br/>
<br/>
Recalling her own experience of leading Ning Zhuo through the trials, she sneered, "This Ning Zhuo is quite the pretender. I thought that after witnessing the power of the Ice Jade Hand, he would willingly submit. I didn't expect him to secretly accumulate strength and achieve such a feat in one move. He dared to toy with me. Very well, very well!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui felt her pride trampled by Ning Zhuo and spat a few times in anger.<br/>
<br/>
"The eighth level? I will go too! There's no reason Ning Zhuo can do it, and I, a main branch member, cannot." Enraged, Ning Xiaohui began to gather the Qi Refining Stage cultivators of the reformation team.<br/>
<br/>
Her grandmother, upon learning of this, gently advised, "Ning Zhuo had over a dozen people assisting him, while you only have five. You are at a numerical disadvantage. Are you really determined to explore the Lava Immortal Palace and surpass Ning Zhuo's achievements?" Ning Xiaowang's situation was somewhat awkward.<br/>
<br/>
When the reformation team was initially formed, the main branch members of the Ning family had shirked their responsibilities in every possible way, leaving the majority of the team to be composed of branch members.<br/>
<br/>
"Absolutely!" Ning Xiao'e nodded slowly, her gaze firm and sharp.<br/>
<br/>
She looked at her grandmother, "Having fewer people also has its advantages. The difficulty of the Lava Immortal Palace varies with the number of people. With fewer people, the difficulty will be lower, and we won't need the palace to increase the challenge. So, even if we encounter the Mechanical Monkeys, it will definitely be in the later stages." Ning Xiaohui confidently speculated.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after, she led five main branch reformation members and pushed open the first door, officially entering the second room.<br/>
<br/>
The Ice Jade Hand froze the mechanisms along the way, and just as they were about to pass through, the second door was pushed open.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng brazenly entered the second level from the third.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui: ?!!<br/>
<br/>
Others: ....<br/>
<br/>
Bang bang bang bang bang.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng struck, and after a series of muffled sounds, he shattered all the Ning family's mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah‚Äî!" Ning Xiaohui's soul returned to her body, and she screamed in anger.<br/>
<br/>
Her grandmother comforted her, "Ning Zhuo reached the eighth level before encountering the Mechanical Monkeys. This shows that their strength is far inferior to your team, Xiaohui. Judging by the position of the Mechanical Monkeys, Ning Zhuo may have talent, but it is insignificant!" With her grandmother's words, Xiaohui's discomfort eased a bit.<br/>
<br/>
At the Ning family's residence.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren, with a regretful expression, said to Ning Zhuo, "That's the situation."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned, incredulous, "Uncle Xiaoren, my achievements aren't enough for Ice Jade Wine?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren replied, "Dear nephew, it's not that simple. Ice Jade Wine is excellent for enhancing one's cultivation, but your reformation team's cultivation is limited to the peak of the third level. Without subsequent techniques, you can't break through. Using Ice Jade Wine would be a waste."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo spread his hands, "I planned to acquire some Ice Jade Wine to store for future use. Isn't that a good plan?" Ning Xiaoren chuckled, a hint of a forced smile, "Dear nephew, many times, it's not about what you want, but what the family grants you. You are only at the third level of Qi Refining, a member of the reformation team. The family elders have many considerations beyond your understanding. Trust the family; their arrangements consider the bigger picture."<br/>
<br/>
"Demanding rewards so forcefully is not a good look. Take my advice, don't do this; it leaves a bad impression." Ning Zhuo frowned, "Then what does the family reward me with? I reached the eighth level!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren smiled and explained.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Pi was stunned and openly dissatisfied, "Just this? Are they treating me like a beggar?!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren felt a sting in his heart, extreme resentment and disgust making him frown, but he quickly relaxed, "Dear nephew, you can't say that. The family's resources are prioritized. Compared to many clan members, your cultivation and qualifications are lacking. Do you understand?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head, "I don't understand!"<br/>
<br/>
"If their cultivation or qualifications are higher than mine, can they enter the Immortal Palace and reach the eighth level? If they can, I don't mind them receiving higher rewards."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren finally couldn't hold back, frowning, "Dear nephew, you seem to misunderstand something. Exploring the Lava Immortal Palace isn't for rewards; it's for contributing to the family. This is a time for the Ning family to shine."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head again, "Uncle Xiaoren, I can't speak for others, but I joined the reformation team and explored the Lava Immortal Palace for the rewards. You know I love money. The more, the better!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren's eye twitched, and he felt an urge to whip Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
He took a deep breath, calmed himself, and smiled, "Dear nephew, your ambition is commendable. Since we've come this far, and you're so mature, I'll be honest with you. You can get the rewards you want, but..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren didn't speak aloud but transmitted his voice.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo listened patiently and was shocked, "What? I have to join a faction within the family and sign a contract? Is the division between the main and branch families that serious, Uncle Xiaoren?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren sighed deeply, "Where there are people, there are conflicts. Dear nephew, even if I admire you and want to support you, my hands are tied. I'm just a minor clan leader, and my faction is only one of the eight main factions."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo fell into a long silence.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Ning Xiaoren gently persuaded him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained silent.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren smiled, patting Ning Pi's shoulder, "I wasn't planning to tell you this. Your father saved my life, and I wanted to protect your youthful innocence. But you're too outstanding, encountering this level so early."<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps this is a test from the heavens. For exceptional people, the heavens always give more tests. This time, I hope you can adjust your mindset and pass this test."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo asked, "What should I do, Uncle Xiaoren?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren's smile deepened, "For example, you modified several mechanical components in the Lava Immortal Palace's preparation room. After practical testing, these components are indeed good. I suggest you proactively submit the related blueprints. It doesn't matter which faction, as long as the higher-ups see your willingness to align with them. This will greatly increase your chances of getting Ice Jade Wine."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face darkened, "Uncle Xiaoren, I need to think about it."<br/>
<br/>
"Take your time. You're at the peak of the third level without subsequent techniques, so there's no rush." Ning Xiaoren patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder and slowly left.<br/>
<br/>
But until he reached the door, he didn't hear Ning Zhuo call him back.<br/>
<br/>
He sneered inwardly, shook his head slightly, and resumed his normal pace, leaving the Ning residence.<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan had been waiting for a long time and met Ning Xiaoren halfway, mentioning Ning Gui's release.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren, still fuming from his encounter with Ning Zhuo, immediately put on a stern face and replied stiffly, "This must wait for the right time. No more questions."<br/>
<br/>
In a private room at a restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian and Zhou Zesheng were invited by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo seated them and got straight to the point, "I invited you today to sell a highly valuable piece of information related to the Lava Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian asked, "Brother Ning Zhuo, I heard you achieved great success this time, breaking through to the eighth level. Is that true?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Pi nodded, "This information is what I discovered while breaking through the eight levels. It's absolutely worth the price."<br/>
<br/>
"If you want to buy it, it will cost this much." Ning Zhuo held up three fingers.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian and Zhou Zesheng exchanged glances and decided to buy the information.<br/>
<br/>
"So, there's a Trial Disciple Mark?" "This information is indeed worth the price."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian was the first to confirm.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zesheng, concerned for Ning Zhuo, asked, "Brother Ning Zhuo, won't your family be angry if you sell such important information?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Pi sneered, "Hmph, no need to worry about that, Brother Zhou. I have my own discretion." Zhou Zesheng's eyes flashed with a hint of malice, and he quickly apologized, "Oh, sorry, I was being presumptuous." Zheng and Zhou both paid for the information, giving Ning Zhuo a substantial sum.<br/>
<br/>
"Trial Disciple Mark?" Zhu Xuanji's eyes lit up upon hearing this.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately mobilized several Qi Refining Stage cultivators with the mark through the Golden Core Stage elders of the three families for an experiment.<br/>
<br/>
He brought these cultivators to the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, the palace emitted a radiant light, absorbing everyone, including the Qi Refining Stage cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
"It's effective!"<br/>
<br/>
"The Trial Disciple Mark indeed allows them to enter the palace. And some of them are completely inept in mechanical arts, practically blank slates. Perhaps I can use these people..."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji led these individuals in exploring the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly discovered that many buildings and facilities in the palace were inaccessible to him but available to the trial disciples, sometimes even for free.<br/>
<br/>
In some aspects, the trial disciples had far greater privileges than him, a royal member!<br/>
<br/>
For example‚Äîthe Disposal Room.<br/>
<br/>
It housed a vast number of mechanical constructs, all discarded.<br/>
<br/>
"Even the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit can't repair them?"<br/>
<br/>
"Many of these constructs only need minor repairs to be usable again." Through the trial disciples' perspectives, Zhu Xuanji gained a deeper understanding of the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
