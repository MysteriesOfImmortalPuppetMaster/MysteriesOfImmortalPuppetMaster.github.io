<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"What? Ning Zhuo actually broke through to the eighth level in one go?!" Ning Xiaohui exclaimed in disbelief upon hearing the news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After confirming it multiple times, Ning Xiaohui's face turned ashen and gloomy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Recalling her own experience of leading Ning Zhuo through the trials, she sneered, "This Ning Zhuo is quite the pretender. I thought that after witnessing the power of the Ice Jade Hand, he would willingly submit. I didn't expect him to secretly accumulate strength and achieve such a feat in one move. He dared to toy with me. Very well, very well!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Xiaohui felt her pride trampled by Ning Zhuo and spat a few times in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"The eighth level? I will go too! There's no reason Ning Zhuo can do it, and I, a main branch member, cannot." Enraged, Ning Xiaohui began to gather the Qi Refining Stage cultivators of the reformation team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Her grandmother, upon learning of this, gently advised, "Ning Zhuo had over a dozen people assisting him, while you only have five. You are at a numerical disadvantage. Are you really determined to explore the Lava Immortal Palace and surpass Ning Zhuo's achievements?" Ning Xiaowang's situation was somewhat awkward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">When the reformation team was initially formed, the main branch members of the Ning family had shirked their responsibilities in every possible way, leaving the majority of the team to be composed of branch members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Absolutely!" Ning Xiao'e nodded slowly, her gaze firm and sharp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">She looked at her grandmother, "Having fewer people also has its advantages. The difficulty of the Lava Immortal Palace varies with the number of people. With fewer people, the difficulty will be lower, and we won't need the palace to increase the challenge. So, even if we encounter the Mechanical Monkeys, it will definitely be in the later stages." Ning Xiaohui confidently speculated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Not long after, she led five main branch reformation members and pushed open the first door, officially entering the second room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Ice Jade Hand froze the mechanisms along the way, and just as they were about to pass through, the second door was pushed open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Yuan Dasheng brazenly entered the second level from the third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Xiaohui: ?!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Others: ....</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Bang bang bang bang bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Yuan Dasheng struck, and after a series of muffled sounds, he shattered all the Ning family's mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Ahâ€”!" Ning Xiaohui's soul returned to her body, and she screamed in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Her grandmother comforted her, "Ning Zhuo reached the eighth level before encountering the Mechanical Monkeys. This shows that their strength is far inferior to your team, Xiaohui. Judging by the position of the Mechanical Monkeys, Ning Zhuo may have talent, but it is insignificant!" With her grandmother's words, Xiaohui's discomfort eased a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">At the Ning family's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Xiaoren, with a regretful expression, said to Ning Zhuo, "That's the situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo frowned, incredulous, "Uncle Xiaoren, my achievements aren't enough for Ice Jade Wine?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Xiaoren replied, "Dear nephew, it's not that simple. Ice Jade Wine is excellent for enhancing one's cultivation, but your reformation team's cultivation is limited to the peak of the third level. Without subsequent techniques, you can't break through. Using Ice Jade Wine would be a waste."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo spread his hands, "I planned to acquire some Ice Jade Wine to store for future use. Isn't that a good plan?" Ning Xiaoren chuckled, a hint of a forced smile, "Dear nephew, many times, it's not about what you want, but what the family grants you. You are only at the third level of Qi Refining, a member of the reformation team. The family elders have many considerations beyond your understanding. Trust the family; their arrangements consider the bigger picture."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Demanding rewards so forcefully is not a good look. Take my advice, don't do this; it leaves a bad impression." Ning Zhuo frowned, "Then what does the family reward me with? I reached the eighth level!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Xiaoren smiled and explained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Pi was stunned and openly dissatisfied, "Just this? Are they treating me like a beggar?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Xiaoren felt a sting in his heart, extreme resentment and disgust making him frown, but he quickly relaxed, "Dear nephew, you can't say that. The family's resources are prioritized. Compared to many clan members, your cultivation and qualifications are lacking. Do you understand?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo shook his head, "I don't understand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"If their cultivation or qualifications are higher than mine, can they enter the Immortal Palace and reach the eighth level? If they can, I don't mind them receiving higher rewards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Xiaoren finally couldn't hold back, frowning, "Dear nephew, you seem to misunderstand something. Exploring the Lava Immortal Palace isn't for rewards; it's for contributing to the family. This is a time for the Ning family to shine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo shook his head again, "Uncle Xiaoren, I can't speak for others, but I joined the reformation team and explored the Lava Immortal Palace for the rewards. You know I love money. The more, the better!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Xiaoren's eye twitched, and he felt an urge to whip Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He took a deep breath, calmed himself, and smiled, "Dear nephew, your ambition is commendable. Since we've come this far, and you're so mature, I'll be honest with you. You can get the rewards you want, but..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Xiaoren didn't speak aloud but transmitted his voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo listened patiently and was shocked, "What? I have to join a faction within the family and sign a contract? Is the division between the main and branch families that serious, Uncle Xiaoren?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Xiaoren sighed deeply, "Where there are people, there are conflicts. Dear nephew, even if I admire you and want to support you, my hands are tied. I'm just a minor clan leader, and my faction is only one of the eight main factions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo fell into a long silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Seeing this, Ning Xiaoren gently persuaded him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Xiaoren smiled, patting Ning Pi's shoulder, "I wasn't planning to tell you this. Your father saved my life, and I wanted to protect your youthful innocence. But you're too outstanding, encountering this level so early."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Perhaps this is a test from the heavens. For exceptional people, the heavens always give more tests. This time, I hope you can adjust your mindset and pass this test."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo asked, "What should I do, Uncle Xiaoren?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Xiaoren's smile deepened, "For example, you modified several mechanical components in the Lava Immortal Palace's preparation room. After practical testing, these components are indeed good. I suggest you proactively submit the related blueprints. It doesn't matter which faction, as long as the higher-ups see your willingness to align with them. This will greatly increase your chances of getting Ice Jade Wine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo's face darkened, "Uncle Xiaoren, I need to think about it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Take your time. You're at the peak of the third level without subsequent techniques, so there's no rush." Ning Xiaoren patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder and slowly left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">But until he reached the door, he didn't hear Ning Zhuo call him back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He sneered inwardly, shook his head slightly, and resumed his normal pace, leaving the Ning residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Wang Lan had been waiting for a long time and met Ning Xiaoren halfway, mentioning Ning Gui's release.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Xiaoren, still fuming from his encounter with Ning Zhuo, immediately put on a stern face and replied stiffly, "This must wait for the right time. No more questions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">In a private room at a restaurant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zheng Jian and Zhou Zesheng were invited by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo seated them and got straight to the point, "I invited you today to sell a highly valuable piece of information related to the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Zheng Jian asked, "Brother Ning Zhuo, I heard you achieved great success this time, breaking through to the eighth level. Is that true?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Pi nodded, "This information is what I discovered while breaking through the eight levels. It's absolutely worth the price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"If you want to buy it, it will cost this much." Ning Zhuo held up three fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zheng Jian and Zhou Zesheng exchanged glances and decided to buy the information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"So, there's a Trial Disciple Mark?" "This information is indeed worth the price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zheng Jian was the first to confirm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Zhou Zesheng, concerned for Ning Zhuo, asked, "Brother Ning Zhuo, won't your family be angry if you sell such important information?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Pi sneered, "Hmph, no need to worry about that, Brother Zhou. I have my own discretion." Zhou Zesheng's eyes flashed with a hint of malice, and he quickly apologized, "Oh, sorry, I was being presumptuous." Zheng and Zhou both paid for the information, giving Ning Zhuo a substantial sum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Trial Disciple Mark?" Zhu Xuanji's eyes lit up upon hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He immediately mobilized several Qi Refining Stage cultivators with the mark through the Golden Core Stage elders of the three families for an experiment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He brought these cultivators to the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The next moment, the palace emitted a radiant light, absorbing everyone, including the Qi Refining Stage cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"It's effective!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"The Trial Disciple Mark indeed allows them to enter the palace. And some of them are completely inept in mechanical arts, practically blank slates. Perhaps I can use these people..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhu Xuanji led these individuals in exploring the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He quickly discovered that many buildings and facilities in the palace were inaccessible to him but available to the trial disciples, sometimes even for free.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In some aspects, the trial disciples had far greater privileges than him, a royal member!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">For exampleâ€”the Disposal Room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">It housed a vast number of mechanical constructs, all discarded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Even the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit can't repair them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Many of these constructs only need minor repairs to be usable again." Through the trial disciples' perspectives, Zhu Xuanji gained a deeper understanding of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Wait, what's that?!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
