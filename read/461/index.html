<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Green Bamboo Tower’s structure was entirely built from bamboo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">There were four bamboo pillars supporting the bamboo tower, each so thick that even if six grown men joined hands to circle it, they still would not encompass it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Bamboo beams crisscrossed, forming a kind of staircase that wound around the outside of the tower. It resembled a green dragon dancing gracefully, spiraling from the first floor straight up to the third floor’s topmost level, twisting and turning with a lively elegance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Following these bamboo stair steps, and led by a waiter from the establishment, Ning Zhuo reached the third floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This place had already been fully reserved by Shuang Jing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“General Shuang,” Ning Zhuo bowed in greeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This time, he had been invited by Shuang Jing to have morning tea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Previously, at the Little Bird Tower, Shuang Jing had tried to recruit Ning Zhuo as a retainer, but Ning Zhuo had tactfully said he needed to consider it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Now Shuang Jing had chosen another day to invite him again, making his intentions quite clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Shuang Jing motioned for Ning Zhuo to sit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Morning tea and pastries were respectfully served by the waiters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But Shuang Jing said, “No need to rush to eat or drink. I invited Advisor Ning today because there’s a good show to watch.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo was slightly taken aback, and then he heard a burst of commotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">A troop of cultivators rode in on fine horses, passing straight through the bustling streets and arriving directly opposite the Green Bamboo Tower, at the military grain depot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The leader was none other than Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“General Mu, please wait…” The cultivator guarding the depot had not finished speaking when Mu Lan swept him aside with a wave of her hand, sending him flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But Mu Lan still dismounted, walked up to the tightly shut main gate of the grain depot, and suddenly raised her foot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo was surprised: “What happened here? Why is General Mu Lan so furious?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The main gate was kicked open by her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The granary chief rushed out anxiously: “General Mu, please calm your anger, please calm down!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Mu Lan snorted coldly: “Where’s Zhao Yuan? Tell him to get out here! Time and again blocking the grain for my Red Flower Battalion —does he really think our Red Flower Battalion is made of mud?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Hmph, the supervisory official is here! General Mu, cease your slander.” Zhao Yuan appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Mu Lan and Zhao Yuan began arguing loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo listened and understood that this was because the Red Flower Battalion had not received the latest batch of rations and pay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Mu Lan once left in anger before everyone’s eyes and does not get along with Zhao Yuan,” he thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Afterward, the military supplies were withheld from the Red Flower Battalion once. I had to use treasure resources to settle it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“And now it’s happening again?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“This is suspicious. The army just experienced an ambush and returned to Green Forest Immortal City, suffering countless casualties. At such a time, morale needs to be upheld with rations. Yet Zhao Yuan is pulling the same trick again —this is unwise!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Although Ning Zhuo had only met Zhao Yuan a few times, he had gathered some intelligence and knew that, though Zhao Yuan was stingy and greedy, he did have some talent and awareness of the bigger picture. Otherwise, the royal family would not have repeatedly trusted him with tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Mu Lan, enraged, struck out. Zhao Yuan was prepared, continually using procedures and regulations as excuses. Infuriated, she landed a palm strike that sent Zhao Yuan flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Zhao dog! You dare keep making excuses, you really don’t put me, the Grand General, in your eyes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Today, this batch of rations and pay, my Red Flower Battalion will definitely take!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“No, you cannot enter!” Zhao Yuan, lying on the ground and spitting blood, shouted to stop her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Saying this, she headed straight into the grain depot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The soldiers behind Mu Lan, seeing the supervisory official in such a pitiful state, felt secretly delighted. They followed Mu Lan in single file.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">However, once Mu Lan barged inside, she found the granary completely empty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Her expression changed slightly, a sense of foreboding welling up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhao Yuan climbed back up and blocked the doorway, shouting sternly: “Mu Lan! You are overbearing and audacious. Not only did you assault a superior officer, you also forcibly entered the granary.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Our newly arrived rations and pay were robbed by the Old Stone Monster yesterday on the road! The matter is of great military importance. To prevent morale from wavering, I concealed the truth by mentioning only procedural issues to delay your collection.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“Yet you slander me, saying I’m making things difficult for you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“I, Zhao Yuan, have always acted openly and honestly. When have I ever made things difficult for you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“You beat me up, you disregard me, the supervisory official and emissary from the capital. What are you trying to do? Do you intend to rebel?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Mu Lan’s face turned ashen. She spun around abruptly, her gaze like arrows, fixed fiercely on Zhao Yuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The soldiers behind her, who never expected things to unfold this way, each showed confused expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Zhao Yuan put on a look as if being wrongly accused. Yet Mu Lan could sense the intense delight, ruthlessness, and schadenfreude hidden in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Above in the Green Bamboo Tower, seeing the desired development, Shuang Jing smiled, picked up his cup, and began to drink tea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo, like Shuang Jing, used his spiritual sense to observe the progress of events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“The Old Stone Monster attacked the grain transport? After the ambush battle, our side must have sent out strong experts to search everywhere. He actually dared to linger without fleeing?!” Ning Zhuo asked Shuang Jing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Shuang Jing looked indignant: “The Old Stone Monster’s methods are formidable. His earth-traveling technique leaves no trace of escaping. It is both fast and hidden. Fortunately, this time the loss to the transport team wasn’t large.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He indeed intended to scheme against Mu Lan, but this was not his doing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“In order to scheme for the Grand Marshal’s Mansion, the high-levels of Two Note State actually attacked their own grain transport teams.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“I never thought the political struggle within Two Note State would be this intense!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Shuang Jing inviting me this time, making me witness Mu Lan’s current predicament, must be his way of exerting pressure on me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“So this is the so-called method of combining both carrot and stick. Heh.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo sneered inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sure enough, the next moment, Shuang Jing spoke with deep meaning: “Our nation’s Grand Marshal Mu has been bedridden for many years. Once, he was the military pillar of our nation. Leading the Red Flower Battalion, he swept the battlefields, pacified the northern demon scourge, subdued the enemy chieftains in the west, cleared out the demonic miasma in the east, and vanquished the various barbarians of the southern range. Truly, his war achievements were illustrious.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“But a hero grows old, and so it is now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“His only descendant, Mu Lan, is indeed ambitious but lacking ability. With her mere Golden Core cultivation, how can she support the Grand Marshal’s Mansion?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Shuang Jing sighed: “Our Two Note State is a small nation; we must cherish every bit of national strength.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“The Grand Marshal’s Mansion occupies too many national resources yet contributes too little.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“For the sake of the country, Mu Lan should yield her position to someone more capable, that would be the proper course.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“But our sovereign is kind-hearted and cannot bring himself to act. We ministers, receiving the ruler’s bounty, must be loyal and share his burdens. It is only natural to do something about it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“I hope that this time, General Mu Lan will understand the situation, and withdraw graciously.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Shuang Jing continued: “The situation changes easily, and strength and weakness alternate. Such is the common truth of the world.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“In my view, talents like Advisor Ning, young and brilliant, represent the future and the hope.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Like a bird choosing a branch to perch on, as long as you recognize a good tree, you will achieve greatness. As for small trees like the Three Generals Battalion, or sickly trees like the Red Flower Battalion, if they delay Advisor Ning’s accomplishments, wouldn’t that be a pity?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“What do you think, Advisor Ning?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo shook his head, fixed his gaze on Shuang Jing, and slowly stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He first cupped his hands in salute, then said: “Lord Shuang Jing, this humble official is loyal and sincere, knowing that matters of state are of great importance and that my heart must remain with the sovereign. How could one presume to guess the sovereign’s intentions? A loyal minister must speak forthrightly, not scheme secretly or manipulate from behind. To serve the country faithfully, how can we act arbitrarily and plot against others? Without a clear directive from the sovereign, who would dare undertake private actions? If we act on baseless assumptions, would we not be harming both the nation and ourselves?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo’s face was stern, brimming with righteousness: “As for your so-called ‘yielding position to the worthy,’ it is not something I can conspire in. A loyal subject should be loyal to the sovereign and assist his governance. How can we decide matters of state on our own?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Paths differ, and thus we cannot work together. Please forgive this junior for lacking the good fortune to serve as your retainer, Lord Shuang Jing. Ning Zhuo takes his leave now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">With these words, Ning Zhuo flicked his sleeves and departed, stepping quickly down the stairs and leaving the building.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Shuang Jing was stunned on the spot, watching Ning Zhuo step into the street and disappear into the crowd without looking back. Only then did he chuckle softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“I thought that since he came from a great clan, he would understand the ways of power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“I never expected him to be such a young greenhorn.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“Well… Ning Zhuo is only sixteen, hot-blooded. It does make sense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Perhaps his family allowed him to journey abroad precisely to educate him, so he would understand the world and human nature?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Heh, so be it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Shuang Jing’s interest in Ning Zhuo mainly stemmed from Ning Zhuo’s prophetic poem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But divination, even for those most skilled, cannot be accurate every single time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Unlike Liu Er, Shuang Jing did not consider Ning Zhuo indispensable. He was merely a nice addition if he could be won over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He bore the Shuang surname and was a Nascent Soul-level cultivator. Inviting Ning Zhuo twice and showing such courtesy in recruitment was already an act of lowering himself to value talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sadly, this second attempt to exert pressure backfired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Though Shuang Jing felt disappointed and regretful, he accepted it as it was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">His real target was still the Red Flower Battalion, still Mu Lan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Originally, I thought only after the great battle would the Red Flower Battalion be weakened, but I never expected that a single ambush would be enough.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“The Grand Marshal’s Mansion —Mu Lan —both shall be mine!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">At the same time—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">An old demon cultivator stood on a mountain peak, gazing at Green Forest Immortal City in the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He wore a robe of yellow and white hues. His ears were long and pointed, lined with golden-tinged fur, and behind his robe trailed a fox’s tail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">His eyes swirled with misty clouds, flickering in and out of illusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">After observing for a while, the old demon cultivator nodded contentedly: “Destiny has stirred to this point, the time has come, finally it has come.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He then descended the mountain and walked toward Green Forest Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Wherever he passed, it was as if he were invisible. Those around him did not notice him, and even the city’s great protective formation did not react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In the city’s alleys, he saw Mu Lan and her subordinates leaving the city without having secured their rations, and after some calculation, he nodded again, pleased: “Their fortune is declining, great calamity approaches. Good, good, very good!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Finally, he arrived outside the Third General Battalion and released his spiritual sense, calling someone forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Inside the camp, Liu Er, learning that Ning Zhuo had gone again to meet Shuang Jing, was pacing in his tent, troubled and anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Suddenly, he heard the old demon cultivator’s voice transmission and was both shocked and overjoyed. He immediately concealed himself, slipped out of camp, and met the old demon cultivator in a forested mountain area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Teacher, why have you come?” Liu Er bowed in greeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The old demon cultivator stroked his beard and smiled: “Little Six, you are determined to rebuild my Bloodslaughter Immortal Kingdom. Tell me, have you made any progress?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Liu Er recounted his recent circumstances in detail to his teacher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The old demon cultivator nodded slightly: “You bear the mandate of a king. Once you emerge, valiant generals will come to serve you. Now it seems that Guan Hong and Zhang Hei are indeed your destined left and right arms.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Liu Er exclaimed, “Teacher, you have given me a fate-prophecy? What comes next? Will Military Advisor Ning Zhuo leave me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Ning Zhuo?” The old demon cultivator shook his head. “He is not important. My purpose this time is something else.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“This is the Yinyang One Qi Kettle, a treasure of the imperial dynasty. I give it to you now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“From now on, use this treasure wisely!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“Teacher, Teacher!” Liu Er, somewhat dazed, came back to his senses, and in his arms was only the treasured flask. The old demon cultivator had already vanished without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Liu Er called out several times, then shook his head and sighed: “Teacher is still as mysterious as ever …Ah, never mind.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He put away the flask and stealthily returned to camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The old demon cultivator had not truly left, continuing to watch Liu Er until he disappeared from view. He muttered in his heart: “Liu Er, that Mu Lan is the empress destined for you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“With the Yinyang One Qi Kettle, you can successfully propose marriage, become the Grand Marshal’s son-in-law, and thus gain legitimate status. You’ll escape the awkwardness of being a human-demon half-blood and truly integrate into the higher ranks.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“The world now is already the world of humankind.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“The hope of rebuilding my Bloodslaughter Immortal Kingdom rests upon you. You must live up to it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The old demon cultivator could not directly reveal Liu Er’s fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">He had inherited the legacy of the Bloodslaughter Imperial Dynasty and was extremely skilled in divination. He could give someone a fate-prophecy with a sixty to seventy percent accuracy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">But this technique had a drawback —he had to not speak of it openly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">If he revealed it prematurely, it would lose its efficacy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Thus, having learned that Guan and Zhang had already joined Liu Er in brotherhood, the old demon cultivator only then uttered the first line of the fate-prophecy.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
