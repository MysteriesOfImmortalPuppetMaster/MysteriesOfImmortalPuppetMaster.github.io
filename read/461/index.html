<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 461: The Empress in One’s Fate</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The Green Bamboo Tower’s structure was entirely built from bamboo.<br/>
<br/>
There were four bamboo pillars supporting the bamboo tower, each so thick that even if six grown men joined hands to circle it, they still would not encompass it.<br/>
<br/>
Bamboo beams crisscrossed, forming a kind of staircase that wound around the outside of the tower. It resembled a green dragon dancing gracefully, spiraling from the first floor straight up to the third floor’s topmost level, twisting and turning with a lively elegance.<br/>
<br/>
Following these bamboo stair steps, and led by a waiter from the establishment, Ning Zhuo reached the third floor.<br/>
<br/>
This place had already been fully reserved by Shuang Jing.<br/>
<br/>
“General Shuang,” Ning Zhuo bowed in greeting.<br/>
<br/>
This time, he had been invited by Shuang Jing to have morning tea.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, at the Little Bird Tower, Shuang Jing had tried to recruit Ning Zhuo as a retainer, but Ning Zhuo had tactfully said he needed to consider it.<br/>
<br/>
Now Shuang Jing had chosen another day to invite him again, making his intentions quite clear.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing motioned for Ning Zhuo to sit.<br/>
<br/>
Morning tea and pastries were respectfully served by the waiters.<br/>
<br/>
But Shuang Jing said, “No need to rush to eat or drink. I invited Advisor Ning today because there’s a good show to watch.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was slightly taken aback, and then he heard a burst of commotion.<br/>
<br/>
A troop of cultivators rode in on fine horses, passing straight through the bustling streets and arriving directly opposite the Green Bamboo Tower, at the military grain depot.<br/>
<br/>
The leader was none other than Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
“General Mu, please wait…” The cultivator guarding the depot had not finished speaking when Mulan swept him aside with a wave of her hand, sending him flying.<br/>
<br/>
But Mulan still dismounted, walked up to the tightly shut main gate of the grain depot, and suddenly raised her foot.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was surprised: “What happened here? Why is General Mulan so furious?”<br/>
<br/>
Bang!<br/>
<br/>
The main gate was kicked open by her.<br/>
<br/>
The granary chief rushed out anxiously: “General Mu, please calm your anger, please calm down!”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan snorted coldly: “Where’s Zhao Yuan? Tell him to get out here! Time and again blocking the grain for my Red Flower Battalion —does he really think our Red Flower Battalion is made of mud?!”<br/>
<br/>
“Hmph, the supervisory official is here! General Mu, cease your slander.” Zhao Yuan appeared.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan and Zhao Yuan began arguing loudly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo listened and understood that this was because the Red Flower Battalion had not received the latest batch of rations and pay.<br/>
<br/>
“Mulan once left in anger before everyone’s eyes and does not get along with Zhao Yuan,” he thought.<br/>
<br/>
“Afterward, the military supplies were withheld from the Red Flower Battalion once. I had to use treasure resources to settle it.”<br/>
<br/>
“And now it’s happening again?”<br/>
<br/>
“This is suspicious. The army just experienced an ambush and returned to Green Forest Immortal City, suffering countless casualties. At such a time, morale needs to be upheld with rations. Yet Zhao Yuan is pulling the same trick again —this is unwise!”<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo had only met Zhao Yuan a few times, he had gathered some intelligence and knew that, though Zhao Yuan was stingy and greedy, he did have some talent and awareness of the bigger picture. Otherwise, the royal family would not have repeatedly trusted him with tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Bang!<br/>
<br/>
Mulan, enraged, struck out. Zhao Yuan was prepared, continually using procedures and regulations as excuses. Infuriated, she landed a palm strike that sent Zhao Yuan flying.<br/>
<br/>
“Zhao dog! You dare keep making excuses, you really don’t put me, the Grand General, in your eyes.”<br/>
<br/>
“Today, this batch of rations and pay, my Red Flower Battalion will definitely take!”<br/>
<br/>
“No, you cannot enter!” Zhao Yuan, lying on the ground and spitting blood, shouted to stop her.<br/>
<br/>
Saying this, she headed straight into the grain depot.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers behind Mulan, seeing the supervisory official in such a pitiful state, felt secretly delighted. They followed Mulan in single file.<br/>
<br/>
However, once Mulan barged inside, she found the granary completely empty.<br/>
<br/>
Her expression changed slightly, a sense of foreboding welling up.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Yuan climbed back up and blocked the doorway, shouting sternly: “Mulan! You are overbearing and audacious. Not only did you assault a superior officer, you also forcibly entered the granary.”<br/>
<br/>
“Our newly arrived rations and pay were robbed by the Old Stone Monster yesterday on the road! The matter is of great military importance. To prevent morale from wavering, I concealed the truth by mentioning only procedural issues to delay your collection.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yet you slander me, saying I’m making things difficult for you!”<br/>
<br/>
“I, Zhao Yuan, have always acted openly and honestly. When have I ever made things difficult for you?”<br/>
<br/>
“You beat me up, you disregard me, the supervisory official and emissary from the capital. What are you trying to do? Do you intend to rebel?!”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan’s face turned ashen. She spun around abruptly, her gaze like arrows, fixed fiercely on Zhao Yuan.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers behind her, who never expected things to unfold this way, each showed confused expressions.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Yuan put on a look as if being wrongly accused. Yet Mulan could sense the intense delight, ruthlessness, and schadenfreude hidden in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Above in the Green Bamboo Tower, seeing the desired development, Shuang Jing smiled, picked up his cup, and began to drink tea.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, like Shuang Jing, used his spiritual sense to observe the progress of events.<br/>
<br/>
“The Old Stone Monster attacked the grain transport? After the ambush battle, our side must have sent out strong experts to search everywhere. He actually dared to linger without fleeing?!” Ning Zhuo asked Shuang Jing.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing looked indignant: “The Old Stone Monster’s methods are formidable. His earth-traveling technique leaves no trace of escaping. It is both fast and hidden. Fortunately, this time the loss to the transport team wasn’t large.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained silent.<br/>
<br/>
He indeed intended to scheme against Mulan, but this was not his doing!<br/>
<br/>
“In order to scheme for the Grand Marshal’s Mansion, the high-levels of Twin Rivers Nation actually attacked their own grain transport teams.”<br/>
<br/>
“I never thought the political struggle within Twin Rivers Nation would be this intense!”<br/>
<br/>
“Shuang Jing inviting me this time, making me witness Mulan’s current predicament, must be his way of exerting pressure on me?”<br/>
<br/>
“So this is the so-called method of combining both carrot and stick. Heh.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sneered inwardly.<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, the next moment, Shuang Jing spoke with deep meaning: “Our nation’s Grand Marshal Mu has been bedridden for many years. Once, he was the military pillar of our nation. Leading the Red Flower Battalion, he swept the battlefields, pacified the northern demon scourge, subdued the enemy chieftains in the west, cleared out the demonic miasma in the east, and vanquished the various barbarians of the southern range. Truly, his war achievements were illustrious.”<br/>
<br/>
“But a hero grows old, and so it is now.”<br/>
<br/>
“His only descendant, Mulan, is indeed ambitious but lacking ability. With her mere Golden Core cultivation, how can she support the Grand Marshal’s Mansion?”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing sighed: “Our Twin Rivers Nation is a small nation; we must cherish every bit of national strength.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Grand Marshal’s Mansion occupies too many national resources yet contributes too little.”<br/>
<br/>
“For the sake of the country, Mulan should yield her position to someone more capable, that would be the proper course.”<br/>
<br/>
“But our sovereign is kind-hearted and cannot bring himself to act. We ministers, receiving the ruler’s bounty, must be loyal and share his burdens. It is only natural to do something about it.”<br/>
<br/>
“I hope that this time, General Mulan will understand the situation, and withdraw graciously.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained silent.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing continued: “The situation changes easily, and strength and weakness alternate. Such is the common truth of the world.”<br/>
<br/>
“In my view, talents like Advisor Ning, young and brilliant, represent the future and the hope.”<br/>
<br/>
“Like a bird choosing a branch to perch on, as long as you recognize a good tree, you will achieve greatness. As for small trees like the Three Generals Battalion, or sickly trees like the Red Flower Battalion, if they delay Advisor Ning’s accomplishments, wouldn’t that be a pity?”<br/>
<br/>
“What do you think, Advisor Ning?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head, fixed his gaze on Shuang Jing, and slowly stood up.<br/>
<br/>
He first cupped his hands in salute, then said: “Lord Shuang Jing, this humble official is loyal and sincere, knowing that matters of state are of great importance and that my heart must remain with the sovereign. How could one presume to guess the sovereign’s intentions? A loyal minister must speak forthrightly, not scheme secretly or manipulate from behind. To serve the country faithfully, how can we act arbitrarily and plot against others? Without a clear directive from the sovereign, who would dare undertake private actions? If we act on baseless assumptions, would we not be harming both the nation and ourselves?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s face was stern, brimming with righteousness: “As for your so-called ‘yielding position to the worthy,’ it is not something I can conspire in. A loyal subject should be loyal to the sovereign and assist his governance. How can we decide matters of state on our own?”<br/>
<br/>
“Paths differ, and thus we cannot work together. Please forgive this junior for lacking the good fortune to serve as your retainer, Lord Shuang Jing. Ning Zhuo takes his leave now!”<br/>
<br/>
With these words, Ning Zhuo flicked his sleeves and departed, stepping quickly down the stairs and leaving the building.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing was stunned on the spot, watching Ning Zhuo step into the street and disappear into the crowd without looking back. Only then did he chuckle softly.<br/>
<br/>
“I thought that since he came from a great clan, he would understand the ways of power.”<br/>
<br/>
“I never expected him to be such a young greenhorn.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well… Ning Zhuo is only sixteen, hot-blooded. It does make sense.”<br/>
<br/>
“Perhaps his family allowed him to journey abroad precisely to educate him, so he would understand the world and human nature?”<br/>
<br/>
“Heh, so be it.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing’s interest in Ning Zhuo mainly stemmed from Ning Zhuo’s prophetic poem.<br/>
<br/>
But divination, even for those most skilled, cannot be accurate every single time.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike Liu Er, Shuang Jing did not consider Ning Zhuo indispensable. He was merely a nice addition if he could be won over.<br/>
<br/>
He bore the Shuang surname and was a Nascent Soul-level cultivator. Inviting Ning Zhuo twice and showing such courtesy in recruitment was already an act of lowering himself to value talent.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, this second attempt to exert pressure backfired.<br/>
<br/>
Though Shuang Jing felt disappointed and regretful, he accepted it as it was.<br/>
<br/>
His real target was still the Red Flower Battalion, still Mulan!<br/>
<br/>
“Originally, I thought only after the great battle would the Red Flower Battalion be weakened, but I never expected that a single ambush would be enough.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Grand Marshal’s Mansion —Mulan —both shall be mine!”<br/>
<br/>
At the same time—<br/>
<br/>
An old demon cultivator stood on a mountain peak, gazing at Green Forest Immortal City in the distance.<br/>
<br/>
He wore a robe of yellow and white hues. His ears were long and pointed, lined with golden-tinged fur, and behind his robe trailed a fox’s tail.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes swirled with misty clouds, flickering in and out of illusion.<br/>
<br/>
After observing for a while, the old demon cultivator nodded contentedly: “Destiny has stirred to this point, the time has come, finally it has come.”<br/>
<br/>
He then descended the mountain and walked toward Green Forest Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Wherever he passed, it was as if he were invisible. Those around him did not notice him, and even the city’s great protective formation did not react.<br/>
<br/>
In the city’s alleys, he saw Mulan and her subordinates leaving the city without having secured their rations, and after some calculation, he nodded again, pleased: “Their fortune is declining, great calamity approaches. Good, good, very good!”<br/>
<br/>
Finally, he arrived outside the Third General Battalion and released his spiritual sense, calling someone forth.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the camp, Liu Er, learning that Ning Zhuo had gone again to meet Shuang Jing, was pacing in his tent, troubled and anxious.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he heard the old demon cultivator’s voice transmission and was both shocked and overjoyed. He immediately concealed himself, slipped out of camp, and met the old demon cultivator in a forested mountain area.<br/>
<br/>
“Teacher, why have you come?” Liu Er bowed in greeting.<br/>
<br/>
The old demon cultivator stroked his beard and smiled: “Little Six, you are determined to rebuild my Bloodslaughter Immortal Kingdom. Tell me, have you made any progress?”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er recounted his recent circumstances in detail to his teacher.<br/>
<br/>
The old demon cultivator nodded slightly: “You bear the mandate of a king. Once you emerge, valiant generals will come to serve you. Now it seems that Guan Hong and Zhang Hei are indeed your destined left and right arms.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er exclaimed, “Teacher, you have given me a fate-prophecy? What comes next? Will Military Advisor Ning Zhuo leave me?”<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo?” The old demon cultivator shook his head. “He is not important. My purpose this time is something else.”<br/>
<br/>
“This is the Yinyang One Qi Kettle, a treasure of the imperial dynasty. I give it to you now.”<br/>
<br/>
“From now on, use this treasure wisely!”<br/>
<br/>
“Teacher, Teacher!” Liu Er, somewhat dazed, came back to his senses, and in his arms was only the treasured flask. The old demon cultivator had already vanished without a trace.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er called out several times, then shook his head and sighed: “Teacher is still as mysterious as ever …Ah, never mind.”<br/>
<br/>
He put away the flask and stealthily returned to camp.<br/>
<br/>
The old demon cultivator had not truly left, continuing to watch Liu Er until he disappeared from view. He muttered in his heart: “Liu Er, that Mulan is the empress destined for you.”<br/>
<br/>
“With the Yinyang One Qi Kettle, you can successfully propose marriage, become the Grand Marshal’s son-in-law, and thus gain legitimate status. You’ll escape the awkwardness of being a human-demon half-blood and truly integrate into the higher ranks.”<br/>
<br/>
“The world now is already the world of humankind.”<br/>
<br/>
“The hope of rebuilding my Bloodslaughter Immortal Kingdom rests upon you. You must live up to it!”<br/>
<br/>
The old demon cultivator could not directly reveal Liu Er’s fate.<br/>
<br/>
He had inherited the legacy of the Bloodslaughter Imperial Dynasty and was extremely skilled in divination. He could give someone a fate-prophecy with a sixty to seventy percent accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
But this technique had a drawback —he had to not speak of it openly.<br/>
<br/>
If he revealed it prematurely, it would lose its efficacy.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, having learned that Guan and Zhang had already joined Liu Er in brotherhood, the old demon cultivator only then uttered the first line of the fate-prophecy.</div>
