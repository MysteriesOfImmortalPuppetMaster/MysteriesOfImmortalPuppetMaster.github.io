<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 283: The First "Entry Standard"!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Clang, clang, clang...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The sound of the bell echoed across the square in front of the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Before thirty-three desks, the expressions of the cultivators were not pleasant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Some frowned deeply, others had faces as calm as still water, and some felt both physically and mentally whipped upon hearing the bell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This was because new information had been transmitted to their mindsâ€”the first round of the palace examination had ended, and all cultivators were to cease answering questions. Those who disobeyed would be disqualified from the subsequent rounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Thus, the cultivators reluctantly put down the jade slips in their hands, their faces filled with bitterness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"I haven't finished answering yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Why did time pass so quickly?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"I tried to answer everything, even though I knew some were wrong. But isn't it better to answer than not? Shouldn't I get some encouragement points?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The thoughts of the cultivators were similar, as they secretly prayed to pass this round smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The position of the palace master of the Lava Immortal Palace was at stake, and these people were the elite among those who had infiltrated the Immortal Palace, naturally harboring ambitions. No one wanted to be eliminated in the first round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Information continued to be transmitted to everyone, instructing the cultivators to wait for a moment as the papers would be graded immediately, and results would be announced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Thus, the cultivators in the square took this time to quickly exchange answers and discuss the questions with each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhu Xuanji, however, was lost in thought alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">At this moment, the Book Master approached him: "Lord Zhu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Book Master smiled and asked, "Do you think the frequently mentioned 'Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique' and 'Demonic Blood Vein Technique' in the jade slip, along with the 'Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique', form a set, the supreme arts inherited by the Lava Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zhu Xuanji was pondering this very question. Upon hearing the inquiry, he looked up and admitted, "I was just contemplating the snippets about these two techniques in the test. I think they seem like a set." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"However, to truly confirm, we would need to consult a cultivator like City Lord Meng Kui for calculations." The Book Master nodded: "I wonder if the Demonic Dao Scripture in Lord Zhu's possession might be for sale?" This was the Book Master's true intention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">During the Golden Core stage melee, the Demonic Dao Scripture appeared, although it was eventually revealed as a fake. But there was still some truth to it, as Ning Zhuo had released some genuine parts of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to gain trust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Golden core cultivators who had come into contact with the scripture knew some of the content of the first few layers of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">However, the Book Master had not participated at that time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Despite his desire, he belonged to the All-Book Pavilion, a renowned neutral force that could not casually involve itself in local disputes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Therefore, the Book Master knew nothing about the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He wanted to purchase it from Zhu Xuanji, but was immediately refused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Before the first palace examination, Zhu Xuanji might have been tempted by the Book Master's high price to sell part of the technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">But now, having just completed the first round of the jade slip exam, Zhu Xuanji had used some knowledge of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to answer questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This further confirmed the value of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique. At this critical stage of the palace examination, he could not sell it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Book Master sighed and had to bid farewell to Zhu Xuanji, seeking other breakthroughs with the Zheng and Zhou families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Watching the Book Master's departing figure, Zhu Xuanji's gaze was deep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Currently, the ranking list showed the Book Master in second place, making him Zhu Xuanji's greatest rival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">On the other side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Brother, how did you do?" Zheng Shuangjun asked Zheng Danlian with concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zheng Danlian snorted coldly, suppressing his inner frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">During the palace examination, he almost wanted to take out his scythe and chop the desk in half!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zheng Danlian said, "The Three Sects Master is nothing special. Before holding the palace examination, he should have spread the Three Sects Supreme Arts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zhou Nongying added, "We've already discussed this. It's likely that the beast attack on the palace caused the examination to be brought forward. Originally, there should have been a transmission of the arts." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Jiufan agreed, "Or perhaps, in the subsequent stages of entering the Immortal Palace, the Three Sects Supreme Arts should have been included." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zheng Shuangjun shook his head with a wry smile, "No matter, no matter, we're all in the same boat, the rankings shouldn't change too much." Almost all the cultivators shared the same thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Except for Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhou Zeshen approached Ning Zhuo to inquire about his feelings regarding this palace examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly, "This time, I'm afraid I messed up. Alas, I might miss a life-changing opportunity!" Zhou Zeshen felt relieved and comforted him, "Everyone is in the same situation, Brother Ning, don't worry too much."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo shook his head, "We Qi Refining cultivators can't compare to those Golden Core cultivators. Their perspectives are much broader. Even if they don't know the Three Sects Supreme Arts, they can answer based on their understanding." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"For us, it's not the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhou Zeshen nodded, sighing, "I feel the same way, Brother Ning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">In another corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Yang Chanyu approached Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Sun Lingtong wore a conflicted expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yang Chanyu couldn't help but worry, "Hey, you Foundation Establishment cultivator, how did you do?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"You're too young and your cultivation is weak, don't leave too many blanks and get eliminated." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"If I'm left to participate in the subsequent palace examinations alone, I'll have to increase my share of the profits by another ten percent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Sun Lingtong sneered, rolling his eyes at Yang Chanyu, "Woman, just you wait."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He quickly glanced at Ning Zhuo in the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">After obtaining the Three Sects Supreme Arts, Ning Zhuo had shared them all with Sun Lingtong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo could answer fully, but Sun Lingtong could not.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Because he was acting under Ning Zhuo's name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Thus, even though he knew the answers to many questions, he couldn't answer them correctly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sun Lingtong had to consider the situation when the palace examination results were announced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Thus, the entire palace examination was extremely conflicting for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Balancing this was incredibly difficult!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The cultivators' exchanges were suddenly interrupted by incoming information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"The first round of the palace examination, the rankings are as follows:" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Entry Standard." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Book Master." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Zhu Xuanji."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The crowd was in an uproar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The first place was simply too, too, too eye-catching!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Entry Standard?!" Everyone turned their shocked, angry, hateful, and disdainful gazes towards Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Even with Sun Lingtong's audacity, being suddenly targeted by so many people made him involuntarily swallow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Yang Chanyu snorted coldly, stepping forward to shield Sun Lingtong behind her, she let out a mocking laugh, "Anyone who wants to be disqualified from the Lava Immortal Palace and lose their palace examination qualification, feel free to make a move!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The eyes of the crowd almost spewed out raging flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"This Void Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"I didn't expect them to infiltrate so deeply, to be so familiar with the Three Sects Supreme Arts!!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"If Sun Lingtong knew the Three Sects Supreme Arts, how could he only practice his Boy Arts?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"This is clearly cheating, blatant cheating!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"We worked hard to answer honestly in the palace examination, and this sneaky thief blatantly cheats?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Alas, I should have expected this. Sun Lingtong, being in the Foundation Establishment stage, could enter the Immortal Palace. He took advantage of the high cultivation levels. It seems the Void Sect has grasped a huge loophole in the Lava Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Where is the palace spirit? Someone is cheating!!! Please punish them swiftly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The cultivators were furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The dragon turtle fire spirit, having observed the entire process, rolled its eyes, feeling utterly powerless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Because it knew the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">It growled, "What you should really be concerned about is Ning Zhuo! That little monster!!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Seeing everyone in the dark, seeing "Ning Zhuo" inconspicuously ranked in the middle of the list â€” this made the dragon turtle fire spirit feel deeply powerless. The chill in its heart grew even stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong let out a long sigh of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He had successfully completed the task, not letting his score stand out too much, allowing Ning Zhuo to remain hidden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Yang Chanyu suddenly hugged him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Such an intimate gesture made Sun Lingtong extremely uncomfortable, and he pushed her away with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Yang Chanyu, what are you doing?!" Sun Lingtong shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Yang Chanyu's eyes were fervent, staring intently at Sun Lingtong, "Amazing, you little rascal, you've really brought glory to our Void Sect." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"How did you do it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Did you really get the Three Sects Supreme Arts, or did you cheat?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Quick, tell me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong shook his head, "Ah, you're so annoying."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Watching Sun Lingtong from afar, Ning Zhuo also relaxed quietly, feeling quite gratified, "The boss is trustworthy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The name Ning Zhuo was inconspicuous on the list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">New information was transmitted again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Combining the merit list and the examination rankings, the new rankings are as follows:" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Zhu Xuanji." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Book Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Zheng Danlian." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Entry Standard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Zhou Zeshen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"How is this possible?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"I â€” I didn't make it?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The cultivators in the last ten positions on the list changed color, some cried out in pain, others were disheartened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo noticed that there wasn't a single Golden Core cultivator among them, about half were trial disciples, and the other half were Foundation Establishment cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Golden Core cultivators' perspectives and knowledge were still deep enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The questions in the jade slip were limited to the Qi Refining stage, with a few reaching the Foundation Establishment stage. Therefore, even if the Golden Core cultivators didn't know the Three Sects Supreme Arts, they could cleverly answer based on their knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">On the other hand, the reason no Golden Core cultivator was eliminated was due to their previous merits, ranking high on the list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The trial disciples who were eliminated suffered from a lack of knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">As for the Foundation Establishment cultivators, it was likely due to both reasons. They lacked merits and their knowledge was not on par with the Golden Core cultivators, showing less effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
