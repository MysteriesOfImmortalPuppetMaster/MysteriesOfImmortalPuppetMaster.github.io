<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Ning Clan cultivators were about to fall into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“Shut up!” Ning Zhanji decisively roared. “If it really is Zheng Shuanggou who wants to harm us, none of us can escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“But that’s unlikely to be the case. If the Zheng Clan wanted to do something, why would they attack us little people? That would only be beating the grass and startling the snake[^1].</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“We won’t be their first choice of target.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">After calming the team down, Ning Zhanji suddenly saw someone wielding twin hooks rushing around in the horde of monster beasts and killing their way through one of the passages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"It's Zheng Shuanggou!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“That’s his signature weapon, the Sun-Moon Hooks.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Phew, he's not here to deal with us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Ning Clan cultivators finally let go of their worries. But the next moment, their expressions grew grim again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">As more and more monster beasts attacked them, the pressure on the defensive formations also increased dramatically. Ning Zhanji had to send small groups of people to kill monster beasts outside the formations in order to relieve some of the pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After all, these formations had been set up hastily and couldn’t be relied on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">With the never-ending assault of fierce monster beasts, and in spite of the Ning Clan cultivators’ desperate counterattacks, the outermost ice curtain quickly broke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The dome cover also didn’t last long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Fortunately, the Ning Clan cultivators had managed to set up a fourth formation during this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Everyone huddled within the pillar of light, exerting all possible efforts to defend their position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Yong’s face was pale and his body was trembling: “Are we going to die here today?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Chen’s calmness had long disappeared, and his face was full of panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo had a similar expression; however, a faint light flickered in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Boom, boom, boom!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Suddenly, three explosions echoed out, and the ground shook violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The monster beasts fled frantically as a dark figure burst through the wall and rushed into the underground clearing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Then, Zheng Shuanggou, the Golden Core cultivator of the Zheng Clan, also appeared and gave chase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Little rat, you dare covet the immortal palace? Die for me!” Zheng Shuanggou roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zheng Shuanggou slashed with all his strength, causing a five-meter-long ray of blade qi to sweep out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The black shadow laughed loudly in a hoarse voice: “The treasures of this world of cultivation shall be obtained by their fated ones. You little clans of Fire Persimmon Immortal City want to swallow up the Lava Immortal Palace by yourselves? Dream on!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">As it spoke, the black shadow parried the blade qi and used the impact force to fly backward toward the Ning Clan cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhanji’s heart pounded in alarm. He immediately moved to the center of the formation and shouted: “I’m taking over the formation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The defensive formation immediately shone with unprecedented brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">However, when the black shadow arrived in front of the formation, it merely waved a hand and caused the whole formation to shatter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Then, it waved its hand again, and numerous cultivators immediately fell down. Their bodies were unharmed, but they were no longer alive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Demonic cultivator! How dare you!” Zheng Shuanggou rushed over furiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The black shadow demonic cultivator turned around and resumed fighting Zheng Shuanggou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Sir Ning Zhanji!" The Ning Clan cultivators shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But Ning Zhanji had fallen to the ground, eyes wide open in death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">With the loss of both their leader and the defensive formation, in the face of the incoming horde of monster beasts, the Ning Clan cultivators could only scatter in all directions!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Casualties began rising almost instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">At this critical moment, Ning Zhuo suddenly shouted: “Go to the passage where the Golden Core cultivators came from! There won’t be as many monster beasts there!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">After hearing this reminder, the panicked Ning Clan cultivators were all jolted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Right!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“That passage was cleaned out by two Golden Core cultivators. There shouldn’t be many monster beasts left!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Let’s go!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">And so, the Ning Clan cultivators once again joined up and rushed toward the passage entrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Ning Yong, Ning Chen, follow me!” Ning Zhuo pulled out numerous frost talismans and scattered them everywhere. These talismans all came from his time in the academy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Yong and Ning Chen both subconsciously followed Ning Zhuo, eyes red and fighting with all their might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Barely holding on with each other’s help, the trio followed the other Ning Clan members and entered the passage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Behind them, the two Golden Core cultivators were still fighting fiercely, sending monster beasts fleeing in all directions. Many monster beasts fled in the same direction as the Ning Clan, rushing over to the same passage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The entrance to the passage was full of monster beast corpses with few survivors, but more and more monster beasts continued pouring in from behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Under such pressure, the Ning Clan cultivators had no choice but to keep running deeper into the passage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Kill! Kill! Kill!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">As they ran, they encountered some monster beasts blocking the way. But every single one of these monster beasts was slaughtered in an instant by the desperate Ning Clan cultivators running for their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“What’s that?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"The Lava Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“So this passage actually led to the Lava Immortal Palace!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Ning Clan cultivators arrived at a lava lake, where they could see a small portion of the immortal palace peeking out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Lava Immortal Palace…” Ning Zhuo’s expression was quite natural. As an ordinary young man, he was of course shocked to see the immortal palace for the first time. But something no one noticed was the subtle gleam that suddenly appeared in his eyes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Actually, he had already expected this to happen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Next to him, Ning Chen panted: “This isn’t surprising! Didn’t you hear what the two Golden Core cultivators said earlier?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“That black shadow demonic cultivator must have tried to sneak in, but got caught by Zheng Shuanggou!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Right now, the Ning Clan cultivators were in a very bad situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">In front of them, there was a lava lake revealing the tip of the immortal palace. Behind, there was an unending stream of fierce monster beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Left with no other choice, the remaining Ning Clan cultivators could only set up defensive formations again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">They set up two formations, one inside the other. The pressure from the monster beasts was much weaker than when they were in the underground clearing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“We can stop them!” The Ning Clan cultivators had only just felt relief when a loud boom echoed out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Where do you think you’re going!?” Zheng Shuanggou’s voice was closer than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Ning Clan cultivators suddenly felt as if they had fallen into an icy cave. Obviously, that black shadow demonic cultivator was coming back to kill again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Looks like we’re all going to die today!” Ning Yong’s face was utterly pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Chen simply closed his eyes in despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The spark of hope that had just ignited was now ruthlessly extinguished. The two newbies had completely lost their fighting spirit after falling from heaven to hell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Yeah, we’re going to die. But so what!” Ning Zhuo suddenly shouted. “Better to die fighting than to die hiding away!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Incited by these words, Ning Yong’s expression changed. He mustered his last bit of courage and stood tall with gritted teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Chen opened his eyes and looked at Ning Zhuo, secretly admiring his classmate’s courage in the face of death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Newfound bravery welled up within him as well: “Ah Zhuo, well said! Dying at the hands of a Golden Core cultivator in front of the Lava Immortal Palace is a worthy death.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">As soon as he finished speaking, a huge cloud of thick smoke rushed over. This thick smoke was pitch-black and contained a surging energy that could block divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Masses of shadows flew out from the black smoke, turning into countless shadow snakes that rushed toward the Lava Immortal Palace in the lava lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But before they could make it halfway, these terrifying pythons all dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Zheng Shuanggou’s furious roar echoed out: “Attacking the immortal palace? Don’t even think about it!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">A moment later, the snakes reappeared; this time, rather than attacking the immortal palace, they struck out toward the passages in the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Under their crazed assault, the walls of the passages cracked and nearly collapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“This lunatic!” Seeing this scene, even Zheng Shuanggou felt his heart go cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He had no choice but to switch from offense to defense, using all his strength and surging magical power to protect the passages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Suddenly, a long shadow snake shot out from the black smoke and struck the Ning Clan’s formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Naturally, a Golden Core-level attack wasn’t something the Ning Clan’s formation could withstand. It shattered instantaneously!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Then, black smoke poured in, completely obscuring the vision of the remaining Ning Clan cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Come at me!” Ning Yong shouted at the top of his lungs. Full of courage, he was determined to fight to the death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In the roiling black smoke, nothing could be seen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">All of a sudden, Ning Zhuo was completely alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He took out the token and summoned the Iron Will Gray Armor. As the iron armor covered his body, his battle prowess immediately rose to Foundation Establishment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">[^1]: Beat the grass and startle the snake – 打草驚蛇 – Basically he’s saying that hurting the team would expose the Zheng Clan’s intentions before they’re ready.</paragraph><br/><br/>
