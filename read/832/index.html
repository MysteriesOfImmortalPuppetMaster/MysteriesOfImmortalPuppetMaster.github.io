<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">When a cultivator dies, or simply when their soul leaves their body while still alive to occupy another person’s shell, this is known as soul possession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">However, doing so usually triggers a conflict between the soul and the physical body. After all, they are not the original set but foreign objects to each other; rejection phenomena will almost always occur, causing a weakening of both.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But as the cultivation world has developed to this day, becoming extremely prosperous with various cultivation arts and techniques emerging and evolving endlessly, the technical standard of soul possession has become increasingly higher and more advanced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">In comparison, cases of a mighty figure reincarnating are much rarer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Reincarnation implies being reborn through a womb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">There is a distinction between rebirth through a womb and possession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Even occupying the body of a fetus in the womb will trigger mutual rejection. In fact, if the soul is too strong, it will cause the extremely fragile physical body of the infant to perish, and may even affect the mother’s body. After all, there is a tight connection via the umbilical cord between the pregnant woman and the infant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The soul and physical body need to be balanced and coordinated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Take Ning Zhuo as a reference. Even though his physical body and soul were original, there was a time when his soul was at the level of a million human souls, oppressing his physical body and causing a situation where the body could not bear the burden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Reincarnation implies abandoning the soul, leaving only a wisp of true spirit to fall into the primeval state, with the placenta forming from nothing. Both the physical body and the soul are original.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">If achieved, the soul and physical body are naturally coordinated and balanced. The difficulty here lies in memory and the self.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Because reincarnation involves abandoning the soul, it is extremely easy to lose the soul of the previous life. If the memories are never recovered, one eventually grows into a completely new person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This requires the cultivation technique of "reception and guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Historically, there was a period when mutual reception between master and disciple was very prevalent. After the master died, their memories were temporarily kept by the disciple. Once the reincarnation was successful, the disciple would search for the master’s body in the current life, receive them, take them as their own disciple, and then gradually instill the memories of the previous life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Because of this cultivation technique, the social relationship between master and disciple was once extremely prevalent, overshadowing families, alliances, and other forms of organization.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">By the Ming Emperor era, this technique of reincarnation reached a completely new height.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Buddhist Sect pushed this technique to a brand-new level and used it as a foundation to develop a completely new method of cultivation. In Buddhist terminology, they call it - Samsara.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The five high-level members of Heavy Formation Peak began to suspect that Ning Zhuo was the reincarnation of a mighty figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This was because the drawbacks of soul possession still existed in significant numbers and were easily detected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Wen Renyan said, "When Ning Zhuo first participated in the Nine Twists Corridor Formation, he stopped at the third twist. I specifically reviewed his formation-breaking process at that time and found that he was quite immature and superficial in the Dao of formations. In the second twist, he could only use clumsy methods of constant trial and error."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"I feel like he wasn't acting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"But afterwards, he suddenly advanced by leaps and bounds, progressing a thousand li in a day, as if he had suddenly been enlightened."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Chunyu Gui scratched his head: "Are you saying he was stimulated, and his past life memories suddenly awakened?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Wen Renyan smiled faintly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Shan Guhong said coldly, "There is no hard proof."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Chunyu Gui said, "Isn't hard proof simple? As the Flying Cloud Assembly continues, every time identity tokens are switched, cultivators are subjected to assessment tests. These tests will become increasingly high-end and strict, eventually revealing the truth and leaving no place for anyone to hide."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Not only can real age not be concealed, but the true cultivation art practiced will be exposed, and real battle records will be revealed. Not to mention soul possession, even if a mighty figure returns through reincarnation, they will be tested out. This has been verified time and again in the past."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The other four nodded one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">They all had extreme confidence in the foundation of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This was also why the Myriad Manifestations Sect had the confidence to recruit outsiders widely. Otherwise, attracting outsiders to join without any defenses would be suicidal, even for a super sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Myriad Manifestations Sect had many unique means to effectively distinguish friend from foe and investigate the truth. In the past, they had stopped the conspiracies of countless external forces and deterred countless sect members who wanted to engage in internal strife.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Chunyu Gui continued, "So, what we really need to discuss today is whether we should fight for Ning Zhuo. If we do fight for Ning Zhuo, what kind of force should we apply, and what methods should we use?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The room fell silent again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The current situation was quite complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">If Ning Zhuo was a case of soul possession or a reincarnated mighty figure, this would be a huge hidden danger. If exposed in the future, it would inevitably impact the reputation of Heavy Formation Peak. And the five high-level members present responsible for recruiting him would all be implicated and punished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Reputation is the pursuit of the Righteous Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">If recruited incorrectly, creating a negative impact that Heavy Formation Peak lacked the ability to judge character, it would trigger public disdain and mockery, causing severe damage to Heavy Formation Peak's reputation. The consequences caused by this are often more serious than imagined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Just like the Confucian cultivator group in the Myriad Manifestations Sect. They were previously on the fast track of development and growth, but unexpectedly, a figure like Qin De appeared, dealing a tragic blow to the group's reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">So much so that even today, Confucian cultivators like Duanmu Zhang have to rack their brains and try every possible way to positively resolve the huge historical legacy problem of Qin De.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo's situation involved more than just doubts about possession or reincarnation. If Heavy Formation Peak wanted to recruit him, there were other powerful competitors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">One was Zhong Dao, and the other was Tuoba Huang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The former was the current Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall, and the latter was the current Peak Master of Myriad Beast Peak. Both were figures with the most real power. The overall structure of the Myriad Manifestations Sect consisted of only Eight Peaks and Sixteen Halls!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Chunyu Gui scratched his chin and said, "I somewhat understand Ning Zhuo's confidence in rejecting Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang now. If he really is a reincarnated mighty figure, naturally he has unyielding pride and confidence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Perhaps, the reason Ning Zhuo swept through the formation trials after rejecting the two lords is also because he wants to borrow the existence of our Heavy Formation Peak to offset the influence of Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Tracing back the source of many of Ning Zhuo's attempts in the Generating Clouds Minor Trials, most were subsidiary forces of Heavy Formation Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Recruiting Ning Zhuo carried risks, but not recruiting him was also troublesome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">If there was no problem with Ning Zhuo himself, or if he concealed it past the Myriad Manifestations Sect's detection methods, once he grew up, he would definitely bring help to his affiliated force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">If they missed out on a genius like Ning Zhuo, the five high-level members of Heavy Formation Peak currently on rotation would inevitably be blamed and punished afterwards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ouyang Lin said, "Perhaps, Ning Zhuo is simply a genius."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Just like my feeling for ice formations. The first time I encountered an ice formation, I knew this was my path! Things others took ten years to learn, I understood at a glance. You guys also thought I wasn't normal, but that's just how I am."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"I possess Innate Talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Ning Zhuo might also possess Innate Talent related to formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Yin Changgeng: "Then, what kind of Innate Talent could allow Ning Zhuo to have such an astonishing performance? The difference between his before and after is too disparate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Shan Guhong: "There are many types of Innate Talent, as numerous as the stars, and new Innate Talents always emerge endlessly. Looking throughout history, there indeed have been many formation-related Innate Talents that allow cultivators to have deep attainment in the Formation Dao at a young age."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"But someone like Ning Zhuo, who has made such huge progress, is truly rare."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"However, if Ning Zhuo deliberately set off some smoke bombs, or even made mistakes himself during the first trial leading to a low score, our speculation here is futile."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ouyang Lin continued, "We don't need to speculate too much; discussing based on the reality before us has more basis."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"You should have also seen it long ago - Ning Zhuo's progress in formations is astonishing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"In the Nine Twists Corridor Formation, he was unskilled when breaking the formation. But by the Earth Fire Abundant Field Formation, he borrowed from the Nine Twists Corridor Formation and used multi-layered formations to solve the problem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"In the Ten Thousand Li Ice Sealing Formation, it wasn't easy for him to find the formation core. But in the Wind and Thunder Formation, the technique he displayed clearly surpassed his time in the Ten Thousand Li Ice Sealing Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"The Five Elements Rotation Formation, Fivefold Gate Formation, Myriad Swords Returning to Origin Formation, Illusion Sea Formation, Heavenly Dipper Formation, Heaven and Earth Shift Formation... his progress in these formations is visible to the naked eye, extremely obvious. Especially when we compare the trials one by one. His progress stands out even more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Yin Changgeng narrowed his eyes: "Put in the context of possession or reincarnation, Ning Zhuo is recovering memories. Put in the context of a genius prodigy, his comprehension is terrifying, and he is growing at extreme speed..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Wen Renyan smiled lightly: "Actually, there is no need to agonize over this question."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"We might as well contact Ning Zhuo privately first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"First explain our purpose, perhaps imply our predicament slightly, and ask Ning Zhuo if he has any intention of joining Heavy Formation Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Since Ning Zhuo rejected Lords Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang one after another, he must have a plan in his heart and his own opinions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Perhaps he never even thought about joining Heavy Formation Peak?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The others were slightly stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">They indeed hadn't thought of this possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Because for a formation genius like Ning Zhuo, Heavy Formation Peak was his best choice. The current Sect Master of the Myriad Manifestations Sect was the Peak Master of Heavy Formation Peak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Heavy Formation Peak was the number one force within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Moreover, generally, those who possessed Ning Zhuo's level of formation attainment inevitably had a strong interest in formations, and even if they didn't, they must have put in huge effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Usually, when the high-level members of Heavy Formation Peak recruited personally, they were successful even with first-rate geniuses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">But now, regarding Ning Zhuo...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The high-level members of Heavy Formation Peak were awakened by Wen Renyan's words. They suddenly realized: Ning Zhuo was different from previous first-rate geniuses; he was rather special.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Yin Changgeng immediately praised Wen Renyan, saying she had awakened the dreamer with a single word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"We should indeed contact him privately, preferably to figure out Ning Zhuo's true thoughts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Since you see it more profoundly than we do, Fellow Daoist Wen Renyan, why don't you take the trouble to contact Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This seemed like a request, but it was actually an order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Among the high-level members present, Yin Changgeng had the highest status, being one of the Vice Peak Masters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Wen Renyan couldn't help but look at Yin Changgeng - the latter narrowed his eyes and smiled, looking full of expectation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">She seriously suspected that Yin Changgeng had long thought of this method but created a situation of discussion to avoid suspicion, waiting until she, Wen Renyan, proposed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">However, Wen Renyan had long heard of Ning Zhuo, and there was no harm in contacting him privately in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"With such talent, Ning Zhuo will surely become great in the future; dealings with him will be unavoidable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Why not take advantage of the fact that he hasn't truly joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect yet, and his cultivation is only at the Foundation Establishment mid-stage, to form a good karmic bond with him in advance?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Thinking of this, Wen Renyan nodded slowly and accepted the task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="173"/>
<paragraph index="175">Blue Stone Cave Dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo had just finished his review.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He sighed deeply, expressing his greatest inner sentiment: "Formations often involve other fields. For example, the Ten Thousand Li Ice Sealing Formation contains the mysteries of the Ice element, and the Five Elements Rotation Formation borrows the power of the Five Elements. The Wind and Thunder Formation, Myriad Swords Returning to Origin Formation, and so on are all like this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"To set up an outstanding formation, having deep attainment in formations alone is not enough; one also needs abilities in other fields."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"I am only eighteen, still only at Foundation Establishment, and haven't been cultivating for long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"The golden age of cultivation is so broad, profound, and full of heroes. I still have much, much to learn."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Just then, the jade pendant at his waist vibrated slightly, emitting a wisp of information that was transmitted into Ning Zhuo's divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">It was Old Chef notifying him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"A flying letter from an important figure?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Recently, Ning Zhuo had been in the limelight, attracting an endless stream of flying letters daily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Old Chef was forced to set aside time every day to carefully inspect these flying letters, screen them, and hand over the most valuable or important ones to Ning Zhuo to handle personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Soon, the flying letter from Wen Renyan was delivered to Ning Zhuo's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo merely scanned it with his divine sense and revealed a faint smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"This is Heavy Formation Peak's reaction. Contacting privately in advance - their methods are flexible. However, this is also one of the possibilities I anticipated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">After thinking for a moment, Ning Zhuo immediately wrote a flying letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This flying letter flew out of the Blue Stone Cave Dwelling, but it did not go to Wen Renyan; instead, it was sent to Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Shen Xi replied quickly, agreeing to the invitation in Ning Zhuo's flying letter and expressing solemn gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Soon, in a private room of a restaurant, Ning Zhuo played the host, inviting both Wen Renyan and Shen Xi, and Su Lingkou also joined the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo did not spare any cost, entertaining them with high-grade wine and delicacies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He presided over the scene, exchanging various formation insights and experiences with Wen Renyan and Shen Xi, demonstrating his own strength while also gaining much from this exchange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Facing Wen Renyan's hints and probing, Ning Zhuo appeared very frank, nearly stating directly that he currently had no plans to join Heavy Formation Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">This declaration shocked Su Lingkou, who found it hard to understand why Ning Zhuo would reject the invitation of the number one faction within the Myriad Manifestations Sect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">As the banquet reached its end, Wen Renyan recruited Shen Xi on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">She expressed that she hadn't expected this trip to be a case of losing at sunrise but gaining at sunset. Although she regretted not recruiting a talent like Ning Zhuo, gaining the genius Shen Xi meant the trip was absolutely not in vain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Shen Xi secretly transmitted a message via divine sense, expressing sincere gratitude to Ning Zhuo. He knew that during the exchange, Ning Zhuo had repeatedly praised him, expressing the help Shen Xi had brought him, and portraying Shen Xi's character and image as a gentle gentleman who sacrificed his own interests for a friend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">This banquet was a stage Ning Zhuo had set up for Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">And Shen Xi had seized this opportunity to fully demonstrate himself.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
