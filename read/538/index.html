<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji’s eyes contained divine light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The entire battlefield was in his view, and at present, everything was within the scope of his arrangements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"The Heavenly and Earthly Twin Ghosts were already famous strong figures, but from another perspective, their widespread reputation was also their weakness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"The greater the fame, the more likely information was to leak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Just one contact battle that made Two Note Country feel pain and humiliation, and given the enormous scale of Two Note Country, they would definitely be able to find a method against the Heavenly and Earthly Twin Ghosts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">For example, Zhenren of the Blazing Sun was urgently dispatched by the royal family of Two Note Country. And the old man’s bronze sundial was even regarded as a national treasure and kept in the national treasury. At this moment, its use immediately crushed the Xuan Yin Frozen Realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This was the profound foundation of a cultivation nation, not a trivial matter and quite unfathomable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth were each simultaneously targeted by four or five Nascent Soul cultivators and suffered a brutal suppression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In an instant, Ning Zhuo and the Three General Camp turned from peril to safety, becoming bystanders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The three generals and Ning Zhuo, as well as Sun Lingtong from within the mechanical dragon, were all panting heavily, their hearts unsettled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The battle just now was really very thrilling!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">It was not long after the battle began that Liu Guan Zhang Ning lost the initiative; for a while, they could only maintain the situation, passively countering move by move, with no way to seize even a trace of the initiative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">If this situation continued any further, Ning Zhuo would only be able to let the soldiers of the Three General Camp suffer slaughter, while he and Sun Lingtong escaped on their own with the help of the mechanical dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Of course, they would also bring along Liu, Guan, and Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">But such a result was obviously not what Ning Zhuo wanted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He had invested a lot in the Three General Camp over a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Although he had regained some losses earlier, if at this moment he gave up the Three General Camp, overall he would still lose a lot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Not just in the calculation of benefits, but emotionally, Ning Zhuo was also unwilling to let go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">On one hand, he and the three generals had developed a tacit understanding, with an increasingly deep combat camaraderie. Ning Zhuo admired Liu Er’s ambition, and from deep within, he was more willing to see Liu Er continuously approach that ambition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Tian Shuang flew swiftly in the high sky, his figure like a long rainbow, crazily twisting, dodging the encirclement of the Nascent Soul cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">His throat knot rolled, and he spat out a pale bone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The bone sphere underwent a deformation in the high sky, transforming into a Ghost Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The next moment, the Ghost Gate swung wide open, from which a large number of ice-crystal ghost souls and snow-bone Luosha emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The ghosts were vast, rolling across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Several Nascent Soul cultivators coldly snorted in unison, each employing their own techniques, and immediately killed countless ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Tian Shuang, today is your death anniversary for next year!" A cultivator in a blue robe with large sleeves let out a light whistle and shot out a flying sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Northern Dipper Exorcism Sword!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The flying sword attracted the light of the North Star, transformed into a thread, pierced Tian Shuang’s brow, and delivered a fatal blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Good! What a fine Northern Dipper Sword Master, what a fine Northern Dipper Exorcism Sword!" Upon seeing this scene, the remaining Nascent Soul cultivators praised in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But in the next moment, Tian Shuang moved again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Not dead yet?" Everyone was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Northern Dipper Sword Master furrowed his brows tightly, looking at Tian Shuang in disbelief: "This is impossible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He was convinced that he had just pierced the vital spot at the Northern Dipper Sword Master’s brow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Crack, crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Starting from the brow of ghost-cultivator Tian Shuang, a large number of cracks rapidly spread across his face. The cracks densely covered, and in a very short time, spread over his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Piece by piece, thin ice peeled off from Tian Shuang’s body, revealing the life aura of others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Wait, aren’t you Heavenly Ghost?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Everyone was astonished. They all sensed that the aura emanating from "Tian Shuang" was not the same as his, but rather -the aura of Earth Ghost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Crack, crack……</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The crisp sounds rang on continuously, with more and more thin ice peeling off, revealing the inner appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Indeed, behind "Tian Shuang’s" mask was the face of Earth Ghost, reduced to half size!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Is this… Ghost Mask Technique?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhenren of the Blazing Sun’s pupils contracted tightly, and he discerned the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Thus, many people looked toward the underground battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">There, the besieged "Di Hui" let out a cold laugh: "Earth Ghost, you useless fellow, you actually ruined my ghost mask first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Look at my use of your ghost mask -it’s even stronger than your own techniques!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Tian Shuang" snorted coldly: "You first undo your encirclement before you come to taunt me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Di Hui laughed heartily: "What is so difficult? Open your eyes wide and watch carefully!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He then immediately made a move, this time not using earth-based techniques, nor methods of the ghost path, but rather ice-based!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Those who were besieging him, originally a group of cultivators targeting the "Earth Ghost", at that moment the "Earth Ghost" suddenly became a "Heavenly Ghost", and the favorable situation they had created immediately collapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">On the other side, the battle situation of the "Heavenly Ghost" was likewise, counterattacking Zhenren of the Blazing Sun, Shan Yue Zi, and others, catching them off guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning watched with unwavering eyes, fully concentrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"It turns out that the Earth Ghost is the Heavenly Ghost, and the Heavenly Ghost is the Earth Ghost!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Ghost Mask Technique… It is said that this method of ghost cultivation can borrow the power of a great ghost, forming a ghost mask. Once worn, one can impersonate the borrowed great ghost for a period of time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"The Heavenly and Earthly Twin Ghosts cultivated the Ghost Mask Technique, borrowing each other’s power. They indulged in this technique so much that such ghost masks nearly covered their entire bodies, infinitely close to a divine power! Truly formidable!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning were all magnanimous individuals; even if they were mortal enemies, it did not prevent them from viewing things objectively and openly praising.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The situation of Two Note Country rapidly turned for the worse!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">They were indeed caught off guard by this change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Many of the methods were too targeted, but the Heavenly and Earthly Twin Ghosts suddenly changed their identity, causing many of their schemes to fall through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Not only that, they were also turned around and targeted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">In the previous battle, Ning Zhuo had already experienced that the nature of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth was completely different, resulting in a completely different combat style.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At this moment, the Heavenly and Earth Twin Ghosts, having exposed their true identities, revealed their real nature, causing their combat style to undergo a sudden change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The cultivators of Two Note Country all needed to adapt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Heavenly Ghost on the ground, freezing the mountains and forests, with the strength of one, suppressed four Nascent Soul-level fighters, firmly holding the advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Earth Ghost in the sky was at a stalemate with his enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Earth Ghost immediately received the ridicule of the Heavenly Ghost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Get out of here, all of you!" The Earth Ghost, infuriated in humiliation, took his greatest "assailant" -Buddha Thought -and in one fell swoop stuffed it into the Heavenly Ghost Mask.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Then, he extended his palm, grabbed his own cheek, and pulled outward forcefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He successfully stripped away the Heavenly Ghost Mask.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Heavenly Ghost Mask was shattered beyond repair, but after separating from the body, it immediately took on a form of its own, as if it were a branch of the Heavenly Ghost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">But this sub-form was not ferocious at all; instead, it had a face full of repentance and compassion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"My Buddha is above, I am a sinner."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"I am deeply sinful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Earth Ghost completely revealed himself to everyone; he swayed his head, moved his arms and legs, took a deep breath, and exclaimed, "Now this is refreshing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"You all just fought quite heartily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"I hope that from now on, you can continue to be this cheerful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Earth Ghost grinned evilly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">With no further interference, he unleashed his full strength and immediately launched a terrifying offensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The several Nascent Soul cultivators in the sky were immediately driven to a disadvantage, growing increasingly disheveled, and their situation became more difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The aftershocks of the battle also affected the Three General Camp on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">At this time, Ning Zhuo had already fallen into the camp, but had not yet withdrawn his mechanical army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The aftershocks caused by the Nascent Soul-level life-and-death struggle were also not to be underestimated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Just as they were about to fend off the aftershocks, they were intercepted in advance by the Heavenly Ghost Mask.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"You need not suspect anything." The Heavenly Ghost Mask had a proper expression on its face, wearing a smile, looking at the Three General Camp with boundless tolerance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"This is what I owe you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"And to protect the weak, to save all beings, is in itself the meaning of Buddha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">These words immediately left everyone in the Three General Camp utterly speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"So that's it!" Ning Zhuo’s eyes flashed with brilliance, and he immediately explained to the three generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"I used a method to infuse a large amount of Buddha Thought into the upper dantian of the Divine Sea of Heavenly Ghost -no, Earth Ghost."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"When the Earth Ghost stripped away the Heavenly Ghost Mask, he inadvertently infused all of the Buddha Thought into the mask."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"We suffered persecution from the Earth Ghost, so the Heavenly Ghost Mask held a heart of repentance and possessed compassionate Buddha Thought, and thus came to help us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The three generals, after Ning Zhuo’s explanation, immediately understood the reason behind it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">On one hand, they marveled at Ning Zhuo’s method, that he could directly reach the Earth Ghost’s Divine Sea; on the other hand, they were delighted to have obtained strong reinforcements. Of course, on a third aspect, there was also caution and vigilance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"With the current battle situation taking another twist, we should withdraw a bit further first." Liu Er issued the order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Three General Camp did not dare to change formation rashly, and with the Iron Bucket Formation as their formation, slowly moved towards the edge of the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">However, a battle at the Nascent Soul level had a remarkably vast scope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Three General Camp needed to move a long distance in order to be truly safe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">During this retreat, the Heavenly Ghost Mask indeed went all out, sparing no damage or injury to itself, in order to assist the Three General Camp by blocking numerous assaults.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts, along with many Nascent Soul cultivators from Two Note Country, naturally all saw this scene and had no energy to intervene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"No, Ning Zhuo cannot leave!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"If we, the Twin Ghosts, are dispatched this time and cannot even capture a single, insignificant Foundation Establishment cultivator, what face do we have to return to our sect?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Seeing Ning Zhuo about to leave, the Heaven and Earth Ghosts both became agitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">They successively shouted, "Courting death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Since you all wish to show off your strength, then all of you, die for us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Heavenly and Earthly Twin Ghosts raised their arms and shouted in unison, "Heaven rises, Earth falls, Heaven and Earth Combined Attack!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Before the words had finished, the Earth Ghost swooped down from the high sky, while the Heavenly Ghost soared upward from the ground; the two, facing each other, swiftly flew towards one another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The Earth Ghost, with a heavy figure, plunged down from the high sky like a meteor, stirring up surging ash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The ash increased, forming a huge rolling black cloud behind him, with a reddish glow intermittently appearing in the ash, making the Earth Ghost seem as if a deity had descended, with a terrifying aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The Heavenly Ghost, clad in white, resembled a long spear, charging skyward and piercing the firmament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Along the way, it drew a long trail of cold air, an ice-blue cold air, as if a huge cloak were draped behind the Heavenly Ghost; wherever it went, it stirred countless frost flowers into the air, with the cold air running rampant, freezing the heavens and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The sky seemed to be swirling downwards like spilled ink, while the ground exhibited an ominous indigo luminescence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Boom, boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The two passed by each other in mid-air, erupting in a thunderous roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The twin divine abilities combined, forming -Heaven and Earth Combined Attack!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
