<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">When he was six years old, his master taught Sun Lingtong how to set up a formation for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Lingtong, I have taught you mathematics. Calculate for me: if we set up a Spirit Gathering Formation, how many Spirit Stones can we save?" Sun Lingtong's master instructed earnestly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The young Sun Lingtong counted on his fingers, calculated for a while, then suddenly looked up, his eyes shining, and reported the answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Excellent!" His master immediately gave a thumbs up. "The Spirit Gathering Formation is so good; do you want to set one up?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Yes, yes, yes!" Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">His master laughed heartily and stroked his head. "Come, Master will teach you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Spirit Gathering Formation, the simplest kind, was passed on to Sun Lingtong by his master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sun Lingtong used a small shovel to dig up the mud, buried the Spirit Stones, and carved the formation patterns according to his master's guidance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He tried continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Failure...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He failed seven times, finally succeeding on the eighth attempt. At that moment, the Spirit Stones lit up with a faint glimmer, and the surrounding spiritual energy slowly gathered. He jumped up in joy, excitedly rolling three times in the mud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Eight years old.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">His master patted his shoulder: "As long as you can walk out of this bewildering formation, Master will buy you that toy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The eight-year-old Sun Lingtong spun around in the bewildering formation for a day and a night, his stomach growling with hunger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He persevered, and when he relieved himself, a stream of urine landed right on the formation eye, unexpectedly breaking the array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">His master stared, blowing into his beard in shock, while Sun Lingtong laughed so hard he rocked back and forth: "Master, you have to keep your word!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">His master was shocked to the core: The formation eye is tiny, yet Lingtong managed to water it directly. Is this intuition, or destiny? As expected of...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ten years old.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sun Lingtong buried his head in various formation classics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">His small body wasn't even half the height of the stacks of books around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Twelve years old. He independently set up a killing formation for the first time. Although it was only the lowest-grade Thorn Formation, when he saw the wild dogs that intruded into the array getting entangled by thorns and howling for mercy, he excitedly clenched his fists and jumped three feet high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He ran proudly to his master: "Master, did you see that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">His master twitched his lips: "I'll give it to you, you're pretty good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun Lingtong was so happy he placed his hands on his hips, stuck out his chest and head, and laughed loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Sixteen years old, eighteen years old, twenty years old...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The depression of those failures, the wild joy of those successes, the loneliness of studying late into the night, the excitement of occasional gains - bit by bit, they combined to form his path of cultivation in the Dao of Formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">And now, he was going to strip away all his cultivation results in this field!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Streams of light surged from the center of his brow, injecting into the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">With every stream of light that poured out, his body trembled more violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">His breathing became rapid and chaotic; every breath seemed to be enduring immense pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">His eyes were wide open, but his pupils were gradually dilating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He used all his strength to maintain his cross-legged posture, continuously extracting his own true intent without stopping, without the slightest hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Sweat fell like rain, soaking his clothes. His hair was plastered wetly against his forehead, and the two rosy flushes on his cheeks had long since disappeared, leaving only a deathly pallor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But his gaze remained firm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Little Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"What the Five Elements Lord and Green Martial Langjun can give you, I can give you too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He thought of Ning Zhuo's big-headed appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He thought of the child who lost his mother at two years old, living alone in a small hut, calling him "Boss" in a childish voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He thought of the child who didn't dare to make a sound when bullied in the school, whom he dragged along to learn theft, disguise, and how to survive in this cold world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He thought of the young man who gradually grew up, soaring to the sky in the Lava Immortal Palace, revealing his talent in the Myriad Medicine Sect, fighting bathed in blood on the battlefield of the Two Note Kingdom, and turning the tide in White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He thought of the figure standing in the sunlight within the main gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, head held high, with an awe-inspiring righteousness piercing the sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">As the streams of light continued to inject, the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages began to change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The originally lustrous white jade surface now revealed countless fine, dense patterns. These patterns spread from the center to the periphery, like ice cracks, or like the growth rings of a tree. Every line was a formation line; every intersection was a formation eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The patterns became more numerous and denser.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Gradually, they began to interweave, overlap, and merge, forming a complete formation chart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The formation chart was ever-changing. Sometimes it showed a Nine Palace grid; sometimes the eight trigrams of Qian, Kun, Zhen, Xun, Kan, Li, Gen, and Dui would light up and dim in sequence. Sometimes light of five colors - Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth - would interweave and merge, generating and overcoming one another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The streams of light dissipated; Sun Lingtong had invested his lifelong true intent of the Formation Dao into them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">All the various formation patterns and brilliant lights retracted. Dozens of Dao-Bearing Jade Pages floated quietly, their bodies as lustrous white as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">But if one looked closely, there was an extra layer of faint texture on their surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">These textures were extremely fine and shallow, as if they were just the natural grain of the jade itself. Yet, upon careful scrutiny, one could see they were patterns woven from countless formations - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The meridians of the Spirit Gathering Formation, the maze of the Trapping Formation, the sharp edge of the Killing Formation, the lights and shadows of the Illusion Formation, the layers of the Stacked Formation, the palace aspects of the Nine Palace Formation, the symbols of the Eight Trigrams, the flow of the Five Elements...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"It's done," Sun Lingtong murmured, his expression complex - containing reluctance, sorrow, pride, and relief, but mostly, the same steadfastness as always!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">If it were anyone else, beat him to death and he wouldn't do this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But for Ning Zhuo, it didn't matter even if Sun Lingtong gave up his life. Let alone this "small" portion of Formation Dao true intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Boss..." Through the Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo saw this scene, ripples of emotion stirring in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Moments later, Ning Zhuo received the dozens of Dao-Bearing Jade Pages brought personally by Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Holding them in his hands, Ning Zhuo felt a heavy weight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A silent tremor, like the striking of a jade chime, rippled through the bluestone cave abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The streams of light reappeared, but this time, they were being absorbed from the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages and projected into Ning Zhuo's Divine Sea Upper Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The big-headed youth frowned deeply, fine beads of sweat gradually seeping from his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Time passed bit by bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">One incense stick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Two incense sticks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Three incense sticks...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Countless realizations flooded into his mind like a tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The method of laying formation foundations, the way of selecting formation eyes, the essentials of constructing formation pillars, the marvel of connecting formation lines, the secrets of nurturing formation cores...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The "hiding movement within stillness" of Static Formations, the "seeking stillness within movement" of Dynamic Formations, the "component coordination" of Battle Formations, the "energy resonance" of Stacked Formations, the "mutual generation of void and reality" of Illusion Formations, the "Five Elements circulation" of Killing Formations, the "layered barriers" of Defensive Formations, the "Eight Trigrams positioning" of Trapping Formations...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Spirit Gathering Formations, Trapping Formations, Bewildering Formations, Killing Formations, Defensive Formations, Illusion Formations, Battle Formations, Stacked Formations, Boundary Formations...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Five Elements Formations, Eight Trigrams Formations, Nine Palace Formations, Heavenly Tiangang Formations, Earthly Fiend Formations...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Formation after formation, principle after principle, layer after layer of comprehension surged into the depths of his divine soul like a torrent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo's original Formation Dao realm was at the Artisan level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">This was the solid foundation he had laid while learning in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Hiding most of his ability, he could easily achieve a super-grade in the Ning Clan's grand examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He could set up micro-formations on a handkerchief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But it was only Artisan-level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Therefore, in White Paper Immortal City, even when Ning Zhuo gave his all toward the magical formations within the Paper Giant Colossus, he couldn't understand them, let alone repair them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">In the campaign against the Lord of Wangchuan, even when he saw the Formless Pivot, he could only guess at what it was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">When he first obtained Shen Xi's school notes, which already had rich annotations and explanations, he still needed the help of the Luo Shu page to temporarily comprehend thirty percent of the content.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">But now, Ning Zhuo felt his realm being constantly solidified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">It was still Artisan-level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Before, it was just a flimsy balloon; now, it was rapidly filling up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">There was a difference between Artisan-level and the peak of Artisan-level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This feeling was marvelous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Many formation principles he had pondered bitterly without understanding suddenly became clear. Formation eyes that previously required repeated deduction to find could now be seen at a glance. Formations that once required cautious care to set up could now be constructed with ease!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Practice makes perfect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He closed his eyes, and with a thought, attempted to conceive a Spirit Gathering Formation in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Instantly, the diagram of a Spirit Gathering Formation appeared in his mind. The diagram was incredibly clear; every formation pattern, every formation eye, every formation line was vivid before his eyes. He could even "see" how the spiritual energy within the Spirit Stones flowed along the formation lines, gathered at the formation eyes, and formed the spirit-gathering effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He searched his memories and found a Trapping Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">A maze-like formation diagram emerged. The maze was intricate and complex, but he saw the location of the formation eye at a glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He found a Killing Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">A Thorn Formation emerged. Every vine and every thorn appeared clearly in his mind. He could even "feel" that if he adjusted a formation line here, the power of the thorns would increase by thirty percent; if he moved a formation eye there, the coverage of the thorns would expand by fifty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">This was the peak of Artisan-level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">No longer needing to follow the book blindly, no longer needing to imitate every step. Standard formations had dissolved into his marrow, becoming instinct. With a mere thought, the formation chart would naturally emerge; with a push of spiritual energy, the formation would naturally take shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo continued to absorb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">More Formation Dao true intent flooded into his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This time, it was no longer about standard "proficiency," but "improvement" and "optimization."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The most basic Spirit Gathering Formation could be attempted with over seventeen different layout methods!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Some buried the formation foundation deeper, some set the formation eye higher, some drew the formation lines thinner, and some changed the material of the formation pillars. Each attempt had a different effect - some gathered spirit faster, some covered a wider area, some consumed less, and some were more concealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The same Trapping Formation. Among nineteen different designs, some made the maze more complex, some hid the formation eye deeper, some arranged the formation lines more ingeniously, and some combined the formation pillars with the terrain. Each variation had different characteristics - some were harder to break, some were more confusing, and some were better at exhausting the intruder's patience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The same Killing Formation, through improvement, could make the thorns sharper, the flames burn hotter, the ice blades fly faster, the lightning strike more accurately...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This was Renowned Artisan-level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">No longer satisfied with standard formations, beginning to pursue better results. No longer sticking to fixed routines, beginning to attempt one's own style. No longer blindly following others' experiences, beginning to form one's own understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo opened his eyes, his gaze flickering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He suddenly understood why Sun Lingtong's formations carried various "personal styles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Because within those formations lay his heart's blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Every improvement was his attempt. Every optimization was his exploration. Every success was his joy. Every failure held his frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Those formations were not just formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">They were the road he had traveled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Thus, Ning Zhuo's Formation Dao realm advanced to the Renowned Artisan-level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">But only thirty percent of the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages had been used.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">A night passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Only three Dao-Bearing Jade Pages remained before Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He suddenly trembled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">All the formation charts, all the formation principles, all the comprehensions suddenly fused into one at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">It was no longer scattered formations, but a complete system.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">It was no longer isolated techniques, but a deep level of understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">It was no longer "how to set up the formation," but "why set it up this way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He seemed to be placed in an endless void. In the void, countless formation patterns flowed, countless formations operated, and every formation was displaying its mysteries to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Five Elements Formation said: The reason I am set up this way is because the Five Elements generate and overcome each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The Nine Palace Formation said: The reason I am set up this way is to allow the Nine Palaces to echo one another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The Illusion Formation said: The reason I am set up this way is to make void and reality indistinguishable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Spirit Gathering Formation said: The reason I am set up this way is to make the flow of spiritual energy smoother and more concentrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Formation after formation, voice after voice, echoed in the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo grasped a truth - the Dao of Formation lies not in "Form," but in "Principle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The form of a Spirit Gathering Formation can change in a thousand ways, but its principle is only one - to gather spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The form of a Trapping Formation can be varied, but its principle is only one - to trap the intruder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The form of a Killing Formation can be bizarre, but its principle is only one - to kill or wound the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">It seemed like nonsense, but in reality, it was returning to the original simplicity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">As long as one grasped the principle, the form could follow one's heart's desire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">And this was Master-level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo suddenly opened his eyes, a brilliant light flashing past in their depths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">In the next moment, he reached out his hand and drew in the empty air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">No formation foundation, no formation materials, no Spirit Stones, no physical formation items. He simply sketched lightly in the air with his finger, consuming only his divine sense and spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">After one breath, a Spirit Gathering Formation took shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">The surrounding spiritual energy slowly gathered toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly and swiped his finger again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The Spirit Gathering Formation instantly changed; the formation eye shifted, the formation lines reorganized, the formation pillars reconstructed - in the blink of an eye, it turned into a Trapping Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">He swiped again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The Trapping Formation changed again, becoming a Killing Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Another swipe, and the Killing Formation became an Illusion Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Another swipe, and the Illusion Formation became a Defensive Formation...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">In just a dozen breaths of time, he transformed seven types of formations in the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Sun Lingtong, who was guarding Ning Zhuo, witnessed this scene and immediately revealed a look of intense surprise and joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Ning Zhuo had fully inherited his realm in the Formation Dao, but having that alone wouldn't allow him to accomplish what he was doing right now. Because this was practical application.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Simply obtaining the realm usually required a massive amount of practice to reach this degree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Ning Zhuo's situation was quite special.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Because he had previously absorbed the life experiences and cultivation memories of three waves of demonic cultivators. Therefore, he took the massive "practical operation" experience of others and used it directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Using the void as paper, spiritual energy as ink, and divine sense as a pen, Ning Zhuo could now set up formations out of thin air!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Ning Zhuo retracted his hand, and the formation patterns in the void slowly dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">He sat quietly, feeling his brand-new Formation Dao realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Artisan-level was "practice makes perfect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Renowned Artisan-level was "ingenuity and unique craftsmanship."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Master-level was "the first manifestation of Dao Rhythm!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Three realms, three sensations, completely distinct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">At the Artisan level, he felt as if he had become a precise machine; as long as commands were input, he could complete the task accurately without error. Standard formations were like standard parts in his hands, able to be assembled and disassembled at will.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">At the Renowned Artisan level, he felt he had become a sincere craftsman, beginning to pursue better works. He was no longer satisfied with "usable," but pursued "easy to use"; no longer satisfied with "standard," but pursued "unique." He wanted every formation to bear his own brand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">At the Master level, he felt as if he had become an artist, beginning to touch the "Dao" behind the formations. He no longer thought about "how to set up," but "why set it up this way." In his eyes, formations were no longer cold patterns and structures, but existences that seemed to possess life or a soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">Formation Master!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Overnight, Ning Zhuo's accumulation in formation arrangement leaped to become the head of his four great arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Alchemy: Artisan-level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">Talisman Making: Artisan-level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">Artifact Refining: Renowned Artisan-level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">Formation Dao: Master-level!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
