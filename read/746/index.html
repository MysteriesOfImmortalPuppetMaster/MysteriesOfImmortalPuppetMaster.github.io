<paragraph index="1">Chen San hurriedly apologized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo tapped his fingers on the table, his gaze cold. "You've just arrived and aren't yet familiar with my character. Given this is your first offense, I'll let it pass, but don't let it happen again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Chen San changed his kneeling posture, both knees touching the ground, hastily giving his assurance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo made an acknowledging sound, leaned back in his chair, and softened his tone. "Right now, Ban Ji and I are like fire and water - we must determine a victor before this can end."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"The Ban Clan is powerful, so I need to leverage my strengths and avoid my weaknesses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Do you know what my greatest strength is, and what the Ban Clan's greatest weakness is?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo deliberately tested Chen San.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Chen San's performance this time exceeded his expectations - not only could he execute orders thoroughly, but he could also improvise on the spot with subjective flexibility, which was quite impressive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Chen San immediately smiled. "Young Master, you've asked at the perfect time. These past days, I've been pondering this very matter and have luckily arrived at an answer - I don't know if it's correct?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "Don't keep me in suspense. Speak directly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Chen San then showed a serious expression. "In this subordinate's view, your greatest strength is your reputation. Although the Ban Clan is righteous, Ban Ji is publicly recognized as a demonic cultivator - this is their weakest point."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Mm, not bad." Ning Zhuo was greatly satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This Chen San truly was talented, seeing through one of the key aspects of this situation at a glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo continued testing him. "Since you've already found the answer, what should be done next?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Chen San immediately gave a sinister chuckle and lowered his voice. "This subordinate has researched Ban Ji's intelligence. He's a demonic cultivator with far too many flaws in his past deeds - the difficulty of spreading rumors about him is very low!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"He once supervised a mine. Upon taking office, he doubled the already severe mining quotas and implemented even harsher punishments. He made the miners' lives unsustainable, working many to death. Yet Ban Ji, by bleeding and fleecing those at the bottom, accumulated his own achievements and even lined his own pockets, gaining vast cultivation resources."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"While serving as marketplace manager, he repeatedly targeted low-level cultivator families with shallow foundations and incompetent descendants. These families still had some meager inheritances, which Ban Ji obtained through various means - whether through deception, trickery, or outright plunder."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"He's also been issuing high-interest loans all along, relying on the Ban Clan's prestige to collect exorbitant profits. If cultivators struggle to repay their debts, the entire person becomes Ban Ji's asset. These people often disappear quickly - I suspect they likely became materials for his cultivation. After all, he is a demonic cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"This subordinate doesn't even need to exaggerate. Just by using this information and processing it slightly, I can make Ban Ji's reputation stink to high heaven, causing him to be loathed and despised by all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Hearing this, Ning Zhuo pointed at Chen San. "That smile of yours isn't right. Take it back. From now on, when working by my side, don't smile like that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Chen San immediately straightened his face and clasped his fists anxiously. "This subordinate obeys!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Mm." Ning Zhuo pondered. "Let me correct you slightly. What we're doing is not slander or false accusation! We are exposing the demonic cultivator Ban Ji's countless misdeeds. We are seeking justice for those miners' wandering souls who had their bones sucked dry, for the small families oppressed to bankruptcy, and for the unregistered cultivators who were drained of their last vitality by high-interest loans and ultimately 'disappeared'!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo's voice gradually rose, tinged with grief. "Ban Ji - born into the righteous Ban Clan - should uphold family rules and harbor benevolence and righteousness. Yet he relies on his family's power to commit such outrageous acts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"What crime have the miners committed? Already struggling to survive, yet Ban Ji treats them as ants and beasts of burden! For his own selfish desires, for that bit of so-called 'achievement,' he disregards human life, imposing cruel labor, causing how many families to shatter, how many orphans and widows to weep blood in cold hovels? And are these lives materials for his demonic cultivation? I don't know, but I want to know - and many others want a clear answer too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Chen San's heart stirred, thinking silently: "I understand. We must describe our misery from the perspective of orphans and widows, stirring people's doubts about whether Ban Ji uses humans as cultivation materials for his demonic arts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo continued: "These great families - their ancestors fought through thorns and brambles, painstakingly establishing some meager foundation. This is bloodline inheritance, their dependence, the last bit of protection left by their predecessors! And Ban Ji? Driven by greed, using every underhanded method, plundering through trickery and force, stripping flesh from bone! Such conduct - how does it differ from those evil demons in the wilderness who dig up human ancestral graves and sever their roots? That's severing their lineage! How can these great households survive?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Chen San's eyes flashed brilliantly, his heart touched: "I understand! We must stir those cultivators with meager estates, making us feel the same, experiencing the terrible possibility of losing the inherited foundation we worked so hard to preserve, having it usurped and plundered by villains, thus generating enormous wariness and hatred toward Ban Ji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo continued: "As for this loan exploitation? It's an even more naked display of his demonic cultivator nature! In the name of legitimacy, he commits the reality of sucking marrow from bones! Forcing people to sign contracts of bondage, making their very lives and deaths no longer their own! These 'disappeared' people - they are your most common, most numerous independent cultivator friends. Ban Ji's current achievements all stand upon the sacrifices of those independent cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Chen San nodded repeatedly. "I understand, I understand. Make the independent cultivators also hate and loathe him from the bottom of their hearts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo's tone slowed, and he sighed deeply before asking: "Chen San, do you know what I'm sighing about?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Chen San quickly clasped his fists. "Young Master's strategies - how could a lowly person like this subordinate presume to fathom them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo shook his head urgently, his face full of grief and indignation. "I'm sighing for the Ban Clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"The Ban Clan has a long heritage, upright family traditions, and enjoys widespread renown. Over so many years, who knows how much merit their ancestors accumulated, how many disciples wielded swords to protect righteousness, earning the world's respect! But today, just because of Ban Ji - this 'rotten apple' with deep demonic nature - they've damaged so much of the Ban Clan's reputation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"As a member of the righteous path, seeing such a black sheep, such a family disgrace, I truly cannot bear to watch. The Ban Clan's tolerance of Ban Ji for so many years shows their magnanimity. But Ban Ji, wearing the Ban Clan's skin, has committed evil for so many years, dragging down the family far too much."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"We must kindly remind the Ban Clan to make rational choices and rectify their roots - only then can they preserve their ancestors' merits and foundation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Chen San's pupils constricted momentarily, his scalp tingling, his heart greatly shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He looked up in admiration and raised his thumb. "Young Master is amazing! Your skill at releasing rumors - I can't catch up even on horseback..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo immediately frowned. "Hmm?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Slap, slap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Chen San snapped to awareness and slapped himself twice. "Young Master, you have the world in your heart, benevolence and magnanimity. Though Ban Ji has harmed you so, you still maintain public-mindedness, even considering the Ban Clan. Such breadth of vision truly makes this subordinate admire you so much that I'd prostrate myself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo sighed again. "You overpraise me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Then he took out a small storage pouch. "Inside are some spirit stones - consider them my small gesture. Use them to compensate the tavern staff."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"When I, Ning Zhuo, act, I've always been upright and proper. I won't mistreat any contributor. Do you understand?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Chen San's heart shook, and he quickly said: "This subordinate understands!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo tossed the storage pouch to Chen San and instructed: "I'm determined to use Ban Ji to establish my authority. My every move from now on will be monitored by the Ban Clan. You shouldn't come around for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Chen San had just pledged allegiance, but he'd handled both tasks well - he had ability and, more importantly, the right attitude. His only shortcoming was his cultivation level being too low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Chen San immediately clasped his fists respectfully. "Then how should this subordinate report to you, Young Master?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo showed an unfathomable smile. "When I want to find you, I'll naturally find you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He waved his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Chen San bowed and withdrew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">In Ning Zhuo's vision, a thread was already suspended above Chen San's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Life-Hanging Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The moment Chen San entered the door, Ning Zhuo had marked him. Ning Zhuo relied on the Life-Hanging Thread's degree of condensation to confirm Chen San's loyalty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After this report, the Life-Hanging Thread visibly condensed several times over!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">After thinking it over, Ning Zhuo ultimately did not cancel this divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Chen San was different from others - as a subordinate in intelligence matters, he would handle many affairs involving Ning Zhuo's secrets in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Therefore, Ning Zhuo had to observe him and confirm his loyalty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Only after Chen San observed through the Life-Hanging Thread for a period and confirmed Chen San's loyalty would he assign more numerous and sensitive tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Chen San quietly left the Azure Stone Dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">All along the way, he clutched the storage pouch in his chest, thinking: "Is this how righteous cultivators operate?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Only when Ning Zhuo handed him the storage pouch did he truly confirm that he didn't intend to eliminate the tavern staff, and sending the staff away wasn't sending them to their deaths - he genuinely wanted to avoid the possibility of the staff being purged by the Ban Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Chen San knew: By doing this, Ning Zhuo was also showing his true intentions to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Chen San only had inferior spiritual roots. Although he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, in the eyes of someone like Ning Zhuo, what difference was there from a mortal?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Chen San clutched the heavy storage pouch of spirit stones and felt at ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"The Young Master is indeed from a great clan - even his skill at spreading rumors is so masterful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"He can do it himself, and do it even better than me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Being able to attach myself to him is truly my fortune! If the Young Master hadn't just arrived with few subordinates, how could I have this opportunity to stand out?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Speaking of which, what force is backing Young Master Ning Zhuo? Seeing how he deals with Ban Ji and his attitude toward the Ban Clan - there's no fear whatsoever. I've latched onto a great tree and must treasure this opportunity, gripping it tightly and never letting go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">At this moment, Ning Zhuo, secretly observing Chen San's surroundings through the Life-Hanging Thread, couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly. "The Life-Hanging Thread is still condensing. This Chen San... is good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">------</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Mechanical Construction Dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ban Ji strode forward with great strides, arriving before Ban Jie. He casually tossed her a token, his brows carrying a confident air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The token flew into midair and was frozen by Ban Jie's divine sense, revealing its true form - a stone tablet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ban Jie didn't look up, still staring at the intelligence in her hand. "The Blind Foolish Old Man's trial ended so quickly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ban Ji chuckled. "Much thanks to him - he dealt with the Blind Foolish Old Man's son and seized his weakness. Since my performance far exceeded others, the Yu Clan naturally stopped delaying and directly awarded me first place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"They're quite sensible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"What are you reading?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ban Jie handed Ban Ji the intelligence in her hand. The latter scanned it with divine sense - it concerned the battle appointment between Zhu Fenxiang and Situ Xing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ban Jie said: "We instigated Yan Linglong to spread rumors, wanting to promote the battle between Situ Xing and Ning Zhuo. But then Zhu Fenxiang suddenly appeared and disrupted this plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"I'm doubting the truth of this matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"If it really was Ning Zhuo's side playing tricks, then I must raise my assessment of him and reconsider this confrontation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">If Ning Zhuo really had orchestrated Zhu Fenxiang, then this Ban-Ning contest could only be considered a draw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo blocked the leak on the Situ Xing front, while Ban Jie had prepared defenses early and held the Blind Foolish Old Man line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ban Ji: "This Ning Zhuo comes from the righteous path - perhaps he has such ability."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ban Jie sighed. "If that's truly the case, I'm afraid we'll be at a disadvantage from here on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ban Ji frowned, showing some confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ban Jie sighed again. "Ning Zhuo's background is difficult to investigate. We can't find any dirt on him, and since arriving at the Myriad Manifestations Sect, his conduct has been proper. He received first place in both the Confucian and Immortal trials - equivalent to the Confucian cultivators endorsing him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Most critically, his three questions to the Heart-Questioning in the Demon Subjugation Hall were truly righteous and upstanding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"News about Ning Zhuo's performance is already spreading widely within the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">In righteous path contests, one must first occupy the moral high ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">But now Ning Zhuo's reputation was too good, making it difficult for Ban Jie's side to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ban Ji snorted coldly. "What's so difficult about ruining his good reputation? Can't Confucian cultivators be deceived? In the Demon-Subjugation Hall's Rising Cloud Trial, there have been precedents of demonic cultivators cheating. We could easily throw dirty water on Ning Zhuo, accusing him of cheating somehow..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Reaching this point, Ban Ji voluntarily stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">His expression changed slightly as he realized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ban Jie's face was expressionless. "It seems you've also comprehended it. It's not that we can't frame and slander him, but if we do, wouldn't we be slapping the Confucian cultivators and the Demon-Subjugation Hall in the face?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Although there aren't many Confucian cultivators here at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, we must never underestimate their influence. Those people occupy the middle levels of various peaks and halls, normally operating in close coordination - they're quite troublesome."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"And the current Demon-Subjugation Hall Master, Zhong Dao, hates evil like an enemy, pursues justice, and his style of conduct is quite domineering."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"If you were him, would you admire Ning Zhuo or Ban Ji more?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ban Ji's expression turned ugly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Ban Clan sending Ban Jie over was the right decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ban Jie and Ban Ji had been close since childhood and could cooperate candidly. On the other hand, although Ban Jie was only at Foundation Establishment, she excelled at this type of contest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Regarding the situation, she saw more deeply than Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ban Ji's brows furrowed tightly. "In that case, our framing and slander of Ning Zhuo won't work. And to assassinate him during this critical juncture of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Soaring Cloud Grand Assembly would be even more impossible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"What should we do then?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Ning Zhuo, Chen San... could they really be my tribulation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Truly troublesome!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Perhaps I'll have to face him personally and resolve him directly in the Martial Arts Hall!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"But it's such a pity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"I sent my sparring challenge, but Ning Zhuo didn't accept. He won't easily fall into line."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Hearing this, Ban Jie immediately changed color. "Wait, sparring challenge? You didn't tell me this information. Ning Zhuo has your sparring challenge?!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
