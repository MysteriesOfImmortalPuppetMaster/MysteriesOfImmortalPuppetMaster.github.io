<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Boulder Cave Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Five or six exquisite dishes adorned the circular stone table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Yu Heye sat at the head of the table, naturally reserving the guest of honor's seat for Ning Zhuo. Besides the two of them, the only other guests were Shen Xi and Su Lingkou, cousins by blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Young Master Ning, please try this dish," Yu Heye said with a smile, gesturing toward a steaming cauldron. "It's called Nine Peaks Sea-Quelling Soup. The broth is made from fermented dough crafted from nine-colored spiritual rice flour, simmered in seawater. The dough is then stewed in a magic treasure-grade Tao's Cauldron and infused with Golden Rock Marrow. If the Spirit Chef's skill is exceptional, the process can even yield Earthen Essence Refinement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">As Yu Heye spoke, he lifted the lid of the cauldron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">A moment later, a brownish-yellow mist, streaked with nine-colored radiance, erupted from the cauldron. Within this swirling mist, three illusory mountain peaks materialized briefly before vanishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Shen Xi, a noble young master from a prominent clan, was visibly surprised. "Those are three illusory mountain peaks," he exclaimed. "This means the Earthen Essence Refinement in the cauldron must contain at least three pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"To prepare such a dish requires a Spirit Chef of extraordinary skill. Senior Yu, may I ask which master chef from the Mountain Gate you commissioned?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Yu Heye chuckled, secretly pleased that Shen Xi recognized the quality. He seized the opportunity and announced, "This is the work of Tao An, the Warm Cauldron Hermit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Su Lingkou immediately exclaimed, "So it's Chef Tao, the Golden Core-level master! No wonder this Spirit Food is so extraordinary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Though she was new to the area, she had already heard of Tao An's reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Golden Core-level Spirit Chefs were almost always head chefs or grand chefs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">While Nascent Soul-level Spirit Chefs existed, they rarely served the public market, preferring to cater to small, exclusive circles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">In the regular market, the highest-level cultivators whose services were consistently available to the public were those at the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Young Master Ning, please try some," Yu Heye said, personally scooping a spoonful of the viscous, honey-like soup from Tao's Cauldron, along with a piece of Earthen Essence Refinement, and placing it in Ning Zhuo's bowl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The soup was thick and translucent, shimmering like liquid amber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo took a spoonful and felt as if he had swallowed a mouthful of warm quicksand. Initially, a robust, salty flavor with a hint of bitterness filled his mouth, but this quickly gave way to a clear, sweet aftertaste that surged from the back of his tongue, like mountain spring water infused with wildflower honey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">As Ning Zhuo swallowed, the soup slid down his throat, and his spine straightened involuntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">A torrent of Earth Spirit energy cascaded down like a waterfall, plunging directly into Ning Zhuo's stomach, bringing with it a powerful sense of weight and grounding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Earth Spirit energy rapidly vaporized, transforming into a warm, golden light that permeated Ning Zhuo's entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">His muscles strengthened, his meridians widened, and his heartbeat settled into a steady rhythm. Accumulated toxins were purged from his system along with the golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After just eight breaths, Ning Zhuo had fully digested the Spirit Food. He felt a significant improvement in his physical body's defense and endurance, and nodded in satisfaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Yu Heye was astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Having consumed this particular Spirit Food dish many times, he knew its benefits were excellent, but it also had a major drawback: its difficulty to digest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He never imagined Ning Zhuo could digest it so quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">At least, as far as he could tell with the naked eye, he seemed to have digested it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">It took Yu Heye six breaths to digest this Spirit Food.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Don't let his Foundation Establishment realm fool you - his physical body's foundation is remarkably strong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Suppressing his surprise, Yu Heye turned to Ning Zhuo with a beaming smile. "Young Master Ning, how do you feel?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo replied, "Excellent, excellent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Then he turned to Shen Xi and Su Lingkou. "You two should try it as well. It's quite beneficial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Shen Xi and Su Lingkou each took a spoonful, their expressions immediately changing. They closed their eyes and began circulating their qi at the dining table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Shen Xi circulated his qi for over thirty breaths, while Su Lingkou reached fifty-six breaths before fully digesting the food.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">A faint golden glow still lingered on Su Lingkou's face as she exclaimed with genuine delight, "Truly a masterpiece forged by a Golden Core-level chef!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Shen Xi, now recovered, turned to Ning Zhuo, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Ning Zhuo's physical body foundation seems extraordinarily robust!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"At least, his digestive capacity far surpasses mine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Is he primarily cultivating the Essence Sea in his Lower Dantian?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">With this thought, Shen Xi openly praised Ning Zhuo's physical cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "Alas, I still have a long way to go. This meager physical cultivation is nothing to boast about."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Shen Xi and Yu Heye exchanged speechless glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo's expression was sincere, his sigh heartfelt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">His physical cultivation paled in comparison to the depth of his soul foundation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo's soul already contained the spirits of a million souls, but his inadequate physical cultivation had long stalled his soul's progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Recently, his skin had even turned a sickly gray-blue, unable to bear the weight of his powerful soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The situation had only improved slightly. Ning Zhuo still had a long and arduous path ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Young Master Ning, this is Golden Needle Mushroom Crisp. What do you think of the flavor?" Yu Heye picked up the serving chopsticks and placed more golden needle mushrooms on Ning Zhuo's plate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The mushrooms were slender and coated in a layer of dazzling gold powder that shimmered brightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo ate them. As the Spirit Food entered his mouth, it immediately transformed into a gentle, flowing stream upon chewing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The stream rapidly coursed through his body, clearing away all internal stagnation and blockages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Shen Xi and Su Lingkou exchanged covert glances, astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">They had never heard of Yu Heye treating a Foundation Establishment cultivator with such warmth and hospitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This was highly unusual!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Shen Xi's mind raced with speculation. "What method did Ning Zhuo use to earn Yu Heye's favor?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"And... is it just my imagination?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"I can't shake the feeling that this show of equality is laced with a hint of fawning?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Shen Xi possessed keen insight and exceptional observational skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Though he recognized this possibility, he couldn't quite convince himself to believe it, as it seemed utterly absurd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Yu Heye ate very little himself, focusing instead on serving Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">This excessive attentiveness made Ning Zhuo uncomfortable. Adopting a deliberately aloof tone, he said, "I can serve myself, Senior Yu. You're being too kind. Please, enjoy your meal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Yu Heye burst into hearty laughter. "Many thanks for your concern, Young Master Ning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Shen Xi remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Su Lingkou, however, felt puzzled. How could the intelligence reports describe Yu Heye as volatile and quick-tempered, when in reality he's so warm and approachable? she wondered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Seeing Ning Zhuo's refusal, Yu Heye immediately stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He shifted his approach, patiently waiting for Ning Zhuo to take a few bites of the delicacies before saying, "Young Master Ning, I have some cultivation dilemmas I'd like to seek your guidance on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Su Lingkou: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The intelligence reports never mentioned Yu Heye being so studious and humble, did they?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The rumors always painted him as volatile and quick-tempered. Could they all be false?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Shen Xi's lips twitched slightly. Yu Heye is showing such deference to a Foundation Establishment cultivator? he thought. And using the pretense of seeking guidance to curry favor? This is going too far, beneath the dignity of a Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">But then, right before Shen Xi and Su Lingkou, Yu Heye actually began asking Ning Zhuo about the core principles of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo set down his chopsticks, his expression turning serious and earnest as he shared his insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Shen Xi's disbelief deepened. He's actually treating this seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">But as he listened, his expression gradually shifted, becoming equally serious and earnest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo's responses were always precise and insightful. More importantly, he skillfully used analogies to explain complex concepts in a way that was remarkably clear and easy to understand, leaving everyone deeply enlightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Su Lingkou quickly noticed this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The cousins gradually set down their chopsticks, focusing entirely on listening. As for Yu Heye, he had long stopped eating, his posture radiating a desire to learn. The dining table had transformed into a lecture hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo spoke eloquently, becoming the undisputed master of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Knowing Yu Heye's limited understanding of the Five Elements, particularly the Metal and Earth Elements, he focused his explanations on these areas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Yu Heye initially listened intently, his face lighting up with joy and sudden comprehension. But as Ning Zhuo continued, his eyes grew hazy, his focus drifting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Observing his expression, Ning Zhuo immediately realized that Yu Heye's comprehension had reached its limit. Continuing further would be counterproductive, so he wisely brought the discussion to a close.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">This left Shen Xi and Su Lingkou deeply disappointed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Su Lingkou gazed at Ning Zhuo, her eyes shining with admiration. Young Master Ning Zhuo is truly insightful! My cousin's brilliance shines through - he spotted such a talented individual in the crowd at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Shen Xi clasped his hands in a respectful bow toward Ning Zhuo, sincerely impressed. "Hearing your words, Fellow Daoist Ning, is worth ten years of study! What an honor it is to share this meal with you today."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He clasped his hands and bowed to Yu Heye, thanking him for the opportunity that had greatly benefited him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Yu Heye waved his hand, first expressing his respect for the Shen Clan of Nine Palaces Immortal City and for Shen Xi himself, before turning to Ning Zhuo to convey his gratitude and admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This time, Shen Xi no longer felt that Yu Heye was merely flattering him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The reason was simple: Ning Zhuo possessed genuine talent and ability!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Shen Xi's eyes gleamed as he stared at Ning Zhuo, his voice fervent. "I wish I could share wine and late-night strolls with Fellow Daoist Ning, talking endlessly without rest!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo waved his hand. "As the saying goes, every inch has its strength, and every foot has its weakness. My Qi Sea Dantian is primarily cultivated with the Five Elements Technique, so I have some understanding of the Five Elements' transformations and arrangements. But I'm still far, far away from becoming a true master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">At that moment, Ning Zhuo thought of the Five Elements Divine Lord and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Su Lingkou stuck out her tongue. "Is that what you call 'some understanding'?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Yu Heye's Adam's apple bobbed. He found Ning Zhuo's humility a bit excessive. Given his own temperament, he usually despised such affectations from noble scions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">If it were him, he would have held his head high and proudly declared, "This is my personal ability, my excellence. Ordinary people can't match it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">But Ning Zhuo's words...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Yu Heye resigned himself to the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">After all, Ning Zhuo had saved his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Even if the elder hidden near Ning Zhuo had intervened, their deliberate concealment suggested they wanted Ning Zhuo to receive the credit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Yu Heye understood this perfectly and immediately attributed the life-saving debt to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">What a charmer! Ning Zhuo's humble demeanor greatly appealed to Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Shen Xi, hailing from the prestigious Shen Clan of Nine Palaces Immortal City, had been raised in nobility and rigorously trained. Had he been in Ning Zhuo's position, he would have adopted the same modest approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This made Shen Xi feel a strong affinity for Ning Zhuo, seeing him as a kindred spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo then looked up at Shen Xi, his expression sincere. "The name of the Shen Clan of Nine Palaces Immortal City has long resounded in my ears like thunder."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"It is a great honor to meet Fellow Daoist Shen Xi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"To be honest, I've always been deeply interested in formations. However, I'm not very familiar with the Nine Palaces Formation. I usually rely on the Five Elements Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Shen Xi laughed heartily, his mood buoyant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo's compliments to the Shen Clan filled Shen Xi with pride.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Previously, such praise from Ning Zhuo wouldn't have pleased Shen Xi so much. But now, through Yu Heye's persistent questioning, comprehension, confirmation, and further inquiry, Ning Zhuo had revealed the profound depth of his mastery over the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">While Shen Xi couldn't fathom the full extent of Ning Zhuo's expertise, he was certain that Ning Zhuo far surpassed him in this domain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">That alone was enough!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">To think that someone as young as Ning Zhuo had already surpassed Shen Xi in this field, even capable of serving as a teacher to a Golden Core cultivator like Yu Heye - this was an extraordinary achievement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Of course, the cultivation world possessed countless methods, including miraculous techniques for preserving youth. Yet, after interacting with Ning Zhuo, Shen Xi felt certain that the young man couldn't be much older than himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">This was primarily because Ning Zhuo still possessed an air of innocence and curiosity, lacking the world-weariness characteristic of middle-aged or elderly individuals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Shen Xi's position in Nine Palaces Immortal City had exposed him to a wide range of people, a result of the Shen Clan's deliberate cultivation of his skills. Consequently, he possessed an exceptional ability to discern character.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo may appear younger, but I suspect he's actually a bit older than me - perhaps a decade or so," Shen Xi, who was thirty years old in name only, mused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He had greatly underestimated Ning Zhuo's mastery of the Five Elements, but the palpable difference in their cultivation levels led Shen Xi to estimate Ning Zhuo's age accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Shen Xi immediately said, "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo's profound understanding of the Five Elements is truly enviable. Your Five Elements Formations must be extraordinary as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up. "I've recently gained some insights. I'd be grateful to learn from Fellow Daoist Shen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"I wouldn't dare," Shen Xi replied hastily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Yet Ning Zhuo proactively revealed the Five Elements Formation he had designed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Yu Heye immediately recognized the underlying principles of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art within the design.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Shen Xi listened intently, his brow furrowing slightly. "Fellow Daoist Ning, are you planning to create a Five Elements Formation Plate?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo answered truthfully, "Fellow Daoist Shen, you're mostly correct. To be precise, I'm designing a Five Elements Mechanism Component."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">This wasn't merely a pretext he had concocted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The truth was this: his study of the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art and his manipulation of Yu Heye's Chaotic Five Elements Golden Core had, through practical application, sparked a wealth of inspiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">During his battle with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, his cultivation level had been too low. Relying on the Black Iron Han Armor - Golden Swallow, he had repeatedly dodged and narrowly escaped death. This intensely stimulating combat experience had fueled his determination to further refine the Black Iron Han Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"These are still just ideas, not yet fully developed," Ning Zhuo said, directly sharing his thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Shen Xi's brow furrowed deeper. "I understand, Fellow Daoist Ning is refining the armor's mechanisms, intending to use them as a source of Spiritual Energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"But... isn't using a Golden Core as the core excessively extravagant?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Shen Xi phrased his concern delicately, but his underlying meaning was clear: We're just humble Foundation Establishment cultivators. Isn't using someone else's Golden Core as a consumable resource a bit too ambitious?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Yu Heye, listening nearby, broke into a cold sweat, remembering the Five Elements Golden Core residing within his own body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Little did he know, Ning Zhuo possessed over a hundred Golden Cores!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
