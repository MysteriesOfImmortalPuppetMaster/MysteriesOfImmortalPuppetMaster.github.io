<paragraph index="1">Inside the martial training formation, Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"From Qing Huangzi's meaning, it seems he wants to cancel the Rising Clouds Trial outright and pass the legacy directly to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"While it would save trouble, what I'd actually gain is much less than my original plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Without the Rising Clouds Trial, there's no top rank. And that's something I could have achieved anyway."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He already held a stone token; three more top ranks would allow him to upgrade to a higher-level token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Having decided to act boldly, Ning Zhuo wouldn't hesitate here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"I must seize every chance to claim the top rank and widen the gap with others!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Besides the top rank, I also need to focus on my reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Many are watching me now. If this Rising Clouds Trial is suddenly canceled, some might spread malicious rumors out of jealousy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"That won't do!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In righteous circles, a good reputation is crucial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo knew this all too well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After careful consideration, he began writing his reply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Soon after, Qing Huangzi received the letter and immediately read it with his spiritual sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">I Respected Elder Qing Huang,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Your letter arrived, bringing both shock and honor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">I, Zhuo, am but a junior of little learning, from humble originsâ€”how could I possibly deserve your exceptional favor, entrusting me with your legacy?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Reading your esteemed words, each character struck my heart like gold and jade, each sentence awakened my spirit like a great bell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Your insight into subtle matters and praise for my foolish actions, along with your earnest expectations warmer than spring sunshine...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The art of mechanisms is not merely about physical movement; it is the blade that explores principles, the bridge to profound mysteries, the very form of thought!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">I have always loved this path, often sitting alone in my humble room, fiddling with gears, forgetting sleep and meals, feeling time flash by yet finding endless fascination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Now, hearing of your great path ahead is like seeing the North Star in the dark night or encountering sweet rain after a long drought!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The responsibility you entrust weighs a thousand pounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">I vow here with all my heart: I will exhaust my mind, burn the midnight oil, and diligently study this art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">I will ensure that its profound principles and wondrous truths not only continue through me but will be glorified and expanded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Your and your master's aspirations shall be my lifelong goal, unwavering even unto death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">However, I have one request, earnestly hoping for your approval: I still wish to participate in the Rising Clouds Trial!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">I dare not doubt your judgment, nor do I seek empty fame out of wishful thinking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">My only concerns are "posthumous reputation" and "the purity of the legacy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Our sect is vast, and tongues wag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">If I receive the true inheritance without undergoing the trial, I fear it may provoke suspicion from petty minds, accusing you of favoritism and disregarding tradition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Worse, they might slander your master's lineage as careless or lacking worthy successors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Gossip spreads like wildfire; if it tarnishes your esteemed reputation or brings shame to your master's memory, I could never atone even with ten thousand deaths!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Participating in the Rising Clouds Trial also offers two benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">First, using the trial as a whetstone to temper myself and verify my learning!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Through practical combat, I can better grasp the depth of your legacy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Second, using my strength as clear proof to announce to my peers!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">If I am fortunate enough to take the top spot, then inheriting your legacy will be rightful and justified, silencing all disputes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">It can thwart the improper thoughts of envious individuals and stop baseless gossip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Let all under heaven know that your decision today is not out of personal favor but due to your sharp discernment, like a master recognizing a fine steed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Bearing your heavy trust, I have my own aspirations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Success or failure in the trial, to me, isn't about glory or shame but concerns the heart of the Dao!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">If I win, I'll do so honorably, enhancing your reputation for recognizing talent; if I lose, I'll accept it openly, demonstrating the strict standards of your lineage's selection!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">I earnestly hope you will grant my sincere wish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Written with fervent respect, I pray for your peace in the Dao!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Your junior, Ning Zhuo, bows respectfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">[/i]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Qing Huangzi read it three times with his spiritual sense before letting out a long, trembling breath filled with complex emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Good... What a fine Ning Zhuo! What fine points about 'posthumous reputation' and 'purity of the legacy'!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">His voice was hoarse, carrying unexpected emotion and warm approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"This young man's vision, the firmness of his character, the depth of his consideration, the breadth of his spirit... far exceed what I had anticipated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Qing Huangzi's sharp gaze seemed to pierce through the paper, envisioning the white-robed youth respectfully writing his reply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The young man, with his slightly large head, sat upright, his upper body straight as a peak, face full of solemnity and righteous energy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"He doesn't flaunt his talent or look down on others! Even with my promise, he shows no arrogance or laziness, instead treating this opportunity as a heavy responsibility, considering its weight!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"He doesn't shirk duty but dares to take it on! Without fear of the trial's challenges, he volunteers to enter the fierce competition to prove himself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Not for empty fame, but for the sake of my and my master's reputations!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"What a remarkable young man!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The more Qing Huangzi thought, the more excited he became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He couldn't help but stand and pace his small cave dwelling, his steps unusually light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Such an outstanding youthâ€”how can I let his earnest efforts go to waste? How can I allow his upright heart to be tarnished!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Since it's so, I must lend him a hand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The next day, at Green Bamboo Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The stone platform was already surrounded by a bustling crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"So many people have come," Jiang Xiaobian remarked, feeling a bit nervous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Qing Huangzi's Rising Clouds Trial is different from most; he's selecting an heir," Zhang Dadan replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"No, that alone wouldn't attract so many people. There's only one reason..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Patchwork Sun shook his head, but before he could finish, the surrounding crowd stirred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"They're here, they're here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Am I seeing this right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"No mistake, no mistakeâ€”it's Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The watching cultivators exclaimed loudly, countless burning, curious gazes turning toward Ning Zhuo as he arrived riding a cloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo had expected this kind of situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Wearing a slight smile, he descended his cloud, cupped his hands to the crowd, displaying the demeanor of a scion from a great clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The cultivators in the crowd returned his greetings one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Many praised Ning Zhuo: "Young Master Ning Zhuo, with you stepping forward this time, you're sure to take first place!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"It's our honor to see Young Master Ning Zhuo sweep through all opponents."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"No one will stand in your way!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo keenly sensed the ill intent hidden within these praises, but the smile on his face only grew a bit wider, as if he noticed nothing at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The crowd automatically parted to make a path, allowing Ning Zhuo to calmly approach the stone platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">There, he saw many familiar faces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Everyone, we meet again," he greeted Patchwork Sun, Chen San, Jiang Xiaobian, Zhang Dadan, Little Fire, and the others proactively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo had once hosted a banquet for these people, so they had a slight connection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Everyone returned his greetings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Some who were also participating in this Rising Clouds Minor Trial but hadn't accepted Ning Zhuo's invitation last time now felt regret: If they had known it would be like this, they should have accepted and formed a connection with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Patchwork Sun cupped his hands, quickly responding to Ning Zhuo, showing a different attitude than beforeâ€”more humble and respectful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Jiang Xiaobian pressed his lips tightly together, growing even more nervous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The others also felt pressure because of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Only Little Fire showed an unwilling expression, shouting that even if Ning Zhuo was strong, he wouldn't admit defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He would give his all and truly compete with Ning Zhuo once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo smiled and accepted the challenge on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Qing Huangzi revealed himself and announced the content of the second round of the Rising Clouds Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">On the stone platform, cultivators could only use sound control to manipulate many small bamboo puppets, engaging in a chaotic battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">During this process, Qing Huangzi would personally intervene, activating different musical notes to disrupt everyone's sound control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">As Qing Huangzi announced the rules, the entire area fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Chen San, Little Fire, and the others listened with full attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Once it ended, they couldn't help but glance at each other, each sensing the others' excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The spectators who had come specifically to watch immediately began communicating through their spiritual senses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"These rules put Ning Zhuo at a great disadvantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Exactly. If I were participating, I'd definitely team up first to deal with Ning Zhuo together!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Qing Huangzi's rules don't forbid teaming up at all. This is practically making Ning Zhuo face everyone else alone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Not necessarily. Maybe Ning Zhuo has already contacted other cultivators in advance and reached some kind of understanding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Qing Huangzi floated up and sat on a stone seat to one side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He lightly stamped his foot, activating the formation. Instantly, two barriers enveloped the entire stone platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"All step onto the stone platform," Qing Huangzi said quietly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">All the cultivators participating in this Rising Clouds Minor Trial stepped forward, standing at the edge of the stone platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">They stood with their backs to the outer hemispherical barrier, facing the inner barrier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Qing Huangzi added, "Release your bamboo puppet teams."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo and the others complied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Soon, the stone platform was filled with hundreds of small bamboo puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">These small mechanical puppets, made by each cultivator, carried a bit of their personal style.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">For example, Patchwork Sun's bamboo puppets looked ragged, as if randomly pieced together from various mechanical parts, with many joints crooked and uneven.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The small puppets lined up in a few rows, sparse and scattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Then there were Black Kite Chen San's bamboo puppets, noticeably smaller in size, very agile, equipped with needle tubes and arm crossbows, giving off a sneaky vibe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Jiang Xiaobian's bamboo puppets had strange shapes, with beetle-like hard shells on their backs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Some had mantis-like blade arms, while others had scorpion-like stingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Iron Drum Zhang Dadan had only three bamboo puppets, the largest on the platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">All three puppets were wrapped head to toe in heavy armor, tightly sealed like three miniature fortresses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Little Fire's bamboo puppets either carried strings of firecrackers or clay pots with fuses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo's small bamboo puppets were the most eye-catching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">These little figures were nearly identical, arranged in a way that seemed simple but actually hid a rigid order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Each bamboo puppet had smooth joints and flawless bodies, standing still as if an elite army ready to strike, their silence carrying an unsettling sharpness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Qing Huangzi sat in the main seat on the high platform, his expression as calm as an ancient well, with only a faint, hard-to-notice flicker of anticipation deep in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"The Rising Clouds Minor Trial begins now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">As soon as he spoke, the bamboo puppets on the stone platform almost all sprang into action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Their attack was unified, their focus aimed directly at Ning Zhuoâ€™s bamboo puppet squad!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Charge! Go, charge!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Little Fire yelled, striking a bronze gong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">His bamboo puppets rushed to the front.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Zhang Dadan slapped his waist drum, and three heavy-armored giant puppets moved slowly but steadily, pressing toward Ning Zhuoâ€™s formation with overwhelming force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Black Kite Chen San, sharp-eyed, whistled continuously, maneuvering his bamboo puppets away from the main group to circle from the left, attempting a flank attack on Ning Zhuoâ€™s forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Jiang Xiaobian blew into a bamboo flute, producing sharp, eerie notes that made his insect-like bamboo puppets unite like a sharp blade, thrusting forward as one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Onlookers gasped at the sightâ€”some worried for Ning Zhuo, others excited at the prospect of a good show.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">A few even thought with envy, "If only Ning Zhuo would fail here, defeated in front of everyone, that would be perfect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Qing Huangzi glanced at Ning Zhuo, ready to use musical notes to interfere at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">He had designed this Rising Clouds Minor Trial to manipulate the rules, ensuring he kept control throughout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">If Ning Zhuo couldnâ€™t react in time, Qing Huangzi would unleash notes to sway the battle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"If you can stand alone against everyoneâ€™s combined efforts, then no one will question me naming you the top rank!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"This is a perfect opportunityâ€”if you seize it, you can turn the tables."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Come on, show me what youâ€™ve got!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Qing Huangzi held deep expectations for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">But the next moment, the temporary bamboo puppet alliance suddenly fell into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Many puppets moved erraticallyâ€”some stalled, some charged wildly, and others even fell apart on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Whatâ€™s going on?" Patchwork Sun and the others turned pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Chen Sanâ€™s eyes flashed with understanding, and he immediately sent a mental message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">At the same time, one cultivator shouted, "Weâ€™re all using sound control based on the Primordial Sound Reed Manual! The overlapping sounds are clashing and causing internal conflict!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The rest quickly grasped the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The spectators caught on as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"So, this trial isnâ€™t as straightforward as it seemsâ€”thereâ€™s a hidden trick to it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">"Of course Qing Huangziâ€™s trial to pick a successor wouldnâ€™t be simple!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">"Hah, if I were him, Iâ€™d just hand the legacy to Ning Zhuo and be done with it. Why bother with a contest?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"But then we wouldnâ€™t get to see a show like this, would we?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"Well, thatâ€™s true!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">The bamboo puppet alliance was in disarray, their advance halting abruptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Ning Zhuo remained expressionless, waving his arm to summon an artifact-grade zither.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Under everyoneâ€™s watchful eyes, the big-headed youth used just two fingers of his left hand to press the strings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">He plucked lightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">"Twang!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">A sharp, abrupt note burst forth, like metal being torn apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Ning Zhuoâ€™s bamboo puppet squad surged forward with the sound, launching their attack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Then, Ning Zhuoâ€™s left hand danced like a butterfly, fingers moving so fast they blurred into shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">A series of harsh, piercing noises suddenly swept through the area!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">The unexpected zither notes felt like countless needles stabbing into every cultivatorâ€™s eardrums.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">"What is that sound?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">"Itâ€™s awful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">"Ugh... Iâ€™m going to be sick."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">The noise was as grating as nails on glass, sharp and irritating, making everyone restless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">Patchwork Sun and the others were badly affected, and the bamboo puppet alliance descended into even greater chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">Ning Zhuoâ€™s squad seized the chance to cut through them, dominating the field unchallenged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">Little Fire had boldly challenged Ning Zhuo before the trial, drawing attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Ning Zhuo made sure he was dealt with first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">In just a few breaths, Little Fireâ€™s bamboo puppets were nearly wiped out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">"No!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">Little Fire glared in fury, crying out in despair and frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
