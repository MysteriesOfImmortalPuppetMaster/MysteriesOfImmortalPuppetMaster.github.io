<paragraph index="1">Green Bamboo Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Inside the cave dwelling, Qing Huangzi, with a solemn expression, recounted the general situation of his lineage's inheritance to Ning Zhuo before the divine effigy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Empty Valley Pitch, Azure Mechanism Slip!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This was the name of this mechanical inheritance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Its original source was the Bamboo Mountain Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This sect no longer existed. When the mountain gate was attacked, the enemy's methods were highly sophisticated, inciting internal strife within the sect. They scattered without engaging the enemy, leaving behind a few loyal cultivators who were willing to fight to the death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">With too few cultivators, the defense line was breached all the way, and they ultimately retreated to a bamboo forest in the valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In a moment of existential crisis, two of the surviving cultivators - one proficient in rhythm and music, the other skilled in mechanisms - cooperated, rapidly modifying the bamboo forest, transforming a section of the bamboo into whistles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">When the enemy forcefully broke in, the cultivators activated the formation, unleashing a great wind that swept through the bamboo forest, naturally causing the bamboo whistles to sound again. Countless sonic blades shot out, circling the bamboo poles, killing the enemy and soaking the ground in blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The enemy's several attempts to charge were all unsuccessful, and they suffered heavy losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">There was a solution - to pull out the bamboo forest, leaving the opponents without their defense. But the leader was also mindful that these bamboo were all spiritual plants of immense value, so they preferred to lay low and strategize gradually.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The main mountain gate of the Bamboo Mountain Sect had been breached, leaving only this mountain valley behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">At the time, war was the main theme of the entire cultivation world. After the leader occupied this area, facing various external pressures, they had less and less energy to seize the final valley bamboo forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Bamboo Mountain Sect had already effectively perished since its internal chaos and dispersal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Every so often, the leader would send several experts to the valley bamboo forest to persuade them to surrender. In the process of persuasion, inevitable sparring and competition would occur.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The two sides, relying on the wind-whistle bamboo forest, engaged in many offensive and defensive battles. Some were tentative, withdrawing after a small gain, while others escalated to casualties and real fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Through this constant grinding, the remaining elders in the valley were spurred to cooperate, continuously innovate, and gradually deepen and develop the initial inspiration of the wind-whistle bamboo forest into a complete system.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">This system was then passed down through generations, constantly evolving. By the time it reached Qing Huangzi, it was already the twenty-eighth generation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Qing Huangzi solemnly stared into Ning Zhuo's eyes: "Ning Zhuo, you are the twenty-ninth generation successor of this Empty Valley Pitch, Azure Mechanism Slip!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Our inheritance does not belong to the Myriad Manifestations Sect. On the contrary, the Myriad Manifestations Sect annexed the sect of the previous generation's successor, which is what led to the current situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"However, being within the Myriad Manifestations Sect is not bad. Many times, the inheritance was saved from being lost with the help of the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"In this long lineage, we have also seen the emergence of a Soul Formation level existence. However, he had a different main cultivation technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"The highest cultivation level attained by a forefather who genuinely and fully practiced this inheritance reached the Nascent Soul level. According to today's standards, this is a Nascent Soul level inheritance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">At this point, Qing Huangzi breathed a sigh of relief: "I see that you have achieved Foundation Establishment and have another main cultivation technique. This does not matter. As long as you succeed in taking the oath before the divine statue, the first task is to properly preserve this inheritance and, as far as you are able, find the most excellent successor. The second is to try your best to complete, improve, and promote this inheritance if possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Ning Zhuo, your cultivation talent is far superior to mine. You are full of youthful spirit, as brilliant as the morning sun. Youth is truly wonderful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"I have self-awareness, you can rest assured. Therefore, you do not need to worry about becoming my disciple upon inheriting this tradition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The relationship between master and disciple is extraordinary!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">This kind of strong social bond sometimes surpasses even blood relations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">In a super sect like the Myriad Manifestations Sect, factions are numerous, the population is vast, and various interwoven interests, emotional and grudges, make the internal situation extremely complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">When Ning Zhuo truly acknowledges a master in the future, it will be considered his complete affiliation with a specific faction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"My acquisition of the stone tablet and the talent I displayed made even Qing Huangzi afraid to take me as a disciple.", Ning Zho thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"This can be considered one of the benefits of my choice to be high-profile."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Had it been earlier, before Ning Zhuo had shown enough of his excellence, Qing Huangzi would likely have required the successor to become his disciple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Prematurely becoming a disciple would be a significant loss for Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">After all, Qing Huangzi's personal combat power and background connections were too weak; he himself was not even a Golden Core True Disciple. From this perspective, he belonged to the peripheral figures outside the power structure of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo faced the divine effigy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The posture of the effigy was rather peculiar and different from most others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He wore a plain white robe, a hair-fastening crown with an ant-like pattern, with three strands of azure hair hanging in front of his forehead, the ends cut straight as if by a sharp blade. His left palm held a half-section of a frost-colored saber horizontally across his chest, and broken hair was wrapped around the sword's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo recognized him as the Severed-Hair Sword Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">During his life, the deeds of the Severed-Hair Guarding the Saber were already famous throughout the land. Now, after more than a thousand years, they are still widely circulated, earning him a place in history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo raised his left hand in a sword-finger gesture, imitating the Sword Lord, and held it horizontally across his brow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">After reciting the divine name, he immediately activated the divine effigy's power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The effigy emitted a resolute white light. The divine light condensed in mid-air, forming a round mirror. The edge of the mirror had ninety-nine azure pins, and the mirror surface reflected a clear image of the one taking the oath, Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo faced the divine effigy and completed the oath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The divine light mirror divided into two streams: one entered Ning Zhuo's body, and the other merged into the divine effigy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The light dissipated immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Qing Huangzi witnessed the entire process. Seeing Ning Zhuo successfully take the oath, he let out a sigh of relief, visibly delighted: "Good, very good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Afterward, he led Ning Zhuo to the inner chamber and handed him over a dozen jade slips and three storage bags.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"These bags contain the necessary items for cultivation, considered the foundation of our inheritance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"My time is short, and keeping them for my own cultivation would not be very useful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Apart from these, the largest piece of wealth is this Green Bamboo Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Qing Huangzi sighed, looking down at the floor tiles: "This mountain peak originally belonged to the eleventh generation successor of our lineage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The Myriad Manifestations Sect annexed his sect and also relocated this mountain peak here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Currently, this mountain peak is only leased for our use. The various spiritual bamboo on the mountain have also been painstakingly cultivated and planted by our successive successors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"The geology, water quality, and formations here are all very mature, making it the best place for raising bamboo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"When I perish in the future, you must immediately report it, handle the handover, and lease this mountain peak. This mountain full of spiritual bamboo will be suitable cultivation resources for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Cough, cough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Speaking up to this point, Qing Huangzi looked sickly and coughed incessantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He was truly old. He was just holding on in public before, but now that Ning Zhuo had become the successor, he no longer concealed it. The constant coughing indicated the spread of death qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo opened his mouth, about to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">But Qing Huangzi offered a bitter smile, waving his hand: "Go now. After you obtained the stone tablet, I investigated you. Although the intelligence was limited, only recording your actions since arriving at the Myriad Manifestations Sect, it reassured me greatly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"You possess such talent and yet still work so hard. There is a reason you, at such a young age, have achieved so much."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Staying by my side will only restrict you. And you would feel uncomfortable, wouldn't you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Go, go, act according to your own intentions. I will hold the last vigil for you at Green Bamboo Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Having completed the inheritance of his lineage, Qing Huangzi fulfilled his biggest wish, and the breath he was forcefully holding gave out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo wore a solemn expression, bowed deeply, and turned to leave in silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">It was evident that Qing Huangzi had little time left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">These were the final days of his life; let him choose his own way to depart. This was a cultivator's final dignity and respect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo hosted several tables of drinks at the Exquisite Treasure Tower, inviting the cultivators who had participated in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo sat at the head table, dressed in a plain white robe, his expression gentle, a faint smile playing on the corner of his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">During the feast, cups and dishes crossed, and the atmosphere was lively. Before long, many of the cultivators seated were flushed with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Chen San's voice, with its characteristic slick tone, actively toasted Ning Zhuo: "Young Master Ning! Ah, today was truly an eye-opener. The little mechanism trinkets we risk our lives to tinker with are truly fireflies compared to the bright moon before you - they're nothing at all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">His exaggerated sigh drew a chorus of laughs from the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"That's right, that's right," an unfamiliar cultivator stood up, emboldened by the alcohol, "Young Master Ning, why are you so exceptional at using 'sound control' to command the multitude of bamboo mechanism people? You command them almost like a battle-hardened elite force? I observed carefully and could tell you only used content from the Original Sound Strategy Scroll."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Although Ning Zhuo had already deduced the Consonant Sound Strategy Scroll, he deliberately held back and did not use it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">According to Qing Huangzi's rules, this was not forbidden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But Ning Zhuo, to convince everyone and solidify his reputation, only used the Original Sound Strategy Scroll.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, put down his jade chopsticks, and spoke in a clear and calm voice: "You all flatter me. The essence of 'sound control,' in my humble opinion, lies in 'harmonious convergence of vital energy and smooth rhythm,' rather than simply pursuing the forceful penetration of spiritual energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The questioning cultivator probably hadn't expected Ning Zhuo to genuinely offer guidance, and in such detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He became increasingly engrossed, as did others in the same situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Consequently, the lively feast quickly turned quiet. One could only hear the wind outside the window, the murmur of voices in the tavern outside the private room, and the chirping sound of the beetles in Jiang Xiaolan's bamboo slips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After Ning Zhuo finished speaking, the questioning cultivator was overjoyed, bowing deeply with emotion: "Thank you, Young Master Ning, for your guidance! Golden words and precious advice, like enlightenment itself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Not at all. Just mutual discussion and exchange," Ning Zhuo smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Jiang Xiaolan gritted her teeth, unable to contain herself, and asked the second question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Ning Zhuo smiled: "It's completely normal for Fellow Daoist Jiang to have this confusion. In my view..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">He not only answered Jiang Xiaolan's question but also commented on her beetle bamboo mechanism, praising it highly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Jiang Xiaolan hadn't been drinking, yet her face turned bright red from excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">The residual grudge she had from her previous encounter with Ning Zhuo was already small, but now it completely vanished. Furthermore, she felt great admiration for Ning Zhuo: "He only fought me once, yet he saw many weaknesses in my beetle bamboo mechanism. Truly worthy of being a first-rate genius!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">After Jiang Xiaolan, others successively asked questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Ning Zhuo explained everything clearly, going from the complex to the simple, with not a hint of condescension in his words. His casual yet precise comments and problem-solving methods, which struck directly at the core issues, made the questioning cultivators feel as if they had stumbled upon a treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">The feast transformed into an exchange meeting on mechanism arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Ning Zhuo was not merely teaching; he also sought advice from other cultivators. Chen San was the first one he consulted. When consulted, Chen San immediately stood up, his face full of flattery and surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">By the end of the banquet, everyone was still lingering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Chen San's eyes flashed with brilliance, and his smile was much warmer and more sincere than before: "Just a small pointer from Young Master Ning is enough for us to ponder for half a lifetime! I, Chen San, will serve you wholeheartedly in any capacity, through fire and water, should Young Master Ning ever need me in the future!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">The atmosphere at the table subtly shifted because of these words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Chen San nodded with a smile: "Fellow Daoists are too polite. The path of mechanism arts is vast, and only through mutual confirmation can one make progress. Today's minor trial also allowed me to benefit greatly..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">It was clear that Chen San intended to attach himself to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Ning Zhuo neither directly rejected him nor immediately agreed, which made the proactive Chen San, who was still standing, feel somewhat awkward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">But at that moment, a waiter from the tavern brought a food box.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Ning Zhuo pointed to the food box and said gently: "One person is missing from the table today. Fellow Daoist Huo Wa'er is strong-willed, and I suppose he couldn't bring himself to attend. The 'Nine Treasures Delicacy Stew' from this Exquisite Treasure Tower is an absolute delicacy, rich in spiritual energy, and most effective for replenishing vital energy. I trouble Brother Chen San to run an errand for me after the feast and deliver it to Huo Wa'er."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">Chen San was taken aback, then a look of pleasant surprise appeared on his face. He immediately thumped his chest and agreed: "Young Master, don't worry! Leave it to me! You truly are... magnanimous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly: "Please also tell him that today's exchange was unfinished. I, Ning Zhuo, am always ready for him to challenge me again. His mechanical bamboo puppet actually has some unique qualities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">After the feast, Chen San took the food box and immediately found Huo Wa'er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">"What? Ning Zhuo actually remembered me and specifically brought this for me?" Huo Wa'er was extremely surprised. He had clearly publicly offended Ning Zhuo during the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">When Chen San sincerely relayed Ning Zhuo's words, Huo Wa'er's rugged face first showed astonishment, then transformed into a thick, complicated expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">He opened the food box, looked at the spiritually rich delicacy inside, paused, and then fiercely wiped his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">He gritted his teeth and said: "To be honest, I truly wasn't reconciled. My bamboo mechanism people didn't fully display their potential."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">"But Young Master... Ning Zhuo, he still agreed to spar with me. He... thinks highly of me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">At this point, Huo Wa'er's voice slightly trembled, his fists clenched, his face full of the joy of being respected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Chen San took in Huo Wa'er's expression and sighed inwardly: "Hmph, Ning Zhuo... this kind of maneuver truly makes people incapable of even mustering the strength to resent him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">After bidding farewell to Huo Wa'er, Chen San, filled with excitement, flew toward the Green Stone Cave Dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">He intended to report to Ning Zhuo that very night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">"Even if he refuses to see me, I must stand outside the cave dwelling and wait the entire night!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">"A genius like him is rare enough, but one with such strategic depth is even rarer. He must be a descendant of a major clan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">"If I don't give my best effort to cling to a 'thigh' like this, I would truly be letting myself down."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">Chen San had a considerable degree of self-awareness. He knew that with his aptitude, he would at most hover around the Foundation Establishment stage. Attaching himself to a powerhouse would be a much more likely path than self-cultivation!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
