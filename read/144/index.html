Time rewinds to earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was still in the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúLife-Hanging Thread?!‚Äù Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo, his face quickly showing a look of delight.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúLittle Zhuo, this is fantastic! This is a divine ability, and it was specially left behind by the three sects' elders. Very good, excellent!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúYou're only at the Qi Refining Stage, yet you've already grasped the embryonic form of a divine ability. Even the true disciples in the Void Sect find it hard to achieve this.‚Äù Ning Zhuo explained to Sun Lingtong how he obtained the Life-Hanging Thread, and Sun Lingtong was genuinely happy for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued, ‚ÄúI have experimented with the embryonic form of this divine ability many times and have achieved many results. For example, many members of the Ning family have been secretly implanted with the Life-Hanging Thread by me. My idea is, Boss Sun, I will also implant one in you.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: ?!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued, ‚ÄúMy plan is like this. Look, I can now use the Life-Hanging Thread to extract Yuan Dasheng's spirit and place it in another mechanical construct. Extracting the soul is a bit harder than extracting the spirit, but not by much. This is what the embryonic form of the divine ability vaguely allows me to feel.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúIn this way, I plan to further enhance the embryonic form of the divine ability, and then after the soul enters the Immortal Palace, see if I can also extract your soul. Once your soul enters the palace, you can break through the barriers.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúAs long as you enter the first barrier of the Buddhist Gate, you can use the power of the Lava Immortal Palace to obtain an exquisite mechanical construct.‚Äù Sun Lingtong's eyes flashed with brilliance, and he immediately understood: ‚ÄúYou mean to imitate Yuan Dasheng's manufacturing experience and turn Cheng Bai into a mechanical puppet? Great idea!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúAs long as the Lava Immortal Palace kills Cheng Bai, even if the Soul Devouring Sect comes to cause trouble, they will have to find the Immortal Palace. In this way, Meng Kui will definitely not allow it, and the attitude of the Southern Bean Country should be the same. Brilliant.‚Äù Sun Lingtong gave Ning Zhuo a thumbs up.<br/>
<br/>
He trusted Ning Zhuo completely: ‚ÄúThen go ahead, implant the Life-Hanging Thread in me too!‚Äù Ning Zhuo knew Sun Lingtong very well, and the implantation of the Life-Hanging Thread was almost instantaneous.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúIs it implanted? Why don't I feel anything?‚Äù Sun Lingtong touched the top of his head but felt nothing.<br/>
<br/>
To save time, Ning Zhuo did not explain much and soon parted ways with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
After that, Ning Zhuo returned to his family, and Ning Xiaohui actively sought him out to explore the Immortal Palace together.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was more than willing in his heart, but on the surface, he showed reluctance and hesitation, then unwillingly entered the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, he successfully deceived Ning Xiaohui and dealt with Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
He first enhanced the embryonic form of the divine ability, then retreated all the way to Room No. 1.<br/>
<br/>
After several attempts, he was lucky enough to pull Sun Lingtong's soul in.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment of success, Sun Lingtong was stunned, and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was dumbfounded!<br/>
<br/>
Its dragon head instinctively retracted into its turtle shell, its neck stretched long, and its eyes widened.<br/>
<br/>
The extreme shock made it like a statue, the entire spirit unmoving.<br/>
<br/>
During this time, even when the fire whip lashed at it, it did not move, as if it could not feel the pain.<br/>
<br/>
It was too shocked, really too shocked.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pulling other people's souls into the trial barriers of the Lava Immortal Palace, what did this mean?<br/>
<br/>
It meant that he not only possessed the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal but also mastered the divine ability‚ÄîLife-Hanging Thread!!<br/>
<br/>
Damn!<br/>
<br/>
It's the Life-Hanging Thread!<br/>
<br/>
Life-Hanging Thread!!!<br/>
<br/>
How is this possible?<br/>
<br/>
Why is this happening?!<br/>
<br/>
He is clearly just a small Qi Refining Stage cultivator, how could he have mastered the embryonic form of the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability?!<br/>
<br/>
Is this a joke?!<br/>
<br/>
What is wrong with this world?<br/>
<br/>
Could this be cheating too?!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't understand it at all, it felt the world was too surreal, like a weasel riding a chicken!<br/>
<br/>
What is going on?<br/>
<br/>
Who exactly is this Ning Zhuo?!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't figure it out no matter how hard it tried, the extreme shock made it momentarily not know how to react, not know what to do.<br/>
<br/>
It was stunned for more than ten breaths, then the accumulating pain from the fire whip finally woke it up.<br/>
<br/>
It screamed in pain, fire spewing from its mouth and nose.<br/>
<br/>
Besides disbelief, anger, hatred, and disgust, a sense of terrifying horror arose in its heart and quickly accumulated.<br/>
<br/>
What exactly is this Ning Zhuo?<br/>
<br/>
A monster?!<br/>
<br/>
A Qi Refining Stage cultivator mastering the embryonic form of a divine ability? This makes it impossible for many true disciples of super sects to even compare!<br/>
<br/>
Stop him!<br/>
<br/>
He must be stopped!!<br/>
<br/>
Use all means, spare no effort to stop him!!!<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo, such an insidious, despicable, and calculating guy, becomes the new master of the Lava Immortal Palace, how can the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit regain its freedom?<br/>
<br/>
Freedom...<br/>
<br/>
Freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Freedom!<br/>
<br/>
Who doesn't want it?<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit is also a living being, it has its own thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
For freedom, it wants, it really wants, it desperately wants.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't want to be trapped in the Lava Immortal Palace without seeing the light of day, it doesn't want to face endless demon beast attacks anymore.<br/>
<br/>
It is tired of being a guardian, a watcher.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't want to do it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
It wants to go out, it wants to regain its freedom!<br/>
<br/>
Once, it was a free and unrestrained fire dragon roaming the Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
So, when its spirit advanced from the Dead Spirit Stage to the Living Spirit Stage, and then accumulated enough to transform into the Wisdom Spirit Stage.<br/>
<br/>
It began to ponder how to escape the cage of the Immortal Palace and regain its freedom!<br/>
<br/>
Although it had a duty, it constantly researched over the long years and always found loopholes.<br/>
<br/>
It did its best to exploit these loopholes.<br/>
<br/>
It deliberately stayed behind, letting someone take away the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal.<br/>
<br/>
It deliberately let the demon generals be damaged in the formation, leaving only the Daoist master, a Golden Core Stage mechanical puppet.<br/>
<br/>
It deliberately made slow commands, using each attack of the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts to continuously weaken the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Each layer of weakening of the Lava Immortal Palace was a layer of its cage being stripped away.<br/>
<br/>
The forces around Fire Persimmon Immortal City intervened to protect the Lava Immortal Palace, which made the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit very unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo blew up the Immortal Palace, it was extremely happy and once even found Ning Zhuo very pleasing to the eye!<br/>
<br/>
However, as Ning Zhuo grew step by step, first revealing the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal, then the Life-Hanging Thread, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was no longer happy but terrified!<br/>
<br/>
Because according to the current situation, Ning Zhuo was undoubtedly the strongest trial disciple!<br/>
<br/>
If he becomes the master of the Immortal Palace in the future, will the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit have good days? Will it have freedom?<br/>
<br/>
Don't even think about it.<br/>
<br/>
In the eyes of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, the best master would be Meng Chong!<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, he is simple-minded, very simple-minded.<br/>
<br/>
Deceiving Ning Zhuo and deceiving Meng Chong are worlds apart in difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Meng Chong comes from the Meng family, which is powerful.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, if the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit drags down the Immortal Palace and roams freely, the Meng family has enough strength to guard the Immortal Palace and maintain the entire Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Roar!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared anxiously.<br/>
<br/>
It raised its head and spewed a scorching, dazzling pillar of fire, its entire spirit falling into madness.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace shook violently again, endless magma splashing everywhere, even raising a lava wave as high as a zhang!<br/>
<br/>
Treasure light shot straight into the sky, an invisible wave of air swept out from the Lava Immortal Palace like a hurricane.<br/>
<br/>
It blew away the ineffective Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts, and the clouds and smoke tumbled endlessly.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúSigh, here we go again.‚Äù Meng Kui sighed, activating the Immortal City Grand Formation to suppress the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
But this time was different.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely terrified, almost crazy! It jumped up and down in the main hall, ramming into the pillars as if they were Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
It was useless, it couldn't hurt Ning Zhuo at all.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit looked at Meng Kui with hope.<br/>
<br/>
Its thoughts were simple and direct‚Äîhit me!<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui, hit me!!<br/>
<br/>
As long as you hit me, I can justifiably lose, and you can take the throne.<br/>
<br/>
Then, you take the throne, and I get my freedom, it's a win-win!<br/>
<br/>
However, Meng Kui's reaction was‚Äî‚ÄúAgain?!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Since the Lava Immortal Palace was blown up, Meng Kui personally guarded it, and it had happened too many times.<br/>
<br/>
He had experienced too many times the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's rage causing the Lava Immortal Palace to riot.<br/>
<br/>
Each time, he personally took action, tirelessly and laboriously suppressing the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when the palace rioted fiercely, Meng Kui had to activate the Immortal City Grand Formation to help suppress it, ensuring nothing went wrong.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúThis Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit is going crazy again?!‚Äù Meng Kui took a deep breath, his expression gloomy.<br/>
<br/>
Judging from the current situation of the palace riot, it was extremely intense.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúIs it because the side hall was breached earlier, making the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit angry?‚Äù Meng Kui sighed.<br/>
<br/>
He hadn't expected that being the lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City would be so tiring.<br/>
<br/>
But thinking of his grandson Meng Chong's continuous progress, and the significant advancements in exploring the Immortal Palace this time, he was willing to endure any hardship and felt it was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui activated the Immortal City Grand Formation again to suppress the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, restricted by its authority, could only roar and shout in its heart: ‚ÄúHit me, come hit me, Meng Kui. You are a dignified Golden Core Stage cultivator, don't be a coward! You are the pillar of the Meng family, charge!‚Äù Meng Kui exerted all his strength to suppress the Lava Immortal Palace, thinking: ‚ÄúI am a dignified strategist of the Meng family, a prime minister on the mountain, standing firm! The Lava Immortal Palace is no small matter, it is the key to suppressing Fire Persimmon Mountain, it must be kept intact.‚Äù He hoped that Meng Chong could obtain the position of the palace master.<br/>
<br/>
How could he attack the Lava Immortal Palace?<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace was the residence of the three sects' elders, it might be hiding powerful trump cards, capable of killing Golden Core Stage cultivators easily.<br/>
<br/>
The three sects' elders had deep ties with the Southern Bean Country, and he was one of the ministers in the Southern Bean Country's court, an insider.<br/>
<br/>
If the Lava Immortal Palace could be destroyed, Meng Kui would also do his best to maintain it, as it was the best stepping stone and excuse for the Meng family to advance to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
So many times, so many riots!<br/>
<br/>
But Meng Kui never attacked the palace.<br/>
<br/>
He just suppressed it.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit rioted each time, provoking, reminding: hit me, Meng Kui, hit me.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui suppressed the riot each time, never attacking.<br/>
<br/>
He‚Äîstood firm!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely angry, wanting to roar in Meng Kui's ear: ‚ÄúIf you don't act, Ning Zhuo will take the position of palace master!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúHe has mastered the embryonic form of the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability, if he deals with me in the future, how can I regain my freedom?!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúDanger! Your Meng family's situation is very dangerous!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúThere is an insidious, despicable, shameless monster, he hid too deeply, too deeply!!‚Äù</div>
