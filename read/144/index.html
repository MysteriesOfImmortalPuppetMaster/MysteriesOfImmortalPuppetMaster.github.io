<paragraph index="1">Time rewinds to earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo was still in the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">‚ÄúLife Hanging by a Thread?!‚Äù Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo, his face quickly showing a look of delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">‚ÄúLittle Zhuo, this is fantastic! This is a divine ability, and it was specially left behind by the three sects' elders. Very good, excellent!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">‚ÄúYou're only at the Qi Refining Stage, yet you've already grasped the embryonic form of a divine ability. Even the true disciples in the Void Sect find it hard to achieve this.‚Äù Ning Zhuo explained to Sun Lingtong how he obtained the Life Hanging by a Thread, and Sun Lingtong was genuinely happy for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo continued, ‚ÄúI have experimented with the embryonic form of this divine ability many times and have achieved many results. For example, many members of the Ning family have been secretly implanted with the Life Hanging by a Thread by me. My idea is, Boss Sun, I will also implant one in you.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo continued, ‚ÄúMy plan is like this. Look, I can now use the Life Hanging by a Thread to extract Yuan Dasheng's spirit and place it in another mechanical construct. Extracting the soul is a bit harder than extracting the spirit, but not by much. This is what the embryonic form of the divine ability vaguely allows me to feel.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">‚ÄúIn this way, I plan to further enhance the embryonic form of the divine ability, and then after the soul enters the Immortal Palace, see if I can also extract your soul. Once your soul enters the palace, you can break through the barriers.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">‚ÄúAs long as you enter the first barrier of the Buddhist Gate, you can use the power of the Lava Immortal Palace to obtain an exquisite mechanical construct.‚Äù Sun Lingtong's eyes flashed with brilliance, and he immediately understood: ‚ÄúYou mean to imitate Yuan Dasheng's manufacturing experience and turn Cheng Bai into a mechanical puppet? Great idea!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">‚ÄúAs long as the Lava Immortal Palace kills Cheng Bai, even if the Soul Devouring Sect comes to cause trouble, they will have to find the Immortal Palace. In this way, Meng Kui will definitely not allow it, and the attitude of the Southern Bean Country should be the same. Brilliant.‚Äù Sun Lingtong gave Ning Zhuo a thumbs up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He trusted Ning Zhuo completely: ‚ÄúThen go ahead, implant the Life Hanging by a Thread in me too!‚Äù Ning Zhuo knew Sun Lingtong very well, and the implantation of the Life Hanging by a Thread was almost instantaneous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">‚ÄúIs it implanted? Why don't I feel anything?‚Äù Sun Lingtong touched the top of his head but felt nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">To save time, Ning Zhuo did not explain much and soon parted ways with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After that, Ning Zhuo returned to his family, and Ning Xiaohui actively sought him out to explore the Immortal Palace together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo was more than willing in his heart, but on the surface, he showed reluctance and hesitation, then unwillingly entered the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Afterward, he successfully deceived Ning Xiaohui and dealt with Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He first enhanced the embryonic form of the divine ability, then retreated all the way to Room No. 1.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">After several attempts, he was lucky enough to pull Sun Lingtong's soul in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">At the moment of success, Sun Lingtong was stunned, and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was dumbfounded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Its dragon head instinctively retracted into its turtle shell, its neck stretched long, and its eyes widened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The extreme shock made it like a statue, the entire spirit unmoving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">During this time, even when the fire whip lashed at it, it did not move, as if it could not feel the pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">It was too shocked, really too shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo pulling other people's souls into the trial barriers of the Lava Immortal Palace, what did this mean?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">It meant that he not only possessed the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal but also mastered the divine ability‚ÄîLife Hanging by a Thread!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Damn!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">It's the Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Life Hanging by a Thread!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">How is this possible?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Why is this happening?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He is clearly just a small Qi Refining Stage cultivator, how could he have mastered the embryonic form of the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Is this a joke?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">What is wrong with this world?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Could this be cheating too?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't understand it at all, it felt the world was too surreal, like a weasel riding a chicken!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">What is going on?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Who exactly is this Ning Zhuo?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't figure it out no matter how hard it tried, the extreme shock made it momentarily not know how to react, not know what to do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It was stunned for more than ten breaths, then the accumulating pain from the fire whip finally woke it up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">It screamed in pain, fire spewing from its mouth and nose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Besides disbelief, anger, hatred, and disgust, a sense of terrifying horror arose in its heart and quickly accumulated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">What exactly is this Ning Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">A monster?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">A Qi Refining Stage cultivator mastering the embryonic form of a divine ability? This makes it impossible for many true disciples of super sects to even compare!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Stop him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He must be stopped!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Use all means, spare no effort to stop him!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">If Ning Zhuo, such an insidious, despicable, and calculating guy, becomes the new master of the Lava Immortal Palace, how can the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit regain its freedom?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Freedom...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Freedom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Who doesn't want it?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit is also a living being, it has its own thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">For freedom, it wants, it really wants, it desperately wants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">It doesn't want to be trapped in the Lava Immortal Palace without seeing the light of day, it doesn't want to face endless demon beast attacks anymore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">It is tired of being a guardian, a watcher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">It doesn't want to do it anymore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">It wants to go out, it wants to regain its freedom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Once, it was a free and unrestrained fire dragon roaming the Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">So, when its spirit advanced from the Dead Spirit Stage to the Living Spirit Stage, and then accumulated enough to transform into the Wisdom Spirit Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">It began to ponder how to escape the cage of the Immortal Palace and regain its freedom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Although it had a duty, it constantly researched over the long years and always found loopholes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">It did its best to exploit these loopholes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">It deliberately stayed behind, letting someone take away the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">It deliberately let the demon generals be damaged in the formation, leaving only the Daoist master, a Golden Core Stage mechanical puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">It deliberately made slow commands, using each attack of the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts to continuously weaken the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Each layer of weakening of the Lava Immortal Palace was a layer of its cage being stripped away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The forces around Fire Persimmon Immortal City intervened to protect the Lava Immortal Palace, which made the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit very unhappy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">When Ning Zhuo blew up the Immortal Palace, it was extremely happy and once even found Ning Zhuo very pleasing to the eye!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">However, as Ning Zhuo grew step by step, first revealing the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal, then the Life Hanging by a Thread, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was no longer happy but terrified!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Because according to the current situation, Ning Zhuo was undoubtedly the strongest trial disciple!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">If he becomes the master of the Immortal Palace in the future, will the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit have good days? Will it have freedom?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Don't even think about it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">In the eyes of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, the best master would be Meng Chong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">On one hand, he is simple-minded, very simple-minded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Deceiving Ning Zhuo and deceiving Meng Chong are worlds apart in difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">On the other hand, Meng Chong comes from the Meng family, which is powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">In the future, if the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit drags down the Immortal Palace and roams freely, the Meng family has enough strength to guard the Immortal Palace and maintain the entire Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared anxiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">It raised its head and spewed a scorching, dazzling pillar of fire, its entire spirit falling into madness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Lava Immortal Palace shook violently again, endless magma splashing everywhere, even raising a lava wave as high as a zhang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Treasure light shot straight into the sky, an invisible wave of air swept out from the Lava Immortal Palace like a hurricane.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">It blew away the ineffective Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts, and the clouds and smoke tumbled endlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">‚ÄúSigh, here we go again.‚Äù Meng Kui sighed, activating the Immortal City Grand Formation to suppress the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">But this time was different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely terrified, almost crazy! It jumped up and down in the main hall, ramming into the pillars as if they were Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">It was useless, it couldn't hurt Ning Zhuo at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit looked at Meng Kui with hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Its thoughts were simple and direct‚Äîhit me!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Meng Kui, hit me!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">As long as you hit me, I can justifiably lose, and you can take the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Then, you take the throne, and I get my freedom, it's a win-win!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">However, Meng Kui's reaction was‚Äî‚ÄúAgain?!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Since the Lava Immortal Palace was blown up, Meng Kui personally guarded it, and it had happened too many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He had experienced too many times the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's rage causing the Lava Immortal Palace to riot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Each time, he personally took action, tirelessly and laboriously suppressing the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sometimes, when the palace rioted fiercely, Meng Kui had to activate the Immortal City Grand Formation to help suppress it, ensuring nothing went wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">‚ÄúThis Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit is going crazy again?!‚Äù Meng Kui took a deep breath, his expression gloomy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Judging from the current situation of the palace riot, it was extremely intense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">‚ÄúIs it because the side hall was breached earlier, making the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit angry?‚Äù Meng Kui sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He hadn't expected that being the lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City would be so tiring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">But thinking of his grandson Meng Chong's continuous progress, and the significant advancements in exploring the Immortal Palace this time, he was willing to endure any hardship and felt it was worth it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Meng Kui activated the Immortal City Grand Formation again to suppress the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, restricted by its authority, could only roar and shout in its heart: ‚ÄúHit me, come hit me, Meng Kui. You are a dignified Golden Core Stage cultivator, don't be a coward! You are the pillar of the Meng family, charge!‚Äù Meng Kui exerted all his strength to suppress the Lava Immortal Palace, thinking: ‚ÄúI am a dignified strategist of the Meng family, a prime minister on the mountain, standing firm! The Lava Immortal Palace is no small matter, it is the key to suppressing Fire Persimmon Mountain, it must be kept intact.‚Äù He hoped that Meng Chong could obtain the position of the palace master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">How could he attack the Lava Immortal Palace?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Lava Immortal Palace was the residence of the three sects' elders, it might be hiding powerful trump cards, capable of killing Golden Core Stage cultivators easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The three sects' elders had deep ties with the Southern Bean Country, and he was one of the ministers in the Southern Bean Country's court, an insider.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">If the Lava Immortal Palace could be destroyed, Meng Kui would also do his best to maintain it, as it was the best stepping stone and excuse for the Meng family to advance to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">So many times, so many riots!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">But Meng Kui never attacked the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He just suppressed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit rioted each time, provoking, reminding: hit me, Meng Kui, hit me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Meng Kui suppressed the riot each time, never attacking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He‚Äîstood firm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely angry, wanting to roar in Meng Kui's ear: ‚ÄúIf you don't act, Ning Zhuo will take the position of palace master!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">‚ÄúHe has mastered the embryonic form of the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability, if he deals with me in the future, how can I regain my freedom?!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">‚ÄúDanger! Your Meng family's situation is very dangerous!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">‚ÄúThere is an insidious, despicable, shameless monster, he hid too deeply, too deeply!!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
