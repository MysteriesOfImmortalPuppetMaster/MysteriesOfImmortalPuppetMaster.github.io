<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Che Zhuzi asked Ning Zhuo what kind of magic treasure he desired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo quickly considered his options.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">I'm only at the Foundation Establishment stage. Many magic treasures are beyond my reach, consuming too much spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Actually, I already have two defensive treasures. What I really lack is a proper offensive one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">But the same problem remains - magic treasures drain spiritual energy too quickly. How many times could I even use it consecutively?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art, my cultivation art, excels in control rather than raw spiritual energy reserves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">So, instead of an offensive treasure, I'd be better off sticking with my mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Whether it's the Heavy-Armored Blood Ape Dasheng, the Phantom Blade Night Tiger, or the Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Snow Pivot Imperial Song, all are Golden Core-level constructs - far more practical than any magic treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Perhaps... I should ask for a treasure that aids in learning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo had always been a diligent student.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">However, instead of answering immediately, he countered with a question: "Senior Che, what kind of Method do you specialize in?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Che Zhuzi gave Ning Zhuo a meaningful smile. "Come with me," he said, turning to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After a moment's hesitation, Ning Zhuo followed closely behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, generally considered safe. Che Zhuzi was risking violating sect rules by luring Ning Zhuo into a trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The threat posed by Che Zhuzi was likely minimal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">More importantly, Ning Zhuo believed that even a swarm of spider puppets would only amount to a single Golden Core-level opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Having weathered countless grand battles, Ning Zhuo felt utterly confident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He followed Che Zhuzi to a stone chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"This is my treasure vault," Che Zhuzi said, his expression calm but subtly proud, "where I store many of my magic treasures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo's gaze was immediately drawn to the chamber, his eyes sweeping across its intricate details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The octagonal vault was lined with massive bronze wall panels, their surfaces embossed with intricate mechanical patterns and interlocking gears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The vaulted ceiling, translucent and deep blue like glazed glass, was embedded with 360 Star Pearls, collectively emitting a natural starlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The floor was paved with luminous tiles, between which blue spiritual light occasionally flowed, shifting and reforming in mesmerizing patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Recognizing the tiles, Ning Zhuo immediately surmised, "There must be a secret chamber beneath this floor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The treasure vault appeared empty, but with a wave of Che Zhuzi's sleeve, the bronze wall panels unfolded, revealing the scenes hidden within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Behind one panel lay a crystal lattice cage. Inside hung several storage pouches, their spiritual patterns faded or riddled with holes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">More than a dozen mechanical postal spiders, varying in size, hung suspended within the crystal lattice cage. Even the largest among them was no bigger than an adult's fist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">They clung to the storage pouches, their metallic joints clicking crisply as they moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Drop by drop, Void Spider Silk oozed from their spinnerets, carefully filling the tears in the storage pouches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Then, the honey spiders' delicate legs tapped around the edges of the tears, deploying temporary reinforcement talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This single scene held Ning Zhuo spellbound for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Against the wall opposite the honey spider cage stood a Starlight Dipper Rotation Instrument. Three bronze rings interlocked and rotated, their surfaces constantly flowing with shimmering silver starlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo recognized this mechanical construct from his books - a device used for calculations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He instinctively looked up at the Star Pearl piercing the ceiling, immediately understanding the treasure chamber's fundamental design: "The Star Pearl collects natural starlight, serving as both the chamber's light source and the primary fuel for the Starlight Dipper Rotation Instrument."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Natural starlight contained the principles of heaven and earth, its true essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">When consumed by the Starlight Dipper Rotation Instrument, it yielded computational power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This computational power, in turn, drove the dozen mechanical postal spiders in the adjacent chamber to meticulously repair the storage pouches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This also explained why the Starlight Dipper Rotation Instrument and the Spider Collapse Cage were positioned so close to each other - they required close coordination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">On the other side of the Spider Collapse Cage stood another mechanical construct: the Yellow Crystal Spider Cluster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The spider cluster resembled a honeycomb, as if cast from amber, divided into numerous small compartments. Many of these compartments housed mechanical butterflies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The cluster emitted a hazy yellow light, its luminous pupils expanding and contracting like breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo could faintly discern dense layers of Magic Restrictions within the yellow glow: "It seems to be the manufacturing method for these mechanical spiders, along with some blood refinement techniques?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Positioned against the three walls were magic treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">One was the Heavy Mountain Shovel, its shovel head as large as a door panel. The upper and side edges of the shovel head, as well as its long handle, were riddled with large and small steam vents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">At a single glance, Ning Zhuo felt an overwhelming aura of aggression and destruction wash over him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Another treasure was the Pure White Wandering Cloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The cloud floated within a Glazed Bell. At the bell's apex, a spinning wheel whirled ceaselessly, generating a vortex. Precious cloud materials were drawn in from outside and pulverized into mist by the vortex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Formation within the Glazed Bell operated continuously, consuming Spirit Stones to replenish the bell's spiritual energy while simultaneously applying invisible pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The intertwined spiritual energy and cloud mist within the bell created a high-pressure environment for the Pure White Wandering Cloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The third item lay in a pool of earth. At the center of the pool's bottom rested a turtle shell, most of its surface worn smooth, with only about forty percent of its original patterns remaining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Around the pool, a vast array of jade stones were arranged: Kunlun Jade, Shangtian Azure Jade, "Inaccessible Human Gold", and more. These jades were slowly being refined, their essence absorbed by the turtle shell, gradually replenishing its lost patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo, uncertain, asked, "Senior Che Zhuzi, could this turtle shell be the Profound Turtle's Divination Shell?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Che Zhuzi cast an admiring glance at him. "Young man, your discernment is remarkable. You're exactly right - this is indeed the Profound Turtle's Divination Shell!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up with envy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Part of his reaction was a deliberate attempt to cultivate a connection with Che Zhuzi, but the emotion was also genuine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Profound Turtles were born with an innate Divination Method, possessing an extraordinary ability to find escape routes from desperate situations, allowing them to emerge unscathed. As spiritual beasts naturally inclined toward fortune and averse to misfortune, they were notoriously difficult to capture, making every part of their bodies exceedingly rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The turtle shell was the most valuable treasure material from a Profound Turtle. It could be considered a natural divination method talisman, reusable multiple times. Each use would help a cultivator unleash a escape technique, often enabling them to escape mortal peril. The cost, however, was the gradual erosion of the shell's patterns, with each activation consuming a portion or section of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Profound Turtle's Divination Shell was undoubtedly a life-saving artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">It could even be used several more times!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo's heart stirred at the sight of it, and he nearly blurted out his choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Yes, it was merely a natural treasure - a part of the Profound Turtle's body from its lifetime - not a magic treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">But for most cultivators, the turtle shell, imbued with the divination method and concealing some mechanism of fate, was far more precious than any magic treasure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Che Zhuzi, ever observant, noticed Ning Zhuo's gaze fixed intently on the Profound Turtle Shell and couldn't help but smile slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He clapped his hands and called out, "Come in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">As soon as the words left his lips, Lady Spiderweb pushed open the side door and entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">She wore a crimson dance dress adorned with pearls and crystal shards that shimmered with dazzling light. Her skin was pale and cold, almost translucent under the starlight, revealing faint blue veins beneath. Her lips, painted with rouge, were full and glistening. Her eyes darted nervously, glancing at Ning Zhuo before quickly lowering her gaze, her entire being radiating unease and tension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo glanced at the female cultivator with curiosity, unsure why Che Zhuzi had summoned her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Che Zhuzi, who had been watching Ning Zhuo closely, asked, "So, you don't recognize her?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The question was odd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo studied Lady Spiderweb more closely, his confusion growing. "Should I?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo sensed a deeper meaning behind Che Zhuzi's words and immediately inquired, "Senior, what do you mean?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Che Zhuzi pointed at Lady Spiderweb. "This woman is my slave. You may choose her as your reward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo's eyes narrowed slightly as he decided to test the waters further. He shook his head, indicating he would rather receive a magic treasure than a female cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Lady Spiderweb's chest heaved with anger. She had feared Ning Zhuo would capture her and make her his dog, but hearing him prefer a magic treasure over her only fueled her fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">How dare he! she seethed inwardly. Am I, Lady Spiderweb, truly less valuable than a mere magic treasure?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Che Zhuzi chuckled deeply and explained, "Young friend Ning Zhuo, there's a reason for my suggestion. This woman is deeply connected to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo bowed respectfully. "Please enlighten me, Senior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Che Zhuzi then meticulously recounted the entire sequence of events to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"I played along with her scheme and eventually uncovered the truth. It turns out this woman went to great lengths to infiltrate my inner circle, all to use me to frame you..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"From that perspective, I was dragged into this mess because of you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo firmly shook his head, refusing to take the blame. "I'm a victim here too, Senior. Didn't your interrogation reveal that the Ban Clan was behind this, targeting both of us?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">With that, Ning Zhuo pulled Che Zhuzi onto his side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He then exposed Lady Spiderweb's bluff: "The Ban Clan is a righteous sect, renowned for their mastery of mechanisms. They wouldn't stoop to targeting me personally."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"It must be Ban Ji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Though born into the Ban Clan, he's a disgrace to their name. He hails from the Righteous Path but cultivates demonic arts, his temperament twisted, his greed boundless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Lady Spiderweb is merely at the Foundation Establishment Stage. This isn't the work of the esteemed Ban Clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"It has to be Ban Ji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"For a righteous cultivator to collude with a demonic cultivator and use their connections is perfectly normal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Lady Spiderweb had previously invoked the Ban Clan's name to protect herself. By directly pointing the finger at Ban Ji, Ning Zhuo aimed to alleviate Che Zhuzi's internal pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Che Zhuzi chuckled softly. "This is a feud between you and Ban Ji. As a man of no principle, I won't meddle in your juniors' squabbles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">With Che Zhuzi's shrewdness, how could he possibly have missed Lady Spiderweb's bluff? He simply chose not to expose it, using the situation to negotiate with Ning Zhuo and secure the best possible outcome for himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo had no concrete evidence to prove Ban Ji was the mastermind, only his own deduction. Yet he spoke with such conviction that his words carried undeniable weight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This was all to lure Che Zhuzi into the trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo and Che Zhuzi exchanged a glance, each fully aware of the other's capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Their seemingly casual negotiation had been a silent battle of wits, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Che Zhuzi pressed, "So, what do you choose? The magic treasure or this woman?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">At that moment, Ning Zhuo felt the full weight of Che Zhuzi's cunning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He gritted his teeth, his brow furrowing into a forced expression of helplessness. "The exchange."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The situation was clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Compared to Profound Turtle's Divination Shell, Ning Zhuo valued obtaining crucial intelligence more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">If Ban Ji was plotting against him, Lady Spiderweb likely knew some of the details. This information was vital to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Even if Lady Spiderweb claimed ignorance, her testimony alone would be a powerful weapon against Ban Ji in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Lady Spiderweb's vision darkened, and she struggled to speak. "Ning Zhuo, I can pay my own ransom!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Che Zhuzi chuckled. "Little Friend Ning Zhuo is now your master. Everything you own belongs to him. What do you have to offer for your freedom?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Curious, Ning Zhuo asked directly, "Senior, what are the exact terms of the contract binding her?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Rest assured." Che Zhuzi held up the contract for Ning Zhuo to examine. "This is a slave contract. The terms are quite strict."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Whatever you command her to do, she must obey. Even if she resists, her body will betray her."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"For example... bark like a dog for us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Che Zhuzi turned to Lady Spiderweb, a mocking grin spreading across his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"No! I won't!" Lady Spiderweb's face twisted in terror, her heart churning with defiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">But the next moment...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Woof! Woof! Woof! Her physical body, beyond her control, barked involuntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Lady Spiderweb's pupils shrank to pinpricks. Shock and horror gave way to overwhelming humiliation and rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">I... I... I just barked like a dog?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Her pride lay shattered. She wanted nothing more than to smash her head against the wall and die.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Utter humiliation! Utter humiliation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Che Zhuzi, I will kill you! Ning Zhuo, you'll die too!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Lady Spiderweb's silent screams echoed in her mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Che Zhuzi laughed heartily, turning to Ning Zhuo as if showcasing his product. "Well?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands in a respectful bow. "I'll take her."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"A wise decision." Che Zhuzi beamed with satisfaction, raising his hand. The contract floated toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo accepted it, carefully reviewed the terms, and, with Che Zhuzi's cooperation, instantly became Lady Spiderweb's master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Lady Spiderweb's vision swam with darkness. Her worst nightmare had come true. She had wanted Ning Zhuo to be her dog, but now she was his slave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The cruel reality left her feeling absurd and utterly hopeless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Che Zhuzi was immensely satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">By transferring the contract, he had not only saved one of his magic treasures but also rid himself of Lady Spiderweb, while simultaneously forging a connection with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">It was like reaping three harvests in a single season.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Che Zhuzi reached out to escort Ning Zhuo away, but the latter smiled and expressed keen interest in the Void Spider Silk, wanting to purchase a large quantity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Hearing talk of business, Che Zhuzi's spirits immediately lifted. He found Ning Zhuo even more agreeable and directly asked how much "a large quantity" meant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Given Ning Zhuo's mere Foundation Establishment cultivation, Che Zhuzi remained skeptical of his claims of a "large quantity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Instead of answering, Ning Zhuo asked about Che Zhuzi's monthly production capacity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Che Zhuzi raised his head slightly, pride swelling in his chest. "I produce nearly twenty strands of Void Spider Silk daily. Each strand is guaranteed to be Golden Core grade, a top-tier treasure material!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Ning Zhuo feigned surprise. "I've only ever heard of Senior operating alone. Do you have family or close relatives?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Che Zhuzi burst into hearty laughter, his chest swelling with pride as he raised his head slightly. "I work alone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">After his self-castration, his production capacity had skyrocketed seventeenfold!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The past limitations on his output were now a distant memory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Hmph.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ning Zhuo's question had struck Che Zhuzi's vanity, further confirming his own brilliance and foresight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">He found Ning Zhuo even more agreeable now!</paragraph><br/><br/>
