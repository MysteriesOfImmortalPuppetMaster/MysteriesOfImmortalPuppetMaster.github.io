<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 445: Not Wearing the Flower Together</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Shuang Jing continued to use talismans, several in succession, each one different, continuously striking them onto himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A series of Nascent Soul-level talismans were consumed continuously; his combat power soared to more than three times its previous level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Lord Long was beating the Golden Core deputy generals into utter disarray. Noticing that Shuang Jing was enhancing himself, at first he didn't care, but soon his expression changed, his gaze becoming extremely stern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Shuang Jing's aura had risen too much, almost reaching the peak of the Nascent Soul stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The treasures he was using â€”Lord Long couldn't recognize most of them; occasionally, when he recognized a few, their high value made him secretly startled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Lord Long raised his head and let out a long howl; at first, it was a human voice, then it transformed into a majestic dragon's roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Divine Bestowed Technique â€”Vitality Collapse!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The life force he had absorbed from others was all transformed into violent life energy, erupting at this moment, enhancing all aspects of his state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">His height rose again, reaching sixteen feet. His build was already burly, now even more massive. His upper body was like a city wall; his lower body's tight martial trousers were propped up by his swollen leg muscles, looking like they were about to tear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"This old codger can get even stronger?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Bad news, he has absorbed our life force; his aura has become mixed, greatly reducing the weakening effect of the battle formation on him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"It's not just that; even the national power is hesitating, feeling unsure if he is one of us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Golden Core deputy generals noticed the subtleties, all showing expressions of shock and fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The reason they could engage him head-on was entirely due to the blessings of the battle formation, military strength, and national power. In contrast, Lord Long was subjected to multiple weakenings and suppressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But now, Lord Long's own combat power had surged significantly, and the national power's weakening effect on him was reduced, immediately breaking the barely maintained stalemate of the White Jade Camp!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">At this moment, seeing Lord Long's fierce and wild posture, they hesitated, only daring to surround him but not to attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Which of the Golden Core deputy generals didn't have injuries on their bodies?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Seeing this, Shuang Jing was terrified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">If the generals retreated on the battlefield, it would surely be a huge blow to the army's morale and fighting spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He hurriedly shouted, "Change formation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The general's seal was on him; the Golden Core deputy generals immediately received the order, all heaving a sigh of relief and quickly retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The soldiers of the White Jade Camp made a rapid move, changing the Seven Stars Gathering Force Formation into the Stars Surrounding the Moon Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Starlight flickered; this time it did not converge on the seven deputy generals but formed a huge pillar-like stream of lunar radiance, all pouring onto Shuang Jing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Shuang Jing's aura rose again; his combat power soared wildly, soaring!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Shuang Jing opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of sword energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">At first, the sword energy was just a mass of qi, emitting a platinum color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Then it instantly spurted out, transforming into a light rainbow, its brilliance so strong that it blinded people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">White Tiger Sky -Rending Sword Qi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This is one of the Four Symbols Sword Qi, renowned throughout the world, and full of the intent of warfare and killing, complementing the battle formations and battlefields.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The platinum sword qi arrived in an instant, giving Lord Long no time or opportunity to dodge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This was Shuang Jing's strongest trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The fierce aura swept around like a hurricane; the dazzling platinum brilliance soared into the sky, forming a huge pillar of light that pierced through the high-altitude clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Shuang Jing laughed heartily: "The Tyrant's Break Cauldron Pill I took gives me the power of domination for the time of one incense stick; one pill has a market price of 380,000 medium-grade spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"My Shaking Tree Ant Powder has the effect of the Heavenly Demon Disintegration Great Technique but without any side effects; one bottle has a market price of 420,000 medium-grade spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"My Spirit Ringing Talisman, Fierce Dragon Talisman, Furious Talisman, Dragon and Tiger Body Talisman, etc., total over 1.6 million medium-grade spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"To cultivate this White Tiger Sky-Rending Sword Qi, I used the bone marrow of Nascent Soul-level white tigers, extracted the sword spirits of Nascent Soul-level magic swords, and consumed Heaven's Tears. Over sixty years, I killed thirteen white tigers, destroyed seven Nascent Soul-level magic swords, and used up sixty-four drops of Heaven's Tears. Just the material costs alone amounted to 76 million medium-grade spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Old codger, can you withstand this? Can you bear it? Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Hmm?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Shuang Jing's expression slightly changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The platinum brilliance was rapidly diminishing; a huge pitch-black figure appeared so clearly within the pillar of light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The brilliance quickly dissipated; Lord Long stood in a deep pit of about an acre, his body like a mountain, standing firm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The semi-transparent dragon scales on his body were tattered; there were many bleeding wounds, but his aura remained extremely strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">On his broad and sturdy shoulder sat a little boy with dragon horns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The little boy had golden pupils, bright red coral-like dragon horns, and was sucking his thumb with a sucking sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Seeing Shuang Jing staring wide-eyed, staring fixedly at him, a blush appeared on the little boy's cheeks, and he instantly transformed into his true form â€”a right shoulder armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The right shoulder armor was shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth, wrapping around Lord Long's right shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">It was entirely gold and red interlaced, with a surface smooth as a mirror, scattering metallic luster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The dragon's eyes were like diamonds, dazzling like stars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">There were intricate cloud patterns on the shoulder armor. These cloud patterns were flowing slowly, layer upon layer, changing endlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Spirituality manifesting!" Shuang Jing and the others were dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Lord Long smiled proudly: "That move was indeed powerful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"However, according to what you said, you spent so many spirit stones to forge such an attack."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The next moment, he appeared almost teleporting in front of Shuang Jing, pushing fiercely with his dragon palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Then, how much should my spiritual treasure be priced at?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Shuang Jing's Adam's apple rolled, unable to speak for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Lord Long lowered his head, his figure suddenly disappearing from where he stood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Oh no!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Shuang Jing couldn't dodge in time, hurriedly parried, but was struck by a palm into a depth of three zhang underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Commander!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Quickly, go rescue Lord Shuang Jing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The White Jade Camp was in chaos; the deputy generals gritted their teeth and swarmed up to besiege.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Dragon roars sounded continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The soldiers of the White Jade Camp were struck into the air, flipping around for a while before falling to the ground; many of them no longer breathed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Worthy of Lord Long indeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Quick, let's attack as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Golden Core cultivators of Thousand Peaks Forest outside, seeing the opportunity, immediately took action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The White Jade Camp, suffering internal and external attacks, was in dire straits, casualties soaring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">News of Lord Long of Thousand Peaks Forest wreaking havoc in the White Jade Camp and firmly gaining the upper hand quickly spread to various battle groups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Inside the Light Mountain Heavy Mist Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Cave Master Mo Yuan smiled, passing the jade slip recording the latest military situation to the other three cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Mo Xin and the others were sincerely convinced: "Indeed, everything is as you predicted, Great Cave Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Cave Master Mo Yuan said, "In this way, our side has taken the initiative."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Send this military report to the other side as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Mo Xin and the others were stunned. What kind of move is this?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Sun Gan of the Golden Halberd Army quickly received the jade slip; after confirming there were no hidden tricks, he learned the military situation in the jade slip and couldn't help but change color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Rescue signals from the outside also flew in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Lu Hongtu decisively loosened the formation diagram, revealing a gap to let the flying message in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Sun Gan learned of it, his face turning livid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Just as Cave Master Mo Yuan, Mu Lan, and others had predicted, most of the soldiers of the White Jade Camp were connected people, closely related to the high noble families of the Two-Pillar Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">If Sun Gan ignored it, even if he returned victorious in the future, it would be tantamount to offending more than half of the court; there would be no good outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The Golden Halberd Army's battle formation, accumulated for a long time, had not yet reached its peak when it burst out the Dharma Aspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Quick, the whole army attack!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Gan hurriedly shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Dharma Aspect was like a battle halberd, glittering with golden light, enormous, shooting into the heavy mist among the mountains. Wherever it went, it split mountains and cut mist, invincible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Cave Master Mo Yuan and the other three had solemn expressions, going all out to maintain this formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Barbarian Demon Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Advance, advance!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Xu Dali was covered in blood, leading the Iron Barrel Battle Formation, attacking Lone Fang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Wolf corpses littered the land, casualties were heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Di Lu had long since joined the battle, fighting Xu Dali multiple times, unable to match him, retreating step by step, with more and more injuries on his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">If it were one-on-one, Xu Dali was far inferior to Di Lu. But with the multiple blessings of battle formation, military strength, and national power, Xu Dali could fight one against two, putting the two Nascent Soul cultivators of the Azure Moon Tribe at an absolute disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">However, Xu Dali's side also paid a heavy price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The elite soldiers and personal guards around him had already lost half!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This was not something that could be made up by casually replenishing troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The rescue flying message from the White Jade Camp came over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The deputy general's eyes lit up, quickly holding up the message to persuade: "General! Our fellow army is in crisis, asking us for help! If we turn back to rescue, we can surely disrupt the enemy's plot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">But Xu Dali was already killing in a frenzy, stiffening his neck, and refused without hesitation: "Not going!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Those young masters of the White Jade Camp usually look down on others; let them suffer a bit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Moreover, when we sent out a rescue message earlier, they didn't move at all. Now they want us to rescue them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"I want to kill these two barbarian beasts, to avenge our soldiers!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Xu Dali roared, charging up again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The deputy general sighed deeply, hurriedly commanding the remaining soldiers to piece together the Iron Barrel Formation, following Xu Dali in the charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The rescue message from the White Jade Camp also reached the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Mu Lan received the message, her face turning pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The thing she feared most had happened!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"If the White Jade Camp is defeated, the Golden Halberd Army will surely be distracted, likely giving the enemy an opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"The key is, we are marching together with them; if we don't rescue them, even if we win this time, the civil and military officials in the court will certainly exclude my Mu General's House even more in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"In such a situation, how can I revitalize the General's House?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Mu Lan looked up at the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The giant Pegasus transformed by Ma Fei Tui flapped its wings, causing strong winds; its hooves, heavy as many tons, stomped down fiercely, pressing the Red Flower Dharma Aspect of the battle formation into constant trembling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The soldiers formed formations, circulated their mana, and kept running; they were already gasping for breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Fortunately, the Red Flower Camp was equipped with a mana pool, which could effectively assist, consuming the mana within, greatly reducing the amount of mana the soldiers needed to use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"But if this continues, our army will be completely pinned down here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Although I have means to defeat this demon cultivator, after using them, I will hardly have the strength to fight again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">She suddenly turned her head and saw smoke rising from the east, the mountains and forests trembling, and flocks of birds flying in chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Let alone leading the army to rush to the aid of the White Jade Camp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"What should I do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Just when Mu Lan was hesitating, the sounds of shouting and killing came from the east.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Mu Lan was both surprised and delighted: "Could it be the Three Generals Camp?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Sure enough, after a moment, she could see with the naked eye the charge of the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei were the sharpest arrowheads; two formed formations, one charged and killed, attacking in turns, forcing Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and others to retreat step by step, suffering greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The Three Generals Camp took the initiative, which gave Ning Zhuo ample time to calmly recover his mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">After recovering his mana, he acted accordingly, casting spells not to kill but only to delay and restrain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">With his assistance, Liu, Guan, and Zhang actually killed three Golden Core cultivators in succession!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"The military advisor's methods are truly marvelous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Five elements spells cast in turns; his methods seem endless!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Being from a great family is truly extraordinary; the military advisor is so young, yet has mastered so many spells, thus can easily choose the most suitable ones, especially targeting the enemy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The three generals' evaluation of Ning Zhuo rose another level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo was not very satisfied with himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Although with multiple enhancements, my spell attacks have completely reached the Golden Core level, but because of this, the mana consumption has greatly increased; after casting two or three times, my mana is exhausted, and I simply cannot fight for long!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Mu Lan's Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"Great, Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang have come over; we have strong reinforcements and can repel Ma Fei Tui now," Zhang Zhongyi was overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Seeing Ning Zhuo's stunning performance, he said to Mu Lan: "See, I told you this young man is remarkable; in today's battle, he indeed shines brightly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Mu Lan stared at the Three Generals Camp's operations, her eyes flickering, pondering: "The three generals are also not ordinary Golden Core cultivators; their combat power is impressive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"But even so, our army combined with the Three Generals Camp will still need some time to repel Ma Fei Tui."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"If this drags on, what will happen to the White Jade Camp?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"The White Jade Camp is the key!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Mu Lan saw through the battle situation clearly, worrying about the overall situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Thinking of this, her face sank, and she made a decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The next moment, she waved the general's banner, commanding a change in formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The Red Flower Dharma Aspect suddenly grew, enveloping Ma Fei Tui within, temporarily trapping him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Ma Fei Tui had fought the Red Flower Camp many times and was already familiar with this move; thus, he was unhurried, dodging left and right while laughing loudly: "Mu girl, you've lost your mind; this move consumes greatly, yet cannot trap your Grandpa Ma!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Mu Lan's expression did not change, waving the general's banner even more urgently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The Three Generals Camp quickly approached the Red Flower Camp; whether it was Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang or Ning Zhuo, they all looked forward to fighting side by side with friendly forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"General Mu Lan, Lord Zhang Zhongyi, let's kill the enemy together!" Ning Zhuo shouted loudly from within the army formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">The soldiers of the Three Generals Camp saw they were joining with friendly forces and cheered, their morale rising even though they were physically and mentally exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">But the next moment, the Red Flower Dharma Aspect spun up, trapping Ma Fei Tui, and fell onto the heads of all the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Battle Formation Variation â€”Not Wearing the Flower Together!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">The marching speed of the entire Three Generals Camp plummeted, as if carrying a mountain on their backs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">In contrast, the Red Flower Camp was lightly equipped, moving at great speed, leaving the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">"Don't go!" Ma Fei Tui shouted angrily, struggling hard within the Red Flower Dharma Aspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">The more fiercely he struggled, the greater the pressure on the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Liu, Guan, and Zhang's faces turnedâ€”one yellow with anger, one red almost dripping blood, and one black like the bottom of a pot. They wanted to fight side by side with Mu Lan, but she had thrown the Nascent Soul-level enemy onto them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Even Ning Zhuo's expression became very grim, his gaze gloomily staring at the departing Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">"Good, very good, Red Flower Camp, Mu Lan!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
