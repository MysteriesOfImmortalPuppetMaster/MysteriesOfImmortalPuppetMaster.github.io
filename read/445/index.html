<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Shuang Jing continued to use talismans, several in succession, each one different, continuously striking them onto himself.<br/>
<br/>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!<br/>
<br/>
A series of Nascent Soul-level talismans were consumed continuously; his combat power soared to more than three times its previous level.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long was beating the Golden Core deputy generals into utter disarray. Noticing that Shuang Jing was enhancing himself, at first he didn't care, but soon his expression changed, his gaze becoming extremely stern.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing's aura had risen too much, almost reaching the peak of the Nascent Soul stage!<br/>
<br/>
The treasures he was using —Lord Long couldn't recognize most of them; occasionally, when he recognized a few, their high value made him secretly startled.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long raised his head and let out a long howl; at first, it was a human voice, then it transformed into a majestic dragon's roar.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Bestowed Technique —Vitality Collapse!<br/>
<br/>
The life force he had absorbed from others was all transformed into violent life energy, erupting at this moment, enhancing all aspects of his state.<br/>
<br/>
His height rose again, reaching sixteen feet. His build was already burly, now even more massive. His upper body was like a city wall; his lower body's tight martial trousers were propped up by his swollen leg muscles, looking like they were about to tear.<br/>
<br/>
"This old codger can get even stronger?!"<br/>
<br/>
"Bad news, he has absorbed our life force; his aura has become mixed, greatly reducing the weakening effect of the battle formation on him."<br/>
<br/>
"It's not just that; even the national power is hesitating, feeling unsure if he is one of us!"<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core deputy generals noticed the subtleties, all showing expressions of shock and fear.<br/>
<br/>
The reason they could engage him head-on was entirely due to the blessings of the battle formation, military strength, and national power. In contrast, Lord Long was subjected to multiple weakenings and suppressions.<br/>
<br/>
But now, Lord Long's own combat power had surged significantly, and the national power's weakening effect on him was reduced, immediately breaking the barely maintained stalemate of the White Jade Camp!<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, seeing Lord Long's fierce and wild posture, they hesitated, only daring to surround him but not to attack.<br/>
<br/>
Which of the Golden Core deputy generals didn't have injuries on their bodies?<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Shuang Jing was terrified.<br/>
<br/>
If the generals retreated on the battlefield, it would surely be a huge blow to the army's morale and fighting spirit.<br/>
<br/>
He hurriedly shouted, "Change formation!"<br/>
<br/>
The general's seal was on him; the Golden Core deputy generals immediately received the order, all heaving a sigh of relief and quickly retreating.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers of the White Jade Camp made a rapid move, changing the Seven Stars Gathering Force Formation into the Stars Surrounding the Moon Formation.<br/>
<br/>
Starlight flickered; this time it did not converge on the seven deputy generals but formed a huge pillar-like stream of lunar radiance, all pouring onto Shuang Jing.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing's aura rose again; his combat power soared wildly, soaring!<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of sword energy.<br/>
<br/>
At first, the sword energy was just a mass of qi, emitting a platinum color.<br/>
<br/>
Then it instantly spurted out, transforming into a light rainbow, its brilliance so strong that it blinded people.<br/>
<br/>
White Tiger Sky -Rending Sword Qi!<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the Four Symbols Sword Qi, renowned throughout the world, and full of the intent of warfare and killing, complementing the battle formations and battlefields.<br/>
<br/>
The platinum sword qi arrived in an instant, giving Lord Long no time or opportunity to dodge.<br/>
<br/>
This was Shuang Jing's strongest trump card.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
The fierce aura swept around like a hurricane; the dazzling platinum brilliance soared into the sky, forming a huge pillar of light that pierced through the high-altitude clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing laughed heartily: "The Tyrant's Break Cauldron Pill I took gives me the power of domination for the time of one incense stick; one pill has a market price of 380,000 medium-grade spirit stones."<br/>
<br/>
"My Shaking Tree Ant Powder has the effect of the Heavenly Demon Disintegration Great Technique but without any side effects; one bottle has a market price of 420,000 medium-grade spirit stones."<br/>
<br/>
"My Spirit Ringing Talisman, Fierce Dragon Talisman, Furious Talisman, Dragon and Tiger Body Talisman, etc., total over 1.6 million medium-grade spirit stones."<br/>
<br/>
"To cultivate this White Tiger Sky-Rending Sword Qi, I used the bone marrow of Nascent Soul-level white tigers, extracted the sword spirits of Nascent Soul-level magic swords, and consumed Heaven's Tears. Over sixty years, I killed thirteen white tigers, destroyed seven Nascent Soul-level magic swords, and used up sixty-four drops of Heaven's Tears. Just the material costs alone amounted to 76 million medium-grade spirit stones."<br/>
<br/>
"Old codger, can you withstand this? Can you bear it? Hahaha!"<br/>
<br/>
"Hmm?!"<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing's expression slightly changed.<br/>
<br/>
The platinum brilliance was rapidly diminishing; a huge pitch-black figure appeared so clearly within the pillar of light.<br/>
<br/>
The brilliance quickly dissipated; Lord Long stood in a deep pit of about an acre, his body like a mountain, standing firm.<br/>
<br/>
The semi-transparent dragon scales on his body were tattered; there were many bleeding wounds, but his aura remained extremely strong.<br/>
<br/>
On his broad and sturdy shoulder sat a little boy with dragon horns.<br/>
<br/>
The little boy had golden pupils, bright red coral-like dragon horns, and was sucking his thumb with a sucking sound.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Shuang Jing staring wide-eyed, staring fixedly at him, a blush appeared on the little boy's cheeks, and he instantly transformed into his true form —a right shoulder armor.<br/>
<br/>
The right shoulder armor was shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth, wrapping around Lord Long's right shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
It was entirely gold and red interlaced, with a surface smooth as a mirror, scattering metallic luster.<br/>
<br/>
The dragon's eyes were like diamonds, dazzling like stars.<br/>
<br/>
There were intricate cloud patterns on the shoulder armor. These cloud patterns were flowing slowly, layer upon layer, changing endlessly.<br/>
<br/>
"Spirituality manifesting!" Shuang Jing and the others were dumbfounded.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long smiled proudly: "That move was indeed powerful."<br/>
<br/>
"However, according to what you said, you spent so many spirit stones to forge such an attack."<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he appeared almost teleporting in front of Shuang Jing, pushing fiercely with his dragon palm.<br/>
<br/>
"Then, how much should my spiritual treasure be priced at?"<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing's Adam's apple rolled, unable to speak for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long lowered his head, his figure suddenly disappearing from where he stood.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
"Oh no!!"<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing couldn't dodge in time, hurriedly parried, but was struck by a palm into a depth of three zhang underground.<br/>
<br/>
"Commander!"<br/>
<br/>
"Quickly, go rescue Lord Shuang Jing."<br/>
<br/>
The White Jade Camp was in chaos; the deputy generals gritted their teeth and swarmed up to besiege.<br/>
<br/>
Boom! Boom! Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Dragon roars sounded continuously.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers of the White Jade Camp were struck into the air, flipping around for a while before falling to the ground; many of them no longer breathed.<br/>
<br/>
"Worthy of Lord Long indeed!"<br/>
<br/>
"Quick, let's attack as well."<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core cultivators of Thousand Peaks Forest outside, seeing the opportunity, immediately took action.<br/>
<br/>
The White Jade Camp, suffering internal and external attacks, was in dire straits, casualties soaring.<br/>
<br/>
News of Lord Long of Thousand Peaks Forest wreaking havoc in the White Jade Camp and firmly gaining the upper hand quickly spread to various battle groups.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the Light Mountain Heavy Mist Diagram.<br/>
<br/>
Cave Master Mo Yuan smiled, passing the jade slip recording the latest military situation to the other three cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Mo Xin and the others were sincerely convinced: "Indeed, everything is as you predicted, Great Cave Master."<br/>
<br/>
Cave Master Mo Yuan said, "In this way, our side has taken the initiative."<br/>
<br/>
"Send this military report to the other side as well."<br/>
<br/>
Mo Xin and the others were stunned. What kind of move is this?<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan of the Golden Halberd Army quickly received the jade slip; after confirming there were no hidden tricks, he learned the military situation in the jade slip and couldn't help but change color.<br/>
<br/>
Rescue signals from the outside also flew in.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu decisively loosened the formation diagram, revealing a gap to let the flying message in.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan learned of it, his face turning livid.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Cave Master Mo Yuan, Mulan, and others had predicted, most of the soldiers of the White Jade Camp were connected people, closely related to the high noble families of the Two-Pillar Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
If Sun Gan ignored it, even if he returned victorious in the future, it would be tantamount to offending more than half of the court; there would be no good outcome.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Halberd Army's battle formation, accumulated for a long time, had not yet reached its peak when it burst out the Dharma Aspect.<br/>
<br/>
"Quick, the whole army attack!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan hurriedly shouted.<br/>
<br/>
The Dharma Aspect was like a battle halberd, glittering with golden light, enormous, shooting into the heavy mist among the mountains. Wherever it went, it split mountains and cut mist, invincible.<br/>
<br/>
Cave Master Mo Yuan and the other three had solemn expressions, going all out to maintain this formation.<br/>
<br/>
Barbarian Demon Camp.<br/>
<br/>
"Advance, advance!!"<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali was covered in blood, leading the Iron Barrel Battle Formation, attacking Lone Fang.<br/>
<br/>
Wolf corpses littered the land, casualties were heavy.<br/>
<br/>
Di Lu had long since joined the battle, fighting Xu Dali multiple times, unable to match him, retreating step by step, with more and more injuries on his body.<br/>
<br/>
If it were one-on-one, Xu Dali was far inferior to Di Lu. But with the multiple blessings of battle formation, military strength, and national power, Xu Dali could fight one against two, putting the two Nascent Soul cultivators of the Azure Moon Tribe at an absolute disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
However, Xu Dali's side also paid a heavy price.<br/>
<br/>
The elite soldiers and personal guards around him had already lost half!<br/>
<br/>
This was not something that could be made up by casually replenishing troops.<br/>
<br/>
The rescue flying message from the White Jade Camp came over.<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general's eyes lit up, quickly holding up the message to persuade: "General! Our fellow army is in crisis, asking us for help! If we turn back to rescue, we can surely disrupt the enemy's plot."<br/>
<br/>
But Xu Dali was already killing in a frenzy, stiffening his neck, and refused without hesitation: "Not going!"<br/>
<br/>
"Those young masters of the White Jade Camp usually look down on others; let them suffer a bit."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, when we sent out a rescue message earlier, they didn't move at all. Now they want us to rescue them?"<br/>
<br/>
"I want to kill these two barbarian beasts, to avenge our soldiers!"<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali roared, charging up again.<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general sighed deeply, hurriedly commanding the remaining soldiers to piece together the Iron Barrel Formation, following Xu Dali in the charge.<br/>
<br/>
The rescue message from the White Jade Camp also reached the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan received the message, her face turning pale.<br/>
<br/>
The thing she feared most had happened!<br/>
<br/>
"If the White Jade Camp is defeated, the Golden Halberd Army will surely be distracted, likely giving the enemy an opportunity."<br/>
<br/>
"The key is, we are marching together with them; if we don't rescue them, even if we win this time, the civil and military officials in the court will certainly exclude my Mu General's House even more in the future."<br/>
<br/>
"In such a situation, how can I revitalize the General's House?"<br/>
<br/>
Mulan looked up at the sky.<br/>
<br/>
The giant Pegasus transformed by Ma Fei Tui flapped its wings, causing strong winds; its hooves, heavy as many tons, stomped down fiercely, pressing the Red Flower Dharma Aspect of the battle formation into constant trembling.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers formed formations, circulated their mana, and kept running; they were already gasping for breath.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, the Red Flower Camp was equipped with a mana pool, which could effectively assist, consuming the mana within, greatly reducing the amount of mana the soldiers needed to use.<br/>
<br/>
"But if this continues, our army will be completely pinned down here."<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it!"<br/>
<br/>
"Although I have means to defeat this demon cultivator, after using them, I will hardly have the strength to fight again."<br/>
<br/>
She suddenly turned her head and saw smoke rising from the east, the mountains and forests trembling, and flocks of birds flying in chaos.<br/>
<br/>
"Let alone leading the army to rush to the aid of the White Jade Camp."<br/>
<br/>
"What should I do?"<br/>
<br/>
Just when Mulan was hesitating, the sounds of shouting and killing came from the east.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was both surprised and delighted: "Could it be the Three Generals Camp?"<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, after a moment, she could see with the naked eye the charge of the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei were the sharpest arrowheads; two formed formations, one charged and killed, attacking in turns, forcing Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and others to retreat step by step, suffering greatly.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp took the initiative, which gave Ning Zhuo ample time to calmly recover his mana.<br/>
<br/>
After recovering his mana, he acted accordingly, casting spells not to kill but only to delay and restrain.<br/>
<br/>
With his assistance, Liu, Guan, and Zhang actually killed three Golden Core cultivators in succession!<br/>
<br/>
"The military advisor's methods are truly marvelous."<br/>
<br/>
"Five elements spells cast in turns; his methods seem endless!"<br/>
<br/>
"Being from a great family is truly extraordinary; the military advisor is so young, yet has mastered so many spells, thus can easily choose the most suitable ones, especially targeting the enemy."<br/>
<br/>
The three generals' evaluation of Ning Zhuo rose another level.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was not very satisfied with himself.<br/>
<br/>
"Although with multiple enhancements, my spell attacks have completely reached the Golden Core level, but because of this, the mana consumption has greatly increased; after casting two or three times, my mana is exhausted, and I simply cannot fight for long!"<br/>
<br/>
Mulan's Camp.<br/>
<br/>
"Great, Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang have come over; we have strong reinforcements and can repel Ma Fei Tui now," Zhang Zhongyi was overjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo's stunning performance, he said to Mulan: "See, I told you this young man is remarkable; in today's battle, he indeed shines brightly."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan stared at the Three Generals Camp's operations, her eyes flickering, pondering: "The three generals are also not ordinary Golden Core cultivators; their combat power is impressive."<br/>
<br/>
"But even so, our army combined with the Three Generals Camp will still need some time to repel Ma Fei Tui."<br/>
<br/>
"If this drags on, what will happen to the White Jade Camp?"<br/>
<br/>
"The White Jade Camp is the key!"<br/>
<br/>
Mulan saw through the battle situation clearly, worrying about the overall situation.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, her face sank, and she made a decision.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, she waved the general's banner, commanding a change in formation.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Dharma Aspect suddenly grew, enveloping Ma Fei Tui within, temporarily trapping him.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Fei Tui had fought the Red Flower Camp many times and was already familiar with this move; thus, he was unhurried, dodging left and right while laughing loudly: "Mu girl, you've lost your mind; this move consumes greatly, yet cannot trap your Grandpa Ma!"<br/>
<br/>
Mulan's expression did not change, waving the general's banner even more urgently.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp quickly approached the Red Flower Camp; whether it was Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang or Ning Zhuo, they all looked forward to fighting side by side with friendly forces.<br/>
<br/>
"General Mulan, Lord Zhang Zhongyi, let's kill the enemy together!" Ning Zhuo shouted loudly from within the army formation.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers of the Three Generals Camp saw they were joining with friendly forces and cheered, their morale rising even though they were physically and mentally exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
But the next moment, the Red Flower Dharma Aspect spun up, trapping Ma Fei Tui, and fell onto the heads of all the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Battle Formation Variation —Not Wearing the Flower Together!<br/>
<br/>
The marching speed of the entire Three Generals Camp plummeted, as if carrying a mountain on their backs.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, the Red Flower Camp was lightly equipped, moving at great speed, leaving the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't go!" Ma Fei Tui shouted angrily, struggling hard within the Red Flower Dharma Aspect.<br/>
<br/>
The more fiercely he struggled, the greater the pressure on the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang's faces turned—one yellow with anger, one red almost dripping blood, and one black like the bottom of a pot. They wanted to fight side by side with Mulan, but she had thrown the Nascent Soul-level enemy onto them!<br/>
<br/>
Even Ning Zhuo's expression became very grim, his gaze gloomily staring at the departing Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
"Good, very good, Red Flower Camp, Mulan!"</div>
