<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 105: The Victory Over the Zhou Family</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the Lava Immortal Palace, the first door was swiftly pushed open by Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zhou Zeshan, Zhou Zhu, and others immediately turned around. The two parties stared at each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"The Zhou family members!" Ning Zhuo, seeing this through Yuan Dasheng, felt his pupils contract slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">When he discovered that there were not only the two Zhou family geniuses in the second room but also three other Zhou family cultivators, he immediately understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"They must have used the method I had thought of earlier, combining puppet bodies to withstand the initial door trap. Besides Zhou Zeshan, who is already at the peak of the third level, there are actually three others with similar cultivation!" Ning Zhuo couldn't help but recall the three-family joint test.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">During the Zhou family’s modification team test, besides Zhou Zhu, there was no second peak third-level cultivator, not even one at the late third level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"The testing formation at that time was provided by the Zhou family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"It seems that even then, the Zhou family had a plan, deliberately hiding the true cultivation of many of their cultivators. The Zheng family and the Ning family were both deceived; at least I didn't expect the Zhou family to have several late third-level cultivators already."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo quickly deduced the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Considering the cultivation speed, it was impossible for an ordinary cultivator to rise from the mid-third level to the peak third level in such a short time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The most likely scenario was that the Zhou family had been concealing their cultivation for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"No wonder they are called the formation masters, adept at formations and schemes. In the three-family joint test, where they led the process, they started their scheme. Fortunately, I stumbled upon it this time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Zhou family cultivators had been tense since they heard the door creak behind them and had turned around, prepared for anything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhou Zeshan smiled wryly, thinking that regardless of whether the visitor was from the Ning family, the Zheng family, or the city lord's mansion, their painstaking layout by the Zhou family would be exposed on their first attempt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">However, the figure that pushed open the door was something the Zhou family cultivators never expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It was a mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The ape was tall, robust, and muscular, with its golden bones exposed, resembling a layer of hollow armor. Its body was entirely red, with uniformly colored monkey hair, and was marked with black streaks of varying lengths, giving it an ominous aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zhou Zeshan was about to greet it, already preparing his words, but was stunned to see such a creature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"What is that thing?!" the Zhou family cultivators exclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In the next moment, without needing Ning Zhuo's command, the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng, having sensed the presence of others, began its attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It lifted its foot and took a giant step, covering a great distance, and directly approached one of the Zhou family cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Zhou family cultivator felt a gust of wind rushing towards him. In the next moment, the towering body of the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng came down like a mountain, heavily crushing him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Zhou family cultivator raised his arms to block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">With a heavy blow, the Golden Blood Battle Ape smashed down like a giant hammer, pulverizing the Zhou family cultivator from head to toe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The ferocity of this attack made the Zhou family cultivators scream in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhou Zeshan's voice turned sharp, "We can't face it head-on, spread out and delay it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">True to his role as Zhou Zhu's trusted strategist, Zhou Zeshan quickly thought of the right tactic in the brief moment they were attacked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">However, while the tactic was sound, the battlefield conditions were not favorable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The second room was much narrower than the first, being a long, narrow space with limited width on either side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">To create distance between themselves and the ape, the Zhou family cultivators had to move towards the second door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">As they moved, the floor tiles pulled back, attempting to drag them back to their original position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">With a roar, Yuan Dasheng spread his arms wide and attacked with full force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Another explosion rang out as the second Zhou family cultivator's puppet was shattered to pieces by Yuan Dasheng, leaving no room for resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Only after passing the sixth level would a cultivator possess a spirit-rhyme mechanism. These mechanisms were notably powerful, often superior to the test disciples' own puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng far exceeded the highest limits, being a spirit-long-term mechanism obtained through Ning Zhuo's crucial findings and the sacrifice of a celestial talent vessel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"This... what is this thing?!" Zhou Zeshan yelled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"I have no idea." Zhou Zhu was equally puzzled as to why this exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace was so different from any previous attempts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Where did this incredibly powerful mechanical ape come from?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"You jump into the trap to attract the monkey, make it follow you into the dark trap," Zhou Zeshan quickly devised another tactic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">These dark traps were specifically arranged by Ning Zhuo. In a previous exploration with Ning Xiaohui, Zhou Zhu, and Zheng Jian, these traps had effectively trapped them, giving them an extremely unpleasant experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhou Zeshan's quick thinking led him to believe that, by sacrificing one of the Zhou family cultivators, they might temporarily deal with the mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">If the trap could capture the mechanical ape, they would only need to find a way to get through the second room and open the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But that was not to be.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">As the Zhou family cultivator jumped in, the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng halted its charge, standing right at the edge of the mechanical trap, without moving an inch further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Joking aside, these traps were personally set by Ning Zhuo, who knew every detail about their positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Zhou Zeshan saw Dasheng turning back and staring at him with a cold gaze, and immediately felt a chill rise in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Damn it! Zhou Zhu, you go intercept him. I'll try to break through with all my might!" Zhou Zeshan shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Okay!" Zhou Zhu stepped forward, rushing towards Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Though he was tall, compared to Dasheng, he was noticeably smaller.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Dasheng moved fluidly, deftly avoiding Zhou Zhu's attacks, then seized an opening and advanced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Bang, bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After two light sounds, Zhou Zhu also fell to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhou Zeshan looked back and saw that Zhou Zhu hadn't lasted even three breaths, and his heart filled with dread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He frantically rushed forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But the floor tiles continued to move back faster and faster, always pushing Zhou Zeshan closer to Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"This damned mechanism is also working against me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Zhou Zeshan struggled with all his might but only managed to buy three breaths of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">In the end, his head was taken by Dasheng. Then, Dasheng extended his arms, tilted at an angle, and directly threw Zhou Zeshan's head to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Zhou family cultivators were completely wiped out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Dasheng dealt with them effortlessly, despite there being five of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Firstly, they didn't possess the celestial talent and couldn't exert the same pressure as Meng Chong. Secondly, they knew very few spells. Amidst Dasheng's rampage, they mostly used air-based spells to increase speed or change direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">As a result, these small maneuvers were insignificant in the eyes of Dasheng, a master of martial arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">In the end, under Ning Zhuo's control, Dasheng voluntarily jumped into the dark trap, finishing off the remaining Zhou family cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Dasheng, carrying the broken puppets of the enemies, leaped out of the trap with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">These traps were originally set by Ning Zhuo himself, so he was fully aware of all their details. These traps posed no obstacle at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">In the main hall, witnessing Dasheng's rampage and easily eliminating the Zhou family cultivators, the dragon turtle fire spirit clenched its dragon claws, repeatedly pounding the throne in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo had been too audacious, this time sending only one mechanism to break through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">It showed no respect for the Lava Immortal Palace at all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The dragon turtle fire spirit lacked the authority to interfere and could only watch as Dasheng cleaned up the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo controlled the mechanical ape, dissecting each Zhou family cultivator and extracting their unused spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Not bad. If I had come alone, there's no way I could have gathered this many spirit stones in the second room. Oh, there are also two suspension rings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">With the contributions from the Zhou family's cultivators, Dasheng had a significant initial accumulation of power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo controlled it and resolutely moved deeper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Meanwhile, at the Zheng family estate:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Catch the assassin!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Hurry, he's running that way. Quickly, chase him!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Zheng family estate was in chaos, with cultivators surging and frantically chasing the intruder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Young Master Zheng Jian, are you alright?" The family's alchemist hurried over to provide treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zheng Jian nodded slightly: "At the critical moment, my Heart-Piercing Foresight was triggered, alerting me in time to avoid walking into the assassin's ambush. How did this assassin get in? This is the inner circle of the estate, it's simply outrageous!" Zheng Jian clenched his fist, gritting his teeth in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The alchemist suddenly let out a strange laugh, his previously deep, middle-aged voice turning into a sinister female tone: "What do you think?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Zheng Jian's pupils shrank, and he instantly retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But it was too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The next moment, the alchemist's body swelled and exploded, releasing a foul, corrosive toxin that splashed onto Zheng Jian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Half of Zheng Jian's body was affected, his skin red, blistering, and festering at an alarming rate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He quickly took out emergency pills and swallowed a bottle, barely managing to stop the spread of the toxin within his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I still got hit! They deliberately triggered my Heart-Piercing Foresight once, putting me on high alert. Without a calm mind, the chances of Heart-Piercing Foresight triggering are greatly reduced! They came prepared." At this moment, his expression was extremely grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">At the City Lord's mansion:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Meng Chong, surrounded by lightning shadows, beat the assassin black and blue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He sneered: "You think you can assassinate me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">At the Zhou family estate:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Zhou Zeshan and Zhou Zhu opened their eyes one after the other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">The next moment, intense pain surged through their bodies!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Zhou Zeshan saw his body covered in ants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Countless ants swarmed densely, layer upon layer, having already gnawed the lower half of Zhou Zeshan's body down to the bone. His abdomen was half-devoured, intestines scattered, many severed and being greedily consumed by the ants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Zhou Zeshan's pupils shrank to needle points, filled with extreme horror!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">In the next moment, his five-elemental power erupted violently, whipping up a fierce wind that swept the ants away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">On the other side, Zhou Zhu was also desperately clearing away the ants. His situation was slightly better, but below his waist, nothing remained but bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"Someone set us up, there’s a traitor in the family!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">"Help, someone, help!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
