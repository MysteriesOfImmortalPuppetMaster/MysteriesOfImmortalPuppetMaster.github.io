<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Should I sneak near the Two Note Kingdom's army or perhaps inside Green Forest Immortal City for a secret farewell meeting with Generals Liu, Guan, Zhang, and General Mu Lan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Inside the Dragonhead cabin, Ning Zhuo hesitated briefly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Resolving the divorce issue officially wasn't feasible. Such matters required going through official channels, were exceedingly time-consuming, and would inevitably expose him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">For Ning Zhuo, this approach brought more harm than benefit, posing considerable risk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Besides a formal farewell, Ning Zhuo's main intention was to utilize the Three Generals' Camp and Red Flower Camp to exchange a portion of his battle merits for resources he could conveniently take with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">After all, Ning Zhuo's performance during the second major battle was remarkably impressive, and according to military regulations, he should be greatly rewarded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"The Three Constellations Treasure Talisman I exchanged last time using battle merits was incredibly useful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Even though the Two Note Kingdom is small, it remains a legitimate cultivation nation. For me personally, and even for the entire Ning family, it’s still an enormous entity with resources as vast as mountains and seas. Surely, I can exchange my battle merits for treasures perfectly suited to my cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Securing these cultivation resources before my departure would significantly benefit my future cultivation journey."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Just as Ning Zhuo pondered these thoughts, the mechanism ring on his finger suddenly tightened significantly, causing him unexpected pain despite his vastly improved physique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"If I linger here, is that equivalent to courting death?" Ning Zhuo's pupils abruptly contracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Did the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth track me down?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Or has Du Tiechuan been lying in wait to ambush me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Perhaps the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King captured a fake Old Stone Monster and inadvertently found clues leading him straight to me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Numerous suspicions immediately swirled through Ning Zhuo’s mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Why even consider a secret meeting now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">It’s time to run!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"I'm merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator with insignificant power - no need to bounce around recklessly under the noses of Soul Formation and Nascent Soul powerhouses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Although my performance in the previous battle appeared impressive, it was mainly because those great cultivators were too preoccupied, desperately fighting amongst themselves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In any case, Lin You and Wu Hen, the two captives, had already been handed over directly to Ning Zhuo by Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Having achieved his primary objective, Ning Zhuo wisely decided to quit while he was ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"As the son-in-law of General Mu, the military achievements I've gained in the Two Note Kingdom campaign should be safeguarded."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Firstly, the national system and honor must be upheld, and secondly, General Mu's household has close ties with me. If they don't assist even their own son-in-law, how can they speak of revitalizing their influence?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Once again, Ning Zhuo recognized the benefits of his marriage to Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"I can always return to Two Note Kingdom later to formally receive my rewards and properly handle this relationship."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">With this resolution, Ning Zhuo no longer lingered. Activating the Mechanical Wandering Dragon, he swiftly moved forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon traversed void space, making it an exceptional mode of transportation for long distances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Three or four days later, ripples appeared in the air as a small mechanical dragon emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">It was precisely the Wandering Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Having deliberately paused at this location, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong gathered within the Dragonhead cabin, observing the magnificent spectacle outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">A gigantic ring-shaped mountain range, stretching about eight hundred Li in diameter, sprawled before them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">From above, the mountains formed a perfect circle surrounding an enormous crater.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The crater walls had entirely vitrified, covered in spider-web-like cracks intermittently glowing with blue-silver brilliance. The rhythmic pulsing of this luminescence resembled the breathing of a giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Suddenly, the earth trembled as a massive surge of blue-silver flames erupted from numerous cracks, instantly engulfing the entire circular mountain in raging fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The blazing flames rose hundreds of meters high, piercing straight into the heavens, dramatically increasing the temperature and creating deadly heat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun and Ning had anticipated this and had positioned the Wandering Dragon far away. Yet, when the flames soared, they swiftly maneuvered the dragon backward in panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Despite the rapid retreat, the Dragon's surface showed signs of melting. Fortunately, the damage was minimal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, muttering, "This is the legendary Burning Star Pit! Even with written records, I've severely underestimated the power of this Purifying Heavenly Fire."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo stared silently, his eyes reflecting the soaring blue flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This was indeed one of the cultivation world's marvels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Legend has it that a star once fell from the heavens, crashing into the depths of these mountains and creating a massive crater.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">From this event, the Purifying Heavenly Fire emerged, merging deeply with the Earth's veins and eternally burning from ancient times until the present day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Countless myths and legends surrounded this remarkable phenomenon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">During the Middle Antiquity Era, excellent spiritual roots emerged in large numbers. Seven major super sects once collaborated, sending an impressive thirty thousand cultivators on an exploration. Ultimately, only seven survived, gaining immense benefits and collectively known thereafter as the Seven Heavenly Inspectors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">By the Near Ancient Era, spiritual energy was abundant, and exceptional talents appeared frequently. The Burning Star Pit greatly benefited from this environment. The spiritual essence it accumulated over countless years eventually underwent a qualitative transformation, birthing a supreme fire spirit capable of self-cultivation. She named herself the Heavenly Maiden of Purifying Flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Upon leaving the Burning Star Pit, this Heavenly Maiden brought catastrophic calamity upon the entire cultivation world, engulfing countless lives in a devastating inferno. Her blue-silver flames, towering like massive mountains, radiated a mysterious force outward, transforming the surroundings into a peculiar domain known as the Azure Cosmos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This space was open and free to enter or exit. Countless shimmering starlights traced intricate paths within the Azure Cosmos, creating dazzling intersections and spirals. Suddenly, three meteorites descended from the heavens, drawn into this azure realm and crashing directly into the Burning Star Pit, triggering three consecutive, thunderous explosions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The mountain-sized flames trembled briefly but quickly stabilized, continuously burning and occasionally releasing particles known as Burning Star Powder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Burning Star Powder!" Sun Lingtong's eyes sparkled as he piloted the mechanical dragon slightly closer to collect a small amount of this highly combustible substance, known for significantly lowering melting points. Despite its value, he dared not venture further; even a Nascent Soul-level mechanical construct would be reduced to ashes within moments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">When the Fire Mountain erupted, the spreading Azure Cosmos became an ownerless domain, formerly controlled by the Heavenly Maiden of Purifying Flame. During the Forbidden Dynasty, it was widely believed that controlling this domain meant dominating the Burning Star Pit itself - a resource point of immense value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Enticed by such vast treasures and the continuous emergence of deities and Buddhas, countless ambitious cultivators ventured deep into the Burning Star Pit. Tragically, many renowned experts and groups lost their lives or were obliterated entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Most notably, Starcloud Hermit, a Buddhist cultivator at the Great Ascension stage, two realms above even Void Refinement, prepared extensively against the Heavenly Purifying Flame's threat. Yet, he fell victim to the Starcore Ghost Remains hidden within the pit, eventually becoming the dreaded Starfire Demon, who wreaked havoc and slaughtered numerous successors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ultimately, these continuous invasions forced the Forbidden Dynasty itself to attempt conquering the Burning Star Pit. They, too, failed disastrously and afterward fell mysteriously silent, merely declaring that "a terrifying horror dwells within."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">From then on, no one else dared attempt control, solidifying the Burning Star Pit as one of the recognized wonders of the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Despite this, numerous cultivators continued to risk their lives to harvest its unique resources. Beyond the relatively mundane Burning Star Powder, there were enormous Starlight Larvae thriving around the pit. Whenever a star was captured and incinerated by the domain, the precious Star Essence, effective in resisting the Fire Calamity of the Three Disasters and Nine Tribulations, emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Occasionally, the walls of the Burning Star Pit revealed mystical flame and star patterns, encapsulating profound insights. Among the rarest treasures was the seed of the Heavenly Purifying Flame itself, albeit extremely dangerous to obtain due to the spatial labyrinth created by Star Fragments and gaps, which continuously changed with each flame eruption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong noticed other cultivators also gathering resources nearby, showcasing various sophisticated techniques. Their cultivation ranged from Golden Core to Soul Formation - at least three Soul Formation experts were visible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">In essence, the stakes and value of this worldly marvel far surpassed the Two Note Kingdom's previous campaign against the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Greetings, fellow Daoist…" Shortly after Sun and Ning began their activity, a Nascent Soul cultivator approached respectfully, introducing himself as a subordinate of a Soul Formation expert and inviting them to a gathering. Mistaking the mechanical dragon for harboring at least a Nascent Soul cultivator, this stranger extended courtesy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Politely yet firmly, Ning Zhuo declined, stating they were merely passing through and would soon depart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Nascent Soul cultivators who had voluntarily extended invitations proactively left behind tokens before respectfully bidding farewell, their demeanor filled with enthusiasm throughout the entire exchange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Sun Lingtong sighed, "Wherever people gather, rivers and lakes inevitably form. Though the Starfire Pit appears unclaimed, its vast benefits have led the surrounding cultivators to establish firm territories and divide its resources long ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Indeed," Ning Zhuo nodded. "We are merely passing through and should avoid getting entangled in their intricate games. It's best we depart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Their visit here was more out of curiosity than greed; they intended only a brief sightseeing tour before moving on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Once we leave here, we’ll officially exit the borders of the Two Note Kingdom," Sun Lingtong remarked wistfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo instinctively glanced back toward the Thousand Peaks Forest, his expression subtly complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This journey through Two Note Kingdom had been fraught with danger. Several times, he had teetered between life and death, yet the rewards were immense. Not only had his initial goals been achieved smoothly, but he had also become exceedingly wealthy. Both his personal strength and mental resolve had undergone significant transformations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon slipped silently into the void, vanishing instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"As expected, they've finally left." Numerous eyes withdrew their scrutiny.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Ten Thousand Li Dragon was a classic mechanical construct. Due to its lack of combat capability - being merely a luxurious transportation and escape vehicle - it was rarely standard equipment. To most Nascent Soul cultivators, possessing one indicated immense wealth or exceptional status.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This misconception caused Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo's reputations to be severely overestimated upon their initial appearance, drawing considerable attention from surrounding cultivators. Little did they know, the occupants of this mechanical dragon were merely two Foundation Establishment cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo continued onward, heading directly for the Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Traveling through the void was far more convenient than flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Flying at high altitudes posed risks like encountering demon beasts or adverse weather, whereas void travel was relatively safer, albeit lonelier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Of course, every advantage came with drawbacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">This mode of travel was exceedingly costly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Every moment spent traversing through the void burned through spiritual stones!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"If only we had captured a Nascent Soul cultivator, we could have saved a fortune. Unfortunately, despite multiple skirmishes and large-scale battles, there was never an opportunity to capture one alive," Ning Zhuo lamented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The main issue lay in their capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Nascent Soul cultivators excelled at spatial escape techniques, masters of fleeing for their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Throughout the Thousand Peaks Forest campaign, many Nascent Soul cultivators had fallen, yet most managed to escape as Nascent Souls. Cultivators like Green Vine Healer, after reconstructing their physical bodies, continued their paths of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">At the Nascent Soul stage, cultivators' survivability underwent a qualitative leap; even losing their physical body did not necessarily sever their cultivation path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Mu Lan’s divine ability, Scarlet Heart Homing Arrow, was extremely potent and could burn away Nascent Souls - a rare technique scarcely found across all of Two Note Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Capturing a Nascent Soul alive was vastly more challenging than simply killing one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Thus, Ning Zhuo’s aspiration to capture a Nascent Soul was exceedingly slim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Although he hadn't captured any Nascent Souls, Ning Zhuo had gained many Golden Cores. He had already exchanged three Golden Cores from Zhao Xi earlier, and after the second major battle, his collection increased dramatically to eight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The journey to Flying Cloud Kingdom was lengthy. Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo took turns cultivating as they traveled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo first focused on repairing his mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng, and the Shadow Blade - Night Tiger had both sustained severe damage in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ordinary mechanical puppets had been utterly annihilated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Mechanical Golden Swallows were down to merely ten percent of their original number.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Once I leave the Two Note Kingdom, I'll likely lose my military rank and organizational structure. Without official rank or structured command, forming armies becomes impossible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Henceforth, using these mechanical puppets would be akin to how the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth controlled spirits - as summoned beasts rather than soldiers. Deploying military strategies would become nearly impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Similarly, Lone Fang and Ju bing, cultivators specializing in beast control, would also find military formations difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Learning military tactics individually was not especially challenging; the real difficulty lay in assembling a cohesive army.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
