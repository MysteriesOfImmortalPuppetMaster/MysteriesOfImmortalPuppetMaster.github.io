<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Lava Immortal Palace rose into the sky, its magnificent golden pillars and crimson bricks shaking people‚Äôs hearts as they gazed upon it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Bathing in dazzling firelight, the immortal palace seemed like the residence of an almighty god.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">All of Fire Persimmon Mountain trembled and quaked, letting loose a horrific roar. Soil went flying as the volcano erupted, spouting lava several zhang high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Cultivators fled in all directions, as insignificant as ants before the immense power of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Fire Persimmon Immortal City‚Äôs reigning City Lord appeared with a solemn expression on his face. Activating the volcano-sealing formation, he poured in his Nascent Soul-level magical power without reserve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Countless rays of green light converged in the sky, turning into a formation net and covering the pillar of lava that was about to burst out from the volcano.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The two sides collided fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The earth quaked!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The whole of Fire Persimmon Immortal City had awakened by now. Countless people ran out of their houses, looking at the collapsing buildings all around them in horror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Black smoke spewed out from the volcanic eruption, roiling like a demonic disaster intent on swallowing up the whole world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The black smoke surged unceasingly, but the green light didn‚Äôt dissipate. The volcano-sealing formation stood strong, preventing a tragedy from occurring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Soon, the shaking of the earth weakened, and eventually disappeared completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Lava Immortal Palace stood atop the crater like a giant. Above it was a huge cloud of roiling black smoke, and beneath it was churning lava.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The immortal palace was built with golden pillars and crimson bricks. With its high towers, grandiose main hall, and numerous exquisite side halls, it seemed a perfect embodiment of the fierceness of fire, the firmness of gold, and the solidity of earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Countless gazes ‚Äì suspicious, curious, greedy, and more ‚Äì all fell on the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But in the next moment, the City Lord descended from the sky with a pale complexion. With a wave of his long sleeves, he activated a formation. The magnificent Lava Immortal Palace was covered up, no longer to be seen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The cultivators within the crater had suffered heavy casualties. Of those who had been plumbing the depths of the volcano, not one had lived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Riding a cloud, Zheng Shuanggou brought the survivors of the Ning Clan and flew over to the City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He quickly reported the situation via divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">When the City Lord finished listening, his face was ashen and his eyes were chillingly cold: ‚ÄúInvestigate! I want an exhaustive investigation. That black shadow demonic cultivator must pay with his life!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Noticing the Ning Clan survivors behind Zheng Shuanggou, he continued: ‚ÄúThese people must be investigated as well. All survivors must be detained and interrogated thoroughly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">‚ÄúDo everything in your power to track down that black shadow demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">‚ÄúAnyone found to be an accomplice will be severely punished!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The City Lord was the only Nascent Soul cultivator in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Right now, he was in an absolutely awful mood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He had discovered the Lava Immortal Palace some time after taking office. However, he didn‚Äôt report it, and instead deliberately concealed the news. He intended to hide the Lava Immortal Palace and swallow it up himself, exploring it in secret and finally making it his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">But things didn‚Äôt go as planned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Zhou Clan and Zheng Clan soon discovered the palace as well. The City Lord had no choice but to compromise and sign a secret contract with the two clans. Now, this year, the Ning Clan had also discovered it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Ning Clan was also a Golden Core-level cultivation clan, and the City Lord had long braced himself to welcome them to the secret alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Thus, Fire Persimmon Immortal City‚Äôs four strongest forces joined together to explore the Lava Immortal Palace and exclude any outsiders. This situation was something that the City Lord had worked very hard to arrange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But now, his careful arrangement had fallen apart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">‚ÄúBlack shadow demonic cultivator, that damn black shadow demonic cultivator!!‚Äù Thinking of this culprit, the hatred in the City Lord‚Äôs heart surged violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The City Lord suppressed his anger and tried to think of a solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He was a mere city lord under the Southern Bean Kingdom. He couldn‚Äôt cover up the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">‚ÄúDammit! Once this news reaches to the capital, it‚Äôll be out of my hands!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">There were many high-level officials in the Southern Bean Kingdom. Compared with the power of an entire kingdom, his Nascent Soul stage cultivation was nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">‚ÄúSigh‚Ä¶ I have to keep hiding it as long as possible. Fortunately, the Lava Immortal Palace didn‚Äôt truly emerge and still remains atop the crater. I just need to repair the formation, set up some clouds to conceal it, and issue a gag order. Then‚Ä¶‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Dong! Dong! Dong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The sound of a tolling bell suddenly burst forth from the depths of the volcano.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The tolls of the bell echoed loud and long, reverberating throughout the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At the same time, those who heard the bell sensed a new cultivation technique appearing in their minds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The City Lord was shocked. His face turned extremely ugly as he blurted: ‚ÄúThe Technique Transmission Bell?!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Currently, it was late in the night. Fire Persimmon Immortal City was still in chaos, with countless buildings having collapsed during the earthquake. Fierce discussions filled the streets, and most people were looking at the top of the volcano.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The confrontation between the City Lord and the immortal palace just now had made it clear to everyone that something big had happened on Fire Persimmon Volcano!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Just then, a deep and vast bell tolled!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Dong, dong, dong‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The sound of the bell was so loud that even the clouds shook. It made the outer wall of the city tremble, and echoed throughout countless streets and alleyways.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">It covered the lavish mansions and spread to the ordinary houses. It carried on the wind and filled the entire immortal city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">It drilled precisely into the hearts and minds of every sentient being, shaking their very souls!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Countless people cried out in surprise, but a moment later, their attention was all placed on the cultivation technique taking shape in their minds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">In the City Lord Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">A burly young man lying on the ground was awakened by the sound of the bell and suddenly opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">‚ÄúWho?!‚Äù Letting out a shout, he jumped to his feet with a gust of wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">‚ÄúIs there an enemy?!‚Äù The burly young man was instantly alert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">At that moment, the Fire Persimmon City Lord sent a voice transmission: ‚ÄúMeng Chong[^1], my grandson, hurry and meditate! This is the sound of the Technique Transmission Bell! It‚Äôs the key for this battle over the Lava Immortal palace!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">‚ÄúTechnique Transmission Bell?‚Äù The burly young man, Meng Chong, immediately stilled upon hearing this reminder. His eyes were dull, but his posture was as straight as a spear as he gazed forward and tried to comprehend the technique that had appeared in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">In the Zhou Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Two young cultivators named Zhou Zeshen[^2] and Zhou Zhu[^3] were studying a mechanical blueprint together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">One was short and one was tall; one was frail and the other sturdy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Suddenly, their expressions and movements froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A few breaths after the bell started ringing, Zhoug Zeshen quickly said in shock: ‚ÄúThe sound of this bell seems to contain a cultivation technique! Quick, hurry and comprehend it.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zhou Zhu was taciturn and usually listened obediently to Zhou Zeshen. He immediately sat down cross-legged with his eyes closed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In the Zheng Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Zheng Jian[^4] was checking through the clan‚Äôs accounting records.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">There was a band around the young man‚Äôs forehead, and an eye-shaped gem was inlaid in the center of the band.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">A pale and sweaty steward stood in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zheng Jian suddenly snorted coldly and threw the account book in his hands onto the ground, saying in a low voice: ‚ÄúDid you really think you could hide these falsified accounts from me?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The steward shuddered and immediately knelt on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">At that moment, the sound of the bell arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After listening for a few moments, Zheng Jian‚Äôs expression changed drastically and he shooed the steward away: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt bother with you for now, scram!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">In the Ning Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Xiaohui[^5], a publicly recognized genius of the Ning Clan, had spent her day crafting talismans and was utterly exhausted. Even when the sound of the bell arrived, her brows merely wrinkled a little; she didn‚Äôt awaken from her deep sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Ji was cultivating when the bell shook him out of his meditative state. His expression was full of doubt: ‚ÄúWhat the heck is this?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">In the crater.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Zheng Shuanggou was still piloting the cloud. On its fluffy surface, the Ning Clan cultivators were scattered haphazardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">It wasn‚Äôt just them; most of the other cultivators were also lying around or sitting in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">‚ÄúOpportunity, this is an opportunity!‚Äù The cultivators were ecstatic and did their best to comprehend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Chen sat down with his eyes closed, brows furrowed with effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Yong held his head tightly: ‚ÄúAhhh, memorize it for me, head, I‚Äôm counting on you to memorize it!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo was surprised and delighted internally: ‚ÄúI succeeded! The selection standard of the Lava Immortal Palace has dropped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">‚ÄúBut the selection method has changed. Now, it‚Äôs directly transmitting the technique of the Qi Refining stage.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">This was something Ning Zhuo hadn‚Äôt expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Like the other cultivators, Ning Zhuo stood stock still and listened carefully to the sound of the bell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Gradually, a cultivation technique outlined itself in his mind ‚Äì ‚ÄúFive Elements Qi Regulation Incantation‚Äù!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">‚ÄúWith this technique, I can finally get rid of the Ning Clan‚Äôs ‚ÄòSnowy Region Talisman Illustration Scripture‚Äô.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He had plotted for so many years, taking on no small degree of risk. Now, everything had paid off with results beyond his imagination, filling his heart with relief, excitement, accomplishment, and other various emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Indeed --</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Mechanical fire monkey leaps into molten lava; Iron Will Gray Armor breaks the dawning frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Buddha and demon conceal machinations; immortal palace quakes with heavenly light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Dao bell tolls, transmitting new knowledge; Five Elements Qi Regulation reflects natural law.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Cultivate to the extreme and return to origin; break seals and shackles to walk freely!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">[^1]: Meng Chong ‚Äì ËíôË°ù ‚Äì Meng is a surname. Chong means ‚Äúto rush straight ahead‚Äù.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">[^2]: Zhou Zeshen ‚Äì Âë®Êæ§Ê∑± ‚Äì Zeshen means ‚Äúdeep pool‚Äù.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">[^3]: Zhou Zhu ‚Äì Âë®Êü± ‚Äì Zhu means ‚Äúpillar‚Äù.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">[^4]: Zheng Jian ‚Äì ÈÑ≠ÁÆ≠ ‚Äì Jian means ‚Äúarrow‚Äù.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">[^5]: Ning Xiaohui ‚Äì ÂØßÂ∞èÊÖß ‚Äì Hui means ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù. Xiao means ‚Äúlittle‚Äù, but it‚Äôs also a kind of cutesy prefix.</paragraph><br/><br/>
