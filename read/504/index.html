<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 504: The Arrow Settles the Hooked Moon Mountain</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Cangyue Ancient God was utterly baffled as to why the dignified Dice-Bone Demon God would betray them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Because deities grew stronger through the incense of worship, that incense became their foundation. And its source was the broad masses of believers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Hence, deities often depended on faith, having to consider the believers‚Äô thoughts in every move they made.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">At present, Two Note Nation was crusading against Thousand Peaks Forest, and the two sides had become mortal enemies. Two Note Nation intended to sweep away all evil for the sake of the kingdom, while Thousand Peaks Forest aimed to defend its homeland and protect its freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Naturally, the believers in Thousand Peaks Forest harbored profound hatred toward Two Note Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The deities of Thousand Peaks Forest were the greatest adversaries of Two Note Nation, so they should have been the most steadfast force of resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Yet the Dice-Bone Demon God actually betrayed them and surrendered!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Secretly anxious, Cangyue Ancient God urgently asked, ‚ÄúDice-Bone Demon God, what sort of spell have you been struck with? Speak, and I‚Äôll try to help you.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Dice-Bone Demon God gave a cold snort but did not reply. Instead, he continued exerting force, causing the Dice-Bone Domain to expand even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Both domains pushed against each other, gradually infiltrating one another as they stalled. Initially, two distinct worlds were clearly separate, but they merged into a brand-new domain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Within this domain, strands of black and white light interwove in alternating rows like fences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">A crescent moon, curved like a hook, still hung high in the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">However, above everyone‚Äôs heads there now hovered a white bone die.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Utterly furious, Cangyue Ancient God let out a low roar, mobilizing his divine power to unleash a vast flood of moonlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Woven together, the moonbeams formed a rain of arrows, nearly blotting out the sky as it enveloped the entire Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But midway through the attack, the die above Cangyue Ancient God‚Äôs head spun, then stopped on the number six.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In the Dice-Bone Demon God‚Äôs own eyes, the die showed a four.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The die in his other eye socket was already damaged and could no longer be cast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In the previous battle, his injuries had lingered, never fully healed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Meanwhile, above Ning Zhuo‚Äôs head, the die showed a five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">And all ranks of the Red Flower Camp, counted as one whole, produced a two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Two plus five plus four equals eleven, which exceeded six.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Thus, the moonlight arrow barrage was weakened, and the lost portion of the bet was added to the Red Flower Camp, Ning Zhuo, and the Dice-Bone Demon God, transforming into defensive power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Seeing the opportunity, Mu Lan‚Äôs eyes flashed brilliantly. She immediately transmitted her voice to Ning Zhuo: ‚ÄúYoung Master Ning, our top priority is to form the Red Flower Battle Formation!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù Ning Zhuo took a deep breath. With a pat on the storage belt at his waist, he released a large number of mechanical puppets once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He led these mechanical puppets in an assault on Di Lu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hold him off for now.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Seizing the chance, Mu Lan retreated. ‚ÄúBe extremely careful!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">She slipped into the Red Flower Camp and instantly began deploying her methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Military strategy ‚ÄîSpeed is of the essence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Once again, the Red Flower Camp attempted to form a battle formation, and this time, thanks to Mu Lan‚Äôs command, their speed was nearly ten times faster than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Di Lu, the barbarian cultivator, brandished a giant blade curved like a crescent moon and charged at the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In secret coordination, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong controlled the mechanical puppets to intercept him halfway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">As a Nascent Soul‚Äìlevel cultivator, Di Lu possessed formidable strength. With each flip of his curved blade, he unleashed fierce edges of power, slicing the mechanical puppets in half one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He charged forward at will, sweeping aside all opposition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">No matter what Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong tried with the puppet army, they could hardly stop his advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Di Lu quickly cut a path through the puppet troops, causing heavy casualties single-handedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Because of the large losses among his mechanical puppets, Ning Zhuo‚Äôs aura surged once again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His eyes grew bloodshot, veins bulged at his temples and neck, and blood even began to trickle from the corner of his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">‚ÄúLittle Zhuo, your body‚Äôs reserves are shallow. With the Hero's Return Technique still boosting you, your flesh is close to its limit!‚Äù Sun Lingtong spotted danger at once through his spiritual eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo nodded. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no other way. I‚Äôll just give it a try.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He cast Five Elements spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">A blaze of fire formed into a fierce tiger that roared once before being cut in two by the curved blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Green vines wove together, seeking to restrain Di Lu, but he simply swayed lightly, slipping past them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">A burst of golden light shot out, sending hundreds of tiny needles at Di Lu. Yet the treasure armor on his body gleamed and blocked every single golden needle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo next deployed water serpents to tangle Di Lu‚Äôs feet. Di Lu immediately adjusted his steps and stomped them all to pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Earth Style ‚ÄîSand Shackles, Stone Locks!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">A surge of spiritual energy turned into yellow sand that enveloped Di Lu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Right away, the sand clung to Di Lu, covering his entire body, rapidly solidifying into stone locks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">These stone locks confined Di Lu, actually holding him fast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Di Lu was astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs first four elements were all at the peak Golden Core level ‚Äîpowerful, but well within Di Lu‚Äôs expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But this final Earth-based spell abruptly soared in power as if it had transcended the simple ranks, reaching a Nascent Soul level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">What was going on?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Clearly, Ning Zhuo hadn‚Äôt deployed any additional troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs forces were part of the Red Flower Camp. Right now, that camp was busy forming their battle array; they couldn‚Äôt carelessly divert large military strength, which would greatly disrupt the process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Moreover, Ning Zhuo himself was already boosted to his body‚Äôs limit, so even if he wanted to use more troop power, it would be quite limited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The real reason lay with his Earth-based spleen temple!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs self-improved Five Organ Shrine Spirit Art not only accelerated his cultivation but also fortified him, greatly increasing the power of spells corresponding to each element.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Previously, he hadn‚Äôt needed to draw upon this power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">But at this moment, alone against a Nascent Soul powerhouse like Di Lu, he had no choice but to fight at full strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Crack, crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Fissures began appearing on the stone locks holding Di Lu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo inhaled sharply and cast the Sand Shackles, Stone Locks technique once again to mend the fractures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Despite his maximum effort, the cracks still multiplied, growing wider and wider.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">After a dozen breaths, Di Lu shattered the stone locks and regained his freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">‚ÄúTo hold me off for so long is something you can be proud of.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He tore away the black cloth covering his eyes, revealing a pair of all-white pupils whose gaze was terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This was a layer of seal on himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Once he tore away the black cloth, his entire being shifted into a frenzied combat stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">At this very moment, Di Lu‚Äôs combat power skyrocketed to his absolute maximum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This state could not last for long, and its aftermath would be severe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Martial Skill ‚ÄîBlind Surge of Dead Eyes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Di Lu‚Äôs aura flared, burning with silent anger. Yet he did not turn on Ning Zhuo; instead, he switched direction to charge toward the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Under Mu Lan‚Äôs leadership, the Red Flower Dharma Aspect was once again condensing, already more than halfway formed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Though fuming, Di Lu was not blinded by rage; he knew full well that the Red Flower Dharma Aspect was a vital element in this battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Mu Lan and Ning Zhuo understood this as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Seeing Di Lu rushing in, Mu Lan sighed inwardly: ‚ÄúNing Zhuo has done remarkably well, but in the end, Di Lu is still a Nascent Soul powerhouse. It seems I must go out and stop him myself!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Just as Mu Lan was about to leave the formation and fight again, Ning Zhuo caught up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">‚ÄúFriend Di Lu, hold on a moment!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">With that, Ning Zhuo deployed a Golden Core‚Äìlevel puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Armored Blood Ape‚ÄîDa Sheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Yuan Da Sheng descended from the sky and landed in front of Di Lu, swinging both fists to intercept.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">They exchanged three blows, and as Di Lu‚Äôs curved blade flickered, he sliced Yuan Da Sheng into three pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">‚ÄúImpressive martial skills,‚Äù Di Lu commented. He stepped across Yuan Da Sheng‚Äôs remains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">In the next instant, a shadow flickered, appearing behind Di Lu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Hidden Shadow Blade ‚ÄîNight Tiger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Its claws snapped out, stabbing viciously at Di Lu‚Äôs back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Without looking, Di Lu stepped forward, twisted his waist, and thrust out an arm, unleashing a vast, majestic blade aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">That vertical slash instantly cut Meng Yehu cleanly into two halves!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Seizing the moment, Di Lu continued rushing toward the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Right then, the Red Flower Dharma Aspect took shape just in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With a sharp cry, Mu Lan commanded the entire Red Flower Camp to move as one, launching a combined strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">A scarlet radiance burst from the blossoming Red Flower, striking Di Lu in a flash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Boom ‚Äîan explosive roar sent Di Lu flying backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He crossed his arms over his chest and used his curved blade to block the raging beam of red light. His feet plowed into the ground for a full four or five zhang before he finally managed to steady himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Di Lu, his pupils white as death, stared at the Red Flower Camp with deep unwillingness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In the end, the Red Flower Battle Formation had formed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Accomplishing that meant the entire Red Flower Camp had turned from endangered to secure, and everyone‚Äôs strength could be gathered as one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Now they were no longer a burden to Mu Lan and Ning Zhuo but a decisive force capable of swaying the overall battle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The Dice-Bone Demon God revealed his true form, falling from high in the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Cracks covered his entire body, like a piece of porcelain on the verge of shattering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Kneeling before Ning Zhuo, the Dice-Bone Demon God bowed low. ‚ÄúI await my master‚Äôs punishment. This old servant has lost.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Moments ago, while Ning Zhuo was holding off Di Lu, Cangyue Ancient God had been fully attacking the Dice-Bone Demon God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">In terms of divine power, Cangyue Ancient God was an old senior to the Dice-Bone Demon God, with far deeper reserves. As for condition, Cangyue Ancient God was in good shape, whereas the Dice-Bone Demon God was already wounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Thus, when the two domains intertwined, Cangyue Ancient God attacked with all his might. The Dice-Bone Demon God could not dodge, only endure, until finally he was struck down, forced to withdraw his domain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">In a flash, the deep night returned, with that thin crescent moon once again hanging prominently in the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">‚ÄúCome back first, Old Dice,‚Äù Ning Zhuo said without reproach, lifting his wrist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Dice-Bone Demon God returned and reverted to a prayer bead bracelet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Of its six white bone dice, three had already crumbled, and the remaining three were badly damaged‚Äînearly destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">‚ÄúOld Dice won‚Äôt be able to fight again for a while.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Realizing this, Ning Zhuo felt heavy-hearted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">‚ÄúNo matter,‚Äù Mu Lan said with a crisp shout, soaring skyward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">She dove straight into the Red Flower Dharma Aspect, where a red flower gleamed upon her brow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Mu Lan stood tall as a spear, gripping a great bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">That bow was huge, nearly half Mu Lan‚Äôs height.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The bow‚Äôs body curved like a crescent, with a reddish-brown hue. From time to time, it shimmered with fiery light that rippled across its length.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">An ancient aura emanated from the bow‚Äôs limbs, both warm and stirring to the spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">On the brownish -red bow limbs, golden feathers stretched from the center toward the ends. Each golden feather was intricately detailed, lifelike, and when the bow trembled, the feather tips quivered softly in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Fewer golden feathers were gathered in the middle, while at the edges of the bow limbs they became dense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">With the sharp, upward thrust of the bow‚Äôs tips, the lavish golden plumage spread like a phoenix unfurling its wings, fierce yet splendid, bold, and fiery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">This was the Red Phoenix Bow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Mu Lan drew the bow and nocked an arrow, boldly revealing her greatest trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Divine Power ‚ÄîScarlet-Heart Swan Arrow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Augmented by threefold power from her troops, the formation, and the kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">She released the arrow like a phoenix cry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">A stream of fire, dazzling and scorching, soared straight toward the crescent moon in the night sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Boom!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Flames roiled, producing blinding light and heat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">It was as though a sudden sun had appeared. The night sky was torn to shreds. Cangyue Ancient God let out a pained howl and fled in panic, disappearing in haste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The crescent moon shattered like a broken mirror, fragmenting into pieces!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">‚ÄúMy god!‚Äù Di Lu roared, his expression tense with alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">His fighting spirit plummeted, and he turned to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">‚ÄúTrying to escape?!‚Äù Mu Lan‚Äôs face had gone pale, and her figure was swaying violently, but she gritted her teeth and forced herself to stand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">She bit through the pill she‚Äôd kept in her mouth, her spirit jolting awake!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">She fired a second arrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">This arrow targeted Di Lu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Desperately, he employed his fleeing technique, giving it all he had.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Slender though it was, the flaming arrow still had tremendous power, albeit far less than the first shot. Even so, the arrow pierced Di Lu‚Äôs body and incinerated his Golden Core!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Di Lu crashed face-first to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Momentum sent his corpse dragging through the mountainside, smashing several boulders and snapping a line of tree trunks until finally coming to a halt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">A Nascent Soul‚Äìlevel cultivator ‚ÄîDi Lu ‚Äîhad fallen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">At the same moment, the Red Flower Dharma Aspect vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Mu Lan plummeted from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Zhang Zhongyi rushed into the air, intending to catch her, then suddenly faltered. While sending a mental warning to Ning Zhuo, he used a spell to let Mu Lan drift down as gently as a feather.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Ning Zhuo flew up and caught her, carrying her safely back to the ground. ‚ÄúGeneral Mu Lan‚Äôs might is awe-inspiring!‚Äù he said in admiration, gazing at her in his arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Mu Lan forced a small smile at him, then fainted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Because the Red Flower Camp was well-trained, a Golden Core‚Äìlevel deputy general immediately took over, so there was no real panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">‚ÄúPlease, Young Master Ning and Doctor Zhang, look after our general,‚Äù the Golden Core deputy generals said. They were well aware of Ning Zhuo‚Äôs relationship with Mu Lan and trusted Zhang Zhongyi completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Zhang Zhongyi looked toward Ning Zhuo. ‚ÄúYoung Master Ning, it seems we‚Äôll be working together again to treat General Mu Lan.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Ning Zhuo surveyed the battlefield. He nodded. ‚ÄúTime is of the essence. Let‚Äôs head back to camp and discuss this.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">All the while, a Nascent Soul cultivator who had remained hidden felt somewhat awkward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">‚ÄúGeneral Mu Lan‚Äôs Scarlet-Heart Swan Arrow is shockingly powerful ‚Äîone arrow to drive off an ancient god, and another to kill a Nascent Soul expert well above her realm!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">‚ÄúI was still hesitating on when to intervene, but the battle is already decided.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">On his shoulder, a myna bird spoke: ‚ÄúIn that case, we shouldn‚Äôt show ourselves anymore, Master.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Slowly nodding, the Nascent Soul cultivator said, ‚ÄúIndeed, I have no face to appear now. Go in my stead. Inform the Red Flower Camp of the latest military orders and have them withdraw.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">‚ÄúUnderstood, Master,‚Äù the myna bird replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">After a short delay, it revealed itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">‚ÄúA Golden Core‚Äìlevel demon cultivator!‚Äù The Red Flower Camp readied themselves as though facing a great enemy at the sight of the myna bird.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">But the myna soon proved its identity and delivered the new orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Zhang Zhongyi said, ‚ÄúWonderful‚Äîwe can withdraw now.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Ning Zhuo told him further details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">At once, Zhang Zhongyi‚Äôs favorable opinion of the myna bird plummeted, and his attitude flipped entirely. ‚ÄúTch! So you‚Äôre the filthy scum who refused to help when we were facing death.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">He glanced at the unconscious Mu Lan, sighing again. ‚ÄúThe Two Note Nation‚Äôs court continues to suppress General Mu‚Äôs household.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">Ning Zhuo said, ‚ÄúMu Lan‚Äôs injuries have stabilized. The situation is urgent, so let‚Äôs get out of here and continue treatment on the way.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">Zhang Zhongyi and the Golden Core deputy generals all readily complied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">The Red Flower Camp‚Äôs retreat went quite smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Nearing Wood Wheel Town, Ning Zhuo spotted the banners of the Three Generals Camp and the Barbarian-Demon Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">‚ÄúHow come I don‚Äôt see the Golden Halberd Army?‚Äù he asked, puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">Dragon King Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">The current Elephant King slammed open the palace doors and strode inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">His body was massive and imposing, so he nearly had to squeeze through the entrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="349">At his waist hung the head of a Nascent Soul cultivator, and in his right hand he dragged another Nascent Soul cultivator taken prisoner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="351">That prisoner was none other than Sun Gan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="353">The Elephant King heaved Sun Gan onto the floor tiles. With a murderous gleam in his eyes, he swept his gaze around the hall and spoke in a rumbling voice that filled the chamber: ‚ÄúThe Golden Halberd Army has been wiped out.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="355">‚ÄúWhere is the Elephant Vein Fostering Pill I was promised?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
