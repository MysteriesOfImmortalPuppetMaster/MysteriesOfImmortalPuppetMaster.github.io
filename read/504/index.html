<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 504: The Arrow Settles the Hooked Moon Mountain</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Cangyue Ancient God was utterly baffled as to why the dignified Dice-Bone Demon God would betray them!<br/>
<br/>
Because deities grew stronger through the incense of worship, that incense became their foundation. And its source was the broad masses of believers.<br/>
<br/>
Hence, deities often depended on faith, having to consider the believers‚Äô thoughts in every move they made.<br/>
<br/>
At present, Twin Rivers Nation was crusading against Thousand Peaks Forest, and the two sides had become mortal enemies. Twin Rivers Nation intended to sweep away all evil for the sake of the kingdom, while Thousand Peaks Forest aimed to defend its homeland and protect its freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, the believers in Thousand Peaks Forest harbored profound hatred toward Twin Rivers Nation.<br/>
<br/>
The deities of Thousand Peaks Forest were the greatest adversaries of Twin Rivers Nation, so they should have been the most steadfast force of resistance.<br/>
<br/>
Yet the Dice-Bone Demon God actually betrayed them and surrendered!<br/>
<br/>
Secretly anxious, Cangyue Ancient God urgently asked, ‚ÄúDice-Bone Demon God, what sort of spell have you been struck with? Speak, and I‚Äôll try to help you.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
The Dice-Bone Demon God gave a cold snort but did not reply. Instead, he continued exerting force, causing the Dice-Bone Domain to expand even more.<br/>
<br/>
Both domains pushed against each other, gradually infiltrating one another as they stalled. Initially, two distinct worlds were clearly separate, but they merged into a brand-new domain.<br/>
<br/>
Within this domain, strands of black and white light interwove in alternating rows like fences.<br/>
<br/>
A crescent moon, curved like a hook, still hung high in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
However, above everyone‚Äôs heads there now hovered a white bone die.<br/>
<br/>
Utterly furious, Cangyue Ancient God let out a low roar, mobilizing his divine power to unleash a vast flood of moonlight.<br/>
<br/>
Woven together, the moonbeams formed a rain of arrows, nearly blotting out the sky as it enveloped the entire Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
But midway through the attack, the die above Cangyue Ancient God‚Äôs head spun, then stopped on the number six.<br/>
<br/>
In the Dice-Bone Demon God‚Äôs own eyes, the die showed a four.<br/>
<br/>
The die in his other eye socket was already damaged and could no longer be cast.<br/>
<br/>
In the previous battle, his injuries had lingered, never fully healed.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, above Ning Zhuo‚Äôs head, the die showed a five.<br/>
<br/>
And all ranks of the Red Flower Camp, counted as one whole, produced a two.<br/>
<br/>
Two plus five plus four equals eleven, which exceeded six.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the moonlight arrow barrage was weakened, and the lost portion of the bet was added to the Red Flower Camp, Ning Zhuo, and the Dice-Bone Demon God, transforming into defensive power.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the opportunity, Mulan‚Äôs eyes flashed brilliantly. She immediately transmitted her voice to Ning Zhuo: ‚ÄúYoung Master Ning, our top priority is to form the Red Flower Battle Formation!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù Ning Zhuo took a deep breath. With a pat on the storage belt at his waist, he released a large number of mechanical puppets once more.<br/>
<br/>
He led these mechanical puppets in an assault on Di Lu.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hold him off for now.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Seizing the chance, Mulan retreated. ‚ÄúBe extremely careful!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
She slipped into the Red Flower Camp and instantly began deploying her methods.<br/>
<br/>
Military strategy ‚ÄîSpeed is of the essence!<br/>
<br/>
Once again, the Red Flower Camp attempted to form a battle formation, and this time, thanks to Mulan‚Äôs command, their speed was nearly ten times faster than before.<br/>
<br/>
Di Lu, the barbarian cultivator, brandished a giant blade curved like a crescent moon and charged at the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
In secret coordination, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong controlled the mechanical puppets to intercept him halfway.<br/>
<br/>
As a Nascent Soul‚Äìlevel cultivator, Di Lu possessed formidable strength. With each flip of his curved blade, he unleashed fierce edges of power, slicing the mechanical puppets in half one after another.<br/>
<br/>
He charged forward at will, sweeping aside all opposition.<br/>
<br/>
No matter what Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong tried with the puppet army, they could hardly stop his advance.<br/>
<br/>
Di Lu quickly cut a path through the puppet troops, causing heavy casualties single-handedly.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the large losses among his mechanical puppets, Ning Zhuo‚Äôs aura surged once again!<br/>
<br/>
His eyes grew bloodshot, veins bulged at his temples and neck, and blood even began to trickle from the corner of his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúLittle Zhuo, your body‚Äôs reserves are shallow. With the Warrior‚Äôs Return Technique still boosting you, your flesh is close to its limit!‚Äù Sun Lingtong spotted danger at once through his spiritual eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no other way. I‚Äôll just give it a try.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
He cast Five Elements spells.<br/>
<br/>
A blaze of fire formed into a fierce tiger that roared once before being cut in two by the curved blade.<br/>
<br/>
Green vines wove together, seeking to restrain Di Lu, but he simply swayed lightly, slipping past them.<br/>
<br/>
A burst of golden light shot out, sending hundreds of tiny needles at Di Lu. Yet the treasure armor on his body gleamed and blocked every single golden needle.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo next deployed water serpents to tangle Di Lu‚Äôs feet. Di Lu immediately adjusted his steps and stomped them all to pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Earth Style ‚ÄîSand Shackles, Stone Locks!<br/>
<br/>
A surge of spiritual energy turned into yellow sand that enveloped Di Lu.<br/>
<br/>
Right away, the sand clung to Di Lu, covering his entire body, rapidly solidifying into stone locks.<br/>
<br/>
These stone locks confined Di Lu, actually holding him fast.<br/>
<br/>
Di Lu was astonished.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs first four elements were all at the peak Golden Core level ‚Äîpowerful, but well within Di Lu‚Äôs expectations.<br/>
<br/>
But this final Earth-based spell abruptly soared in power as if it had transcended the simple ranks, reaching a Nascent Soul level!<br/>
<br/>
What was going on?<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, Ning Zhuo hadn‚Äôt deployed any additional troops.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs forces were part of the Red Flower Camp. Right now, that camp was busy forming their battle array; they couldn‚Äôt carelessly divert large military strength, which would greatly disrupt the process.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Ning Zhuo himself was already boosted to his body‚Äôs limit, so even if he wanted to use more troop power, it would be quite limited.<br/>
<br/>
The real reason lay with his Earth-based spleen temple!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs self-improved Five Organ Shrine Spirit Art not only accelerated his cultivation but also fortified him, greatly increasing the power of spells corresponding to each element.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, he hadn‚Äôt needed to draw upon this power.<br/>
<br/>
But at this moment, alone against a Nascent Soul powerhouse like Di Lu, he had no choice but to fight at full strength.<br/>
<br/>
Crack, crack.<br/>
<br/>
Fissures began appearing on the stone locks holding Di Lu.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo inhaled sharply and cast the Sand Shackles, Stone Locks technique once again to mend the fractures.<br/>
<br/>
Despite his maximum effort, the cracks still multiplied, growing wider and wider.<br/>
<br/>
Boom.<br/>
<br/>
After a dozen breaths, Di Lu shattered the stone locks and regained his freedom.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúTo hold me off for so long is something you can be proud of.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
He tore away the black cloth covering his eyes, revealing a pair of all-white pupils whose gaze was terrifying.<br/>
<br/>
This was a layer of seal on himself.<br/>
<br/>
Once he tore away the black cloth, his entire being shifted into a frenzied combat stance.<br/>
<br/>
At this very moment, Di Lu‚Äôs combat power skyrocketed to his absolute maximum.<br/>
<br/>
This state could not last for long, and its aftermath would be severe.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Skill ‚ÄîBlind Surge of Dead Eyes!<br/>
<br/>
Di Lu‚Äôs aura flared, burning with silent anger. Yet he did not turn on Ning Zhuo; instead, he switched direction to charge toward the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Under Mulan‚Äôs leadership, the Red Flower Dharma Aspect was once again condensing, already more than halfway formed.<br/>
<br/>
Though fuming, Di Lu was not blinded by rage; he knew full well that the Red Flower Dharma Aspect was a vital element in this battle.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan and Ning Zhuo understood this as well.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Di Lu rushing in, Mulan sighed inwardly: ‚ÄúNing Zhuo has done remarkably well, but in the end, Di Lu is still a Nascent Soul powerhouse. It seems I must go out and stop him myself!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Just as Mulan was about to leave the formation and fight again, Ning Zhuo caught up.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúFriend Di Lu, hold on a moment!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
With that, Ning Zhuo deployed a Golden Core‚Äìlevel puppet.<br/>
<br/>
Armored Blood Ape‚ÄîDa Sheng!<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Da Sheng descended from the sky and landed in front of Di Lu, swinging both fists to intercept.<br/>
<br/>
They exchanged three blows, and as Di Lu‚Äôs curved blade flickered, he sliced Yuan Da Sheng into three pieces.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúImpressive martial skills,‚Äù Di Lu commented. He stepped across Yuan Da Sheng‚Äôs remains.<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, a shadow flickered, appearing behind Di Lu.<br/>
<br/>
Hidden Shadow Blade ‚ÄîNight Tiger!<br/>
<br/>
Its claws snapped out, stabbing viciously at Di Lu‚Äôs back.<br/>
<br/>
Without looking, Di Lu stepped forward, twisted his waist, and thrust out an arm, unleashing a vast, majestic blade aura.<br/>
<br/>
That vertical slash instantly cut Meng Yehu cleanly into two halves!<br/>
<br/>
Seizing the moment, Di Lu continued rushing toward the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Right then, the Red Flower Dharma Aspect took shape just in time.<br/>
<br/>
With a sharp cry, Mulan commanded the entire Red Flower Camp to move as one, launching a combined strike.<br/>
<br/>
A scarlet radiance burst from the blossoming Red Flower, striking Di Lu in a flash.<br/>
<br/>
Boom ‚Äîan explosive roar sent Di Lu flying backward.<br/>
<br/>
He crossed his arms over his chest and used his curved blade to block the raging beam of red light. His feet plowed into the ground for a full four or five zhang before he finally managed to steady himself.<br/>
<br/>
Di Lu, his pupils white as death, stared at the Red Flower Camp with deep unwillingness.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the Red Flower Battle Formation had formed!<br/>
<br/>
Accomplishing that meant the entire Red Flower Camp had turned from endangered to secure, and everyone‚Äôs strength could be gathered as one.<br/>
<br/>
Now they were no longer a burden to Mulan and Ning Zhuo but a decisive force capable of swaying the overall battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Dice-Bone Demon God revealed his true form, falling from high in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Cracks covered his entire body, like a piece of porcelain on the verge of shattering.<br/>
<br/>
Kneeling before Ning Zhuo, the Dice-Bone Demon God bowed low. ‚ÄúI await my master‚Äôs punishment. This old servant has lost.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Moments ago, while Ning Zhuo was holding off Di Lu, Cangyue Ancient God had been fully attacking the Dice-Bone Demon God.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of divine power, Cangyue Ancient God was an old senior to the Dice-Bone Demon God, with far deeper reserves. As for condition, Cangyue Ancient God was in good shape, whereas the Dice-Bone Demon God was already wounded.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, when the two domains intertwined, Cangyue Ancient God attacked with all his might. The Dice-Bone Demon God could not dodge, only endure, until finally he was struck down, forced to withdraw his domain.<br/>
<br/>
In a flash, the deep night returned, with that thin crescent moon once again hanging prominently in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúCome back first, Old Dice,‚Äù Ning Zhuo said without reproach, lifting his wrist.<br/>
<br/>
The Dice-Bone Demon God returned and reverted to a prayer bead bracelet.<br/>
<br/>
Of its six white bone dice, three had already crumbled, and the remaining three were badly damaged‚Äînearly destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúOld Dice won‚Äôt be able to fight again for a while.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Realizing this, Ning Zhuo felt heavy-hearted.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúNo matter,‚Äù Mulan said with a crisp shout, soaring skyward.<br/>
<br/>
She dove straight into the Red Flower Dharma Aspect, where a red flower gleamed upon her brow.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan stood tall as a spear, gripping a great bow.<br/>
<br/>
That bow was huge, nearly half Mulan‚Äôs height.<br/>
<br/>
The bow‚Äôs body curved like a crescent, with a reddish-brown hue. From time to time, it shimmered with fiery light that rippled across its length.<br/>
<br/>
An ancient aura emanated from the bow‚Äôs limbs, both warm and stirring to the spirit.<br/>
<br/>
On the brownish -red bow limbs, golden feathers stretched from the center toward the ends. Each golden feather was intricately detailed, lifelike, and when the bow trembled, the feather tips quivered softly in the air.<br/>
<br/>
Fewer golden feathers were gathered in the middle, while at the edges of the bow limbs they became dense.<br/>
<br/>
With the sharp, upward thrust of the bow‚Äôs tips, the lavish golden plumage spread like a phoenix unfurling its wings, fierce yet splendid, bold, and fiery.<br/>
<br/>
This was the Red Phoenix Bow!<br/>
<br/>
Mulan drew the bow and nocked an arrow, boldly revealing her greatest trump card.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Power ‚ÄîScarlet-Heart Swan Arrow!<br/>
<br/>
Augmented by threefold power from her troops, the formation, and the kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
She released the arrow like a phoenix cry.<br/>
<br/>
A stream of fire, dazzling and scorching, soared straight toward the crescent moon in the night sky.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!!<br/>
<br/>
Flames roiled, producing blinding light and heat.<br/>
<br/>
It was as though a sudden sun had appeared. The night sky was torn to shreds. Cangyue Ancient God let out a pained howl and fled in panic, disappearing in haste.<br/>
<br/>
The crescent moon shattered like a broken mirror, fragmenting into pieces!<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúMy god!‚Äù Di Lu roared, his expression tense with alarm.<br/>
<br/>
His fighting spirit plummeted, and he turned to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúTrying to escape?!‚Äù Mulan‚Äôs face had gone pale, and her figure was swaying violently, but she gritted her teeth and forced herself to stand.<br/>
<br/>
She bit through the pill she‚Äôd kept in her mouth, her spirit jolting awake!<br/>
<br/>
She fired a second arrow.<br/>
<br/>
This arrow targeted Di Lu.<br/>
<br/>
Desperately, he employed his fleeing technique, giving it all he had.<br/>
<br/>
Slender though it was, the flaming arrow still had tremendous power, albeit far less than the first shot. Even so, the arrow pierced Di Lu‚Äôs body and incinerated his Golden Core!<br/>
<br/>
Di Lu crashed face-first to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Momentum sent his corpse dragging through the mountainside, smashing several boulders and snapping a line of tree trunks until finally coming to a halt.<br/>
<br/>
A Nascent Soul‚Äìlevel cultivator ‚ÄîDi Lu ‚Äîhad fallen!<br/>
<br/>
At the same moment, the Red Flower Dharma Aspect vanished.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan plummeted from the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi rushed into the air, intending to catch her, then suddenly faltered. While sending a mental warning to Ning Zhuo, he used a spell to let Mulan drift down as gently as a feather.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo flew up and caught her, carrying her safely back to the ground. ‚ÄúGeneral Mulan‚Äôs might is awe-inspiring!‚Äù he said in admiration, gazing at her in his arms.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan forced a small smile at him, then fainted.<br/>
<br/>
Because the Red Flower Camp was well-trained, a Golden Core‚Äìlevel deputy general immediately took over, so there was no real panic.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúPlease, Young Master Ning and Doctor Zhang, look after our general,‚Äù the Golden Core deputy generals said. They were well aware of Ning Zhuo‚Äôs relationship with Mulan and trusted Zhang Zhongyi completely.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi looked toward Ning Zhuo. ‚ÄúYoung Master Ning, it seems we‚Äôll be working together again to treat General Mulan.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo surveyed the battlefield. He nodded. ‚ÄúTime is of the essence. Let‚Äôs head back to camp and discuss this.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
All the while, a Nascent Soul cultivator who had remained hidden felt somewhat awkward.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúGeneral Mulan‚Äôs Scarlet-Heart Swan Arrow is shockingly powerful ‚Äîone arrow to drive off an ancient god, and another to kill a Nascent Soul expert well above her realm!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúI was still hesitating on when to intervene, but the battle is already decided.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
On his shoulder, a myna bird spoke: ‚ÄúIn that case, we shouldn‚Äôt show ourselves anymore, Master.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Slowly nodding, the Nascent Soul cultivator said, ‚ÄúIndeed, I have no face to appear now. Go in my stead. Inform the Red Flower Camp of the latest military orders and have them withdraw.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúUnderstood, Master,‚Äù the myna bird replied.<br/>
<br/>
After a short delay, it revealed itself.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúA Golden Core‚Äìlevel demon cultivator!‚Äù The Red Flower Camp readied themselves as though facing a great enemy at the sight of the myna bird.<br/>
<br/>
But the myna soon proved its identity and delivered the new orders.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi said, ‚ÄúWonderful‚Äîwe can withdraw now.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo told him further details.<br/>
<br/>
At once, Zhang Zhongyi‚Äôs favorable opinion of the myna bird plummeted, and his attitude flipped entirely. ‚ÄúTch! So you‚Äôre the filthy scum who refused to help when we were facing death.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
He glanced at the unconscious Mulan, sighing again. ‚ÄúThe Twin Rivers Nation‚Äôs court continues to suppress General Mu‚Äôs household.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, ‚ÄúMulan‚Äôs injuries have stabilized. The situation is urgent, so let‚Äôs get out of here and continue treatment on the way.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi and the Golden Core deputy generals all readily complied.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Camp‚Äôs retreat went quite smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
Nearing Wood Wheel Town, Ning Zhuo spotted the banners of the Three Generals Camp and the Barbarian-Demon Camp.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúHow come I don‚Äôt see the Golden Halberd Army?‚Äù he asked, puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
Dragon King Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The current Elephant King slammed open the palace doors and strode inside.<br/>
<br/>
His body was massive and imposing, so he nearly had to squeeze through the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
At his waist hung the head of a Nascent Soul cultivator, and in his right hand he dragged another Nascent Soul cultivator taken prisoner.<br/>
<br/>
That prisoner was none other than Sun Gan!<br/>
<br/>
The Elephant King heaved Sun Gan onto the floor tiles. With a murderous gleam in his eyes, he swept his gaze around the hall and spoke in a rumbling voice that filled the chamber: ‚ÄúThe Golden Halberd Army has been wiped out.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúWhere is the Elephant Vein Fostering Pill I was promised?‚Äù</div>
