<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Wu Chai stood among the crowd, watching Ning Zhuo speak, his eyes widening slightly in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">As a Qi Refining cultivator with exceptionally poor aptitude, he had barely managed to embark on the path of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Without family or mentors, he had stumbled upon a fragmented cultivation manual, which had inadvertently launched his cultivation journey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">After nearly a century of trials and tribulations, his cultivation remained stuck at the Qi Refining stage - its peak. This was the limit of his innate talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Yet Wu Chai refused to give up, even as he grew frail with age and his days dwindled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He had pawned every last possession, including his defensive and offensive Magic Artifacts, to scrape together enough money for a teleportation array ticket.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Reaching the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Main Mountain Gate required teleportation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Upon arrival, Wu Chai was practically penniless, unable to afford Spirit Food or rent a cave abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Fortunately, the Main Mountain Gate was a feng shui treasure land brimming with spiritual energy. Even an impoverished old cultivator like Wu Chai could survive by foraging for wild fruits and hunting in the wilderness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Throughout his life, Wu Chai had been plagued by misfortune. Despite living in an era of abundant resources and flourishing cultivation, he had never encountered any significant opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo claimed to have a lucrative business venture that required no upfront investment from them, immediately piquing everyone's interest. They turned to him with renewed enthusiasm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo proceeded to outline the entire plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">It was simple: he would provide the funds for them to rent cave abodes from the Hall of Internal Affairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">These cave abodes were all located on the same mountain peak as Stone Spring Cave Dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">When Yu Heye inevitably sent someone to evict them - just as the cultivator had offered Ning Zhuo ten mid-grade spirit stones to leave - the assembled cultivators would accept the offer, withdraw from the mountain, and then return to the Hall of Internal Affairs to cancel their leases and reclaim their rental fees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The profits would be split evenly. Ning Zhuo would recover his rental fees and keep five mid-grade spirit stones, while the others would share the remaining five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">After Ning Zhuo finished explaining his plan, someone immediately asked, "What if Yu Heye finds out?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo didn't conceal Yu Heye's involvement, plunging the entire group into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">No one was foolish enough to miss the truth: Ning Zhuo was clearly using them as pawns to provoke a Golden Core cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">If this Golden Core cultivator flew into a rage and retaliated, wouldn't they be risking their lives?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Of course, the Myriad Manifestations Sect's rules were clear: no matter how arrogant Yu Heye might be, he wouldn't dare kill anyone within the Sect's territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">But he was a Golden Core cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">With a single word, he could torment these low-level cultivators into a living hell, casting their lives into utter darkness. Their reactions were exactly as Ning Zhuo had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He smiled confidently, his voice ringing with certainty. "Gentlemen, money isn't earned so easily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"What kind of 'good fortune' would grant you five mid-grade spirit stones for nothing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"You will pay a price..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo was interrupted by Wu Chai's loud declaration: "I'll do it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Wu Chai had staked his entire fortune to teleport here, hoping to seize this final chance at the Flying Cloud Assembly to turn his life around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">But after wandering the mountain peaks these past few days, he had come to a grim realization: with his meager strength, he stood no chance of completing any missions. He was merely clinging to life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This opportunity was the only tangible chance he had encountered since arriving!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">What did it matter if he was being used?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">What did it matter if he antagonized a Golden Core cultivator?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">What did he have left to lose?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">If this succeeded, it would mean five mid-grade spirit stones!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">A full five mid-grade spirit stones!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo glanced at Wu Chai, noting his frail frame and snow-white hair. He nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The situation was proceeding more smoothly than he had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Excellent," Ning Zhuo praised immediately, producing a Jade Token before the crowd. "This token contains a portion of my spiritual energy, serving as proof of my Qi signature."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Take this to the nearest branch of the Hall of Internal Affairs and find a cultivator named Cao Gui."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"I've already arranged everything with him and paid a substantial deposit. He will guide you to the cave abode rental office."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The funds for renting the cave abode could not be entrusted to these people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The difference was stark: five mid-grade spirit stones versus dozens?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The disparity was obvious, and there was no guarantee that greed wouldn't cloud their judgment, leading them to abscond with the money on impulse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Cao Gui, on the other hand, was different. Ning Zhuo had carefully selected him through intelligence gathering and bound him with a Divine Contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">There was no need to bind these low-level cultivators with contracts - each contract carried significant value, representing a considerable cost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Wu Chai accepted the Jade Token and immediately released a withered yellow paper crane, which he mounted and swayed unsteadily away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After a moment of silence, a second and third cultivator stepped forward to claim their tokens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Soon, most of the cultivators had collected their Jade Tokens and began to move out. Only five or six, overcome by fear, withdrew voluntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This was no problem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo had anticipated such withdrawals and had recruited more cultivators than strictly necessary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Every cultivator he had gathered was in a similar predicament to Wu Chai: desperate circumstances, meager possessions. While five mid-grade spirit stones might not be a fortune, they were a timely rain to quench their parched lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Hehehe, Cousin, we're in for a good show," Su Lingkou said, her eyes gleaming as she witnessed the scene, eagerly anticipating the unfolding events. Liu Fu was the Foundation Establishment cultivator Yu Heye had dispatched to confront Ning Zhuo and "expel" him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"How many people did you say?" When Liu Fu learned that five new cultivators had suddenly appeared on his mountain peak and rented cave abodes together, he was momentarily stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The subordinate gave a clear report again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Liu Fu's brow furrowed. After a moment's thought, he asked, "Are these five working together?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The subordinate shook his head, indicating they didn't seem to be.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Liu Fu, his patience wearing thin, snapped, "Don't seem to be? You can't even confirm that? Get out and investigate thoroughly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Yes, sir!" The subordinate nodded hastily and retreated from the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Come back!" Liu Fu suddenly called out, changing his mind. "This matter... I'll have to handle it personally."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">A faint sense of unease stirred in Liu Fu's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He immediately set out, heading to the various cave abodes rented by the newcomers to negotiate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Wu Chai and his group were the first wave. Seeing Liu Fu arrive, they thought, Finally, he's here, and emerged from their cave abodes. Liu Fu bluntly offered ten mid-grade spirit stones to make the newcomers leave immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The newcomers cooperated readily, accepting the spirit stones. Some left immediately, while others even smiled and thanked him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Having resolved the matter, Liu Fu sighed in relief and returned to his residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">However, before long, a second group of cultivators arrived - again, five in number.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Liu Fu's pupils constricted sharply, his heart skipping a beat. "Damn it! Someone must be pulling strings behind the scenes, trying to make things difficult for me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">A crushing pressure weighed on Liu Fu's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Why?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The reason was simple: he had been skimming profits. Yu Heye paid twelve mid-grade spirit stones for each expulsion, but Liu Fu secretly pocketed two, reporting only ten.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">It was a small secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Even if exposed, Liu Fu had calculated that Yu Heye wouldn't care - it was such a trivial amount.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">On the contrary, if Yu Heye questioned or punished him, it would make the dignified Golden Core cultivator seem petty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">That was how it started.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">But gradually, as the number of expelled cultivators grew, so did the number of spirit stones Liu Fu secretly withheld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The small secret had imperceptibly morphed into a major one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Liu Fu was beginning to regret his actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The sheer quantity of spirit stones he had embezzled was becoming a hot potato. Yet he couldn't stop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The reason was simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">If he gave the newcomers twelve mid-grade spirit stones, what would the previous cultivators think if they found out?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Why?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">We were all expelled. Why should your status be higher than mine?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">We're all intelligent people. It's only natural we'd figure out the trickery - oh, Liu Fu had a hand in this. By acting this way, Liu Fu is practically confessing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He could only console himself inwardly: Endure, just endure a little longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Flying Cloud Assembly will officially begin soon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">By then, fewer people will remain ignorant of the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Soon, very soon...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">While Liu Fu eagerly awaited the Flying Cloud Assembly, Ning Zhuo's scheme began to unfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The first wave of five cultivators, followed by a second wave of five, made Liu Fu's heart skip a beat. He felt a sudden sense of foreboding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Someone is targeting me! Who is it? Who?! It wasn't difficult for Liu Fu to uncover the mastermind behind the plot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The low-level cultivators Ning Zhuo had manipulated were all greedy for money.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Liu Fu only needed to offer a couple of mid-grade spirit stones to make them talk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Ning Zhuo?" Liu Fu's brow furrowed in confusion. He had initially suspected a cultivator close to Yu Heye was behind the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The small faction surrounding Yu Heye wasn't limited to Liu Fu alone; others harbored their own petty schemes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Liu Fu racked his brain, only to realize he couldn't recall Ning Zhuo's face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He remembered there had been such a youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"A youth? Ah, a youth..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Couldn't swallow his pride, so he's seeking revenge?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Liu Fu smugly believed he had deciphered Ning Zhuo's motives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He immediately concocted an excuse to fly off the mountain peak, proactively sought out Ning Zhuo, and offered him a bribe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Liu Fu's message was simple: Take this money, kid. Stop causing trouble! I can speak for Yu Heye and promise no repercussions for your past actions. Young people get impulsive and make mistakes, after all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He still carried himself with considerable arrogance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Though they were both Foundation Establishment cultivators, Liu Fu had Yu Heye backing him. What does Ning Zhuo have? He's clearly just a newcomer here to try his luck and broaden his horizons at the Flying Cloud Assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Liu Fu's assumptions weren't entirely unfounded. The Flying Cloud Assembly had become a grand spectacle in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, drawing expectant gazes from across the nation - from major powers to minor factions, and even formidable cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo remained affable, then smiled and said he couldn't comply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Impossible? How could you possibly say it's impossible?" Liu Fu roared, his voice filled with displeasure. "You'll do it whether you want to or not!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He slammed his palm forcefully on the table, then stood up, towering over Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">A typical cultivator might have been intimidated by Liu Fu's imposing presence. But Ning Zhuo had faced even Soul Formation cultivators before - what fear could he have for a mere nobody of the same level?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">A wider, more sincere smile spread across Ning Zhuo's face, but his words dripped with defiance: "Guards! Send five people to rent cave abodes immediately!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Seeing Liu Fu's face flush crimson with fury, Ning Zhuo laughed heartily. "Oh, wait - make that ten!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Liu Fu's rage froze on his face. In that moment, he realized he couldn't easily intimidate Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"What do you want?!" Liu Fu hissed, his voice low and menacing, veins bulging on his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo's smile softened slightly as he pointed at Liu Fu. "Speak properly. Don't frighten my people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo wasn't speaking to Liu Fu alone; Qing Chi stood beside him. The young woman was a member of the Ghost-Human Clan. Liu Fu glanced at her dismissively, assuming she was merely Ning Zhuo's servant and paying her no further attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo, mindful of Qing Chi's amnesia and eager to care for her, decided to expose her to various experiences, using these events to teach the young woman the ways of navigating the Cultivation World.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Liu Fu braced his hands on the table, bowed his head, closed his eyes, and took several harsh breaths. Suppressing his inner rage, he snapped his eyes open again. "Ning... Young Master," he ground out through clenched teeth, "what do you want?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo rubbed his fingers together. "Offer me a thousand mid-grade spirit stones, and I'll drop the matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Liu Fu's eyes widened in disbelief. "Are you insane?!" he roared. "A thousand?! What do you take me for? A fool with deep pockets?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Is my head really that big?!" Ning Zhuo retorted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"A thousand... that does seem a bit excessive," Ning Zhuo conceded. "How about we cut it in half?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Liu Fu's eyes were now bloodshot as he calculated frantically. "Five hundred? If I pay that, I'll be losing money!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Even that price is unreasonable!" Liu Fu hissed, his voice barely above a whisper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"I'm not some pauper," Ning Zhuo replied. "Let's halve it again. But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo retrieved a letter. "This is my formal greeting to Senior Yu Heye," he said. "Please deliver it on my behalf. Rest assured, I won't report you to him. I simply wish to make his acquaintance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Liu Fu glanced at the greeting card, his expression shifting unpredictably as he struggled to decipher Ning Zhuo's intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Shouldn't ordinary cultivators be avoiding Yu Heye like the plague?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Why is this kid actively seeking confrontation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Doesn't he realize how easily a Foundation Establishment cultivator like him could be crushed by a Golden Core cultivator?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Liu Fu now understood that the greeting card was Ning Zhuo's true objective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">He gritted his teeth. "What do you really want?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly and shook his head. "You don't need to know."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Liu Fu took a deep breath, slowly reached out, and took the greeting card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Half an incense stick later, he knelt in Boulder Cave Mansion, his face flushed with shame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">His encounter with Ning Zhuo had made Liu Fu realize that the young man, despite his age, was not to be trifled with and harbored ulterior motives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">This realization filled Liu Fu with dread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">After agonizing over his situation, Liu Fu rushed back and confessed everything to Yu Heye, admitting his guilt. Yu Heye chuckled. "It's just a few hundred mid-grade Spirit Stones. Nothing to worry about."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">He glanced at the invitation in his hand, the very one Ning Zhuo had entrusted to Liu Fu for delivery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Burn it. A flame suddenly erupted from Yu Heye's palm, engulfing the invitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">He snorted coldly. "A mere Foundation Establishment youth dares to seek an audience with me? Does he presume he's already won?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Hmph, how naive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">He turned to Liu Fu. "Why do you think I keep you by my side, nurturing your talents?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"The group Ning Zhuo has gathered may be numerous, but their cultivation levels are pitifully low."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"You will challenge them collectively, using the Martial Arts Arena to your advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"Once these upstarts are restrained and taught a lesson, who would still bother renting cave abodes?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Yu Heye would never stoop to personally intervene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">As a dignified Golden Core cultivator, he couldn't possibly lower himself to target mere Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators. What would become of his reputation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">But the cultivators under his command could. They should step forward to address this situation and alleviate Yu Heye's concerns.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
