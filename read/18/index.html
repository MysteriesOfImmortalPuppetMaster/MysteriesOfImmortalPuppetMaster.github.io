<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 18: Fei Si[^1] Offers a Plan</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Two Golden Core cultivators flew to the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Chi Dun was covered in dust and had some minor injuries. Riding on a gray cloud, he snorted, “Fei Si! If you hadn’t stopped me from chasing that demonic cultivator, I would’ve caught him by now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The one he was arguing with was a bright-eyed, goateed old man wearing a yellow robe. His name was Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Fei Si snorted, “Reckless fool. You think I stopped you from chasing the demonic cultivator? No, I stopped you from destroying Fire Persimmon Forest!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The two continued their argument all the way to the City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Soon, the heavy clouds parted like a curtain, revealing the true visage of the City Lord. The man’s expression was calm; obviously, he was accustomed to his subordinates’ arguing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Fei Si and Chi Dun, one a scholar and the other a warrior, were the City Lord’s right and left hands. However, they had always been at odds with each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">After Chi Dun paid his respects, he immediately started complaining. He accused Fei Si of failing to cooperate, instead preventing him from continuing his pursuit. This obstruction had allowed the black shadow demonic cultivator to slip into Fire Persimmon Forest and left them with no choice but to seal the forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Fei Si immediately offered a rebuttal: “Reckless fool! Fire Persimmon Forest is incredibly valuable and has been nurtured since the city’s founding. It took dozens of generations and hundreds of years of hard work for it to reach its current scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Fire persimmons are highly explosive. Fighting in Fire Persimmon Forest would definitely set off a chain of explosions. At that point, our Fire Persimmon Immortal City’s greatest industry would be completely wiped out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“More than half of the immortal city’s annual income comes from Fire Persimmon Forest. It can even be said that the profits from Fire Persimmon Forest sustain the entire city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Is your own task all you can think about? If Fire Persimmon Forest is destroyed, what will Sir City Lord say to the Southern Bean Royal Court?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Long, long ago, Three Schools Supreme Sage hid Lava Immortal Palace deep inside Fire Persimmon Mountain, suppressing the volcano’s eruptions and turning the area from a wasteland to a blessed land.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Later on – still hundreds of years before the present – Southern Bean Immortal Dynasty took a fancy to this place and sent a Nascent Soul cultivator to build an immortal city here. A great formation was laid down around the immortal city, absorbing the power of the earth and the fire-element spirit energy here and nurturing Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Fire Persimmon Forest was extremely profitable, and the immortal city became known as Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The annual harvest of fire persimmons also turned into a festival unique to Fire Persimmon Immortal City – the Fire Persimmon Festival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">On the day of the festival, all the cultivators in the city would head over to the forest to pick fire persimmons. At that time, the whole city would be filled with joy and laughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Chi Dun’s neck stiffened. After shooting a glare at Fei Si, he opened his mouth to continue speaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">However, the City Lord interrupted him: “Enough. Are there any results from your interrogation of those survivors?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Chi Dun bowed and presented a booklet with the recorded confessions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The City Lord didn’t move as the confession booklet slowly floated in front of him. A gust of wind blew, flipping the pages rapidly from beginning to end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">As a Nascent Soul cultivator with mighty divine sense, the City Lord only needed a few breaths of time to read everything inside the booklet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">There was nothing of note.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Chi Dun asked, “Sir City Lord, that demonic cultivator is now hiding inside Fire Persimmon Forest. What should we do?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The City Lord’s divine sense moved and returned the confession booklet to Chi Dun’s hands. He calmly said, “What do you think we should do?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Chi Dun’s brows furrowed. Hesitantly, he said, “Fire Persimmon Forest is extremely important. This subordinate believes that it’s best to report this upward and let the Southern Bean Immortal Court send down an expert to take care of things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“As long as they throw down a handful of red beans, we’ll have Red Scarf Warriors to lead the charge. This would greatly reduce any casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Or, we could directly ask for someone from the Divine Investigation Bureau to come and catch the demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Cultivators of the Divine Investigation Bureau know the Clear Heart Warning Art and the Source Tracing Magic. Any of them would be better than me at hunting down the culprit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">No expression could be seen on the City Lord’s face. He glanced at Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Fei Si immediately understood his meaning and shouted, “Reckless idiot! If you call the Divine Investigation Bureau over, there’ll be nothing left for us to do!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“We’ve already negotiated in secret with the Zhou Clan and Zheng Clan. If we suddenly report to the higher ups, how will we answer to them?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“That would be crossing the line!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“When Sir City Lord takes charge again in the future, how will the local cultivation clans dare to trust him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“As the governing power, we must maintain a harmonious relationship with the local cultivation clans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“We can’t be villains and go back on our words!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Fei Si’s refutation was full of emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">However, there was also something he hadn’t said –</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Lava Immortal Palace had been discovered after the current City Lord took office. According to regulations, the City Lord should have reported it immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">But at that time, the Zhou Clan and Zheng Clan brought over a huge sum of money to dissuade him, and the City Lord himself bore ambitions toward the immortal palace’s treasures. Thus, he concealed the news and didn’t report it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Originally, the three parties had peacefully explored in secret. The Ning Clan’s eventual discovery of the Lava Immortal Palace was also expected, and they had already been prepared to accept this new collaborator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">But now, an accident had occurred – someone had bombed the Lava Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">It was all the fault of that damn black shadow demonic cultivator! The previously harmonious situation had now taken a turn for the worse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Lava Immortal Palace almost completely emerged, only barely being suppressed by the City Lord taking personal action. And even so, the selection standard had lowered to the Qi Refining stage, and the sound of the Technique Transmission Bell had echoed far and wide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Although the City Lord had immediately issued orders to cover things up and captured those at the scene, the news had already leaked. It was no longer possible to hide things from the Southern Bean royal family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">If the City Lord had already obtained the treasures of the Lava Immortal Palace, he wouldn’t care at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">But as of now, he hadn’t gotten any benefits at all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Losing the palace to the immortal dynasty was already inevitable. But how could the City Lord be willing to just give up like this? Now, he could only go all in on exploring the immortal palace in order to at least reap some benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Chi Dun knew he couldn’t beat Fei Si in this argument, so he simply spread his hands helplessly and said that the task was too difficult for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Fei Si sneered. “How could a reckless fool like you possibly come up with a solution? In the end, it’s up to me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The City Lord looked at Fei Si and said lightly, "Fei Si, if you have any ideas, just tell me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Fei Si had already prepared a strategy. Smiling, he said, “Sir, this subordinate thinks that what we should do now is… do nothing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“The black shadow demonic cultivator’s target is very obvious – the Lava Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Last time, he wanted to enter the immortal palace, but was obstructed by Zheng Shuanggou. This time, he appeared near the dungeon. Why?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“On the surface, it’s because he wanted to destroy the formation pillar beneath the dungeon.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">There were five formation pillars in Fire Immortal Persimmon City’s grand formation, located in the Zhou Clan, the Zheng Clan, the Ning Clan, the dungeon, and the barracks. Destroying these pillars would destabilize the grand formation and endanger the whole city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“However, that wasn’t his true aim!” Fei Si’s eyes shone with confidence as he laid out his analysis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Most likely, he exposed himself on purpose, luring Chi Dun into chasing him and ultimately aiming to trick Sir City Lord over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“In the end, that demonic cultivator hid in Fire Persimmon Forest. It seemed like it was a panicked decision when he was at the end of his rope, but the reality of the situation is quite different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Fire persimmons are highly explosive, and there are many formations in Fire Persimmon Forest. Why would he choose to hide in there?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Right now, Fire Persimmon Forest’s sealing formations have all been activated, leaving the black shadow demonic cultivator trapped like a bird in a cage or a fish in a jar. However, I am inclined to think that he is merely trying to attract our attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“This subordinate would like to present my bold conjecture: That black shadow demonic cultivator is just bait. There are others hiding where we can’t see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Once we muster our forces to encircle him, the crater will be left empty and exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Our enemy’s situation is unclear. We don’t know how many allies they have hiding in the dark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“We can’t rule out the possibility that the three major clans are accomplices to the demonic cultivator, or even… the true masterminds behind the scenes!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Chi Dun’s mouth hung open slightly as his eyes went blank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
