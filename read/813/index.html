<paragraph index="1">The gray-robed cultivator took a deep breath, fished a gray cloth bag from his bosom, and carefully untied the drawstring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Elder Sun, please take a look." He took out three items and lined them up on the stone table. "These are items I have treasured for many years. I am willing to offer them as compensation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The first item consisted of several fragments of crystal interwoven with azure and purple. Thin as a cicada's wing, they shimmered faintly in the dim underground cavern, emitting the faint sound of wind and thunder. This was Wind Thunder Mica.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The second item was a section of dark red vine, as thick as a child's arm. Its surface bore scale-like patterns, and a pale golden liquid oozed from the cut end. It was known as Earth Dragon Blood Vine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The third item was a piece of dark azure wood with silver speckles. When tapped, it produced a faint thunderous sound. It was confirmed to be Thunder Clamor Iron Wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">All three materials were at the Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Wind Thunder Mica can be used to refine Wind Thunder Wings; Earth Dragon Blood Vine can be crafted into an Earth Dragon Whip; and Thunder Clamor Iron Wood is a high-grade main material for lightning-attribute magical artifacts." The gray-robed cultivator introduced them one by one, a hint of reluctance in his tone. "These three items combined are enough to show my sincerity, Elder Sun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sun Lingtong sent a divine sense transmission through the Life Hanging by a Thread ability, contacting Ning Zhuo: "Hehe, Little Zhuo, take a look at these precious materials for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Every time Sun Lingtong visited the black market, Ning Zhuo would provide protection. At the first sign of trouble, the latter could use the Spirit Communication Mirror to help Sun Lingtong escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">At this very moment, Ning Zhuo was constantly observing everything around Sun Lingtong through the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The two had been coordinating like this for some time, always acting with caution and prudence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Sun Lingtong knew that Ning Zhuo's attainments in artifact refining had improved significantly, surpassing his own. Just as Ning Zhuo often asked for his help, he now invited Ning Zhuo to assist him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo observed carefully, formed an opinion, and told Sun Lingtong: "Boss, first pick up a piece of the Wind Thunder Mica. Transmit your five senses, especially your sense of touch, to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Remember, the Wind Thunder Mica is currently in a restrained, stored state. Handle it gently; you only need to pinch the edge lightly with your thumb and index finger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong nodded inwardly. "Alright."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">On the surface, he glanced at it expressionlessly, then reached out and pinched a piece of the mica.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Just seeing Sun Lingtong's gesture made the gray-robed cultivator's heart sink, realizing he had encountered an expert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong closed his eyes and focused for a moment, then suddenly sneered: " The vein patterns on the edge of your Wind Thunder Mica are broken, and the thunder sound is weak. Its origin source must have been damaged by astral winds during collection. It is not a top-quality piece."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He then picked up the Earth Dragon Blood Vine, sniffed it at the tip of his nose, and pinched the surface to make it ooze liquid. "Pale gold liquid? The liquid of a genuine Earth Dragon Blood Vine should be dark gold, smelling fishy yet sweet. Why do I smell a trace of pangolin essence blood? Was this vine artificially ripened using that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The gray-robed cultivator's heart sank further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Finally, Sun Lingtong tapped the Thunder Clamor Iron Wood: "I see five strikes at most. The power of thunder within the wood is thin; there are only five thunder echoes. A true high-grade piece is struck by lightning nine times!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sun Lingtong placed the three items back on the table and stared at the gray-robed cultivator. "You try to fool me with these defective goods? do you really think this old man has lived in vain all these years?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The gray-robed cultivator's heart hit rock bottom. He hadn't expected Sun Lingtong's eyes to be so sharp, capable of accurately judging the quality of every material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">In reality, this was Ning Zhuo observing remotely through Sun Lingtong's senses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong had once managed the black market in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, but he hadn't come into contact with many Nascent Soul-level treasures. The main reason was that Fire Persimmon Immortal City was a new city; the Fire Persimmon Mountain hadn't been developed, and the market hadn't truly scaled up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Fire Persimmon Immortal City had always been caught in the fierce game between the Meng and Zhu families. Developing the Immortal City itself wasn't their priority.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">This situation was actually beneficial for Sun and Ning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">If the black market had truly reached a large scale, it wouldn't have been left for a small Foundation Establishment cultivator like him to control, even with Sun Lingtong's connections in the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">In the cavern, the gray-robed cultivator did not panic. Realizing he couldn't fulfill the transaction, he had spent days meticulously preparing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Throwing out three precious materials first was merely a probing move he had designed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Elder Sun, please quell your anger. T-this was just an appetizer." The gray-robed cultivator hurriedly smiled apologetically and took a jade box from his bosom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The jade box opened to reveal three pills the size of pigeon eggs. They were purple throughout, with cloud patterns swirling on their surface. With just one breath, Sun Lingtong smelled a refreshing fragrance that rushed into his face, revitalizing his spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Purple Prefecture Vitality Nurturing Pills, three of them!" The gray-robed cultivator lowered his voice. "Specifically used by Foundation Establishment stage cultivators to consolidate their Purple Prefecture. It can increase spiritual consciousness by ten percent. If three pills are taken consecutively, even with drug resistance, it is enough to increase the spiritual consciousness strength of a cultivator who hasn't taken them before by twenty-five percent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong's heart stirred slightly, and he couldn't help but think: Little Zhuo hasn't eaten this kind of pill yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Although he had a master and came from a super sect, he had been a rogue cultivator wandering outside and hadn't taken this kind of pill either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But when facing such situations, Sun Lingtong always thought of Ning Zhuo first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He had watched Ning Zhuo grow up; their bond was extraordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Little Zhuo, what do you think?" Sun Lingtong asked Ning Zhuo secretly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo observed carefully but couldn't tell much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In alchemy, although his foundation was solid, his realm was only at the Artisan level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Among the four major cultivation arts, he had only reached the Renowned Artisan level in artifact refining. The other three were all at the Artisan level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Faced with a mid-range pill like the Purple Prefecture Vitality Nurturing Pill, it was normal for Ning Zhuo to be unable to distinguish its quality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo: "Boss, I can't tell anything. Sigh, I haven't learned enough yet. Give me some time; with the help of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, I should be able to bring my alchemy skills up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">But in fact, this was Ning Zhuo's greatest predicament - he really didn't have enough time!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Lingtong understood Ning Zhuo's situation well, so he wasn't surprised by the response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He couldn't see anything wrong either, but he still had a way to deal with it. Immediately, he took just one glance and said, "The heat was thirty percent too high during refining; at least twenty percent of the medicinal potency has been lost."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He shook his head slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Gray-robed cultivator: "..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He didn't know either!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sun Lingtong didn't evaluate the pill fragrance or the pill patterns; he only spoke of the refining heat and medicinal potency. These things were implicit, and hard to measure unless one was an alchemist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong was gambling that the gray-robed cultivator had no significant achievements in alchemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He won the bet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Gritting his teeth, the gray-robed cultivator took out another porcelain bottle. "Then add this, Blood Jade Bone-Knitting Ointment! This is a holy item for healing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Sun Lingtong took the porcelain bottle, opened it to smell, then used his fingernail to pick up a bit of the ointment, rubbing and observing it at his fingertips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He repeated his old trick: "Insufficient amount of Jade Bone Glue, mixed with ordinary beast bone powder. The Blood Jade Ginseng isn't old enough; the medicinal potency is greatly discounted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He shook his head again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The gray-robed cultivator's face turned dark, but ultimately, he did not refute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Seeing this reaction twice in a row, Sun Lingtong knew his gamble had paid off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">And this wasn't just a blind gamble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Sun Lingtong's logic was: Since the gray-robed cultivator was selling demonic souls in the black market and doing gray business, he obviously didn't have any presentable skills in the hundred cultivation arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">If he truly had strong alchemy abilities, why wouldn't he refine pills to sell?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Why take such risks?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The gray-robed cultivator stared at Sun Lingtong, a look of suspicion flashing in his eyes. "Elder Sun, your standards are too high. I thought everything I brought out was good stuff, but in your eyes, they are all defective goods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Elder Sun, you aren't trying to bankrupt me, are you?" He spoke jokingly, but upon careful reflection, there was a trace of threat in his tone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Sun Lingtong's experience in dealing with such situations was simply too rich.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The gray-robed cultivator did gray business; Sun Lingtong used to manage exactly this sector.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Sun Lingtong's face immediately became stern, his tone icy: "You were the one who broke the contract first! Either bring out the real goods or suffer the backlash of the Divine Contract. Choose for yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">When he acted tougher, the gray-robed cultivator predictably retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He took several deep breaths, his expression struggling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After a long time, he took out a palm-sized cold jade bottle from his bosom. The jade bottle was cold to the touch, with fine water droplets condensing on its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"This item... I originally prepared for myself." The gray-robed cultivator's voice trembled slightly. "But since things have come to this, I can only bring it out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He carefully pulled out the stopper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">In an instant, a refreshing aura filled the secret chamber, and a faint lotus fragrance floated in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"This is Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew." The gray-robed cultivator enunciated each word. "It is a rare treasure that assists in breaking through realms and resisting Heart Demons. After taking it, one can enter a state of clarity that is 'illusionary yet real' for two hours. This small bottle contains thirty drops. One drop per use. This isn't something easily bought on the market!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Items that could resist Heart Demons were all good things. In the market, demand had always exceeded supply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">And the Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew could not only resist Heart Demons but also assist in breaking through realms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">When cultivators crossed a major realm, they feared the interference of Heart Demons the most. With the assistance of this dew, the success rate could increase by more than thirty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo's divine thought immediately transmitted to Sun Lingtong's mind: "Boss, aren't you about to break through to the Golden Core stage? This is very suitable for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"This item is indeed difficult to refine and hard to preserve." Sun Lingtong took the cold jade bottle and carefully observed the liquid inside. "This bottle of yours... is actually not bad."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The gray-robed cultivator heaved a sigh of relief. "Elder Sun has good eyes. I spent years sucking up to an Alchemy Master within the sect, maintaining the relationship and racking my brains to commission just this one bottle. I originally planned to use it when attacking a bottleneck. Now... sigh, as long as Elder Sun agrees to dissolve the contract, this dew belongs to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Although the gray-robed cultivator was at the Golden Core level, his cultivation had encountered a bottleneck. Using the Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew would have a good auxiliary effect, but success wasn't guaranteed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">There was also a possibility that the gray-robed cultivator couldn't bear to use it on a small bottleneck and might be saving it for greater difficulties in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Pills and spirit food were different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Taking too many pills would lead to drug resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Often, the first time had the best effect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Alchemy Master?" Sun Lingtong secretly noted this clue. This could help him find the gray-robed cultivator's true identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">As the two communicated more, such clues would increase. Eventually, with enough accumulation, Sun Lingtong would be able to uncover the gray-robed cultivator's identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Currently, Sun Lingtong guessed that the gray-robed cultivator was very likely an insider of the Demon Subjugation Hall. Otherwise, where did these demonic cultivator souls come from?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Little Zhuo is appreciated by Zhong Dao of the Demon Subjugation Hall and will likely join it in the future. This gray-robed cultivator might be useful to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">It wasn't just Wen Ruanyu paving the way for Ning Zhuo; Sun Lingtong was doing the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo also secretly kept the information about the "Alchemy Master" in mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"The Master level is a tier higher than the Renowned Artisan. Does this mean that the Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew can only be created by an alchemist at the Master level?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"In the future, if I become an Alchemy Master and obtain the recipe, could I also make it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">From this point alone, the value of the Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew was evident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">However, Sun Lingtong still shook his head: "This old man reached the limit of his aptitude long ago. Breaking through? Heh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">With one lie, Sun Lingtong knocked off half the value of the Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He continued, "If we're talking about resisting Heart Demons, I have other pills and magic treasures that can deal with that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This remark suppressed the other half of the Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew's value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Hearing that things were going south, the gray-robed cultivator hurriedly reached out to stop him and interjected, "Elder Sun, you underestimate the value of this item. I might as well tell you a secret!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"The Demon Subjugation Hall's upcoming second minor trial has been upgraded in specification compared to the past. The difficulty and rewards have both increased accordingly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"And the Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew can help cultivators achieve better results in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Oh?" Sun Lingtong hurriedly pursued the topic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"That is all I can say. That is all." The gray-robed cultivator was unwilling to say more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sun Lingtong thought, "Little Zhuo is about to participate in the second minor trial; I didn't expect this surprise harvest! I must secure this bottle of Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">On the surface, Sun Lingtong pondered aloud, "If I resell this item to others, with this news, it might indeed sell for a premium..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The gray-robed cultivator nodded repeatedly. "Exactly so, exactly so!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"I'll accept this bottle of Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew." Sun Lingtong put the cold jade bottle into his bosom. "But it's not enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo chuckled in his azure stone cave dwelling. He knew Sun Lingtong's methods well; how could the gray-robed cultivator be let off so easily after being targeted by him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Not enough?!" The gray-robed cultivator almost jumped up. "Elder Sun, one shouldn't be too greedy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Unexpectedly, Sun Lingtong waved his hand. "This bottle of Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew is decent, but I didn't care for any of the other things from before!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">This sentence revealed Sun Lingtong's high standards, which implied that his own rank and strength were also high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"He looks like a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but that must be fake. Golden Core? Or... Nascent Soul?" The gray-robed cultivator couldn't help but speculate, becoming more discouraged the more he thought about it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Sun Lingtong stared at the gray-robed cultivator, using his gaze to show his determination and pressure the other party. "I only barely consider the Illusionary Heart Clarity Dew acceptable, perhaps to build good karma with some young talent joining the Demon Subjugation Hall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"You have to realize, you were the one who broke the contract first!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"How did you guarantee me the first time? And how swore on it the second time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"You've wasted too much of my time and disrupted my entire plan. Can these small items make up for those losses?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Then what do you want?!" The gray-robed cultivator's voice carried a tone of despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Sun Lingtong was silent for a moment, then suddenly said, "Bring out your real family assets. Something that can truly move me - in other words, hard currency in the market."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Aside from that, don't try to fob me off with other things! It's useless!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The gray-robed cultivator lowered his head and gritted his teeth. After a long silence, he used a trembling hand to take out a jade talisman from close to his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He channeled a sliver of spiritual power into the jade talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Buzz!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Dense silver patterns suddenly surfaced on the jade talisman. These patterns twisted and shifted, finally forming a complex talisman seal that emitted a dense aura of the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Small Teleportation Talisman." Sun Lingtong nodded slightly, his tone sounding somewhat satisfied. "It can teleport one to any location within a range of ten to fifty li. This kind of life-saving item has always had a price but no market."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Now that's more like it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"This is sincerity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He reached out, grabbed one side of the jade talisman, and tried to pull it over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The gray-robed cultivator subconsciously gripped it tight, not letting go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Hm?" Sun Lingtong's expression changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The gray-robed cultivator's body trembled, and he had no choice but to let go, allowing Sun Lingtong to take the Small Teleportation Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Pain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">It hurt too much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The gray-robed cultivator was indeed a member of the Demon Subjugation Hall. Because of this, he fought constantly and traveled outside, facing high risks. He understood the value of such a life-saving item perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Now that it was taken by Sun Lingtong, it was equivalent to cutting off one of his escape routes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Elder Sun..." his voice was hoarse. "Now, can we dissolve the contract?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Sun Lingtong put away the Small Teleportation Talisman but still shook his head. "Still not enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"You!" The gray-robed cultivator clenched his fists abruptly, his eyes bloodshot. "Elder Sun! Don't go too far! I've given everything I have. What more do you want? Do you want my life?! If you have the guts, come and take it!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Don't get excited, don't get excited." Sun Lingtong took out a handful of Ghost Path Golden Cores. "Here, take these."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Disregarding everything else, he handed them directly over and let go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The gray-robed cultivator subconsciously reached out to catch them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Sun Lingtong smiled. "They're all for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The gray-robed cultivator was dumbfounded: ??!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Sun Lingtong smiled again. "Our business must continue."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">The gray-robed cultivator shuddered violently, as if a venomous snake had bitten his vitals. "No, no, no, you should take these back, Elder!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">He hurriedly tried to shove the Golden Cores back to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">He didn't dare do business anymore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Today, he had thoroughly experienced Sun Lingtong's formidability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">The Elder Sun before him was unfathomable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">He couldn't be provoked!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">I don't want any involvement with you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Sun Lingtong took a step back and naturally did not take them back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">The Ghost Path Golden Cores were freezing cold in his palm, but the gray-robed cultivator felt like he was holding burning coals; they were simply too hot to handle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">His eyes even revealed a pleading look, as if saying: "Please let me go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">How could that be possible?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">"Little brother." Sun Lingtong patted the gray-robed cultivator on the shoulder, his friendly smile making the latter tremble again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">"We need to settle our accounts clearly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">"The things I accepted are just compensation for your failure to fulfill your promise. Since I accepted them, it means I accept that settlement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">"But our business still needs to go on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">The gray-robed cultivator opened his mouth to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Sun Lingtong waved his hand directly. "Next, I won't force you to obtain Qin De's soul. In fact, I only requested the soul of a Confucian cultivator. Think back carefully - is that correct?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">The gray-robed cultivator was stunned for a moment, then nodded. "That is true. But the content of our Divine Contract specifically concerns Qin De."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Sun Lingtong spread his hands. "That's not my fault. You were the one who actively set it that way when we signed the Divine Contract. You were very confident, and I believed you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Thump, thump, thump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">The gray-robed cultivator immediately pounded his own head with his fist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">Regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">He regretted it so much!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">"Wait, I seem to remember that when signing the Divine Contract, your attitude was very firm, Elder Sun..." The gray-robed cultivator tried to recall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">Sun Lingtong interrupted again. "Don't think about the past; that's not important."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">"What's important is that I don't intend to dissolve the Divine Contract. What can you do to me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">The gray-robed cultivator opened his mouth slightly, staring blankly at Sun Lingtong. There was anger, but even more helplessness and dejection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">"The Divine Contract remains," Sun Lingtong said slowly. "I have always been very interested in acquiring souls. Look, you do a great job in this line of business."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">The gray-robed cultivator felt a chill in his heart as he deeply scrutinized the old man before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">Not a good person!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">Most buyers bought one or two at a time; this old cultivator before him bought a whole batch at once and had cleared out his stock twice in a row.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="349">How could such a cultivator be a good person?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="351">He must be a great demonic cultivator who uses souls for cultivation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="353">"I have my principles when I do things." Sun Lingtong said indifferently. "You broke the contract first, so you must pay what is due. But this old man is never aggressive. Regarding the business between us, I'm determined to continue it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="355">"Keeping the Divine Contract is just a form of insurance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="357">"You should be able to understand what I mean."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="359">Sun Lingtong firmly held the initiative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="361">"Elder Sun..." The gray-robed cultivator opened his mouth, still wanting to argue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="363">"Shut up." Sun Lingtong's expression became even more indifferent, bordering on heartless. "Show me your goods for this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="365">The gray-robed cultivator stared blankly for a few breaths, then exhaled a breath of turbid air. With a numb expression, completely devoid of vitality, he said, "Please take a look, Elder."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="367">Sun Lingtong swept his divine sense over the numerous clay jars, his tone surprised: "There's actually a Nascent Soul-level soul?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
