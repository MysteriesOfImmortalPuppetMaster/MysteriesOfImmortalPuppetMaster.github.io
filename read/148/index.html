<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 148: The City Lord's Mansion Strikes with Full Force</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"We pay our respects to Young Master Meng Chong!" Sixteen cultivators greeted in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Their cultivation levels were uniform, all at the peak of the third layer of Qi Refining Stage, practicing the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Standing beside Meng Chong, Fei Si timely introduced, "Young Master Meng Chong, let me introduce them to you. Many of them were personally recruited by me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"This is Li Duolun, skilled in using serrated wheels to attack and kill enemies. When designing new mechanical constructs, he likes to use interlocking wheels." Li Duolun stepped forward and cupped his hands towards Meng Chong, "I am willing to serve Young Master Meng Chong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He was a tall, fat man with a kind face, reminiscent of a Buddha statue in a temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Fei Si continued, "This is Feng Feidao. His design of the flying knife sleeve crossbow is extremely exquisite, capable of shooting more than ten flying knives at once. Each flying knife can further split into four or five, forming an array in the air to slice the enemy into pieces." Meng Chong looked at Feng Feidao, who was a short man in a warrior's outfit, masked, with a pair of small, sharp eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Feng Feidao knelt on one knee, expressing his loyalty to Meng Chong, "I am willing to go through fire and water for Young Master Meng Chong!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Fei Si finally introduced, "This is Guan Tiesuo. His specialty is controlling a large number of magnetic lock mechanisms that climb onto the target, interlocking to form iron chains that completely bind the enemy, making it impossible for them to move."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Guan Tiesuo spoke in a deep voice, "I have met Young Master Meng Chong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Li Duolun, Feng Feidao, and Guan Tiesuo were the most outstanding leaders in the City Lord's Mansion's Reformation Team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Fei Si had put in considerable effort to recruit them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Finding cultivators at the Qi Refining Stage with a certain level of mechanical construct expertise was not easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Mechanical constructs were difficult to learn and master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Most Qi Refining Stage cultivators with the means would choose alchemy, artifact refining, or array formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Those without the means would opt for farming, fishing, or hunting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Mechanical constructs were considered a niche skill in the myriad arts of cultivation, rarely chosen unless by chance or necessity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Good," Meng Chong nodded, "Next, we will explore the Immortal Palace together. It's simple, when I charge, you follow me." Meng Chong had no command ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Fei Si coughed twice, reminding, "While numbers bring strength, they also have drawbacks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"According to our current knowledge, the difficulty of the Lava Immortal Palace's trials adjusts based on the number and strength of participants. With our large group, it's likely we will attract mechanical apes, increasing the trial's difficulty. It's even possible multiple mechanical apes will attack us simultaneously."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"If that happens, you must protect Young Master Meng Chong at all costs. Even if it means using your bodies, you must distract the mechanical apes to create opportunities for Young Master Meng Chong!" "Understood!" The Reformation Team responded in unison, resolute in their obedience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The City Lord's Mansion had informants in all three families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The intelligence about the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng blocking the three families' geniuses in Room Two had already been obtained by the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Therefore, Fei Si attributed Yuan Dasheng's appearance to the Lava Immortal Palace's trial difficulty adjustment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Meng Chong suddenly said, "Wait!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"If that mechanical ape appears, none of you are to intervene. I will handle it personally. Do you understand?" The Reformation Team members exchanged glances, then looked at Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Fei Si smiled slightly, "Since Young Master Meng Chong has said so, you should obey." "Yes," they responded again, but this time their voices were noticeably weaker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Some exchanged glances, clearly skeptical of Meng Chong's decision to fight alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Do you understand anything?" Fei Si thought disdainfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Meng Chong's decisions came from his heart, driven by his nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Each action allowed him to further unleash his nature and deepen his understanding of his immortal potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Since exploring the Immortal Palace, Meng Chong had repeatedly fought and improved significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"And he is far ahead of the geniuses from the three families!" Fei Si, unaware of the truth, always believed Meng Chong was the first, holding a significant advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Especially after Meng Chong recently shared the ranking information with Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Fei Si asked some questions, including whether names could be changed, and was misled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Young Master Meng Chong has limitless potential. The City Lord's foresight is profound. At this rate, he will surely take control of the Lava Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"The only concern is Zhu Xuanji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"This person colludes with the three families, stirring up trouble, and enters the Immortal Palace under the guise of investigating the truth. Even Lord Meng Kui cannot openly stop him. It's quite troublesome..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The righteous path follows the rules of the game.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Direct confrontation is the style of the demonic path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Family Territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">In Ning Gui's cultivation chamber, Ning Zhuo was practicing almost manically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He was surrounded by dense clouds, thick like cotton, enveloping him completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He lit incense to aid his spirit, meditated on the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, his face serene and peaceful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He tilted his head back, pouring exquisite spiritual food into his throat, swallowing large mouthfuls while practicing the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sitting cross-legged on a mat, he actively circulated the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, using the Ice Light Strong Pulse Talisman and Sharp Advancement Needle to boldly open new meridians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">While Zhong Chong, Zheng Jian, and Ning Xiaohui were stuck at the peak of the third layer of Qi Refining Stage, Ning Zhuo's Qi Refining cultivation had reached the late fifth layer, his essence cultivation had broken through to the sixth layer, and his spirit cultivation had advanced to the late sixth layer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Since understanding the embryonic form of the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability, each spirit cultivation session has been exceptionally effective, without any bottlenecks, smooth sailing. The Demonic Blood Vein Technique quickly broke through to the sixth layer, thanks to my relentless consumption of large amounts of spiritual food and various elixirs. Ironically, the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, which I started with, has fallen behind, only at the late fifth layer. Even with the Ice Light Strong Pulse Talisman and Sharp Advancement Needle, it's the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Unfortunately, to be safe, I can't use the Zhou Family's Gathering and Dispersing Wishful Spirit Stream Formation. Using that formation might push my magical power cultivation to the sixth layer." Ning Zhuo thought of the message from the Ning Family's upper echelon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Ning Family's ancestor personally decreed to heavily support the Ning Family's Reformation Team, providing more unique and excellent cultivation resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Three bottles of White Snow Spring Elixir for the entire Reformation Team as a baseline. With such excellent healing elixirs, there's no fear of injuries from rapid cultivation. Two Insight Diagrams are also good. If I can comprehend the Proud Snow Technique or the Lingxiang Technique, these two techniques naturally align with the Five Elements Qi, requiring no modification. The most crucial is the Ice Heart Jade Pot!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"This is the Ning Family's treasured artifact, capable of brewing Ice Heart Jade Liquid Wine, or Ice Jade Wine for short."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"After consuming this wine, it can use spirit treasures to enhance qi treasures, supplementing qi with spirit, making it the best cultivation resource for the Ice Heart Technique." The main lineage of the Ning Family all practiced the Ice Heart Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">This technique, when mastered, often led to calmness, even coldness, without any emotional fluctuations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">As the saying goes: "Frost like a knife, the ice heart grinds the mirror. Guard the heart like ice, no evil can invade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The accumulation speed of the Ice Heart Technique's magical power was not as fast as most top-tier techniques, but its strength in spirit cultivation was unparalleled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Relying on Ice Jade Wine could let spirit cultivation drive qi cultivation, perfectly compensating for the technique's flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Although I practice the Five Elements Qi, Ice Jade Wine is also very suitable for me." Ning Zhuo's spirit cultivation far surpassed his magical cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Drinking Ice Jade Wine could elevate his magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Of course, the effect of Ice Jade Wine was best for those practicing the Ice Heart Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The purpose of this spiritual wine was to compensate for the slow accumulation of magical power in Ice Heart Technique practitioners.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The same resource has different effects and values for different cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">For this, Ning Zhuo felt fortunate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">If not for the four families competing over the Lava Immortal Palace, how could a marginal figure from a branch family like Ning Zhuo access the Ning Family's core cultivation resources?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Not to mention the Insight Diagrams, even the Ice Light Strong Pulse Talisman would be out of reach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Now, Ning Zhuo only needed to perform the best to qualify for Ice Jade Wine!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Under normal circumstances, Ice Jade Wine was only sufficiently supplied to Golden Core ancestors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">All other main lineage members, including the family head, had to wait in line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">How could it be Ning Zhuo's turn?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Hmm?" Ning Zhuo took a moment to observe the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Yuan Dasheng had been left in the Lava Immortal Palace, as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Through Yuan Dasheng's perspective, Ning Zhuo noticed the City Lord's Mansion's significant move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Led by Meng Chong, the Reformation Team, with a total of seventeen members, entered the Immortal Palace together, marching with high morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"The City Lord's Mansion? What a grand gesture." Ning Zhuo was secretly amazed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Currently, the three families combined could barely gather sixteen people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The City Lord's Mansion alone brought out sixteen, showing their long preparation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Meng Kui, such a wise strategist, indeed had deep plans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"With the City Lord's Mansion so strong, no wonder the three families had to unite and grow increasingly cohesive." Ning Zhuo sighed while controlling the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng to notify Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Sun Lingtong's soul was still in the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Being at the Foundation Establishment Stage, his soul was strong enough to last two or three days without issue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sun Lingtong was currently hiding in a preparation room, using various mechanical tools to modify himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Sun Lingtong's mechanical construct skills were also not low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo had shared his mother's mechanical construct books with Sun Lingtong when they were young.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Sun Lingtong, eager to reunite with his master, had always been diligent and serious in learning mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He was naturally talented, with high comprehension ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Thus, Sun Lingtong's mechanical construct skills, though not as advanced as Ning Zhuo's, far exceeded the standard for entering the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Receiving the report from Da Sheng, Sun Lingtong was startled, "Someone's coming?" Then, he was delighted, "Good, good, good. Just as Little Zhuo said, let them in first."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
