<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo had originally intended to study the “fuel” aspect of the Fire Cremation Prajna Spirit-Resolving Sutra, unexpectedly discovering a critical clue within the paper giant statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Within the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, Sun Lingtong’s eyes sparkled with excitement, rubbing his hands together eagerly: “Little Zhuo, let’s keep quiet first. When no one’s around, we’ll secretly take away your mother’s treasure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo rubbed his ring thoughtfully, then shook his head. “There’s no need for secrecy. We should take it openly, right in front of Wen Ruanyu!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Lingtong froze, confused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo explained, “If my mother truly left behind treasures here, considering how White Paper City Lord previously treated me as the savior of White Paper Immortal City, it is only reasonable that the treasures return to their rightful heir. It’s natural for me to inherit what my mother left behind.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“If it turns out there’s nothing, we’ll have demonstrated our sincerity regardless.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong shook his head vigorously, “No, no, Little Zhuo, you’re overlooking one possibility.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“If the treasure your mother left behind is incredibly powerful or precious, aren’t you worried that White Paper City Lord might covet it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Even if it’s not blatant robbery, she could certainly find an excuse to quietly take it. You know how those righteous sect types behave!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, “You have a point, boss.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“However, I still won’t do it your way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“This arrangement was made by my mother. She was kind-hearted and generous, giving so much for White Paper Immortal City. Her leaving treasures here meant they were intended for the city’s benefit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“I’m her son; my journey here isn’t just to follow her footsteps but also to inherit her legacy and fulfill the concerns she had in life.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“So, if it comes down to it and White Paper City Lord uses the treasures to protect the city and sustain its residents, I would willingly accept that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong was thoroughly convinced and sighed deeply, “Little Zhuo, you’re becoming more and more righteous.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He quickly clarified, “By righteous, I mean it in the most literal sense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“I understand, boss.” Ning Zhuo smiled inwardly. “I’m merely following my mother’s example.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">His voice softened, “When I act according to her teachings, completing tasks she wished to accomplish, I feel as though my mother is right beside me, guiding me personally.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sun Lingtong sighed again and fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo then summoned Wen Ruanyu and frankly shared the discovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Wen Ruanyu was both surprised and delighted. “The City Lord truly made a wise choice! Appointing you for this investigation was remarkably insightful. Who could have expected such a breakthrough from your first action!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Clearly, your expertise in formations is extraordinary. Few could discern such subtlety.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Wen Ruanyu continued with admiration, “Senior Sister Meng’s method is brilliant - forward, it works one way, reversed, it unveils something entirely different. Such ingenious design; who would think to reverse-engineer this formation?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">With the crucial insight provided by Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu quickly spotted the anomaly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Under Wen Ruanyu’s watchful eyes, Ning Zhuo reversed a particular formation, triggering the opening of an internal spatial formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu entered in succession, finding themselves in a space held up by eight massive stone pillars, connecting the heavens above and the earth below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">At the very center of the formation space was a large well, from which Yin energy surged forth like a roaring river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Suspended precisely above the well mouth was an octagonal palace lantern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The lantern, in the shape of an octagonal prism, was four feet two inches tall and one foot eight inches in diameter. Its domed top narrowed inward, and its base was square and level, embodying the principle of a round heaven and square earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Crafted from brass and sandalwood, the lantern emitted a faint yellow glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Yet, even this faint luminescence firmly suppressed the raging Yin energy, penetrating subtly within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">As Ning Zhuo continued examining it, Wen Ruanyu exclaimed, “This is the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern of our Myriad Manifestations Sect! Who would’ve thought Senior Sister Meng had hidden it here!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This revelation surprised both Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“The Interwoven Field Paths Lantern?” Ning Zhuo questioned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Wen Ruanyu nodded, pointing at the Nascent Soul-grade artifact, “This lantern significantly regulates the earth’s energy in a region, creating fertile soil and interconnected paths.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Senior Sister Meng must have placed it here specifically to suppress this Yin tide.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Alas, she gave up this artifact, missing her chance to soar at the Flying Cloud Assembly. Her sacrifices went far beyond what we ever imagined!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Looking toward the surging Yin energy, Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, “How can we completely eliminate this vast Yin tide? How do we ensure a lasting solution?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Wen Ruanyu shook his head, sighing, “It’s too difficult!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“The Ghostly Black Marshlands have long been shaped by such deep and persistent erosion, creating today’s unique terrain and resources.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“As the saying goes, rely on mountains for livelihood, and rivers for sustenance - this Yin tide is precisely the lifeblood sustaining our White Paper Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“For this very reason, the City Lord has selflessly sacrificed herself, continuously suppressing the Yin Tides over the years. Now, she’s heavily tainted by the Yin energy and trapped in this dire predicament.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo furrowed his brows: “This palace lantern has continuously suppressed the Yin Tides, greatly contributing to the survival of White Paper Immortal City until today!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Although it belongs to the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the survival of everyone in White Paper Immortal City depends on it. We must handle this matter carefully.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“In my opinion, Lord Wen, you might pretend you’ve never seen this lantern, acting confused just this once. This way, we honor the arrangements and heartfelt intentions of Senior Meng Yaoyin.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">However, Wen Ruanyu shook his head and smiled bitterly: “I can’t do that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“This palace lantern itself may seem ordinary, but its origin is extraordinary - it’s actually a mechanical part from the Hundred Flowers Flying Ship.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“The Hundred Flowers Flying Ship is the ultimate sect-protecting treasure of our Myriad Manifestations Sect, lost for many years now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“A component like this palace lantern is a vital clue. Senior Sister Meng had taken this task herself, searching everywhere for the ship using this very lantern.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“It involves our sect’s most treasured artifact - I cannot conceal it. I’ll report it to the sect, and naturally, I’ll inform the White Paper City Lord as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong slapped his forehead dramatically: “Ah, if only we hadn’t dismantled this formation right in front of everyone!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo remained silent for a moment but ultimately agreed: “Fine. But since I’m the one who discovered it, I have a request.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Now that Myriad Manifestations Sect is reclaiming their Interwoven Field Paths Lantern, surely a great sect like yours can offer an equivalent artifact to continue suppressing this place, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Wen Ruanyu looked at Ning Zhuo thoughtfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Confused, Ning Zhuo asked: “Why are you looking at me like that, Lord Wen?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Wen Ruanyu sighed admiringly: “Jiao Ma, I didn’t expect you to have such magnanimity and insight, prioritizing White Paper Immortal City’s welfare above all else. It’s rare to see someone your age with this perspective.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Wen Ruanyu developed newfound respect for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">As a Confucian cultivator, Wen Ruanyu pursued self-cultivation, family harmony, national governance, and global peace. He believed in establishing ideals for heaven and earth, guiding people’s destinies, continuing the teachings of sages, and fostering eternal peace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Thus, Ning Zhuo’s actions resonated deeply with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He smiled faintly and assured him: “Rest easy. I will not only request a suitable artifact from my sect to maintain suppression here, but I’ll also ensure you’re properly credited for your discovery!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“For many years, this secret has eluded all of White Paper Immortal City. Your contribution must not go unnoticed!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“I’ll advocate for your inclusion in the Myriad Manifestations Sect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Jiao Ma, with your talent, becoming merely a male consort in White Paper Immortal City would be squandering your potential.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“White Paper Immortal City, or even the Ghostly Black Marshlands, are too small a stage for you. You belong in a great sect, where you can truly shine!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Surprised, Ning Zhuo murmured: “Join Myriad Manifestations Sect?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">His heart quickened at the thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">If he joined the sect, he could delve deeper into his mother’s past, find more fuel, and further nurture Meng Yaoyin’s spiritual essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Then, of course, there was his personal growth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo voiced his concern: “I don’t wish to change my main cultivation technique. Can I join without switching my path?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Wen Ruanyu pondered briefly before responding: “Our Myriad Manifestations Sect embraces all forms and styles. Many disciples join us without changing their original cultivation paths.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“If you join now, your timing couldn’t be better.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“The upcoming Flying Cloud Assembly is about to commence. If you make an impressive showing, you could quickly rise above the status of miscellaneous or outer sect disciple and become an inner sect disciple directly!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This being the second time Wen Ruanyu mentioned the Flying Cloud Assembly, Ning Zhuo immediately asked for details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Wen Ruanyu explained: “Our sect’s talent recruitment is highly flexible. The Flying Cloud Assembly is a grand event for talent selection, covering the entire Flying Cloud Nation and even beyond.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Many sect members, dissatisfied with their current positions, spend years preparing for this assembly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“The sect will release all sorts of tasks during the event, open to both sect disciples and independent cultivators. With divine communication, each person’s achievements and contributions are meticulously recorded, allowing precise evaluations of their capabilities.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“Senior Sister Meng received her mission at the Flying Cloud Assembly, obtaining this very lantern.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Alas, she was too kind-hearted.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“She left the lantern here, which greatly impacted her standing due to the loss, ultimately causing her to be disqualified from the assembly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred slightly, a suspicion forming within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Suppressing his doubts, he bowed deeply in gratitude: “If I could join Myriad Manifestations Sect with your recommendation, Senior, it would truly be a great honor. Thank you for your kindness and support.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Wen Ruanyu smiled warmly: “Recommending talented individuals also benefits my standing within the sect. More importantly, I truly wish to build a positive relationship with you, Jiao Ma.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo didn't hide anything, and his honest demeanor made a favorable impression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Dropping the formalities, Ning Zhuo declared straightforwardly, "However, before anything else, I must refine this palace lantern first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Wen Ruanyu was momentarily taken aback, a look of hesitation crossing his face. He opened his mouth to object but caught sight of Ning Zhuo's unwavering gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">In that instant, Wen Ruanyu understood clearly - this point was non-negotiable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo's expression was emotionless, his voice even slightly stern, "Elder Wen, as long as you honor your promise, I will exchange the treasure immediately afterward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">At this moment, Wen Ruanyu vividly recalled Ning Zhuo single-handedly capturing three Golden Core-level ghost cultivators, a feat etched clearly in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">A faint smile appeared on Wen Ruanyu's face. "Very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Elder Wen," Ning Zhuo continued, "please personally report this situation to the City Lord. I will remain here and refine the palace lantern."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Wen Ruanyu nodded gravely. "Indeed, this matter is significant and warrants my personal report to ensure thoroughness. However, leaving you here alone is unsafe. Allow me to leave behind a clone to guard you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Although it was clear that Wen Ruanyu was wary of Ning Zhuo fleeing after claiming the treasure, he delivered his words smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Though smiling, Ning Zhuo sensed the underlying insistence behind Wen Ruanyu's polite exterior and agreed, "Fine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With Ning Zhuo's agreement, Wen Ruanyu promptly took out a scroll from his storage belt. Infusing spiritual Energy, he unfurled it, revealing a detailed self-portrait. From the painting emerged Wen Ruanyu's clone, gracefully stepping into the array space and bowing politely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The aura emanating from this clone impressively matched the Golden Core stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo studied the clone curiously, sincerely praising, "I've heard Confucian cultivators typically practice the Four Arts: music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. Today, seeing Elder Wen's profound skill with my own eyes truly confirms the depth of your accomplishments."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Wen Ruanyu smiled humbly and modestly deflected the praise. After stationing the clone safely away from the lantern to avoid suspicion, he swiftly departed to report back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Floating upward, Ning Zhuo cautiously approached the lantern, gently laying both hands upon it. He began concentrating, steadily channeling his Spiritual Energy to commence the refinement process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sun Lingtong, concealed within the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, vigilantly stood guard beside Ning Zhuo, keeping an eye on Wen Ruanyu's painted clone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Little Zhuo, did you discover something else?" Sun Lingtong transmitted mentally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Just a suspicion," Ning Zhuo replied, focusing intensely. "Once I've refined this lantern, I'll confirm it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Despite lacking advanced techniques in artifact refinement, Ning Zhuo soon felt a shuddering revelation as he refined the lantern to thirty percent completion, uncovering further arrangements made by Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"As expected, my mother had additional plans!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Recalling Wen Ruanyu's lament earlier, Ning Zhuo had already found something peculiar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Mother was extraordinarily intelligent. Why wouldn't she directly report to the sect and exchange the treasure, instead suffering such a loss and failing at the Flying Cloud Convention? Unless she had hidden motives or other deeper schemes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">As the refinement progressed, Ning Zhuo uncovered even more of Meng Yaoyin's carefully concealed setup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He realized that the lantern's power had subtly permeated the endless Yin Tide, forming invisible yet tangible pathways. These paths stretched out endlessly, barely perceptible without the lantern’s activation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">When his refinement reached sixty percent, Ning Zhuo discovered where these mysterious paths led - they traversed the boundary between Yin and Yang, reaching directly into the Underworld!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Sun Lingtong, upon receiving this revelation, was astonished. "Little Zhuo, your mother's strategy is incredible! Utilizing the unique environment of the Ghostly Black Marshlands within the Yin Tide to bridge Yin and Yang takes remarkable courage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Frowning slightly, Ning Zhuo grappled with deeper uncertainty. "Mother willingly sacrificed her standing at the Flying Cloud Convention and temporarily damaged her prospects in the sect, all to arrange something in the Underworld using this lantern."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Why would she go so far?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"There must be a compelling reason behind her actions!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Upon reaching eighty percent refinement, Ning Zhuo suddenly felt a profound shock reverberate through his very soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"This is?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">--- </paragraph><br/><br/>
