<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">In the preparation room, Ning Zhuo ran over to the five-sided stone pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He found that there was a ranking list on each side of the stone pillar. There was the Qi Refining List, the Essence Refining List, the Spirit Refining List[^1], the Trial Progress List, and the Level Speedrun List.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">His name was on the Checkpoint Speedrun List as well, and he was still the only name there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo didn‚Äôt care about the hidden meaning of these rankings, nor did he care why he was the only one there. All he wanted to know was how to get rid of his name!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">‚ÄúEven the four major forces can‚Äôt protect their Qi Refining geniuses. If I‚Äôm exposed, I can‚Äôt even imagine the consequences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">‚ÄúThree Schools Supreme Sage must have set up these ranking to spur competition. But a little person like me can‚Äôt bear it.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo circled the five-sided stone pillar. As the pillar turned, so too did he.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">His name wasn‚Äôt carved into the pillar, but rather formed by slight protrusions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">‚ÄúCan I grind it off?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo jumped up, but couldn‚Äôt reach his name. As the first and only name on the rankings, his name was naturally at the highest point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Hanging ring!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Clink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The indigo diamond fused into the ceiling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The wooden ring below his big head whirred, retracting the thin thread and yanking Ning Zhuo‚Äôs puppet body upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Head tilted, Ning Zhuo gradually rose into the air until his name was at eye level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He reached out and tried to grind off his name, but not a single stone chip flaked off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The stone pillar was incredibly solid!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo considered his current methods. His only offensive spell was the Icy Embrace Art, which definitely wouldn‚Äôt work; trying it out would only be a waste of time and spirit power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">‚ÄúI have to find a solution!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Concluding that he would need external aid, Ning Zhuo swung his body and looked around while hanging from the ceiling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">At this moment, he finally examined this unique room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">According to the message, this was the maintenance room, different from Rooms 1, 2, and 3.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Looking at the room now, Ning Zhuo found this information to be true.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The maintenance room was shaped like a square. Its walls and ceiling were still made of copper, but this copper was a bluish color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Light seemed to come from nowhere, filling the room with a faint blue glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The five-sided stone pillar was in the center of the maintenance room, and there were five or six mechanism pedestals located next to a wall. Hanging on a different wall were numerous mechanical components, and there were also several workbenches with a full array of mechanical tools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Seeing these facilities, hope rekindled in Ning Zhuo‚Äôs heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">‚ÄúMaybe I can use these tools to get rid of my name.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo manipulated the hanging ring to extend the thread again and fell back to the ground. Then, he walked over to a wall and grabbed a torch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As soon as he touched the torch, a message sounded in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">There was a fee for using the torch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The exact cost would depend on how long he used it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo was stunned for a moment, and suddenly realized, ‚ÄúNo wonder the spirit stone reward increased from room to room!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">‚ÄúIn the Lava Immortal Palace, these spirit stones aren‚Äôt just sources of spirit power, but also currency.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo mentally consented to paying and successfully took the torch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This torch was a welding torch, a commonly-used tool for creating mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Holding the welding torch, Ning Zhuo sprinted back to the center of the maintenance room. As he kicked the ground hard to make a leap, the wooden ring around his neck rotated and quickly retracted the thin thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs head tilted as he hanged himself once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Suspended in the air, he used the inertia of his leap to return to the spot where his name was written.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Then, he reached out the hand holding the torch and infused his spirit power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The torch immediately ignited, with a flame the reddish color of a duck egg‚Äôs yolk appearing from its tip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo increased his output, and the flame ballooned in size. At the very tip, there was a bright bluish-purple glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo aimed the tip of the flame at his name, putting all his strength into burning it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But even after a long time passed, his name showed no traces of burning. It was still just as eye-catching as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Gritting his teeth, Ning Zhuo had to give up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The hanging ring spun again, lengthening the wire and letting Ning Zhuo down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">On his next attempt, the torch in his hand had disappeared, now replaced by a file.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This was the Grinding Tooth Demonic Sound File.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">This thing‚Äôs main material was a beast‚Äôs canine teeth. When infused with spirit power, it would generate a harsh sound wave. The sound wave‚Äôs magnitude and range could be adjusted freely, and was used by many people for grinding objects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Not just the outside, but even the inside could be ground up smoothly due to the penetration ability of sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo tried using the Grinding Tooth Demonic Sound File to attack his name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Meanwhile, in the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Lying on the throne, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit yawned in boredom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">During the previous exploration, Ning Zhuo had given it a lot of amusement. That‚Äôs why, when it noticed that Ning Zhuo‚Äôs soul was pretty much recovered, it eagerly drew him back into the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit wanted to have fun watching Ning Zhuo again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">And so, Ning Zhuo came to explore the immortal palace for the second time. His bizarre hanging appearance in Room Two and the way he got the crap beaten out of him by the kung fu puppet made the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit very happy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">But now, Ning Zhuo refused to move on and was trying everything to scrape his name away. The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit felt that this was very boring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">It directly sent a message ‚Äì the ranking stone pillar was indestructible!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo paused slightly when he received this message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Under normal circumstances, he might have stopped here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">But the matter regarding his name was too important. Ning Zhuo absolutely couldn‚Äôt give up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Gritting his teeth, he continued using the demonic sound file to grind away at his name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit snorted in annoyance, giving rise to a puff of flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Then, it directly activated the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo was instantly immobilized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">One breath of time later, his mobility was restored, but he knew he had to cease his actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He looked back at his name on the pillar. The two words, ‚ÄúNing Zhuo‚Äù, were still so attention-grabbing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù A feeling of despair gradually filled Ning Zhuo‚Äôs heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"No, I can't just give up like this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This time, when Ning Zhuo landed on the ground, he no longer went to take the mechanical tools. Instead, he set his sights on the pedestals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">These pedestals came in various shapes. Ning Zhuo walked past the Motion Equilibrium Frame and the Formation Engraving Platform, jumped over the Spirit Power Compression Frame and the White Tiger Knife Sharpening Wheel, and finally arrived at the Thousand Jun[^2] Heavy Hammer Platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">‚ÄúThe Lava Immortal Palace can instantly take control of my body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">‚ÄúI‚Äôll set up a simple mechanism here. As long as I activate it, the hammer will automatically strike the stone pillar!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs large head immediately thought of a method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He began his work, first selecting mechanical components and then dragging out the Thousand Jun Heavy Hammer Platform. A catapult gradually took shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">[^1] Essence Refining and Spirit Refining ‚Äì along with Ê∞î (qi, ‚Äúenergy‚Äù), Á≤æ (jing, ‚Äúessence‚Äù) and Á•û (shen, ‚Äúspirit‚Äù) are the ‚Äúthree treasures‚Äù of the human body according to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Although I call Á•û‚Äúspirit‚Äù in this context, please be aware that it has nothing at all to do with spirit stones (ÁÅµÁü≥) or spirit energy (ÁÅµÊ∞î). Instead, you should really associate it more with the word ‚Äúdivine‚Äù, e.g. divine sense (Á•ûËØÜ) or divine sea (Á•ûÊµ∑). This is because Á•û actually also means ‚Äúgod‚Äù. There is probably some academic paper somewhere on why Á•û refers to both the soul/spirit and the divine, but for the purposes of this novel just remember that ‚Äúspirit‚Äù in the specific context of the three treasures does not have anything to do with ‚Äúspirit‚Äù in most other contexts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">[^2] One jun is equivalent to thirty catties, or fifteen kilograms, or about 33 pounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
