<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji's expression changed as he made a new discovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He immediately ordered the trial disciples to retrieve a severed arm from the pile of discarded items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The severed arm was deep red, shimmering with a golden hue, and exuded a heavy, sinister demonic aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"The quality is very high, definitely Golden Core Stage material. And it's not a single material; it's a new composite created using alchemical methods," Zhu Xuanji murmured to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Is this also a construct from the Lava Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"What kind of construct would use such materials?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zhu Xuanji's mind instantly recalled the three major constructs of the Lava Immortal Palaceâ€”Dao Master, Buddha Healer, and Demon General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Could this be the arm of a fallen Demon General?" Zhu Xuanji naturally speculated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Greatly intrigued, he ordered the trial disciples to retrieve the crimson iron severed arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">But they failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">One trial disciple, with a bitter expression, said, "Master Zhu, I can't do it. My contribution is too low."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Zhu Xuanji laughed, "No matter. The Lava Immortal Palace is not peaceful; there are continuous attacks from Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts. You can use this opportunity to accumulate a large amount of contribution." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After the trial disciples followed his instructions, Zhu Xuanji discovered that the contribution they earned from killing the same Scarlet Flame Demon Beast was significantly higher than that of others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He also found that trial disciples could occasionally receive critical information, providing them with more ways to earn contributions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In contrast, others rarely received proactive messages from the Immortal Palace, and the primary way to earn contributions was by slaying Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">However, this method was fraught with danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">On the other hand, trial disciples had a broader range of options.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">For example, they could retrieve construct parts from the discard room for repair and assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zhu Xuanji observed their actual gains and was surprised to find that the earnings from these repair tasks were comparable to slaying Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Is this the treatment enjoyed by those who practice the techniques provided by the three sects?" "In comparison, we are clearly being treated differently..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Zhu Xuanji felt a pang of emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">For a moment, Zhu Xuanji entertained a fleeting fantasy of switching his cultivation path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">But it was just a fleeting thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He was already at the Golden Core Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">If he were still in the Foundation Establishment Stage, there might be a slight chance of reconsidering and starting over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Once a Golden Core is formed, the foundation is set, and it is impossible to start over in this lifetime.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The saying "Golden Core has no regrets" holds true.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The trial disciples accumulated contributions rapidly, and soon someone had enough to exchange for the crimson iron severed arm from the discard room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Zhu Xuanji touched the severed arm and used his Golden Eyes talent and Tracing Origin Technique to investigate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He saw an underground lava cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The cave was vast, with numerous pillars of varying thickness supporting the cave walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">A gigantic demon ape, exuding Golden Core Stage aura, was sleeping with its eyes closed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In one of the stone pillars where it slept, there was a cavity storing the demon ape's various spoils of war.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Among them was a severely damaged construct puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Demon General Construct!!" Zhu Xuanji's eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Judging by this, the underground lava cave should be the demon ape's lair, similar to a royal court." "The Demon General Construct fell here, but if I can retrieve it, I will surely gain a large amount of contribution." "If I can repair it and return it, the contribution should be even greater!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhu Xuanji easily deduced that retrieving the Demon General Construct would far exceed the total contribution he had previously earned by donating three quasi-Golden Core constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This was because the Demon General Construct itself was a Golden Core combat power and perfectly matched the Lava Immortal Palace's original constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The King's recruitment order led Meng Kui to lift the blockade on the mountain top and the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Many people flocked to the Lava Immortal Palace, most of whom were rejected at the gates, but a few met the standards and were allowed entry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Lava Immortal Palace became even more bustling than before the blockade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhu Xuanji also felt the pressure of competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He urgently needed to gain a large amount of contribution to widen the gap between himself and his pursuers, securing his advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The three Golden Core ancestors of Fire Persimmon Immortal City were Zhu Xuanji's helpers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The three families had a two-pronged approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The first path was to rely on Zhu Xuanji, expressing loyalty and depending on the royal family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The second path was to cultivate their own reformation teams, continuously breaking through the Lava Immortal Palace's checkpoints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Cultivation families operate this way, never putting all their eggs in one basket.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Therefore, true cultivation families have high-level cultivators serving in different countries, even in rival nations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Xiaoren slammed his hand on the table in anger, growling, "He really did it?!" "Good, good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"I thought it was the Zhou family and the Zheng family who figured out the setup and obtained the trial disciple insignia." "I didn't expect it to be Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"For a mere thousand spirit stones, he sold such crucial information to Zheng Jian and Zhou Zeshen!" "Does he not know that our Ning family could use this opportunity to gain an advantage and close the gap with the Zhou and Zheng families?" "He put his own interests above the family's big picture!" "Ning Zhuo is too short-sighted, too narrow-minded, too selfish."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Just because we didn't agree to give him Ice Jade Wine, he immediately sold the information to outsiders." "Traitor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Is he still a member of the Ning family? What did he learn in all those years of schooling?!" "It seems we must teach him a lesson, let him know how badly he has erred."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Xiaoren paced back and forth in the study, then ordered the freezing of resources allocated to Ning Zhuo in the reformation team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But then he remembered that Ning Zhuo's cultivation resources were not limited to this; he had many other sources of income, quite substantial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Xiaoren thought of Ning Xiaohui, who gathered main branch members but only reached the second room, while Ning Zhuo had consecutively broken through to the eighth room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Ning Xiaohui is not up to the task."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"If she could suppress Ning Zhuo, would he still be so ambitious?!" Ning Xiaoren paced again, then issued a second order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo had joined the reformation team, giving Ning Xiaoren the right to command him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"You are so focused on studying mechanical constructs?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Very well, Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Now, you won't have half an hour to spare for your research."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Xiaoren sneered inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo refused the order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo withdrew from the reformation team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"What?!" Ning Xiaoren was stunned when he heard this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">When he recovered, his heart was filled with rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Audacious, audacious!" "How dare he, how dare he!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"How dare he refuse the family's assignment, how dare he unilaterally withdraw from the reformation team?!" "Ahhhh!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Xiaoren was furious, smashing the inkstone on the table to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After smashing it, he felt something was missing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">So, he went to the private prison and saw Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"You raised a good nephew!" Ning Xiaoren raised a long whip and continuously lashed Ning Ze to vent his anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Ze: "Ahâ€”!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
