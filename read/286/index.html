<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">With the situation desperate, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit quickly divulged the content of the palace examination to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Clap clap clap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"What is that sound?" Ning Zhuo asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Young master, I am being severely punished by the Immortal Palace's fire whip for revealing the palace examination content to you," the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit urged frantically, "Hurry, fire the cannon!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Only then did Ning Zhuo relent and issue the command to fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">A barrage of cannonballs condensed from Five Elements mana flew towards the location of the Golden Furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Just as expected!" Zhu Xuanji's eyes shone with golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He had been prepared for this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In the next moment, the cultivators he had arranged activated a temporary formation, intercepting many of the Five Elements cannonballs in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhu Xuanji threw out a formation disk, instantly constructing a defensive formation to block the remaining cannonball attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Taking advantage of the opportunity, he approached the Golden Furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">First, he casually killed a few Scarlet Flame Beasts, then arrived at the ruins of a Golden Furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"The Lava Immortal Palace originally had eight Golden Furnaces and now only three remain, having used up five." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"The three intact Golden Furnaces can be ignored; the clues left by Ning Xiaohui are on the five used furnaces!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"I already know the details of the first Golden Furnace, no need to investigate." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"The remaining ones are the second, third, fourth, and fifth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"The destruction of the Golden Furnaces likely followed this sequence. In other words, the fifth Golden Furnace was destroyed most recently." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Then, it's this one!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Innate Talent: Heaven-Piercing Eyes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Technique: Origin Tracing Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">In the next moment, Zhu Xuanji "saw" the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He saw a teleportation circle form out of thin air, then expel the corpse of Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The portal of the Golden Furnace opened automatically, drawing Yuan Dasheng's corpse inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Immediately, the Golden Furnace roared to life, blazing with fierce flames, initiating the refining process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">As the smelting proceeded, countless cracks gradually appeared on the surface of the Golden Furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">When the refining concluded, the Golden Furnace collapsed with a roar, turning into countless fragments and debris.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">As the smoke and dust gradually dispersed, a mechanical ape stood motionless in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"This is the mechanical ape from the trial checkpoint?!" In an instant, Zhu Xuanji's pupils slightly dilated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The retrospective image ended there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zhu Xuanji returned to his senses, finding that another round of bombardment had already descended!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Boom boom boom...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Under the cannon fire, the intact Golden Furnace remained unmoved while a large number of Scarlet Flame Beasts perished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The temporary formation that Zhu Xuanji had set up earlier ultimately couldn't withstand the onslaught and sunk under the devastating Five Elements mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Zhu Xuanji, shrouded in golden light, bathed in the bombardment, remained unmoved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">However, a powerful force was pushing him outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zhu Xuanji felt helpless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This force originated from the Immortal Palace's restrictions. With the beasts defeated, Zhu Xuanji no longer had the qualifications to linger there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">With his status as a participant in the palace examination vying for the position of the Immortal Palace's master in mind, Zhu Xuanji didn't want to resist such a force and had to temporarily comply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Just as he left the Golden Furnace, a flying message arrived, hovering slowly before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It was a message from Meng Kui!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">After reading the message, Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly, "Is that all?" He was indifferent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Because after Ning Zhuo confessed and submitted, he admitted that the corpse of Yuan Dasheng he obtained had been taken by Sun Lingtong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Han Ming had never seen the true face of Chui Tiao Ke, only knowing that Chui Tiao Ke had obtained Yuan Dasheng's corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Unyielding Righteous Golden Bones? Yuan Dasheng actually had immortal potential. No wonder the Demonic Dao Scripture remained in his body after death." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Ning Zhuo didn't know Yuan Dasheng's true value and handed over the corpse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Sun Lingtong of the Void Sect, Chui Tiao Ke, and others not only obtained the Demonic Dao Scripture but also used the Golden Furnace to turn Yuan Dasheng into a mechanical ape." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"That mechanical ape should be the one within the route inside the Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Previously, everyone speculated it was part of the Immortal Palace as one of the arrangements set by the Three Sects Master. Unexpectedly, it was the handiwork of the Void Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"The Void Sect has long coveted the Lava Immortal Palace and had infiltrated deeply. They were not only able to rename themselves, add mechanical apes in trial checkpoints to intercept the respecialization team, but also use the Golden Furnace for their own gain." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Perhaps, the mechanical traps on the route into the Immortal Palace that once troubled all reformation team members were also the arrangements of the Void Sect?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The City Lord's Mansion had long captured two demon cultivators from the Soul Devouring Sect (Triangular-eyed and Hook-nosed), leading Zhu Xuanji to believe that Chui Tiao Ke and Sun Lingtong were disciples of the Void Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"I had already communicated with Meng Kui about Ning Zhuo's confession. Now, he sends me Fei Si's report, what does it mean?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Oh, I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zhu Xuanji felt slightly puzzled, then suddenly realized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He looked up at the sky, snorted coldly, "That old fox." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Immediately, Zhu Xuanji wrote a flying message, arranged for a messenger, and sent it to Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Meng Kui had been waiting, and upon seeing the flying message immediately reached out a large hand to receive it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">After receiving Zhu Xuanji's approval, Meng Kui immediately issued orders to Fei Si, instructing him to take action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo was still unaware of Han Ming's surrender.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">But he understood that Zhu Xuanji had already explored the fifth Golden Furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">This made him realize that the refining of Yuan Dasheng and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had been exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">If Zhu Xuanji knew the mechanism of "Golden Furnace refining immortal potential leads to self-destruction," then the fact that Yuan Dasheng had immortal potential would also be exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo felt fortunate, "Luckily, back at the children's orphanage, I made the right decision to betray Boss Sun and confess to Zhu Xuanji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">If he hadn't done so, he wouldn't have been able to reveal the secret that "Yuan Dasheng had already been handed over to the Void Sect." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Without this preemptive action, Zhu Xuanji's exploration of the fifth Golden Furnace would have inevitably triggered this hidden danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">At this moment, Ning Zhuo no longer had the Buddha Heart Demon Seal for protection!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Even if he could temporarily deceive him, as long as Zhu Xuanji and others restrained him and prevented him from moving freely, he would be unable to act and would ultimately be exposed and defeated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">His temporary safety in this situation was due to his previous actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">One wrong step, even if nothing happened at the time, would leave almost no chance to change things once the matter was exposed later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">It was Ning Zhuo's foresight, along with his decade-long preparations and many arrangements set up as a second line of defense, that allowed him to pass through this ordeal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Zhu Xuanji is becoming more troublesome." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"This guy has set his sights on the Golden Furnace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Today's bombardment ... although it stopped his subsequent actions, it still exposed many secrets." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"After this incident, Zhu Xuanji will surely realize that the Void Sect is very concerned about the Golden Furnace, further confirming that the Golden Furnace holds significant clues!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"He will definitely continue to try, and next time he will be even more prepared." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Sigh, what a headache!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo faced not only the palace examination and the need to continue cooperating with Sun Lingtong in public, but also the relentless pursuit of the truth by Zhu Xuanji!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">If Zhu Xuanji focused solely on the palace examination, things would have been much easier for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">But reality and ideals often have a clear gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo could only be forced to divert his attention and constantly monitor the movements of the beasts. If any beast horde threatened the Golden Furnace, he had to act preemptively to bombard it to deny Zhu Xuanji any opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Choosing the position of the Five Elements Cannon Tower's tower master was indeed a wise decision." The position had repeatedly demonstrated its immense value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The position of the Medical Pavilion's director was also very useful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo went to the critical care room to secretly meet with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He shared with Sun Lingtong the palace examination information he had just learned from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He also took out the Golden Core stage mechanical ape and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">In front of Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo used the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability to extract the spirit of Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The spirit of Dasheng floated in mid-air, round and plump like a ball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The ball displayed the appearance of a monkey's head, vivid and lifelike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The monkey head was not noisy but looked solemnly at Ning Zhuo, speaking, "Master." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo nodded to him, "I have a task for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"In the upcoming period, I need you to hide within this mechanical body. When I give the command, you will launch a counterattack." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">After speaking, Ning Zhuo infused mana into the base of his tongue, where a strange flower was hidden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Mana infused into the Cloud Concealment Bud within the strange flower, releasing a wisp of cloud smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo exhaled the cloud smoke towards Dasheng's spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The cloud smoke enveloped Dasheng's spirit, making it semi-transparent and surrounded by cloud patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo placed the spirit of Yuan Dasheng, now with cloud patterns, into the Golden Core stage mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He allowed Yuan Dasheng to try using the new body, giving it time to adapt, and then ordered it to hide again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Finally, Ning Zhuo opened the body of the Golden Core mechanical ape, dismantling many internal components, and placed them in the critical care room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">After secretly discussing with Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo returned to his temporary residence and actively sought an audience with Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Ancestor, with the second round of the palace examination imminent, after much consideration, I believe lending you this item is the best course of action!" Saying this, Ning Zhuo took out the Golden Core stage mechanical ape and handed it directly to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Jiufan was surprised and instinctively used his divine sense to scan the entire Golden Core mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He saw that the mechanical ape was tall, standing at one zhang and eight. Its frame and joints were made of Myriad Strike Profound Iron. The front chest and back were primarily made of Scarlet Sun Copper. The claws and teeth were crafted from Diamond Stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The entire mechanical ape was made of high-end materials, extremely solid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">However, compared to its exterior, the interior of the mechanical ape was empty, requiring many mechanical components to be filled in to activate it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Little Zhuo, not bad, you're doing very well." Ning Jiufan stroked his beard, feeling satisfied, "Then, I will accept your filial piety. The second round of the palace examination may indeed require its use!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Since the news of the second round of the palace examination was conveyed, he had been thinking of ways to prepare actively from all aspects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He had naturally thought of the Golden Core stage mechanical ape in Ning Zhuo's possession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">However, due to seniority and the face of the righteous path, he was reluctant to ask Ning Zhuo for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">This time, Ning Zhuo offered it voluntarily, warming Ning Jiufan's heart, making him feel that Ning Zhuo was indeed a member of the Ning family, and his previous actions to protect Ning Zhuo were not in vain! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Now, there was a heartwarming return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"This mechanical scripture, 'Ice Sculpture Secret Manual,' is the focus of my mechanical arts. Take it back and study it." Ning Jiufan took out a jade slip from his storage ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo's face lit up with joy, and he quickly accepted it, sincerely expressing his gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Seeing Ning Jiufan open the Golden Core mechanical ape, Ning Zhuo tactfully took his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Fire Persimmon Immortal City, City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Fei Si received Meng Kui's reply and immediately began to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">He entered the dungeon and met with Han Ming, speaking directly, "According to you, Chui Tiao Ke used you to enhance his soul foundation?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"I don't believe it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Come, show me, use it on me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
