<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
With the situation desperate, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit quickly divulged the content of the palace examination to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Clap clap clap!<br/>
<br/>
"What is that sound?" Ning Zhuo asked.<br/>
<br/>
"Young master, I am being severely punished by the Immortal Palace's fire whip for revealing the palace examination content to you," the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit urged frantically, "Hurry, fire the cannon!" <br/>
<br/>
Only then did Ning Zhuo relent and issue the command to fire.<br/>
<br/>
A barrage of cannonballs condensed from Five Elements mana flew towards the location of the Golden Furnace.<br/>
<br/>
"Just as expected!" Zhu Xuanji's eyes shone with golden light.<br/>
<br/>
He had been prepared for this.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the cultivators he had arranged activated a temporary formation, intercepting many of the Five Elements cannonballs in mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji threw out a formation disk, instantly constructing a defensive formation to block the remaining cannonball attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Taking advantage of the opportunity, he approached the Golden Furnace.<br/>
<br/>
First, he casually killed a few Scarlet Flame Beasts, then arrived at the ruins of a Golden Furnace.<br/>
<br/>
"The Lava Immortal Palace originally had eight Golden Furnaces and now only three remain, having used up five." <br/>
<br/>
"The three intact Golden Furnaces can be ignored; the clues left by Ning Xiaohui are on the five used furnaces!" <br/>
<br/>
"I already know the details of the first Golden Furnace, no need to investigate." <br/>
<br/>
"The remaining ones are the second, third, fourth, and fifth."<br/>
<br/>
"The destruction of the Golden Furnaces likely followed this sequence. In other words, the fifth Golden Furnace was destroyed most recently." <br/>
<br/>
"Then, it's this one!" <br/>
<br/>
Innate Talent: Heaven-Piercing Eyes!<br/>
<br/>
Technique: Origin Tracing Technique.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, Zhu Xuanji "saw" the past.<br/>
<br/>
He saw a teleportation circle form out of thin air, then expel the corpse of Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
The portal of the Golden Furnace opened automatically, drawing Yuan Dasheng's corpse inside.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, the Golden Furnace roared to life, blazing with fierce flames, initiating the refining process.<br/>
<br/>
As the smelting proceeded, countless cracks gradually appeared on the surface of the Golden Furnace.<br/>
<br/>
When the refining concluded, the Golden Furnace collapsed with a roar, turning into countless fragments and debris.<br/>
<br/>
As the smoke and dust gradually dispersed, a mechanical ape stood motionless in place.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the mechanical ape from the trial checkpoint?!" In an instant, Zhu Xuanji's pupils slightly dilated.<br/>
<br/>
The retrospective image ended there.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji returned to his senses, finding that another round of bombardment had already descended!<br/>
<br/>
Boom boom boom...<br/>
<br/>
Under the cannon fire, the intact Golden Furnace remained unmoved while a large number of Scarlet Flame Beasts perished.<br/>
<br/>
The temporary formation that Zhu Xuanji had set up earlier ultimately couldn't withstand the onslaught and sunk under the devastating Five Elements mana.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, shrouded in golden light, bathed in the bombardment, remained unmoved.<br/>
<br/>
However, a powerful force was pushing him outward.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji felt helpless.<br/>
<br/>
This force originated from the Immortal Palace's restrictions. With the beasts defeated, Zhu Xuanji no longer had the qualifications to linger there.<br/>
<br/>
With his status as a participant in the palace examination vying for the position of the Immortal Palace's master in mind, Zhu Xuanji didn't want to resist such a force and had to temporarily comply.<br/>
<br/>
Just as he left the Golden Furnace, a flying message arrived, hovering slowly before him.<br/>
<br/>
It was a message from Meng Kui!<br/>
<br/>
After reading the message, Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly, "Is that all?" He was indifferent.<br/>
<br/>
Because after Ning Zhuo confessed and submitted, he admitted that the corpse of Yuan Dasheng he obtained had been taken by Sun Lingtong!<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming had never seen the true face of Chui Tiao Ke, only knowing that Chui Tiao Ke had obtained Yuan Dasheng's corpse.<br/>
<br/>
"Unyielding Righteous Golden Bones? Yuan Dasheng actually had immortal potential. No wonder the Demonic Dao Scripture remained in his body after death." <br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo didn't know Yuan Dasheng's true value and handed over the corpse."<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Lingtong of the Void Sect, Chui Tiao Ke, and others not only obtained the Demonic Dao Scripture but also used the Golden Furnace to turn Yuan Dasheng into a mechanical ape." <br/>
<br/>
"That mechanical ape should be the one within the route inside the Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
"Previously, everyone speculated it was part of the Immortal Palace as one of the arrangements set by the Three Sects Master. Unexpectedly, it was the handiwork of the Void Sect."<br/>
<br/>
"The Void Sect has long coveted the Lava Immortal Palace and had infiltrated deeply. They were not only able to rename themselves, add mechanical apes in trial checkpoints to intercept the respecialization team, but also use the Golden Furnace for their own gain." <br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps, the mechanical traps on the route into the Immortal Palace that once troubled all reformation team members were also the arrangements of the Void Sect?" <br/>
<br/>
The City Lord's Mansion had long captured two demon cultivators from the Soul Devouring Sect (Triangular-eyed and Hook-nosed), leading Zhu Xuanji to believe that Chui Tiao Ke and Sun Lingtong were disciples of the Void Sect.<br/>
<br/>
"I had already communicated with Meng Kui about Ning Zhuo's confession. Now, he sends me Fei Si's report, what does it mean?" <br/>
<br/>
"Oh, I understand."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji felt slightly puzzled, then suddenly realized.<br/>
<br/>
He looked up at the sky, snorted coldly, "That old fox." <br/>
<br/>
Immediately, Zhu Xuanji wrote a flying message, arranged for a messenger, and sent it to Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui had been waiting, and upon seeing the flying message immediately reached out a large hand to receive it.<br/>
<br/>
After receiving Zhu Xuanji's approval, Meng Kui immediately issued orders to Fei Si, instructing him to take action.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was still unaware of Han Ming's surrender.<br/>
<br/>
But he understood that Zhu Xuanji had already explored the fifth Golden Furnace.<br/>
<br/>
This made him realize that the refining of Yuan Dasheng and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had been exposed.<br/>
<br/>
If Zhu Xuanji knew the mechanism of "Golden Furnace refining immortal potential leads to self-destruction," then the fact that Yuan Dasheng had immortal potential would also be exposed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt fortunate, "Luckily, back at the children's orphanage, I made the right decision to betray Boss Sun and confess to Zhu Xuanji!"<br/>
<br/>
If he hadn't done so, he wouldn't have been able to reveal the secret that "Yuan Dasheng had already been handed over to the Void Sect." <br/>
<br/>
Without this preemptive action, Zhu Xuanji's exploration of the fifth Golden Furnace would have inevitably triggered this hidden danger.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Zhuo no longer had the Buddha Heart Demon Seal for protection!<br/>
<br/>
Even if he could temporarily deceive him, as long as Zhu Xuanji and others restrained him and prevented him from moving freely, he would be unable to act and would ultimately be exposed and defeated.<br/>
<br/>
His temporary safety in this situation was due to his previous actions.<br/>
<br/>
One wrong step, even if nothing happened at the time, would leave almost no chance to change things once the matter was exposed later.<br/>
<br/>
It was Ning Zhuo's foresight, along with his decade-long preparations and many arrangements set up as a second line of defense, that allowed him to pass through this ordeal.<br/>
<br/>
"Zhu Xuanji is becoming more troublesome." <br/>
<br/>
"This guy has set his sights on the Golden Furnace!"<br/>
<br/>
"Today's bombardment ... although it stopped his subsequent actions, it still exposed many secrets." <br/>
<br/>
"After this incident, Zhu Xuanji will surely realize that the Void Sect is very concerned about the Golden Furnace, further confirming that the Golden Furnace holds significant clues!" <br/>
<br/>
"He will definitely continue to try, and next time he will be even more prepared." <br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, what a headache!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo faced not only the palace examination and the need to continue cooperating with Sun Lingtong in public, but also the relentless pursuit of the truth by Zhu Xuanji!<br/>
<br/>
If Zhu Xuanji focused solely on the palace examination, things would have been much easier for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
But reality and ideals often have a clear gap.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could only be forced to divert his attention and constantly monitor the movements of the beasts. If any beast horde threatened the Golden Furnace, he had to act preemptively to bombard it to deny Zhu Xuanji any opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
"Choosing the position of the Five Elements Cannon Tower's tower master was indeed a wise decision." The position had repeatedly demonstrated its immense value.<br/>
<br/>
The position of the Medical Pavilion's director was also very useful.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo went to the critical care room to secretly meet with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
He shared with Sun Lingtong the palace examination information he had just learned from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
He also took out the Golden Core stage mechanical ape and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
In front of Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo used the Life-Hanging Thread Divine Ability to extract the spirit of Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
The spirit of Dasheng floated in mid-air, round and plump like a ball.<br/>
<br/>
The ball displayed the appearance of a monkey's head, vivid and lifelike.<br/>
<br/>
The monkey head was not noisy but looked solemnly at Ning Zhuo, speaking, "Master." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded to him, "I have a task for you."<br/>
<br/>
"In the upcoming period, I need you to hide within this mechanical body. When I give the command, you will launch a counterattack." <br/>
<br/>
After speaking, Ning Zhuo infused mana into the base of his tongue, where a strange flower was hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Mana infused into the Cloud Concealment Bud within the strange flower, releasing a wisp of cloud smoke.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo exhaled the cloud smoke towards Dasheng's spirit.<br/>
<br/>
The cloud smoke enveloped Dasheng's spirit, making it semi-transparent and surrounded by cloud patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo placed the spirit of Yuan Dasheng, now with cloud patterns, into the Golden Core stage mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
He allowed Yuan Dasheng to try using the new body, giving it time to adapt, and then ordered it to hide again.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Ning Zhuo opened the body of the Golden Core mechanical ape, dismantling many internal components, and placed them in the critical care room.<br/>
<br/>
After secretly discussing with Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo returned to his temporary residence and actively sought an audience with Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
"Ancestor, with the second round of the palace examination imminent, after much consideration, I believe lending you this item is the best course of action!" Saying this, Ning Zhuo took out the Golden Core stage mechanical ape and handed it directly to Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was surprised and instinctively used his divine sense to scan the entire Golden Core mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
He saw that the mechanical ape was tall, standing at one zhang and eight. Its frame and joints were made of Myriad Strike Profound Iron. The front chest and back were primarily made of Scarlet Sun Copper. The claws and teeth were crafted from Diamond Stone.<br/>
<br/>
The entire mechanical ape was made of high-end materials, extremely solid.<br/>
<br/>
However, compared to its exterior, the interior of the mechanical ape was empty, requiring many mechanical components to be filled in to activate it.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, not bad, you're doing very well." Ning Jiufan stroked his beard, feeling satisfied, "Then, I will accept your filial piety. The second round of the palace examination may indeed require its use!" <br/>
<br/>
Since the news of the second round of the palace examination was conveyed, he had been thinking of ways to prepare actively from all aspects.<br/>
<br/>
He had naturally thought of the Golden Core stage mechanical ape in Ning Zhuo's possession.<br/>
<br/>
However, due to seniority and the face of the righteous path, he was reluctant to ask Ning Zhuo for it.<br/>
<br/>
This time, Ning Zhuo offered it voluntarily, warming Ning Jiufan's heart, making him feel that Ning Zhuo was indeed a member of the Ning family, and his previous actions to protect Ning Zhuo were not in vain! <br/>
<br/>
Now, there was a heartwarming return.<br/>
<br/>
"This mechanical scripture, 'Ice Sculpture Secret Manual,' is the focus of my mechanical arts. Take it back and study it." Ning Jiufan took out a jade slip from his storage ring.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face lit up with joy, and he quickly accepted it, sincerely expressing his gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Jiufan open the Golden Core mechanical ape, Ning Zhuo tactfully took his leave.<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
Fire Persimmon Immortal City, City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si received Meng Kui's reply and immediately began to act.<br/>
<br/>
He entered the dungeon and met with Han Ming, speaking directly, "According to you, Chui Tiao Ke used you to enhance his soul foundation?" <br/>
<br/>
"I don't believe it."<br/>
<br/>
"Come, show me, use it on me!"<br/>
