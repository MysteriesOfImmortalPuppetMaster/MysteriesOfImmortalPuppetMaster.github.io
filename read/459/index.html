<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Storage cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A stone sphere wrapped around the embryonic breath spirit boat, inside the embryonic breath spirit boat was hidden Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The complete recorded incantations of the “Great arts of heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing” shone brightly on the surface of the embryonic breath spirit boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">When the time arrived, Ning Zhuo came to the side of the stone sphere to help Sun Lingtong escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Divine ability — Stone-Cast Earth Treasure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The layer of stone skin covering Sun Lingtong’s entire body rustled off, scattering all over the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sun Lingtong stretched lazily and chuckled, “Little Zhuo, I feel that I’ve gotten so much stronger again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">As he spoke, he reached out and grabbed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Spiritual sense fetching objects!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sun Lingtong fetched a large military saber. He was small and the saber was large; wielding the big saber was like waving a stalk of straw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Sun Lingtong then used the saber and aimed it at his own chest, chopping continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Clang clang clang…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">A series of rapid strikes sparked countless bursts of fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The blade’s edge rolled and bent, but Sun Lingtong’s chest skin only became slightly flushed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong was very delighted: “Without using any special methods, relying solely on my fleshly body, I can already withstand ordinary weapons.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“Little Zhuo, the results of this cultivation are really great. Come and try it yourself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Oh, wait, you can use those four pieces of national power, that’s even more efficient!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo slightly shook his head, “Boss, I only tried it once, I never truly used it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Sun Lingtong: “Ah, why is that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sun Lingtong did not go with Ning Zhuo to the feast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He had to watch over the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, there were too many spoils —no, war trophies. If by any means some technique detected them and discovered them on Ning Zhuo’s person, that would be terrible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Therefore, even in the Three Generals Camp, Ning Zhuo and the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon tried their best to stay separate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo then told him about Shuang Jing’s recruitment and the matter of becoming a retainer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun Lingtong felt it was strange: “Since he didn’t restrict your freedom, if you want to leave, then leave. Why not join him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Becoming a retainer only sounds bad in name. But your national power bricks are equivalent to tripling. That advantage is enormous!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo shook his head, sighing: “Boss, I am a righteous man.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“If I just took advantage and then left, how would others view me, Ning Zhuo? How would they view my Ning Family?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Shuang Jing offered such generous terms because he saw through my identity. He is a high-born scion, not a mere wastrel, and he’s quite capable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“This was clear from before, during the ambush, when he decisively ordered the armory replenishment to stall us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Sun Lingtong used his hand as a pillow: “Hah, the righteous path is such a hassle!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo continued: “Shuang Jing recruiting me as a retainer doesn’t actually have a bad title.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“I’m not someone who’s overly proud. I was humble since childhood. If I were proud, how could I have endured fourteen years, secretly plotting against the Lava Immortal Palace?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“In fact, having served as a retainer to a dynastic grandmaster at the Foundation Establishment stage would be quite an outstanding part of one’s résumé.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“I simply have two major concerns.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun Lingtong: “Oh? Tell me about them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo raised the index finger of his left hand: “The first concern is the trio of Liu, Guan, and Zhang.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Boss, I’ve told you before. I can use Life Hanging by a Threads to plant a divine ability into Guan Hong and Zhang Hei, but I can’t use it on Liu Er.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Liu Er has true depth!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“At the time of their oath of brotherhood, he could subdue Guan Hong and Zhang Hei. And not long ago, during the war, he played a major role and captured Ma Feitui alive. All of this shows his extraordinariness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“What I value most is his social finesse, which is very seasoned.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Such a talented person is only restricted by his background and not well-received. Once he gains an opportunity, he’ll rise with the wind!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“If I befriend him now, I will surely reap greater benefits in the future.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Thus, if I agreed to Shuang Jing now, my relationship with the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang would greatly weaken.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“For the moment, that loss is smaller than the cost of refusing Shuang Jing. But from a long-term perspective, it’s not so certain!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Sun Lingtong was slightly stunned: “I didn’t expect you, Little Zhuo, to value Liu Er so highly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“But I think you don’t need to calculate this so carefully.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“If I were you, I would immediately agree to Shuang Jing, become a retainer, and use the national power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Benefits must be taken into your hands. Only then can they be considered benefits. It’s best to have them secured first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“And compared to Liu, Guan, and Zhang, I think more highly of you, Little Zhuo. How can those three compare to you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Therefore, everything should prioritize your own development.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Didn’t you say not long ago that you almost died in battle? From now on, you still have to participate in this war. Of course your cultivation should be as high as possible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Perhaps, at a certain life-or-death moment, that extra bit of cultivation might save your life.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This time it was Ning Zhuo’s turn to be slightly stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He looked at Sun Lingtong, and warmth rose in his heart. He thought to himself: “Liu Er has two sworn brothers, Guan Hong and Zhang Hei, to support him, but I’m not lacking either. I have Boss by my side!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">When it came to the person in this world who valued Ning Zhuo the most, who had the greatest confidence in him, who understood and cared for him the most, none other than Sun Lingtong could compare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo then raised his left middle finger: “Now, let me speak of my second concern.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“I’m thinking, if I become Shuang Jing’s retainer and then absorb national power, is that really the most efficient?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“At that moment, when Shuang Jing proposed his recruitment, I recalled an old matter.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Boss, do you remember when General Mu Lan was injured, and Zhang Chongyi suggested dual cultivation?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong giggled: “How could I forget such a fun matter? Huh?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Little Zhuo! Do you want to dual cultivate with Mu Lan?” Sun Lingtong’s eyes shone as if he found it quite entertaining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo sighed and said seriously: “If I dual cultivate with Mu Lan, I would become someone of the Grand Marshal’s Residence. With such an identity, wouldn’t absorbing national power be even more efficient than as Shuang Jing’s retainer?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Sun Lingtong replied without hesitation: “Of course! You currently hold an actual post as Military Advisor. It’s actually very hard to rise further.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Unless you abandon your Southern Bean Kingdom identity and become a citizen of Two Note Kingdom, you can’t gain promotions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Extraordinary promotions for foreigners are truly rare.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong continued to analyze: “Besides an actual post, there are nominal titles.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Becoming Shuang Jing’s retainer triples your efficiency. But dual cultivating with Mu Lan would at least be ten times, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Shuang Jing is merely royalty of Two Note Kingdom, while Mu Lan is the sole heir of the Grand Marshal’s Residence!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo nodded: “So, from this perspective, if I agree to Shuang Jing, I might as well agree to Mu Lan, isn’t that so?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong blinked: “What you say makes a lot of sense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“It’s just, Little Zhuo, I find something odd.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“With your cleverness, you wouldn’t fail to consider the benefits of joining the Grand Marshal’s Residence, nor would you fail to foresee that you’d be rewarded with national power after gaining merit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“If that’s the case, why did you refuse dual cultivation before?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“Your cultivation of the Three Supreme Techniques doesn’t require you to preserve your own primal yang, after all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly: “Boss, human hearts are fickle; how could I be exempt?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“The previous ambush battle shocked me in many ways.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“You’re right. The battlefield is perilous, fraught with danger. I must do my utmost to enhance myself!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“National power is the best shortcut. I must use it fully.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“In the Southern Bean Kingdom, the Zhu Family wouldn’t reward me with national power just because my Ning Family opposed the Meng Family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Only here in Two Note Kingdom, with this war and the generous royal Shuang family, do I have such a golden opportunity.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Having said this, Ning Zhuo’s gaze became sharp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Therefore, I actually have only two choices.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Either I stick only to the identity of Military Advisor andto absorb national power, or I agree to dual cultivation and absorb national power at ten times the efficiency.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“The compromise of becoming Shuang Jing’s retainer was never in my consideration from the start!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Boss, what do you think I should choose?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Sun Lingtong did not hesitate: “Close your eyes and pick the second one, dual cultivation, dual cultivation! I want to see you dual cultivate, Little Zhuo!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong excitedly raised his arms in a cheer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“I only want the name of dual cultivation, thereby indirectly obtaining the status of the Grand Marshal’s Residence’s son-in-law.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: “Dual cultivation?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“I don’t want it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“Mu Lan previously tossed her enemies onto us. If I dual cultivate now to help her clear up hidden troubles, wouldn’t that be letting her off too easily?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Also, although the Three Supreme Techniques don’t demand preserving one’s primal yang, I only have one share of it. Keeping it is surely better than not having it, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Sun Lingtong became even more excited: “Little Zhuo, you want to take all the benefits without giving anything in return. Not bad, not bad! I said you were suited to join the Void Sect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“Do you already have some bad idea brewing in that big head of yours?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Hurry and tell me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo nodded: “I do have some ideas. Boss, starting tomorrow you should do this…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sun Lingtong listened, nodding repeatedly, his eyes shining, a mischievous smile appearing on his childlike face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">After listening, he looked at Ning Zhuo with an appreciative gaze: “As expected of you, Little Zhuo. As expected of someone I trained, hee hee!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
