Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Storage cabin.<br/>
<br/>
A stone sphere wrapped around the embryonic breath spirit boat, inside the embryonic breath spirit boat was hidden Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
The complete recorded incantations of the “Great arts of heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing” shone brightly on the surface of the embryonic breath spirit boat.<br/>
<br/>
When the time arrived, Ning Zhuo came to the side of the stone sphere to help Sun Lingtong escape.<br/>
<br/>
Divine ability — Stone-Cast Earth Treasure!<br/>
<br/>
The layer of stone skin covering Sun Lingtong’s entire body rustled off, scattering all over the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong stretched lazily and chuckled, “Little Zhuo, I feel that I’ve gotten so much stronger again.”<br/>
<br/>
As he spoke, he reached out and grabbed.<br/>
<br/>
Spiritual sense fetching objects!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong fetched a large military saber. He was small and the saber was large; wielding the big saber was like waving a stalk of straw.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong then used the saber and aimed it at his own chest, chopping continuously.<br/>
<br/>
Clang clang clang…<br/>
<br/>
A series of rapid strikes sparked countless bursts of fire.<br/>
<br/>
The blade’s edge rolled and bent, but Sun Lingtong’s chest skin only became slightly flushed.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was very delighted: “Without using any special methods, relying solely on my fleshly body, I can already withstand ordinary weapons.”<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, the results of this cultivation are really great. Come and try it yourself.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, wait, you can use those four pieces of national power, that’s even more efficient!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo slightly shook his head, “Boss, I only tried it once, I never truly used it.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: “Ah, why is that?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong did not go with Ning Zhuo to the feast.<br/>
<br/>
He had to watch over the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, there were too many spoils —no, war trophies. If by any means some technique detected them and discovered them on Ning Zhuo’s person, that would be terrible.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, even in the Three Generals Camp, Ning Zhuo and the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon tried their best to stay separate.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then told him about Shuang Jing’s recruitment and the matter of becoming a retainer.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt it was strange: “Since he didn’t restrict your freedom, if you want to leave, then leave. Why not join him?”<br/>
<br/>
“Becoming a retainer only sounds bad in name. But your national power bricks are equivalent to tripling. That advantage is enormous!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head, sighing: “Boss, I am a righteous man.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I just took advantage and then left, how would others view me, Ning Zhuo? How would they view my Ning Family?”<br/>
<br/>
“Shuang Jing offered such generous terms because he saw through my identity. He is a high-born scion, not a mere wastrel, and he’s quite capable.”<br/>
<br/>
“This was clear from before, during the ambush, when he decisively ordered the armory replenishment to stall us.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong used his hand as a pillow: “Hah, the righteous path is such a hassle!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued: “Shuang Jing recruiting me as a retainer doesn’t actually have a bad title.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m not someone who’s overly proud. I was humble since childhood. If I were proud, how could I have endured fourteen years, secretly plotting against the Lava Immortal Palace?”<br/>
<br/>
“In fact, having served as a retainer to a dynastic grandmaster at the Foundation Establishment stage would be quite an outstanding part of one’s résumé.”<br/>
<br/>
“I simply have two major concerns.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: “Oh? Tell me about them.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo raised the index finger of his left hand: “The first concern is the trio of Liu, Guan, and Zhang.”<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, I’ve told you before. I can use life-hanging threads to plant a divine ability into Guan Hong and Zhang Hei, but I can’t use it on Liu Er.”<br/>
<br/>
“Liu Er has true depth!”<br/>
<br/>
“At the time of their oath of brotherhood, he could subdue Guan Hong and Zhang Hei. And not long ago, during the war, he played a major role and captured Ma Feitui alive. All of this shows his extraordinariness.”<br/>
<br/>
“What I value most is his social finesse, which is very seasoned.”<br/>
<br/>
“Such a talented person is only restricted by his background and not well-received. Once he gains an opportunity, he’ll rise with the wind!”<br/>
<br/>
“If I befriend him now, I will surely reap greater benefits in the future.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thus, if I agreed to Shuang Jing now, my relationship with the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang would greatly weaken.”<br/>
<br/>
“For the moment, that loss is smaller than the cost of refusing Shuang Jing. But from a long-term perspective, it’s not so certain!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was slightly stunned: “I didn’t expect you, Little Zhuo, to value Liu Er so highly.”<br/>
<br/>
“But I think you don’t need to calculate this so carefully.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I were you, I would immediately agree to Shuang Jing, become a retainer, and use the national power.”<br/>
<br/>
“Benefits must be taken into your hands. Only then can they be considered benefits. It’s best to have them secured first.”<br/>
<br/>
“And compared to Liu, Guan, and Zhang, I think more highly of you, Little Zhuo. How can those three compare to you?”<br/>
<br/>
“Therefore, everything should prioritize your own development.”<br/>
<br/>
“Didn’t you say not long ago that you almost died in battle? From now on, you still have to participate in this war. Of course your cultivation should be as high as possible.”<br/>
<br/>
“Perhaps, at a certain life-or-death moment, that extra bit of cultivation might save your life.”<br/>
<br/>
This time it was Ning Zhuo’s turn to be slightly stunned.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at Sun Lingtong, and warmth rose in his heart. He thought to himself: “Liu Er has two sworn brothers, Guan Hong and Zhang Hei, to support him, but I’m not lacking either. I have Boss by my side!”<br/>
<br/>
When it came to the person in this world who valued Ning Zhuo the most, who had the greatest confidence in him, who understood and cared for him the most, none other than Sun Lingtong could compare.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then raised his left middle finger: “Now, let me speak of my second concern.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m thinking, if I become Shuang Jing’s retainer and then absorb national power, is that really the most efficient?”<br/>
<br/>
“At that moment, when Shuang Jing proposed his recruitment, I recalled an old matter.”<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, do you remember when General Mu Lan was injured, and Zhang Chongyi suggested dual cultivation?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong giggled: “How could I forget such a fun matter? Huh?”<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo! Do you want to dual cultivate with Mu Lan?” Sun Lingtong’s eyes shone as if he found it quite entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed and said seriously: “If I dual cultivate with Mu Lan, I would become someone of the Upper General’s Residence. With such an identity, wouldn’t absorbing national power be even more efficient than as Shuang Jing’s retainer?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong replied without hesitation: “Of course! You currently hold an actual post as Military Advisor. It’s actually very hard to rise further.”<br/>
<br/>
“Unless you abandon your Southern Bean Kingdom identity and become a citizen of Two Note Kingdom, you can’t gain promotions.”<br/>
<br/>
“Extraordinary promotions for foreigners are truly rare.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong continued to analyze: “Besides an actual post, there are nominal titles.”<br/>
<br/>
“Becoming Shuang Jing’s retainer triples your efficiency. But dual cultivating with Mu Lan would at least be ten times, right?”<br/>
<br/>
“Shuang Jing is merely royalty of Two Note Kingdom, while Mu Lan is the sole heir of the Upper General’s Residence!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: “So, from this perspective, if I agree to Shuang Jing, I might as well agree to Mu Lan, isn’t that so?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong blinked: “What you say makes a lot of sense.”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s just, Little Zhuo, I find something odd.”<br/>
<br/>
“With your cleverness, you wouldn’t fail to consider the benefits of joining the Upper General’s Residence, nor would you fail to foresee that you’d be rewarded with national power after gaining merit.”<br/>
<br/>
“If that’s the case, why did you refuse dual cultivation before?”<br/>
<br/>
“Your cultivation of the Three Supreme Techniques doesn’t require you to preserve your own primal yang, after all.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly: “Boss, human hearts are fickle; how could I be exempt?”<br/>
<br/>
“The previous ambush battle shocked me in many ways.”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re right. The battlefield is perilous, fraught with danger. I must do my utmost to enhance myself!”<br/>
<br/>
“National power is the best shortcut. I must use it fully.”<br/>
<br/>
“In the Southern Bean Kingdom, the Zhu Family wouldn’t reward me with national power just because my Ning Family opposed the Meng Family.”<br/>
<br/>
“Only here in Two Note Kingdom, with this war and the generous royal Shuang family, do I have such a golden opportunity.”<br/>
<br/>
Having said this, Ning Zhuo’s gaze became sharp.<br/>
<br/>
“Therefore, I actually have only two choices.”<br/>
<br/>
“Either I stick only to the identity of Military Advisor andto absorb national power, or I agree to dual cultivation and absorb national power at ten times the efficiency.”<br/>
<br/>
“The compromise of becoming Shuang Jing’s retainer was never in my consideration from the start!”<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, what do you think I should choose?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong did not hesitate: “Close your eyes and pick the second one, dual cultivation, dual cultivation! I want to see you dual cultivate, Little Zhuo!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong excitedly raised his arms in a cheer.<br/>
<br/>
“I only want the name of dual cultivation, thereby indirectly obtaining the status of the Upper General’s Residence’s son-in-law.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: “Dual cultivation?”<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t want it!”<br/>
<br/>
“Mu Lan previously tossed her enemies onto us. If I dual cultivate now to help her clear up hidden troubles, wouldn’t that be letting her off too easily?”<br/>
<br/>
“Also, although the Three Supreme Techniques don’t demand preserving one’s primal yang, I only have one share of it. Keeping it is surely better than not having it, right?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong became even more excited: “Little Zhuo, you want to take all the benefits without giving anything in return. Not bad, not bad! I said you were suited to join the Void Sect.”<br/>
<br/>
“Do you already have some bad idea brewing in that big head of yours?”<br/>
<br/>
“Hurry and tell me.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: “I do have some ideas. Boss, starting tomorrow you should do this…”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong listened, nodding repeatedly, his eyes shining, a mischievous smile appearing on his childlike face.<br/>
<br/>
After listening, he looked at Ning Zhuo with an appreciative gaze: “As expected of you, Little Zhuo. As expected of someone I trained, hee hee!”</div>
