<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="2">Zhu Xuanji walked out of the warehouse, deep in thought along the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">He hadn't expected that the clues about the Shadow Demon Cultivator would suddenly present themselves in such a manner. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="6">"Could it be that the City Lord's Mansion is using the same old trick again?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">"Using this method to direct and act out a play, diverting my attention and scattering my focus, preventing me from fully committing to the competition in the Lava Immortal Palace?" If so, Zhu Xuanji had to admit, this plan was extremely insidious! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">The other party must have accurately grasped his nature, firmly holding onto his strong desire to protect the city's residents. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">With the demon beasts besieging the city, the forces of the City Lord's Mansion were stretched thin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">Fei Si couldn't possibly investigate the entire Immortal City thoroughly and could only ensure that no Fire Persimmons were hidden in critical areas. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">Even if these Fire Persimmons weren't buried in key positions, detonating them in the city center would cause massive casualties. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">Excessive casualties and chaos in the city would inevitably affect the front lines. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">Zhu Xuanji believed in his own abilities and tended to think that Fei Si wasn't lying, but what about Meng Kui? </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">Although the Meng family was known for their straightforward and direct nature, Meng Kui was the only strategist among the four generals. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">Even if Zhu Xuanji confronted them, he wasn't confident in his lie-detecting skills against someone at the Nascent Soul level. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">Zhu Xuanji walked down the street, his eyes vacant, his mind filled with various thoughts. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">"But what if it's not?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">"What if the City Lord's Mansion is simply a victim? What if neither Meng nor Fei Si has secretly arranged anything?" "Could this Shadow Demon Cultivator be the same as the culprit who bombarded Fire Persimmon Mountain?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">Countless possibilities flashed through Zhu Xuanji's mind. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">He felt as if he were in a fog, unsure which path led to the truth. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">"Lord Zhu! Finally found you!" A voice interrupted Zhu Xuanji's thoughts. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">Zhu Xuanji focused and saw a Foundation Establishment cultivator dressed as a servant. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">Zhu Xuanji asked about his purpose. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">The servant cultivator bowed deeply: "This old servant is a subordinate of Lord Zhu Hou. Lord Zhu Hou has been selected to serve as the new director of the children's orphanage in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. He arrived here two days ago and is ready to take over." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">"Tomorrow, there will be a ceremony for his appointment." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">"Lord Zhu Hou heard that you are present in the Immortal City and wishes to invite you to attend the appointment ceremony." "After all, the position at the children's orphanage was advocated by you." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">Zhu Xuanji's spirit lifted, and he smiled: "This is the only good news I've heard today! You're right, the matter of the children's orphanage was reported by me to the kingdom, with special instructions to select talent from my Zhu family royal lineage." "I didn't expect it to be Uncle Zhu Hou who took on this task." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">"With him there, I can rest assured." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">"Unfortunately, I am entangled in important matters and have no time to attend the ceremony." As he spoke, Zhu Xuanji's eyes flickered with hesitation. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">He understood Zhu Hou's intention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">If he, as a divine constable, attended the ceremony tomorrow, it would greatly improve Zhu Hou's future situation, facilitating the work at the children's orphanage. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">"Since I've already promised Li Leifeng, why not do things thoroughly?" After some consideration, Zhu Xuanji decided to compromise: "I'll go see Uncle Zhu Hou now, let's go." With that, he grabbed the old servant's collar and flew into the air, heading grandly towards the children's orphanage. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Zhu Xuanji's actions quickly attracted countless gazes. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">Just like before, when he openly went to find Ning Zhuo, implementing the strategy of beating the grass to startle the snake. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">From this moment on, he had already begun to support and stand by Zhu Hou. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Zhu Xuanji landed with the servant cultivator at the children's orphanage and met Zhu Hou. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">Zhu Hou, with only Foundation Establishment cultivation, was broad and stout, gentle and magnanimous. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Zhu Xuanji immediately cupped his hands in salute to Zhu Hou. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">In his youth, Zhu Xuanji had received much kindness and support from Zhu Hou. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">Therefore, even after becoming a Golden Core stage cultivator, he remained respectful to Zhu Hou, never showing arrogance. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">Zhu Xuanji then expressed his apologies to Zhu Hou, stating that he couldn't attend the appointment ceremony the next day. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">Zhu Hou smiled slightly and gestured for him to sit down. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Zhu Hou also sat down: "When I saw you flying over so ostentatiously, I understood your intention." "I'm already quite happy that you could spare the time to come." "In the future, leave the children's orphanage to me, and you can rest assured." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">"I've watched you grow up, don't I know your aspirations? Our goals are aligned." "I will do my best to cultivate talent within, sending them to the royal family." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">"Accumulating earth to form a mountain, gathering fur to make a coat, with continuous accumulation, we can surely help the royal family resist the power of many influential ministers." At this point, Zhu Hou sighed deeply. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">"Nowadays, in the Southern Bean Kingdom, the Meng family, the Su family, and others have become too powerful to control." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">"The late emperor, deeply wounded by emotions in his later years, didn't handle everything well, leaving such a mess for the descendants." Zhu Xuanji remained silent, not wanting to criticize his ancestors. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">No matter what, the founding emperor of the Southern Bean Kingdom, who established such a foundation, undoubtedly had more merits than faults. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">Seeing Zhu Xuanji's melancholic expression, Zhu Hou proactively changed the topic: "By the way, Xiao Ji, while organizing Li Leifeng's belongings, I found a good item!" "Come take a look." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Zhu Hou revealed a mysterious expression, took out a jade slip, and handed it to Zhu Xuanji. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">The surface of the jade slip was smooth, the kind that becomes polished after frequent use and handling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">Clearly, Li Leifeng had often used it during his lifetime. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">Zhu Xuanji took the jade slip and scanned its contents with his divine sense. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">He immediately discovered that it was Li Leifeng's diary from when he was alive. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">This diary mainly recorded some outstanding orphans in the children's orphanage. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Li Leifeng was very adept at discovering the strengths of these children and then determining whether they were excellent cultivation seeds. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Li Leifeng even created a detailed list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">The list recorded names and times in detail. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Upon examining the list, Zhu Xuanji found that Li Leifeng not only cared for the orphans in the children's orphanage but sometimes also assisted some impoverished children outside the orphanage. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">Although the children's orphanage received support from various parties, overall, resources were still limited. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">From this list, one could see Li Leifeng's philosophy in managing the children's orphanage. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">He didn't distribute resources equally like a communal meal but invested more in orphans with greater potential. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">On one hand, he hoped to have successors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">So, he had always been actively cultivating successors. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">On the other hand, he hoped these resources could be used in more valuable places, receiving as much positive feedback as possible. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">He earnestly hoped to cultivate some successful cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Once these cultivators had the capacity, they could continue to provide more resources to the children's orphanage, thus forming a positive cycle. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">Zhu Xuanji sighed: "As expected of Li Leifeng, his benevolent and caring heart extends from this jade slip." Holding this old jade slip, he felt its weight. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Li Leifeng's dedication to managing the children's orphanage was so heartfelt that, in Zhu Xuanji's perception, it was even more valuable than a magical artifact! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Seeing Zhu Xuanji's expression change, Zhu Hou smiled: "Feeling a bit better now?" He continued to comfort Zhu Xuanji: "Xiao Ji, you're under too much pressure." "You must know, you're not the only one striving; everyone is moving forward together." "Don't be too harsh on yourself, don't demand too much from yourself." "You've already done a great job." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">"Perhaps, sometimes you will make mistakes, but who can be without fault?" "As long as you're a cultivator, you're human, and as long as you're human, you'll make mistakes." "Now, our royal family is short on talent, and you're the only cultivation seed we've got." "Don't shoulder too much, and don't think you're always fighting alone." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">"People like me, although lacking in cultivation and talent, can also contribute to the royal family. Accumulating bit by bit, this power is not to be underestimated." Zhu Xuanji replied earnestly: "Thank you, Uncle, for your concern." After Zhu Hou's guidance, his mood indeed improved. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">However, just as Zhu Xuanji was about to return the jade slip to Zhu Hou, his expression suddenly changed. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Because his divine sense had scanned the end of the list, and he unexpectedly discovered a familiar name. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Ning Zhuo!!! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">"How could he be on this list?!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Zhu Xuanji hurriedly examined it closely. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Li Leifeng had made detailed records in the jade slip regarding Ning Zhuo. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Over a decade ago, during a puppet show at the children's orphanage, Li Leifeng accidentally discovered a child hiding in the corner, secretly watching. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">The child not only watched secretly but also took advantage of the guests dispersing to steal some leftover pastries to eat. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Li Leifeng saw him twice more afterward. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">On the third occasion, feeling sorry for the child, he brought him backstage and offered him some fresh pastries. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">From then on, the child came more frequently. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">The child often nestled in the corner watching puppet shows, each time completely absorbed. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">This was very different from other children. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">Generally speaking, children's minds are unsettled, and their attention easily diverted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">They could focus for most of a show when seeing new, unfamiliar puppet shows for the first few times. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">But when seeing familiar puppet shows, they often wandered around the audience, unable to sit still for long. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">However, Li Leifeng noticed that this child was always fully focused. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">This piqued Li Leifeng's interest. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">He secretly observed and was amazed to find that the child was imitating his techniques for manipulating the puppet mechanisms! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Others watched the show just to watch, but this child was constantly learning, imitating Li Leifeng's puppet manipulation techniques during the performance, practicing as he watched. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">The child hid in the shadows, learning joyfully, his small hands moving within his sleeves. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">After observing for a while, Li Leifeng was astonished. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">He found that for some simple techniques, the child only needed to watch two or three times to learn them quite well. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Realizing this, Li Leifeng was intrigued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">Whenever the child came to watch secretly, he would add some more complex and difficult performances. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">These puppet shows could at most challenge the child for two or three performances, up to four or five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Then, he would have learned them almost completely. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Finally, during the Seeking Justice play, due to the numerous characters and extremely complex operations, the child was stumped for over ten performances. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">But after a dozen performances, the child had mastered about seventy to eighty percent of it. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">"He has a strong talent for mechanisms!" Li Leifeng considered taking him as a disciple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">After investigating, he found out the child was named Ning Zhuo, a branch disciple of the Ning family. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Before Ning Zhuo was born, his father had already died.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">At two years old, his mother also lost her life. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Although he had a paternal uncle, for some reason, he still lived alone, leading a very difficult life. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Realizing this, Li Leifeng consciously left more pastries, inviting Ning Zhuo to eat whenever he came to watch. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Ning Zhuo was quite gluttonous but very polite, always showing great respect to Li Leifeng, understanding etiquette well. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Every time he saw the small figure bowing respectfully, Li Leifeng couldn't help but reach out and pat his head. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Li Leifeng wrote in his diary: "This child Ning Zhuo, with a rather large head, seems very spirited." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">He also commented on the Ning family: "The Ning family is a large cultivation clan, but not all that impressive. Just looking at Ning Zhuo, one can see the hardships of branch disciples." After inviting Ning Zhuo to eat several times, Li Leifeng felt the time was right. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Once, when no one else was around, Li Leifeng specifically asked Ning Zhuo if he wanted to acknowledge him as a master, promising to teach him more puppet manipulation techniques. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Ning Zhuo's response surprised Li Leifeng. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">He said he couldn't understand any manipulation techniques and just liked watching puppet shows. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Li Leifeng knew this was a lie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">He had seen too many people, and from Ning Zhuo's gaze during each puppet show, he was certain the latter had a deep love for puppets! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Li Leifeng thought, haste makes waste, so he decided to wait and invite him again later. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">However, after the first invitation failed, Ning Zhuo rarely came to the children's orphanage to watch shows. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Occasionally, when he did come, Li Leifeng would add a special performance of "Seeking Justice" for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">This was the most complex puppet show, and even Li Leifeng felt exhausted after each performance. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Li Leifeng knew only such puppet shows could attract Ning Zhuo to watch and come more often. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">By the time Ning Zhuo was four, he could watch "Seeking Justice" while moving his fingers, having developed manipulation techniques with about fifty percent of Li Leifeng's skill. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">Such talent led Li Leifeng to conclude that this child would become a great performer in the future! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">"A sharp tool in a bag, even if covered, is only hidden for a while. After six years old, he will surely stand out!" This was Li Leifeng's personal judgment in his diary. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Seeing this, Zhu Xuanji's heart pounded, and he stood up abruptly. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">He widened his eyes, staring intently at the jade slip in his hand! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">He continued reading. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">He found that Li Leifeng's subsequent records were sparse. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">This was because Ning Zhuo's visits to the children's orphanage had sharply decreased! By the time he was five, he only came two or three times a year.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">By six, he stopped coming altogether. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">"Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo!" Zhu Xuanji murmured, his eyes shining with golden light, his expression intense. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">He hadn't expected to find such a crucial clue from Li Leifeng's relics. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">This allowed him to understand the true side of Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
