<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji walked out of the warehouse, deep in thought along the way.<br/>
<br/>
He hadn't expected that the clues about the Shadow Demon Cultivator would suddenly present themselves in such a manner. <br/>
<br/>
"Could it be that the City Lord's Mansion is using the same old trick again?" <br/>
<br/>
"Using this method to direct and act out a play, diverting my attention and scattering my focus, preventing me from fully committing to the competition in the Lava Immortal Palace?" If so, Zhu Xuanji had to admit, this plan was extremely insidious! <br/>
<br/>
The other party must have accurately grasped his nature, firmly holding onto his strong desire to protect the city's residents. <br/>
<br/>
With the demon beasts besieging the city, the forces of the City Lord's Mansion were stretched thin.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si couldn't possibly investigate the entire Immortal City thoroughly and could only ensure that no Fire Persimmons were hidden in critical areas. <br/>
<br/>
Even if these Fire Persimmons weren't buried in key positions, detonating them in the city center would cause massive casualties. <br/>
<br/>
Excessive casualties and chaos in the city would inevitably affect the front lines. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji believed in his own abilities and tended to think that Fei Si wasn't lying, but what about Meng Kui? <br/>
<br/>
Although the Meng family was known for their straightforward and direct nature, Meng Kui was the only strategist among the four generals. <br/>
<br/>
Even if Zhu Xuanji confronted them, he wasn't confident in his lie-detecting skills against someone at the Nascent Soul level. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji walked down the street, his eyes vacant, his mind filled with various thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
"But what if it's not?" <br/>
<br/>
"What if the City Lord's Mansion is simply a victim? What if neither Meng nor Fei Si has secretly arranged anything?" "Could this Shadow Demon Cultivator be the same as the culprit who bombarded Fire Persimmon Mountain?" <br/>
<br/>
Countless possibilities flashed through Zhu Xuanji's mind. <br/>
<br/>
He felt as if he were in a fog, unsure which path led to the truth. <br/>
<br/>
"Lord Zhu! Finally found you!" A voice interrupted Zhu Xuanji's thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji focused and saw a Foundation Establishment cultivator dressed as a servant. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji asked about his purpose. <br/>
<br/>
The servant cultivator bowed deeply: "This old servant is a subordinate of Lord Zhu Hou. Lord Zhu Hou has been selected to serve as the new director of the children's orphanage in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. He arrived here two days ago and is ready to take over." <br/>
<br/>
"Tomorrow, there will be a ceremony for his appointment." <br/>
<br/>
"Lord Zhu Hou heard that you are present in the Immortal City and wishes to invite you to attend the appointment ceremony." "After all, the position at the children's orphanage was advocated by you." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's spirit lifted, and he smiled: "This is the only good news I've heard today! You're right, the matter of the children's orphanage was reported by me to the kingdom, with special instructions to select talent from my Zhu family royal lineage." "I didn't expect it to be Uncle Zhu Hou who took on this task." <br/>
<br/>
"With him there, I can rest assured." <br/>
<br/>
"Unfortunately, I am entangled in important matters and have no time to attend the ceremony." As he spoke, Zhu Xuanji's eyes flickered with hesitation. <br/>
<br/>
He understood Zhu Hou's intention.<br/>
<br/>
If he, as a divine constable, attended the ceremony tomorrow, it would greatly improve Zhu Hou's future situation, facilitating the work at the children's orphanage. <br/>
<br/>
"Since I've already promised Li Leifeng, why not do things thoroughly?" After some consideration, Zhu Xuanji decided to compromise: "I'll go see Uncle Zhu Hou now, let's go." With that, he grabbed the old servant's collar and flew into the air, heading grandly towards the children's orphanage. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's actions quickly attracted countless gazes. <br/>
<br/>
Just like before, when he openly went to find Ning Zhuo, implementing the strategy of beating the grass to startle the snake. <br/>
<br/>
From this moment on, he had already begun to support and stand by Zhu Hou. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji landed with the servant cultivator at the children's orphanage and met Zhu Hou. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Hou, with only Foundation Establishment cultivation, was broad and stout, gentle and magnanimous. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji immediately cupped his hands in salute to Zhu Hou. <br/>
<br/>
In his youth, Zhu Xuanji had received much kindness and support from Zhu Hou. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, even after becoming a Golden Core stage cultivator, he remained respectful to Zhu Hou, never showing arrogance. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji then expressed his apologies to Zhu Hou, stating that he couldn't attend the appointment ceremony the next day. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Hou smiled slightly and gestured for him to sit down. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Hou also sat down: "When I saw you flying over so ostentatiously, I understood your intention." "I'm already quite happy that you could spare the time to come." "In the future, leave the children's orphanage to me, and you can rest assured." <br/>
<br/>
"I've watched you grow up, don't I know your aspirations? Our goals are aligned." "I will do my best to cultivate talent within, sending them to the royal family." <br/>
<br/>
"Accumulating earth to form a mountain, gathering fur to make a coat, with continuous accumulation, we can surely help the royal family resist the power of many influential ministers." At this point, Zhu Hou sighed deeply. <br/>
<br/>
"Nowadays, in the Southern Bean Kingdom, the Meng family, the Su family, and others have become too powerful to control." <br/>
<br/>
"The late emperor, deeply wounded by emotions in his later years, didn't handle everything well, leaving such a mess for the descendants." Zhu Xuanji remained silent, not wanting to criticize his ancestors. <br/>
<br/>
No matter what, the founding emperor of the Southern Bean Kingdom, who established such a foundation, undoubtedly had more merits than faults. <br/>
<br/>
Seeing Zhu Xuanji's melancholic expression, Zhu Hou proactively changed the topic: "By the way, Xiao Ji, while organizing Li Leifeng's belongings, I found a good item!" "Come take a look." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Hou revealed a mysterious expression, took out a jade slip, and handed it to Zhu Xuanji. <br/>
<br/>
The surface of the jade slip was smooth, the kind that becomes polished after frequent use and handling.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, Li Leifeng had often used it during his lifetime. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji took the jade slip and scanned its contents with his divine sense. <br/>
<br/>
He immediately discovered that it was Li Leifeng's diary from when he was alive. <br/>
<br/>
This diary mainly recorded some outstanding orphans in the children's orphanage. <br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng was very adept at discovering the strengths of these children and then determining whether they were excellent cultivation seeds. <br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng even created a detailed list.<br/>
<br/>
The list recorded names and times in detail. <br/>
<br/>
Upon examining the list, Zhu Xuanji found that Li Leifeng not only cared for the orphans in the children's orphanage but sometimes also assisted some impoverished children outside the orphanage. <br/>
<br/>
Although the children's orphanage received support from various parties, overall, resources were still limited. <br/>
<br/>
From this list, one could see Li Leifeng's philosophy in managing the children's orphanage. <br/>
<br/>
He didn't distribute resources equally like a communal meal but invested more in orphans with greater potential. <br/>
<br/>
On one hand, he hoped to have successors.<br/>
<br/>
So, he had always been actively cultivating successors. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, he hoped these resources could be used in more valuable places, receiving as much positive feedback as possible. <br/>
<br/>
He earnestly hoped to cultivate some successful cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Once these cultivators had the capacity, they could continue to provide more resources to the children's orphanage, thus forming a positive cycle. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji sighed: "As expected of Li Leifeng, his benevolent and caring heart extends from this jade slip." Holding this old jade slip, he felt its weight. <br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng's dedication to managing the children's orphanage was so heartfelt that, in Zhu Xuanji's perception, it was even more valuable than a magical artifact! <br/>
<br/>
Seeing Zhu Xuanji's expression change, Zhu Hou smiled: "Feeling a bit better now?" He continued to comfort Zhu Xuanji: "Xiao Ji, you're under too much pressure." "You must know, you're not the only one striving; everyone is moving forward together." "Don't be too harsh on yourself, don't demand too much from yourself." "You've already done a great job." <br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps, sometimes you will make mistakes, but who can be without fault?" "As long as you're a cultivator, you're human, and as long as you're human, you'll make mistakes." "Now, our royal family is short on talent, and you're the only cultivation seed we've got." "Don't shoulder too much, and don't think you're always fighting alone." <br/>
<br/>
"People like me, although lacking in cultivation and talent, can also contribute to the royal family. Accumulating bit by bit, this power is not to be underestimated." Zhu Xuanji replied earnestly: "Thank you, Uncle, for your concern." After Zhu Hou's guidance, his mood indeed improved. <br/>
<br/>
However, just as Zhu Xuanji was about to return the jade slip to Zhu Hou, his expression suddenly changed. <br/>
<br/>
Because his divine sense had scanned the end of the list, and he unexpectedly discovered a familiar name. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo!!! <br/>
<br/>
"How could he be on this list?!" <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji hurriedly examined it closely. <br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng had made detailed records in the jade slip regarding Ning Zhuo. <br/>
<br/>
Over a decade ago, during a puppet show at the children's orphanage, Li Leifeng accidentally discovered a child hiding in the corner, secretly watching. <br/>
<br/>
The child not only watched secretly but also took advantage of the guests dispersing to steal some leftover pastries to eat. <br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng saw him twice more afterward. <br/>
<br/>
On the third occasion, feeling sorry for the child, he brought him backstage and offered him some fresh pastries. <br/>
<br/>
From then on, the child came more frequently. <br/>
<br/>
The child often nestled in the corner watching puppet shows, each time completely absorbed. <br/>
<br/>
This was very different from other children. <br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, children's minds are unsettled, and their attention easily diverted.<br/>
<br/>
They could focus for most of a show when seeing new, unfamiliar puppet shows for the first few times. <br/>
<br/>
But when seeing familiar puppet shows, they often wandered around the audience, unable to sit still for long. <br/>
<br/>
However, Li Leifeng noticed that this child was always fully focused. <br/>
<br/>
This piqued Li Leifeng's interest. <br/>
<br/>
He secretly observed and was amazed to find that the child was imitating his techniques for manipulating the puppet mechanisms! <br/>
<br/>
Others watched the show just to watch, but this child was constantly learning, imitating Li Leifeng's puppet manipulation techniques during the performance, practicing as he watched. <br/>
<br/>
The child hid in the shadows, learning joyfully, his small hands moving within his sleeves. <br/>
<br/>
After observing for a while, Li Leifeng was astonished. <br/>
<br/>
He found that for some simple techniques, the child only needed to watch two or three times to learn them quite well. <br/>
<br/>
Realizing this, Li Leifeng was intrigued.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever the child came to watch secretly, he would add some more complex and difficult performances. <br/>
<br/>
These puppet shows could at most challenge the child for two or three performances, up to four or five.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he would have learned them almost completely. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, during the Seeking Justice play, due to the numerous characters and extremely complex operations, the child was stumped for over ten performances. <br/>
<br/>
But after a dozen performances, the child had mastered about seventy to eighty percent of it. <br/>
<br/>
"He has a strong talent for mechanisms!" Li Leifeng considered taking him as a disciple.<br/>
<br/>
After investigating, he found out the child was named Ning Zhuo, a branch disciple of the Ning family. <br/>
<br/>
Before Ning Zhuo was born, his father had already died.<br/>
<br/>
At two years old, his mother also lost her life. <br/>
<br/>
Although he had a paternal uncle, for some reason, he still lived alone, leading a very difficult life. <br/>
<br/>
Realizing this, Li Leifeng consciously left more pastries, inviting Ning Zhuo to eat whenever he came to watch. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was quite gluttonous but very polite, always showing great respect to Li Leifeng, understanding etiquette well. <br/>
<br/>
Every time he saw the small figure bowing respectfully, Li Leifeng couldn't help but reach out and pat his head. <br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng wrote in his diary: "This child Ning Zhuo, with a rather large head, seems very spirited." <br/>
<br/>
He also commented on the Ning family: "The Ning family is a large cultivation clan, but not all that impressive. Just looking at Ning Zhuo, one can see the hardships of branch disciples." After inviting Ning Zhuo to eat several times, Li Leifeng felt the time was right. <br/>
<br/>
Once, when no one else was around, Li Leifeng specifically asked Ning Zhuo if he wanted to acknowledge him as a master, promising to teach him more puppet manipulation techniques. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's response surprised Li Leifeng. <br/>
<br/>
He said he couldn't understand any manipulation techniques and just liked watching puppet shows. <br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng knew this was a lie.<br/>
<br/>
He had seen too many people, and from Ning Zhuo's gaze during each puppet show, he was certain the latter had a deep love for puppets! <br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng thought, haste makes waste, so he decided to wait and invite him again later. <br/>
<br/>
However, after the first invitation failed, Ning Zhuo rarely came to the children's orphanage to watch shows. <br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, when he did come, Li Leifeng would add a special performance of "Seeking Justice" for him.<br/>
<br/>
This was the most complex puppet show, and even Li Leifeng felt exhausted after each performance. <br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng knew only such puppet shows could attract Ning Zhuo to watch and come more often. <br/>
<br/>
By the time Ning Zhuo was four, he could watch "Seeking Justice" while moving his fingers, having developed manipulation techniques with about fifty percent of Li Leifeng's skill. <br/>
<br/>
Such talent led Li Leifeng to conclude that this child would become a great performer in the future! <br/>
<br/>
"A sharp tool in a bag, even if covered, is only hidden for a while. After six years old, he will surely stand out!" This was Li Leifeng's personal judgment in his diary. <br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Zhu Xuanji's heart pounded, and he stood up abruptly. <br/>
<br/>
He widened his eyes, staring intently at the jade slip in his hand! <br/>
<br/>
He continued reading. <br/>
<br/>
He found that Li Leifeng's subsequent records were sparse. <br/>
<br/>
This was because Ning Zhuo's visits to the children's orphanage had sharply decreased! By the time he was five, he only came two or three times a year.<br/>
<br/>
By six, he stopped coming altogether. <br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo!" Zhu Xuanji murmured, his eyes shining with golden light, his expression intense. <br/>
<br/>
He hadn't expected to find such a crucial clue from Li Leifeng's relics. <br/>
<br/>
This allowed him to understand the true side of Ning Zhuo!</div>
