<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Mulan lifted the curtain and walked into the tent.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike usual, Uncle Zhang Zhongyi, whom she knew, was not preparing herbal medicines but was holding a jade slip in his left hand, immersing his divine sense to examine it.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing footsteps, Zhang Zhongyi withdrew his divine sense and looked up to see the female general Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was still dressed in a red military robe, covered with brass armor, looking heroic and valiant. However, at the moment, her brows were slightly furrowed, as if enduring pain.<br/>
<br/>
"You're here, have a seat." Zhang Zhongyi gestured for Mulan to sit beside him. He placed the jade slip on the table, stood up, walked to the workbench, and began preparing the herbal medicine for Mulan's injury this time.<br/>
<br/>
"Just now, Ning Zhuo came to me to treat his friend."<br/>
<br/>
"It was a success."<br/>
<br/>
"This jade slip is the treatment method we designed this time; we came up with three plans."<br/>
<br/>
"You can take a look," Zhang Zhongyi advised.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan immediately became interested. "Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
"Is he the little brother who was sitting next to you in the outer hall last night, Uncle Zhang?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi nodded. "Exactly."<br/>
<br/>
As she picked up the jade slip, Mulan said, "I've heard you mention before, Uncle Zhang, that his friend practices the 'Virgin Boy Technique' and has suffered a Dao wound. Treating it is quite troublesome; at the very least, you'd need to invite a master-level earth element expert to specially design specific spells to sort out the earth element principles involved."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan immediately raised an eyebrow, showing a look of surprise. "Him? How old is he?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi lowered his head and began grinding herbs. "You might not believe it."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo himself possesses a master-level realm in the earth element!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi sighed and lamented, "He definitely isn't older than eighteen. Such talent..."<br/>
<br/>
"Before this, I had treated Dao wounds three times. None of those collaborations were as effortless as this one!"<br/>
<br/>
"Now that I think about it, Ning Zhuo's own earth element realm might be beyond the master level."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan listened skeptically and chuckled. "Uncle Zhang praises a young junior so highly; it seems this little brother Ning Zhuo has really caught your eye."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi stopped pounding the herbs, formed a hand seal to examine the composition of the herbal paste, then thoughtfully added a leaf.<br/>
<br/>
He continued grinding while pouring some kind of spiritual liquid into the mixture. He laughed and said, "If I were to tell you that Ning Zhuo also has master-level realms in the wood and fire elements, would you doubt me even more?"<br/>
<br/>
The surprise on Mulan's face deepened. "Isn't that a bit exaggerated? Master-level in three elements?"<br/>
<br/>
She changed her tone. "However, Uncle Zhang, you've met countless people, and now there's evidence from healing the Dao wound. Then this Ning Zhuo must indeed be a master in three elements."<br/>
<br/>
After a pause, Mulan commented, "At such a young age, to have such achievements is truly impressive!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi added, "Impressive doesn't even begin to describe it. In the entire Liangzhu Kingdom, you won't find someone like him. He's too young, yet his achievements are astonishingly high."<br/>
<br/>
"Also, his friend isn't simple either."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, the treatment could have been complete, but his friend stopped it midway."<br/>
<br/>
"The reason is that the other party actually found some wonderful method during his injury period, using the injury to cultivate."<br/>
<br/>
"In my opinion, the effect of this cultivation is outstanding!"<br/>
<br/>
"In this way, he can be said to have turned misfortune into fortune; the foundation of his physical body will increase by at least three times."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan nodded. "Wolves don't dwell with dogs; eagles don't converse with chickens. For such an excellent young man like Ning Zhuo, naturally, there will be equally outstanding cultivators around him."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi finished preparing the herbal medicine and poured all the medicinal paste onto a white bandage.<br/>
<br/>
His hands kept moving as he said, "You might not know yet, but this time the imperial envoy secretly played tricks, delaying the distribution of our army's supplies..."<br/>
<br/>
Before he could finish, Mulan had already nodded and interrupted, "Uncle Zhang, I already know about this matter you're talking about."<br/>
<br/>
"It was Ning Zhuo who helped us resolve the predicament."<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that since Mulan was being harassed, she had ordered her subordinates to secretly keep an eye out and began investigating this military intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
One of her subordinates happened to witness the whole process of Ning Zhuo resolving the issue and immediately reported it to Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan said, "This time, we owe him a favor. If there's an opportunity in the future, I will properly thank him."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi picked up the bandage with the medicinal paste and walked over to Mulan. "No need to thank him. This time, I waived his consultation fee."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan laughed. "Then I should properly thank you, Uncle Zhang."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi immediately shook his head. "No, I should be thanking your father!"<br/>
<br/>
Mulan's wrist turned slightly, and the armor on her left arm automatically separated, transforming into a brass light that entered her storage belt.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan rolled up her sleeve, revealing her forearm.<br/>
<br/>
On her forearm, there were many scars, some of which were from the inside out, with skin and flesh turned over, still oozing blood.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi used the bandage to wrap Mulan's forearm.<br/>
<br/>
Then, his palms hovered over Mulan's forearm, palms facing the bandage. He then mobilized his mana, infusing it into the herbal medicine to activate its healing properties for Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi took out a set of golden needles and, according to specific acupoints, inserted a dozen needles into Mulan's forearm.<br/>
<br/>
Waves of sharp pain attacked, but Mulan remained calm throughout.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, the thick medicinal paste was absorbed, becoming a thin layer.<br/>
<br/>
As time passed, the needle tips gradually began to shine with white light.<br/>
<br/>
The white light was sharp, disintegrating the needles into powder.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi's face darkened, and he said solemnly, "Niece Mulan, your condition has worsened considerably recently."<br/>
<br/>
"I've warned you not to frequently activate your family-inherited cultivation method, the 'Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art.'"<br/>
<br/>
"This cultivation method is suitable for men; it's too masculine and sharp. You, as a woman, practicing this method, are highly susceptible to an excess of yang energy, harming your feminine body."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan shook her head. "Uncle Zhang, with the imminent war, I must train the soldiers daily. Naturally, the use of the 'Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art' will increase, and it will be even more in the future."<br/>
<br/>
"As for this internal injury, I can only slowly nurse it after the war."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi sighed. "Your condition is more serious than you think. If this continues, it might erupt on the battlefield."<br/>
<br/>
"You're underestimating it."<br/>
<br/>
"In fact, to solve your ailment, there's a very simple method, which is dual cultivation!"<br/>
<br/>
"You need to find a male cultivator who possesses pure yang energy and engage in dual cultivation with him."<br/>
<br/>
"As the saying goes, 'Lonely yin does not generate; solitary yang does not grow.' Harmony between yin and yang is the great way of heaven and earth."<br/>
<br/>
"In this way, the overly sharp yang energy can be transferred to the male cultivator. Although in the short term, your cultivation will decrease by several levels, after reducing the burden, the yin energy will no longer be suppressed, naturally flourishing, giving you the opportunity for yin and yang to balance in the future."<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, relying solely on your own efforts to balance yin and yang has no chance of success."<br/>
<br/>
"Your condition has become deeply entrenched; only by borrowing external forces can there be hope of resolving it."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan nodded. "Uncle Zhang, you mentioned this method last time. After I went back, I thought about it for a long time."<br/>
<br/>
She was the valiant daughter of a general, without any shyness.<br/>
<br/>
"To speak frankly, I also want to find a man to dual cultivate with, but after much consideration, there's no suitable candidate." Mulan sighed.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi nodded. "Indeed."<br/>
<br/>
"Finding someone suitable for you is truly difficult."<br/>
<br/>
"First, he must have pure yang energy. However, outstanding individuals often attract many of the opposite sex. The method of dual cultivation is widely known and can quickly increase cultivation. Therefore, whether male or female cultivators, unless under special circumstances, have usually lost their pure yang or pure yin by a certain age."<br/>
<br/>
"Secondly, this person must be compatible with your Mu family. I heard that the current king's third son once pursued you, but you rejected him. That was very wise. The third prince lacks military power and has a bad reputation. What he values is the military prestige of your Mu family's General's Mansion."<br/>
<br/>
"Lastly, this person must be excellent enough; otherwise, associating with mediocre individuals would not be worthy of you. In my opinion, only those at the level of the Twelve Young Masters would prevent you from being wronged."<br/>
<br/>
In today's cultivation world, many enthusiasts rank young elites on a list called the 'Young Masters List.'<br/>
<br/>
The 'Young Masters List' has only twelve spots, representing the universally recognized outstanding talents of the current era.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan shook her head and smiled. "Uncle Zhang, you think too highly of me."<br/>
<br/>
"Although my family is the General's Mansion, we're only a powerful family in Liangzhu Kingdom. Liangzhu Kingdom, in the entire world, is a small country, sandwiched between the Northern Wind Kingdom and the Southern Bean Kingdom, blocked on both ends, with little room for upward mobility."<br/>
<br/>
"My father has been bedridden for years; the family has already declined. Even though I have talent, I can't reach for people renowned throughout the world like the Twelve Young Masters."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi stroked his beard. "Niece, don't underestimate yourself. Since I entered your military camp and observed your training, your attainments are close to Old General Mu's. Your talent in military strategy is extraordinary."<br/>
<br/>
"Consider that the Twelve Young Masters aren't fixed; people often fall off the list, and new ones ascend. This shows that heroes aren't limited by their origins; many rise from humble beginnings."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if we can't aim for the Twelve Young Masters right now, there's a Young Master-level candidate right before us."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan raised her eyebrows and immediately realized whom Zhang Zhongyi was referring to.<br/>
<br/>
She couldn't help but chuckle. "Uncle Zhang, after all this, you want to recommend Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
"It's not that I'm arrogant, but you're making an absurd match. He's only at the Foundation Establishment stage."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi, however, looked serious. "What's wrong with being at the Foundation Establishment stage? Don't underestimate his cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
"His cultivation is indeed lower, but you have to consider his age!"<br/>
<br/>
"He definitely isn't over eighteen years old. Think about it —a Foundation Establishment cultivator under eighteen. How does such cultivation talent compare to yours?"<br/>
<br/>
Mulan's expression became solemn. "He's much stronger than me. I only advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage at twenty-one."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi stroked his beard. "Niece, your family-inherited cultivation method, the 'Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art,' isn't suitable for you. If you were a man, you could have advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage before eighteen."<br/>
<br/>
"Let's get back to Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"This person has talent. Although I haven't thoroughly investigated, he may have concealed his true abilities. Even if he's telling the truth, it must be exceptional. In terms of talent alone, he matches your top-tier talent."<br/>
<br/>
"His comprehension is extremely high. He's a master in fire, earth, and wood elements. Tsk tsk, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, this person comes from the Ning family of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Although I don't know much about this family, seeing that Ning Zhuo is wealthy and has taken out Nascent Soul-level precious materials multiple times... the Ning family can't be insignificant!"<br/>
<br/>
"Finally, Ning Zhuo comes from the Southern Bean Kingdom, not a citizen of Liangzhu Kingdom. If you dual cultivate with him, it won't drag the Mu General's Mansion into the whirlpool of domestic political struggles."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was silent for a moment before saying, "Uncle Zhang, what you've said makes sense and moves me."<br/>
<br/>
"However, Ning Zhuo comes from a big family and may already have a marriage engagement."<br/>
<br/>
"This dual cultivation involves pure yang and pure yin, which is significant. Many marriage engagements have strict regulations in this regard."<br/>
<br/>
"Uncle Zhang, please find an opportunity in the future to subtly inquire whether he has such intentions."<br/>
<br/>
"However..."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan's tone shifted slightly. "With the imminent war, if I dual cultivate and cause a decline in combat power, there are still many risks."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, I need to rely on myself to achieve merits and revitalize the family. If I rely too much on outsiders, I can't reconcile it in my heart, and the effect of restoring the Mu Mansion's reputation will be greatly diminished."<br/>
<br/>
"So, regardless of whether Young Master Ning is interested, I plan to schedule dual cultivation after this war."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi nodded. "Alas, that's the best scenario. I'm just afraid that with frequent wars and increased pressure, your condition will worsen."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not know that after he left, Zhang Zhongyi and Mulan had this conversation.<br/>
<br/>
The two of them had already schemed to obtain his pure yang energy.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back, he had been pondering Sun Lingtong's proposal —to use Dao wounds to rapidly enhance his physical cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
"I have grandmaster levels in the five elements. This time, cooperating with Senior Zhang Zhongyi, I can indeed turn misfortune into fortune."<br/>
<br/>
"However, this method also has risks."<br/>
<br/>
"Currently, with the imminent war between Liangzhu Kingdom's army and Thousand Peaks Forest, the situation is unstable."<br/>
<br/>
"If something happens to Zhang Zhongyi, and I suffer a Dao wound without finding a skilled healer to cooperate with me, that would be disastrous."<br/>
<br/>
After all, treating Dao wounds requires adapting measures to the time and person, designing spells according to specific circumstances, and preparing herbal medicines.<br/>
<br/>
The treatment method used for Sun Lingtong wouldn't be effective on him after one night.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention using it on himself.<br/>
<br/>
"So, the most reliable method is for me to master advanced medical skills myself."<br/>
<br/>
"As long as my medical skills reach the level required to treat Dao wounds, I can treat myself alone and improve my cultivation through Dao wounds without worry."<br/>
<br/>
"Alas!"<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo sighed deeply. "I'm still too weak, with too little knowledge."<br/>
<br/>
'One regrets having too few books when in need.'<br/>
<br/>
"Learning is endless!"<br/>
<br/>
"If I had advanced medical skills, I could have cured Old Sun long ago and allowed myself to improve my cultivation without worries."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo made up his mind to study medical skills!<br/>
<br/>
Not just for now; he considered more about his mother.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, he wanted to treat the Dao wounds of the Buddha Doctor, Meng Yaoyin. The safest and most reliable way was for him to become a medical expert like Zhang Zhongyi.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered all the way back to the Three Generals' Camp.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he entered, he was informed by a cultivator that Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang had just been looking for him everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then went to the center of the camp, lifted the curtain of the main general's tent, and entered.<br/>
<br/>
At a glance, he saw the yellow face of Liu Er, the red face of Guan Hong, and the black face of Zhang Hei gathered together, their six eyes staring at the ledger on the table.</div>
