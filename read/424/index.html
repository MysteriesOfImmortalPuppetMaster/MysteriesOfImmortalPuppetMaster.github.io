<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 424: Mu Lan plans for Ning Zhuo</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Mu Lan lifted the curtain and walked into the tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Unlike usual, Uncle Zhang Zhongyi, whom she knew, was not preparing herbal medicines but was holding a jade slip in his left hand, immersing his divine sense to examine it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Hearing footsteps, Zhang Zhongyi withdrew his divine sense and looked up to see the female general Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Mu Lan was still dressed in a red military robe, covered with brass armor, looking heroic and valiant. However, at the moment, her brows were slightly furrowed, as if enduring pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"You're here, have a seat." Zhang Zhongyi gestured for Mu Lan to sit beside him. He placed the jade slip on the table, stood up, walked to the workbench, and began preparing the herbal medicine for Mu Lan's injury this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Just now, Ning Zhuo came to me to treat his friend."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"It was a success."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"This jade slip is the treatment method we designed this time; we came up with three plans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"You can take a look," Zhang Zhongyi advised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Mu Lan immediately became interested. "Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Is he the little brother who was sitting next to you in the outer hall last night, Uncle Zhang?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Zhang Zhongyi nodded. "Exactly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">As she picked up the jade slip, Mu Lan said, "I've heard you mention before, Uncle Zhang, that his friend practices the 'Virgin Boy Technique' and has suffered a Dao wound. Treating it is quite troublesome; at the very least, you'd need to invite a master-level earth element expert to specially design specific spells to sort out the earth element principles involved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Mu Lan immediately raised an eyebrow, showing a look of surprise. "Him? How old is he?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Zhang Zhongyi lowered his head and began grinding herbs. "You might not believe it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Ning Zhuo himself possesses a master-level realm in the earth element!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zhang Zhongyi sighed and lamented, "He definitely isn't older than eighteen. Such talent..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Before this, I had treated Dao wounds three times. None of those collaborations were as effortless as this one!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Now that I think about it, Ning Zhuo's own earth element realm might be beyond the master level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Mu Lan listened skeptically and chuckled. "Uncle Zhang praises a young junior so highly; it seems this little brother Ning Zhuo has really caught your eye."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Zhang Zhongyi stopped pounding the herbs, formed a hand seal to examine the composition of the herbal paste, then thoughtfully added a leaf.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He continued grinding while pouring some kind of spiritual liquid into the mixture. He laughed and said, "If I were to tell you that Ning Zhuo also has master-level realms in the wood and fire elements, would you doubt me even more?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The surprise on Mu Lan's face deepened. "Isn't that a bit exaggerated? Master-level in three elements?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">She changed her tone. "However, Uncle Zhang, you've met countless people, and now there's evidence from healing the Dao wound. Then this Ning Zhuo must indeed be a master in three elements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">After a pause, Mu Lan commented, "At such a young age, to have such achievements is truly impressive!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zhang Zhongyi added, "Impressive doesn't even begin to describe it. In the entire Liangzhu Kingdom, you won't find someone like him. He's too young, yet his achievements are astonishingly high."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Also, his friend isn't simple either."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"This time, the treatment could have been complete, but his friend stopped it midway."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"The reason is that the other party actually found some wonderful method during his injury period, using the injury to cultivate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"In my opinion, the effect of this cultivation is outstanding!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"In this way, he can be said to have turned misfortune into fortune; the foundation of his physical body will increase by at least three times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Mu Lan nodded. "Wolves don't dwell with dogs; eagles don't converse with chickens. For such an excellent young man like Ning Zhuo, naturally, there will be equally outstanding cultivators around him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Zhang Zhongyi finished preparing the herbal medicine and poured all the medicinal paste onto a white bandage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">His hands kept moving as he said, "You might not know yet, but this time the imperial envoy secretly played tricks, delaying the distribution of our army's supplies..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Before he could finish, Mu Lan had already nodded and interrupted, "Uncle Zhang, I already know about this matter you're talking about."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"It was Ning Zhuo who helped us resolve the predicament."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">It turned out that since Mu Lan was being harassed, she had ordered her subordinates to secretly keep an eye out and began investigating this military intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">One of her subordinates happened to witness the whole process of Ning Zhuo resolving the issue and immediately reported it to Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Mu Lan said, "This time, we owe him a favor. If there's an opportunity in the future, I will properly thank him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhang Zhongyi picked up the bandage with the medicinal paste and walked over to Mu Lan. "No need to thank him. This time, I waived his consultation fee."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Mu Lan laughed. "Then I should properly thank you, Uncle Zhang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhang Zhongyi immediately shook his head. "No, I should be thanking your father!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Mu Lan's wrist turned slightly, and the armor on her left arm automatically separated, transforming into a brass light that entered her storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Mu Lan rolled up her sleeve, revealing her forearm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">On her forearm, there were many scars, some of which were from the inside out, with skin and flesh turned over, still oozing blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhang Zhongyi used the bandage to wrap Mu Lan's forearm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Then, his palms hovered over Mu Lan's forearm, palms facing the bandage. He then mobilized his mana, infusing it into the herbal medicine to activate its healing properties for Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Zhang Zhongyi took out a set of golden needles and, according to specific acupoints, inserted a dozen needles into Mu Lan's forearm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Waves of sharp pain attacked, but Mu Lan remained calm throughout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Soon, the thick medicinal paste was absorbed, becoming a thin layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">As time passed, the needle tips gradually began to shine with white light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The white light was sharp, disintegrating the needles into powder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Zhang Zhongyi's face darkened, and he said solemnly, "Niece Mu Lan, your condition has worsened considerably recently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"I've warned you not to frequently activate your family-inherited cultivation method, the 'Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"This cultivation method is suitable for men; it's too masculine and sharp. You, as a woman, practicing this method, are highly susceptible to an excess of yang energy, harming your feminine body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Mu Lan shook her head. "Uncle Zhang, with the imminent war, I must train the soldiers daily. Naturally, the use of the 'Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art' will increase, and it will be even more in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"As for this internal injury, I can only slowly nurse it after the war."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zhang Zhongyi sighed. "Your condition is more serious than you think. If this continues, it might erupt on the battlefield."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"You're underestimating it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"In fact, to solve your ailment, there's a very simple method, which is dual cultivation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"You need to find a male cultivator who possesses pure yang energy and engage in dual cultivation with him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"As the saying goes, 'Lonely yin does not generate; solitary yang does not grow.' Harmony between yin and yang is the great way of heaven and earth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"In this way, the overly sharp yang energy can be transferred to the male cultivator. Although in the short term, your cultivation will decrease by several levels, after reducing the burden, the yin energy will no longer be suppressed, naturally flourishing, giving you the opportunity for yin and yang to balance in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Otherwise, relying solely on your own efforts to balance yin and yang has no chance of success."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Your condition has become deeply entrenched; only by borrowing external forces can there be hope of resolving it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Mu Lan nodded. "Uncle Zhang, you mentioned this method last time. After I went back, I thought about it for a long time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">She was the valiant daughter of a general, without any shyness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"To speak frankly, I also want to find a man to dual cultivate with, but after much consideration, there's no suitable candidate." Mu Lan sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhang Zhongyi nodded. "Indeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Finding someone suitable for you is truly difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"First, he must have pure yang energy. However, outstanding individuals often attract many of the opposite sex. The method of dual cultivation is widely known and can quickly increase cultivation. Therefore, whether male or female cultivators, unless under special circumstances, have usually lost their pure yang or pure yin by a certain age."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Secondly, this person must be compatible with your Mu family. I heard that the current king's third son once pursued you, but you rejected him. That was very wise. The third prince lacks military power and has a bad reputation. What he values is the military prestige of your Mu family's General's Mansion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Lastly, this person must be excellent enough; otherwise, associating with mediocre individuals would not be worthy of you. In my opinion, only those at the level of the Twelve Young Masters would prevent you from being wronged."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">In today's cultivation world, many enthusiasts rank young elites on a list called the 'Young Masters List.'</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The 'Young Masters List' has only twelve spots, representing the universally recognized outstanding talents of the current era.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Mu Lan shook her head and smiled. "Uncle Zhang, you think too highly of me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Although my family is the General's Mansion, we're only a powerful family in Liangzhu Kingdom. Liangzhu Kingdom, in the entire world, is a small country, sandwiched between the Northern Wind Kingdom and the Southern Bean Kingdom, blocked on both ends, with little room for upward mobility."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"My father has been bedridden for years; the family has already declined. Even though I have talent, I can't reach for people renowned throughout the world like the Twelve Young Masters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zhang Zhongyi stroked his beard. "Niece, don't underestimate yourself. Since I entered your military camp and observed your training, your attainments are close to Old General Mu's. Your talent in military strategy is extraordinary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Consider that the Twelve Young Masters aren't fixed; people often fall off the list, and new ones ascend. This shows that heroes aren't limited by their origins; many rise from humble beginnings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Even if we can't aim for the Twelve Young Masters right now, there's a Young Master-level candidate right before us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Mu Lan raised her eyebrows and immediately realized whom Zhang Zhongyi was referring to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">She couldn't help but chuckle. "Uncle Zhang, after all this, you want to recommend Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"It's not that I'm arrogant, but you're making an absurd match. He's only at the Foundation Establishment stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Zhang Zhongyi, however, looked serious. "What's wrong with being at the Foundation Establishment stage? Don't underestimate his cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"His cultivation is indeed lower, but you have to consider his age!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"He definitely isn't over eighteen years old. Think about it —a Foundation Establishment cultivator under eighteen. How does such cultivation talent compare to yours?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Mu Lan's expression became solemn. "He's much stronger than me. I only advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage at twenty-one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Zhang Zhongyi stroked his beard. "Niece, your family-inherited cultivation method, the 'Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art,' isn't suitable for you. If you were a man, you could have advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage before eighteen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Let's get back to Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"This person has talent. Although I haven't thoroughly investigated, he may have concealed his true abilities. Even if he's telling the truth, it must be exceptional. In terms of talent alone, he matches your top-tier talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"His comprehension is extremely high. He's a master in fire, earth, and wood elements. Tsk tsk, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Moreover, this person comes from the Ning family of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Although I don't know much about this family, seeing that Ning Zhuo is wealthy and has taken out Nascent Soul-level precious materials multiple times... the Ning family can't be insignificant!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Finally, Ning Zhuo comes from the Southern Bean Kingdom, not a citizen of Liangzhu Kingdom. If you dual cultivate with him, it won't drag the Mu General's Mansion into the whirlpool of domestic political struggles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Mu Lan was silent for a moment before saying, "Uncle Zhang, what you've said makes sense and moves me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"However, Ning Zhuo comes from a big family and may already have a marriage engagement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"This dual cultivation involves pure yang and pure yin, which is significant. Many marriage engagements have strict regulations in this regard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Uncle Zhang, please find an opportunity in the future to subtly inquire whether he has such intentions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"However..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Mu Lan's tone shifted slightly. "With the imminent war, if I dual cultivate and cause a decline in combat power, there are still many risks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Moreover, I need to rely on myself to achieve merits and revitalize the family. If I rely too much on outsiders, I can't reconcile it in my heart, and the effect of restoring the Mu Mansion's reputation will be greatly diminished."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"So, regardless of whether Young Master Ning is interested, I plan to schedule dual cultivation after this war."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Zhang Zhongyi nodded. "Alas, that's the best scenario. I'm just afraid that with frequent wars and increased pressure, your condition will worsen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo did not know that after he left, Zhang Zhongyi and Mu Lan had this conversation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The two of them had already schemed to obtain his pure yang energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">On the way back, he had been pondering Sun Lingtong's proposal —to use Dao wounds to rapidly enhance his physical cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"I have grandmaster levels in the five elements. This time, cooperating with Senior Zhang Zhongyi, I can indeed turn misfortune into fortune."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"However, this method also has risks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Currently, with the imminent war between Liangzhu Kingdom's army and Thousand Peaks Forest, the situation is unstable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"If something happens to Zhang Zhongyi, and I suffer a Dao wound without finding a skilled healer to cooperate with me, that would be disastrous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">After all, treating Dao wounds requires adapting measures to the time and person, designing spells according to specific circumstances, and preparing herbal medicines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The treatment method used for Sun Lingtong wouldn't be effective on him after one night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Not to mention using it on himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"So, the most reliable method is for me to master advanced medical skills myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"As long as my medical skills reach the level required to treat Dao wounds, I can treat myself alone and improve my cultivation through Dao wounds without worry."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Alas!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo sighed deeply. "I'm still too weak, with too little knowledge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">'One regrets having too few books when in need.'</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Learning is endless!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"If I had advanced medical skills, I could have cured Old Sun long ago and allowed myself to improve my cultivation without worries."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo made up his mind to study medical skills!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Not just for now; he considered more about his mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">In the future, he wanted to treat the Dao wounds of the Buddha Doctor, Meng Yaoyin. The safest and most reliable way was for him to become a medical expert like Zhang Zhongyi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo pondered all the way back to the Three Generals' Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">As soon as he entered, he was informed by a cultivator that Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang had just been looking for him everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo then went to the center of the camp, lifted the curtain of the main general's tent, and entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">At a glance, he saw the yellow face of Liu Er, the red face of Guan Hong, and the black face of Zhang Hei gathered together, their six eyes staring at the ledger on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
