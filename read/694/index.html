<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo also unearthed the Enlightenment Diagrams of Ling Shuang and Ao Xue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He sighed, realizing he hadn't had time to study them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Hopefully, I'll find the time someday."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The most valuable items were undoubtedly Gao Sheng's Lost Writings and the Netherworld Penal Code.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">At the bottom of the chest, Ning Zhuo discovered a Myriad Phenomena Cloud Seed, a relic from his time in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The prisoners - Lin You, Wu Hen, and Bone Tomb Daoist - were hardly worth mentioning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Oh, and there was the Heavenly Frost Ghost Mask. If used skillfully, it could unleash Nascent Soul-level combat power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo's expression turned peculiar. "Strange... why didn't I think to use it during the battle against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Not just that, I seemed to have forgotten about the Milk Butterfly Lady too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Was it just the pressure of the moment?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes, unable to fathom why he had forgotten such crucial assets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">It was utterly baffling!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He only remembered them while reviewing his possessions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Overall, Ning Zhuo's wealth was staggering. While not enough to rival an entire nation, it could certainly rival a prosperous town.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Towns typically formed around abundant cultivation resources, attracting cultivators to gather and settle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">At the same time, Ning Zhuo's assets were distributed in a highly skewed manner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">This was evident in several ways.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">For instance, as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he should have primarily used Magic Artifacts. Magic treasures were difficult for cultivators at this stage to fully utilize.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Even Foundation Establishment geniuses like Lin Jinglong and Shen Xi, who received family support, possessed only two or three magic treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Moreover, they rarely used these treasures in combat, typically reserving them to shift the tide of battle or deliver a decisive blow, providing significant assistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">After all, the spiritual energy of a Foundation Establishment cultivator was rarely sufficient to power a magic treasure-level artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo, however, possessed an excessive number of magic treasures, most of which were used for cultivation. He had two defensive magic treasures but none for offense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The vast majority of cultivators invested their resources in Medicinal Pills and talismans. The former were essential for cultivation, while the latter offered cost-effectiveness, providing a far more convenient alternative to painstakingly practicing spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Yet Ning Zhuo had invested the least in these two areas, having never made any significant investments in them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">His talismans, many of which were gifts from others, were all high-quality, some even imbued with spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He had little need for Medicinal Pills, thanks to his National Power Bricks and the personal chef he kept by his side. Both Spirit Food and National Power Bricks produced far fewer side effects than Medicinal Pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After examining his resources, Ning Zhuo grew wary. He murmured to himself, "I need to adjust my approach within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, focusing more on Medicinal Pills and talismans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"For starters, acquiring a batch of pills and talismans for Physical Body cultivation would definitely enhance my physical foundation. This could quickly resolve the issue of my Soul overwhelming my body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"My Spirit Stone reserves are dangerously low... I need to replenish them immediately!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo was once a man of immense wealth, but the battle at White Paper Immortal City had left him penniless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Having finished his assessment, Ning Zhuo retrieved the Floating Ice White Jade Hand and the Weather Orb - Ice Crystal Snow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The large-headed youth let out a wry smile. "My Ning Clan is renowned for its mastery of ice, yet I'm so inept in this area."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"I'm still too weak. There's so much I need to learn."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"To free Yuan Dasheng, I might have to rely on my clan members after all..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The spiritual energy within the Floating Ice White Jade Hand originated from Ning Xiaohui. It had already reached full potency, possessing the Innate Talent: Ice-Jade Hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The spiritual energy within the Weather Orb - Ice Crystal Snow came from Ning Xie. In life, she had been a Clan Elder of the Ning Clan; in death, she became a Foundation Establishment Ghost Cultivator, hidden as the clan's hidden strength. She possessed the Innate Talent: Snow Soul Ice Essence, and her spiritual energy had long since reached full potency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">With such conditions, creating a Mechanical Puppet should have been possible long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo hadn't done so for two reasons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">First, what he had was sufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng and Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu served as his primary combat forces, proving their worth even in the battle against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin remained Ning Zhuo's ultimate trump card!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Floating Ice White Jade Hand provided healing capabilities, while the Weather Orb - Ice Crystal Snow could be deployed to shape the battlefield, offering crucial support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Second, Ning Zhuo lacked the design expertise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Designing a Mechanical Puppet was an immense challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Consider the Mechanical Fire Monkey. Ning Zhuo had secretly devoted countless hours and invested tremendous effort and resources into its creation. Only after countless iterations and adjustments did he finally produce a relatively refined prototype.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Yuan Dasheng's Mechanical Puppet hadn't materialized out of thin air. When designing its mechanical body, Ning Zhuo had built upon the foundation of the Fire Monkey and incorporated templates from the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Even with these advantages, Yuan Dasheng's mechanical form underwent numerous refinements before evolving into the Armored Blood Ape configuration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Simply designing a Mechanical Puppet was no small feat. The true difficulty lay in continuously refining it through practical use, adding or removing mechanical components, and constantly improving its design until it reached maturity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin was created using the design templates from the Lava Immortal Palace, essentially standing on the shoulders of the three great sects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu was a special case. During a period of extraordinary luck, Ning Zhuo stumbled upon scattered design fragments that unexpectedly combined into a complete blueprint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">As it turned out, this design was remarkably effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo had been using this Meng Yehu model ever since.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Now, Ning Zhuo aimed to upgrade both constructs to full Mechanical Puppet forms, facing the daunting challenge of redesigning them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Compared to his previous attempts, he felt far more confident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The reason for this newfound confidence was simple: the Luoshu Pages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This Dao Artifact, the source of all worldly mathematics, allowed Ning Zhuo to save vast amounts of time and energy. With its assistance, he was certain to arrive at the correct calculations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"I need to design and construct these two Mechanical Puppets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Perhaps with their help, I can rescue Yuan Dasheng from the ice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Even if that fails..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Even if that failed, they would still provide crucial reinforcements to Ning Zhuo's mechanical combat capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">With Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin, Heavy Armored Blood Ape Dasheng, and Shadow Blade Night Tiger Yehu all absent, Ning Zhuo desperately needed additional Mechanical Puppets to fill the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Netherworld Envoy - Qi Bai was not up to the task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Despite his powerful mechanical body, equipped with magic treasure-grade mechanical components, his Golden Core from his past life, and his innate talent, his spiritual energy had not reached full potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Moreover, Ning Zhuo's absence during his travels had further diminished Qi Bai's spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Achieving full spiritual energy marked a qualitative shift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Below this threshold, spiritual energy would gradually erode over time. Once attained, however, even if damaged, it could regenerate on its own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Boss, help me!" Ning Zhuo immediately transmitted a mental message to Sun Lingtong through the Life Hanging by a Thread connection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong, deeply immersed in studying the Formation Dao using the Luoshu Pages, was annoyed by the interruption. "What is it now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo didn't immediately propose the Mechanical Puppet plan. Instead, he brought up another matter first: "Boss, I just reviewed my assets and made a startling discovery."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Remember the Heavenly Frost Ghost Mask and the Milk Butterfly Lady?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"During the battle with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, I completely forgot about these invaluable combat assets! That's highly unusual!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Netherworld Envoy - Qi Bai was a different matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">His spiritual energy was insufficient, so even if Ning Zhuo used him, he would have to control him personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Moreover, his combat strength was concentrated in the Soul Dao, making him a risky choice against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord or the Imperial Guard - a case of "teaching a master craftsman his own trade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong's expression turned grave, his eyes flickering with uncertainty. "Little Zhuo, you're right!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"It's a bit frightening."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"I knew about them too, but I'd completely forgotten! I couldn't even warn you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Strange... this is too strange."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Could it be... Qi Luck at work?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. Sun Lingtong had voiced his own suspicion - he believed the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"I'm the savior of White Paper Immortal City, sent here by Yang Heaven."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Perhaps these two would bring me more harm than good. Under the influence of Qi Luck, I might have simply forgotten them entirely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The two discussed the matter further, but their conversation yielded no conclusions. Instead, it only deepened their longing for the art of Qi Luck divination!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"I really want to learn that kind of legacy..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"But my mother told me it would be incredibly difficult to obtain... sigh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong: "Alright, what did you want to see me about?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo explained his purpose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Sun Lingtong immediately agreed without hesitation. He possessed some skill in Mechanical Arts, though not as much as Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">In array formation, Ning Zhuo was similarly less skilled than Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Working together and aided by the Luoshu Pages, the two quickly produced a draft design.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo, following the blueprint like a prescription, sent Old Chef and Gongsun Yan to procure the necessary precious materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Lacking sufficient Spirit Stones, Ning Zhuo first retrieved three Ghost Path Golden Cores and exchanged them at the Universal Commerce Hall for the required funds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Observing Ning Zhuo's extensive purchases, Gongsun Yan guessed his intentions and volunteered, "Young Master, are you planning to refine artifacts? Though my skills are modest, I would be honored to contribute my humble efforts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">After considering Gongsun Yan's offer, Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. "Very well. I'll assign you some tasks. You can handle the refinement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Gongsun Yan received the blueprints, his expression shifting with surprise. So, the Young Master intends to craft mechanical components. Does he also study Mechanism Art?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">This cultivation technique is rare and notoriously difficult to master. Why would the Young Master be interested in it?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"But it seems his Innate Magic Fan incorporates some Mechanism Art techniques?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Gongsun Yan couldn't quite grasp it. In his view, Ning Zhuo's mastery of the Five Elements was unfathomably profound, and such a bright future lay on the Righteous Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Mechanism Art seemed too niche.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Yet these doubts didn't hinder Gongsun Yan's full commitment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"This is the Young Master's first task for me. I must give it my all and achieve perfection!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He reviewed the Mechanism blueprints repeatedly, first selecting the Warm Jade Wheel for refinement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Gongsun Yan's refinement process differed from the norm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He first forged a rough blank, then placed it within the Melting Furnace Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Pressing his palm against the furnace wall, he channeled spiritual energy and his Innate Talent, transforming them into a gentle Heartfire that enveloped the jade wheel blank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Heartfire excelled at precision work. Under Gongsun Yan's skilled manipulation, the Warm Jade Wheel blank was meticulously carved and refined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Gongsun Yan retrieved Cold Steel and tossed it into the furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Immediately, he formed a sword-like gesture with his fingers and swiftly pointed into the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The Cold Steel melted and fused onto the Warm Jade Wheel, forming a honeycomb-like grid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Heartfire remained wrapped around the Warm Jade Wheel. Any excess Cold Steel was precisely burned away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Gongsun Yan successively added three precious materials to the furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The materials melted together, forming a unified, multicolored glaze. This glaze dripped onto the honeycomb grid, creating a three-colored enamel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Gongsun Yan channeled his Heartfire into the Warm Jade Wheel, burning three hundred and sixty microscopic holes within it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">With this step complete, he infused the wheel with his divine sense, forcefully drawing the enamel glaze through the tiny holes and deep into the jade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Finally, the Warm Jade Wheel emerged from the furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">It floated in mid-air, slowly rotating. The outer ring shimmered with swirling frost-like patterns of the three-colored enamel, while warm smoke billowed from the three hundred and sixty holes in the inner ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Exhausted but satisfied, Gongsun Yan declared, "This is the most intricate piece I've ever crafted. I wonder what kind of mechanism the Young Master will assemble with it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Gongsun Yan possessed extensive experience in Artifact Refinement. Though he lacked expertise in Mechanism Art, his keen eye for detail allowed him to recognize the rarity of such finely crafted mechanical components. Moreover, the use of two Golden Core-level precious materials as the primary components suggested that the final mechanical construct would also be at the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"The Young Master and I are both Foundation Establishment cultivators," Gongsun Yan mused. "Attempting to create a Golden Core-level mechanism... Can we truly succeed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Regardless of success or failure, this undertaking is truly grand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">After resting for over two hours, Gongsun Yan had fully restored himself to peak condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Sundial Pillar. He began refining the next mechanical component, named Cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Three days later, Gongsun Yan presented Ning Zhuo with five completed mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo inspected them thoroughly and smiled with satisfaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Looking up at the utterly exhausted Gongsun Yan, he said warmly, "As expected of Heartfire. It's perfectly suited for crafting such intricate artifacts. Thank you for saving me considerable effort."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Gongsun Yan hastily demurred, saying he was delighted to contribute his skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo nodded and urged him to rest well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Disappointed at not seeing Ning Zhuo assemble the mechanism, Gongsun Yan obediently withdrew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">During those three days, Ning Zhuo utilized the three Mechanism Platforms to fabricate the remaining mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Within the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon, two rudimentary Mechanical Puppets were already taking shape. They only lacked the assembly of their crucial components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Soon, the assembly was complete. Ning Zhuo then used Life Hanging by a Thread to extract two wisps of spiritual energy and inserted them into their respective mechanical bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">In the next moment, the mechanical components activated one after another, and the two Mechanical Puppets... came to life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The puppet on the left stood six feet three inches tall, with a slender, graceful figure and feminine features. Her body was covered in tri-colored Enamel Glaze armor, her face a mask of snow-white porcelain, and her dark hair woven from ice silk. Beneath her primary arms were two additional pairs of secondary hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Snow-Colored Lady Hui!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The puppet on the right was also six feet tall, though slightly shorter than Snow-Colored Lady Hui. She too had a feminine form, wearing an ice-mirror helmet designed for reconnaissance. Her hexagonal Profound Ice armor resembled interlocking honeycomb cells, with shoulder guards shaped like roaring ice dragons whose eyes were inlaid with aurora-glazed gems that could unleash freezing blasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Six mechanical orbs hovered around her, their cold steel surfaces covered in ice crystal spiderweb patterns. These orbs could spew icy currents and summon blizzards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Snow Pivot Guard Xie!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Snow-Colored Lady Hui lowered her head, examining her hands - first her primary hands, then her two pairs of secondary hands - as they moved in alternating motions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Snow Pivot Guard Xie, meanwhile, scanned her surroundings before fixing her gaze on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">She slowly lowered herself into a bow, her voice taking on the tone of an older woman as she said, "Greetings... Clan Leader."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
