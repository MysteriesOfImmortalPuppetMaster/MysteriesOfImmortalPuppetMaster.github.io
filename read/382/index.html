<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Hua Guzi was led into the cave dwelling by Ning Zhuo, feeling as if she were in a dream.<br/>
<br/>
"Did I... did I really come in?!" She stood rooted to the spot, her face full of disbelief.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sat down in the main seat first and invited Hua Guzi: "Friend Hua, please have a seat."<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi hesitated for a moment before choosing a position closest to Ning Zhuo and sitting down.<br/>
<br/>
Then, she leaned her body to one side, trying to get as close to Ning Zhuo as possible.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, he sensed extreme emotions such as ecstasy and infatuation from Hua Guzi's heart.<br/>
<br/>
How terrifying!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately regretted bringing Hua Guzi in. But there was no help for it; since he had already done so, he could only steel himself and continue.<br/>
<br/>
With a cold expression, he said, "Friend Hua, to avoid entanglements between us in the future, I'll accept the flower cultivation method you mentioned today."<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi sprang to her feet and rushed before Ning Zhuo, her eyes shining brightly as she hurriedly handed over a jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
"Stop right there." Ning Zhuo quickly extended his hand to prevent Hua Guzi from getting too close to him.<br/>
<br/>
He channeled his spiritual power to take the jade slip from Hua Guzi's hand.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi was immediately disappointed, unable to touch Ning Zhuo's fingers in the process.<br/>
<br/>
"That's enough." Ning Zhuo looked at Hua Guzi, who was now within arm's reach, feeling that she might pounce on him at any moment.<br/>
<br/>
If Hua Guzi had shown hostility, killing intent, or the will to fight, Ning Zhuo would have found it easy to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was that Hua Guzi was extremely friendly towards Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
This made it very difficult for Ning Zhuo to handle the situation.<br/>
<br/>
He was only sixteen years old, and such a person and trouble were a bit too much for him to handle.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could only remain on edge, speaking coldly: "Alright, I've received the item. You may leave now."<br/>
<br/>
"Leave already?!" Hua Guzi was extremely reluctant and unwilling to part.<br/>
<br/>
"Please leave, Friend Hua." Ning Zhuo's voice was icy, and the smile had vanished from his face.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi's heart raced violently. Being rejected by Ning Zhuo in this manner made her feel a surge of exhilarating humiliation from the depths of her heart!<br/>
<br/>
"How awful, how hateful, how infuriating!"<br/>
<br/>
"To treat me like this!! Not even considering me worthy of his attention!!"<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi was driven out of the cave dwelling by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Her eyes were bloodshot, filled with red veins, and her entire body trembled slightly.<br/>
<br/>
There was anger, hatred, and frustration, but also a strange sense of satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, the feeling of satisfaction surged like a flood, overwhelming all negative emotions.<br/>
<br/>
She glanced back at Ning Zhuo's cave dwelling, let out a whimper, and ran away with a crimson face.<br/>
<br/>
"She's finally gone." Ning Zhuo wiped the cold sweat from his brow, feeling quite parched.<br/>
<br/>
He sat in the main seat, closed his eyes to rest, and only after adjusting his breathing did his emotions settle down.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the jade slip in his hand, he felt that this flower cultivation method was extraordinarily weighty!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo projected his divine sense to investigate the contents of the jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
Night Wandering Grass.<br/>
<br/>
The leaves were deep green with faint purple luminescence at the edges, shaped like a sunflower when fully opened. Each leaf was covered with tiny silver veins that emitted a faint glow under moonlight at night, as if stars had fallen upon the leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Its stem was long and straight, with a smooth surface showing a faint purple luster. At the lower part of the stem were some tiny silver scales that could reflect weak light.<br/>
<br/>
It would bloom small purple flowers during specific periods, with translucent petals and a deep blue crystal in the center of the flower, resembling the night sky.<br/>
<br/>
This specific period was the Ghost Walking Festival.<br/>
<br/>
During the festival, ghost gates around the world would open, allowing ghosts from the netherworld to walk freely in the mortal realm, seeking revenge or settling grudges.<br/>
<br/>
Deities from the netherworld would also quickly mobilize to stop and imprison these ghosts who wished to commit wrongdoings. Among them, the Night Patrolling God was the main figure.<br/>
<br/>
When the Night Patrolling God became tired from his rounds, he would often rest on the Night Wandering Grass to catch his breath and relieve fatigue.<br/>
<br/>
This was the origin of the Night Wandering Grass's name.<br/>
<br/>
To cultivate Night Wandering Grass, one needed a dark place rich in yin energy. Regarding spiritual energy, it required a place where spiritual energy was depleted during the day but abundant at night, with a very noticeable difference.<br/>
<br/>
For fertilizer, one should choose night dew, star river spiritual liquid, night-blooming jasmine...<br/>
<br/>
Night Wandering Grass, Purple Smoke Orchid, Silver Butterfly Flower, Soul Yearning Flower, Rosy Peach, Heart-Burning Flower, and Poison Flame Chrysanthemum ‚Äì a total of seven exotic flowers and grasses.<br/>
<br/>
The entire content of the jade slip was the cultivation method for these seven exotic flowers and grasses. Each one was detailed and practical, with step-by-step instructions that could be followed easily.<br/>
<br/>
"Soul Yearning Flower?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's gaze paused slightly; he knew about this flower.<br/>
<br/>
Eleven years ago, a demonic cultivator named Hua Qianhun had come to the outskirts of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
He had set up a scheme, planting flowers in a valley near the city outskirts, causing a sea of flowers to spread across the mountains and valleys, creating rumors of a miraculous flower appearing.<br/>
<br/>
Many people were attracted and entered the sea of flowers, only to have their souls extracted to become flower fertilizer. In the end, a miraculous flower did appear, named the Soul Yearning Flower. Hua Qianhun immediately plucked it and quickly fled.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo became interested and skipped the descriptions of the intermediate flowers, prioritizing the review of the Soul Yearning Flower.<br/>
<br/>
In the jade slip, the appearance of the Soul Yearning Flower was described in detail.<br/>
<br/>
Its petals were semi-transparent, changing color with the light, ranging from crystal clear to deep purple. Each petal seemed to have souls moving within it, and when a breeze blew, the ripples of the soul's movements could be seen with the naked eye.<br/>
<br/>
Its flower center was deep black, emitting a faint blue fluorescence, like a pair of deep-set eyes staring directly into one's heart.<br/>
<br/>
The leaves were a dark green color, giving people a creepy and horrifying feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the soil requirements, Ning Zhuo indeed saw that the Soul Yearning Flower needed to be planted in soil containing a large amount of soul essence. The best choice was an ancient battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
But up and down Fire Persimmon Mountain, countless beings had died, so the soil indeed met the requirements in terms of soul essence.<br/>
<br/>
The fertilizer for the Soul Yearning Flower was soul essence, and it had to be fresh soul essence.<br/>
<br/>
The specific planting location also required careful consideration. It needed to be planted at a place where yin and yang converged, neither too gloomy nor too sunny. The best location was deep in a valley, where yin energy was relatively heavy but could still receive a small amount of sunlight.<br/>
<br/>
There was also a sacrificial technique.<br/>
<br/>
The object of the sacrifice was the Soul Yearning Flower itself. Through the sacrificial spell, souls were offered to nourish the flower, promoting its growth.<br/>
<br/>
The jade slip also mentioned its effects.<br/>
<br/>
This Soul Yearning Flower naturally purified external soul essence and could increase the foundation of one's soul without side effects.<br/>
<br/>
If used as the main ingredient to create a Soul Yearning Pill, its medicinal effects would be far superior to consuming it raw, at least three times stronger.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo had read all the contents of the jade slip, he found that the Rosy Peach had the highest market value. However, the most suitable for the Ning family branch was the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum.<br/>
<br/>
This chrysanthemum needed to be planted in a place of intense flames and heat, with the best location being inside an active volcano where fire poison permeated. The area needed to have raging flames year-round, with ground fire erupting, which would help the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum absorb the power of fire poison.<br/>
<br/>
If the location was good, the soil for cultivating the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum wouldn't need processing. But if it was slightly inferior, one needed to use refined waste soil from cooled volcanic lava, mixed with hundred-year fire poison rock powder and thousand-year flame vine ash, following the refining method to create Flame Poison Fire Soil.<br/>
<br/>
One could set up a Raging Flame Poison Fire Array to concentrate fire poison energy and enhance the toxicity and fire power of the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum.<br/>
<br/>
In the jade slip, there were detailed instructions on how to set up the Raging Flame Poison Fire Array.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the array eye needed to use a top-grade fire attribute crystal as the core, which could attract and gather fierce flames.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for the four fire gates in the four directions, each gate needed to be set with a fire spirit lamp, with fire essence burning constantly in the lamp, illuminating all directions.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, for the eight poison positions, each needed to raise a fire poison copper-scaled snake to transform fire poison energy.<br/>
<br/>
During the cultivation stage of the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum, after the flower buds had grown, one could draw talismans on the buds at appropriate times.<br/>
<br/>
The talismans were named Poison Smoke Talisman and Raging Flame Talisman. If the toxicity of the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum was slightly less, one would use the Poison Smoke Talisman to increase toxicity. If the fire attribute power was weak, one would use the Raging Flame Talisman to enhance its fierceness.<br/>
<br/>
In the jade slip, the specific methods for drawing the Poison Smoke Talisman and Raging Flame Talisman were also recorded.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, the Poison Smoke Talisman needed to be drawn with a mixture of red blood ink and fire poison insect essence to form a specific talisman ink.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Raging Flame Talisman, it was best to write it under the scorching sun at high noon, absorbing the radiance of the fierce sun.<br/>
<br/>
The jade slip recorded: If conditions were met, one could also use Flame Poison Powder as fertilizer. This pill mainly used Poison Flame Chrysanthemum petals as the main ingredient, combined with highly poisonous medicinal materials such as flame scorpion heart, fire poison lizard gallbladder, and red spirit grass.<br/>
<br/>
It had four major effects: increasing poison, protecting roots, strengthening stems, and adding fierceness.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivation of Poison Flame Chrysanthemum required little water, but it couldn't be without it. When irrigating, one needed to use natural hot spring water, and it couldn't be cold, needing to maintain a high temperature.<br/>
<br/>
During the growth process of the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum, it also needed to be placed under the scorching sun for exposure at regular intervals, absorbing the fierce yang to neutralize yin nature, only then could it grow strong and robust.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo studied it carefully and couldn't help but have many feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivating spiritual plants, abbreviated as cultivation, was one of the hundred arts of immortal cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
To do well in this field actually involved knowledge from a multitude of other disciplines. For example, using pills, setting up arrays, and drawing talismans.<br/>
<br/>
From this, one could see that the hundred arts of immortal cultivation were not isolated from each other, but interconnected, with each containing elements of the others.<br/>
<br/>
It was just that one art was the main focus, with other skills playing a secondary role.<br/>
<br/>
Only the art of mechanisms had no distinction between primary and secondary. The hundred arts of immortal cultivation, and even cultivation itself, were integrated in the form of mechanical creations, manifesting as one.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the art of mechanisms was difficult to learn and master, but if one truly succeeded in learning it, the upper limit was very high, able to integrate the hundred arts of immortal cultivation into one, achieving great accomplishment!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo only had a slight understanding of the art of cultivation and was not proficient in it, truly an outsider.<br/>
<br/>
The Seven Flower Cultivation Secret from Hua Guzi opened his eyes wide, making him wonder if the countless herb cultivations of the Myriad Medicine Sect were also like this.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could only know what these cultivation classics said, but not understand why they were done this way.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm still too shallow."<br/>
<br/>
"The existing content is right before my eyes, yet I can't deduce the reasons why it's done this way."<br/>
<br/>
"Learning is endless, I still need to study more!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed and carefully put away the Seven Flower Secret Record.<br/>
<br/>
He had no intention of sending the jade slip back to the Ning family branch through the courier station.<br/>
<br/>
It was too unsafe!<br/>
<br/>
This kind of industry secret was like a goose that laid golden eggs; it had to be delivered personally.<br/>
<br/>
Once the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum cultivation was set up, the Ning family branch would have another continuous new source of income.<br/>
<br/>
For the entire branch family, and for Ning Zhuo himself, this was a beneficial thing.<br/>
