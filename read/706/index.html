<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo held the Intent Comprehension Brush, examining it closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The brush handle was made of yellow-green River Luo Jade, its natural patterns intertwining to form faint trigrams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The brush cap was Kai Wood, scorched with lightning marks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The brush tip was crafted from Autumn Frost White Yak Hair, shimmering with silver glints when held up to the light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The entire brush radiated the aura of a magic treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo, Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran had discussed the brush extensively during their banquet, uncovering much about its history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Crafting an Intent Comprehension Brush inevitably invites calamity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"This Golden Core-level brush must have endured at least three tribulations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"The most fundamental is the Heart Demon Tribulation, which tests the Confucian cultivator's Literary Heart. Additionally, River Luo Jade, when extracted from water, often attracts Thunder Tribulation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"The Thunderstruck Kai Wood used for the brush cap suggests that the River Luo Jade suffered Thunder Tribulation during extraction, lacking proper protection and becoming tainted by thunder Qi. The thunderstruck wood was likely used to compensate for this material flaw."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"As for the nature of the third tribulation..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Given Ning Zhuo's current mastery of Confucian cultivation and artifact refinement, he couldn't discern it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">During the banquet, Ning Zhuo showed the treasured brush to Bai Liu Kong and the other two cultivators, but none of them could discern any peculiarities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This lack of understanding didn't deter Ning Zhuo from using it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He immediately channeled his Five Elements Spiritual Power into the Intent Comprehension Brush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">As a non-Confucian cultivator, Ning Zhuo's Five Elements Spiritual Power wasn't perfectly compatible with the brush. While this might affect its effectiveness, it was still usable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">As spiritual energy flowed into the brush, its seven-inch, two-fen shaft quickly emitted a soft, jade-like glow - warm, clear, and luminous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Tiny sparks of electricity flickered around the brush's ferrule.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The silver light at the brush's tip intensified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo had already reached a preliminary agreement with Bai Jiyun and Kong Ran, which included a requirement for authentic calligraphy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Now eager to test the brush, he considered his options and first retrieved a tiger skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The tiger skin was heavy, thick, and exceptionally large, adorned with two massive, tattoo-like talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This was the trophy he had claimed after slaying a Tiger Demon during his conflict with the Pi Family cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had both studied the two talismans on the tiger skin, but their efforts yielded little insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Let's see if using the Treasure Brush will work this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo began by copying the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The talisman was nearly perfectly circular, as large as a millstone, and appeared to have been written in blood. Its surface now resembled dried blood, a dark crimson hue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Upon closer inspection, flame-like patterns could be discerned within the dark crimson lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Having studied this Demonic Talisman once before, Ning Zhuo was already familiar with its structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He started copying the talisman, beginning with the Talisman Core. The upper half of the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman's core resembled a drop of blood, while the lower half resembled a burning flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As Ning Zhuo copied the core, he immediately felt an eerie impulse and blurted out, "Blood burns fire, fire boils blood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">From the Talisman Core extended the main veins of the talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Blood-Burning Surge Talisman's main veins consisted of three thick, deep crimson Cinnabar lines that radiated outward from the center, twisting slightly as they spread toward the periphery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">While copying these veins, Ning Zhuo felt as if he were tracing three boiling blood vessels, pulsing rhythmically with a heartbeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Twisting, boiling, like magma surging within..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Finally came the auxiliary patterns. Between the three main veins, intricate, closely packed lines filled the spaces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">As Ning Zhuo copied the patterns, he experienced two distinct sensations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">One felt like a strong wind brushing against his face, leaving a tingling, numbing sensation. The other felt like the very fabric of space cracking, shattering its limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">From this, he immediately understood: "There must be two types of talismanic patterns here. One is the Wind-Thunder Pattern, and the other is the Space-Rending Pattern."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">This was a depth of understanding he had never reached in his previous studies of talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">After a moment, Ning Zhuo glanced at the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman on the Talisman Paper, making his final assessment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The talismanic structure was identical to the one on the tiger hide, at least in appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo lightly traced his fingers across the talisman's surface. He could sense a volatile energy about to explode from the bold, powerful lines, along with the resolve and demonic intent behind the blood sacrifice required to achieve extreme speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He channeled spiritual energy into the paper and ignited it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The paper burned directly, showing no reaction whatsoever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The talisman had failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo wasn't surprised in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He had only copied it once, gaining a deeper understanding of its Intent and slightly enhancing his foundational knowledge of talisman crafting. This also included the Paper Art Technique, though his gains in that area were even more meager.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo continued to copy the Thousand-Layered Scale Skin Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">This Demonic Talisman was about the size of a washbasin, not perfectly circular like the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman, but octagonal with sharp, distinct edges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The runes weren't dark red but a deep, earthy yellow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">It was immediately clear that this talisman would be difficult to copy. The primary veins were too prominent, almost overshadowing the core. The Talisman Core itself was tiny yet intricately connected to its surroundings by countless thread-like patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">To copy this talisman, one had to work from the outside in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo began to copy it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The main body of the Thousand-Layered Scale Skin Talisman consisted of countless meticulously arranged rhomboid talismanic patterns, each layer stacked upon the previous one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">As he copied, wisps of Intent seeped into Ning Zhuo's mind, making him feel as if he were touching actual gemstone scales.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">As these rhomboid patterns spiraled inward, Ning Zhuo gradually reached the Talisman Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Surrounding the core were three distinct talismanic patterns, each forming a concentric ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The rings appeared nearly identical, differing only in size.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yet as Ning Zhuo copied them, he sensed three distinct Intents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The outer ring felt like swirling waves, the middle ring like a towering mountain peak, and the inner ring like a slowly moving land turtle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The final patterns filled the gaps between the scales and the triple concentric rings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">As Ning Zhuo meticulously copied the design, he felt the surrounding space ripple with faint vibrations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"It seems these are all variations of the Void Ripple Pattern," he murmured. "These patterns enhance resistance to spells."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">In the final analysis, Ning Zhuo gazed at the completed Thousand-Layered Scale Skin Talisman on the talisman paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Unlike the Blood-Burning Surge Talisman he had previously attempted, this Demonic Talisman's patterns were intricate, precise, and complex, exuding an aura of order and solidity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The overlapping layers of rhomboid patterns, combined with the triple concentric rings at the Talisman Core, conveyed an Intent of "a thousand layers of force deflection, impervious to myriad methods." This aspect had completely eluded Ning Zhuo during his earlier studies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He ignited the talisman paper with spiritual energy, and as expected, he suffered a second failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Yet he experienced no backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This was the advantage of using talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The talisman itself absorbed the consequences of failed spellcasting, sparing the cultivator from harm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">After copying two Demonic Talismans in succession, Ning Zhuo closed his eyes, sat cross-legged, and began to recuperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">His head throbbed, his spiritual essence and mental energy were severely depleted, and his body and mind felt utterly exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Using the Intent Comprehension Brush for imitation consumes far more energy than I imagined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"My Physical Body and Soul's foundation surpass those of most Foundation Establishment cultivators. If I can barely sustain it, others might only be able to imitate one Demonic Talisman before needing to rest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Still, the imitation effect is truly remarkable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"My understanding of Demonic Talismans now surpasses the combined knowledge I gained from all my previous research with Big Brother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Yet when Ning Zhuo tried to articulate this, he struggled to find the words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This was Intent - information that defied complete expression through language or writing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">It can only be comprehended through intuition, not conveyed through words!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">True masters could explain it simply, but the subtle nuances were invariably lost in translation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After a brief rest, Ning Zhuo returned to his peak condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He attempted another imitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">This time, instead of tiger skin, he retrieved a Jade Slip from his Storage Belt: the Ice Sculpture Secret Manual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This classic text on mechanisms, personally gifted to Ning Zhuo by Ning Jiufan, detailed the art of ice sculpture mechanisms - Ning Jiufan's primary field of study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo had read the Ice Sculpture Mechanism Manual several times before, recognizing its unique and ingenious design.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">All the ice sculptures were carved from a single massive block of ice, formed as a unified whole rather than assembled from separate mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Therefore, to sculpt the desired forms, one needed to master the art of carving, one of the Hundred Crafts of Cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Inner Carving Technique, in particular, required etching array patterns and talismans onto the inner surfaces of the ice sculptures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo's carving skills were relatively weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">As a result, he had only treated the Classic Text as a reference book, never delving deeply into its intricacies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">During his travels, he simply hadn't had the time to focus on such minor details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This time, his primary goal in copying the manual was to test his limits and observe how pushing himself to the brink affected his comprehension of Intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo continued copying until he could barely endure it any longer. His Soul grew weak, his divine sea felt utterly empty, and each subsequent thought struggled to form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He had only managed to copy slightly more than ten percent of the entire Classic Text.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Yet Ning Zhuo felt he had gained a profound understanding of carving techniques, mechanism arts, and the ice element itself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">However, he found it difficult to assess the precise extent of these gains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">After their second rest stop, Ning Zhuo proactively contacted Sun Lingtong: "Big Brother, great news!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He shared Wen Ruanyu's letter, his participation in Chu Xuangui's Flying Cloud Minor Trial, and his subsequent discussions with Kong Ran and Bai Jiyun regarding potential trades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sun Lingtong was genuinely delighted and immediately began strategizing with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Little Zhuo, you're on the right track. The Confucian school excels at learning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"To maximize your gains, leverage the Luoshu Page and Spirit Hidden Willow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"You should also acquire medicinal pills and talismans to support your cultivation. Consider Wisdom Spring Surge Powder, Enlightenment Spirit Tea, Heart Mirror Dustless Talisman, and Sudden Enlightenment Bodhi Incense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"If your trade with Kong Ran succeeds, perhaps you can use the Early Wisdom Innate Talent Method to accelerate your comprehension and learning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel excited by the prospects Sun Lingtong outlined. "Big Brother, those medicinal pills and talismans are all rare treasures, and they come at a steep price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"There are only tens of thousands of Intent Comprehension Brushes in the entire cultivation world. Each one requires enduring a calamity during its creation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"The Spirit Hidden Willow is also an exceptionally rare spirit plant, found in only one percent of such flora."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Early Wisdom's innate talent goes without saying - one in ten thousand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Even an incomplete Luoshu Page is still a Dao Artifact."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"With all these factors combined, my learning speed should skyrocket! But I can't predict exactly how much it will improve."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">In short, the future looks bright!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo retrieved his brush rest box.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">This was the Cloud Han Brush Rest Box, about twelve inches long, four inches wide, and two inches thick, rectangular and flat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Its rounded corners flowed like Stellar Tracks, radiating warmth and inclusiveness without a hint of sharpness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">A gentle push would slide the lid open smoothly in the opposite direction, without a sound. When closed, it fit seamlessly, leaving only a faint, luminous gap like a sliver of the Heavenly River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The Intent Comprehension Brush's jade-like glow had faded to a dull, dark luster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo placed the brush in the box to rest and recover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He then began his daily cultivation routine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">As usual, the core components were physical body training and comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">His physical body's foundation continued to steadily improve with the aid of the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">However, his progress in comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art remained slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"If only I could obtain the original True Scripture of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art, I wouldn't have this problem," Ning Zhuo sighed bitterly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Within the Lava Immortal Palace, the three sect elders had left behind original True Scriptures for each Cultivation Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Intent contained within these True Scriptures was True Intent! Thus, the three original True Scriptures were three True Scriptures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Even without the Intent Comprehension Brush, ordinary cultivators who came into contact with them would receive an infusion of True Intent, causing their mastery of the three Cultivation Arts to skyrocket!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"These three True Scriptures were originally hidden within the bodies of the Buddha Physician, Demon General, and Dao Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"By a twist of fate, Yuan Dasheng mistakenly used the True Scripture of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art as a refining material."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"My mother is residing within the Buddha Physician. Yet I haven't found the True Scripture of the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual there either."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"As for the True Scripture of the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art within the Dao Master... I don't really need it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo's mastery of the Five Elements realm was already exceptionally profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">His bottleneck lay with the Demonic Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"I'm truly not suited for cultivating Demonic Arts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"When will I break through the Red Flower Dharma Aspect? Perhaps I can interrogate Lin You for the Demonic Heart Method as a crucial reference."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Time flowed onward, and night deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Having finished his comprehension of the Cultivation Art, Ning Zhuo felt restless and couldn't fall asleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">He decided to create some ice blocks and try his hand at sculpting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Failure, failure, failure...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">A string of failures plunged him into deep thought. "Though I've grasped the Intent, the actual execution falls far short of the standard I envisioned!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"My vision is too lofty, but my skills are too crude. I need extensive practice and hands-on experience to make real progress in my craft."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">As this realization struck him, a sudden flash of spiritual light sparked in Ning Zhuo's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">There's a crucial point here...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">But just then, the Cave Residence Token vibrated slightly, signaling an attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Ning Zhuo's train of thought was abruptly interrupted, leaving him startled and suspicious. "How could my rented cave residence within the Myriad Manifestations Sect be under attack?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Upon inspection, he found the attack was minimal - a Mechanical Puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Hidden within the puppet's body was a letter from Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">In the letter, Ban Ji bluntly challenged Ning Zhuo to a sparring match. The victor would claim a trophy from the loser as a reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"Who is Ban Ji?" Ning Zhuo wondered, puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">"Someone, investigate his background," Ning Zhuo instructed Old Chef, summoning him with a wave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">As he pondered further, Ning Zhuo couldn't recapture that fleeting spiritual light from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"Ban Ji has misled me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, a flicker of resentment rising in his heart. Yet, he also felt a growing premonition: Ban Ji seemed to hold significant importance for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">If left unchecked, this matter could severely hinder his progress within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
