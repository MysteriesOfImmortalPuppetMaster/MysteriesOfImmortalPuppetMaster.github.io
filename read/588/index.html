<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Meng... Senior Sister?" Ning Zhuo had an indifferent expression, his tone calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Only Sun Lingtong, who truly knew him well, was aware of how turbulent the undercurrents were beneath Ning Zhuo's calm surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Wen Ruanyu, unsuspecting, said: "Yes, she is indeed my Senior Sister, a True Inheritor disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"The reason I am stationed long-term in White Paper Immortal City is because of the Ghost Tide crisis."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Over thirty years ago, White Paper Immortal City faced the danger of annihilation due to a Ghost Tide, and thus requested aid from the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"It coincided with that session of the Flying Cloud Assembly, so I followed Senior Sister Meng here, experienced some perils, and successfully helped White Paper Immortal City overcome the crisis of annihilation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Senior Sister Meng's strength was extraordinary. At that time, the White Paper Immortal City Lord was also in extremely poor condition; it was almost Senior Sister Meng alone who turned the tide, ultimately changing the entire situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">As Wen Ruanyu spoke to this point, a look of admiration couldn't help but appear on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Flying Cloud Assembly?" Ning Zhuo secretly noted this point, his tone slightly hurried, "Oh? Such a hero, truly admirable. May I venture to ask for her full name?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Wen Ruanyu: "Senior Sister Meng Yaoyin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo fell silent for a moment, his heart felt as if it had been struck hard!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He secretly gritted his teeth, striving to suppress his slightly trembling breath, and said as calmly as possible: "So that's how it is. Since she is a hero who turned the tide, it's no wonder a statue of her was erected in White Paper Immortal City in commemoration."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Wen Ruanyu smiled faintly: "In this matter, I played a part."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Back then, White Paper Immortal City suffered the frenzied attacks of the Ghost Tide, and nearly half the city fell. In order to recover the lost territory of the City South, Senior Sister Meng went into seclusion with the White Paper Immortal City Lord for seven days and seven nights without sleep, discussing related formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Afterwards, she personally led us, fought our way back here, and set up a formation here. We followed her, fought desperately here for three days and three nights. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">We finally held the formation, and bridged it into the immortal city's foundation, integrating it with the original immortal city grand formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"After overcoming the Ghost Tide, before Senior Sister Meng left this place, she made multiple arrangements. She left behind the talisman paper giant statue she had crafted in the immortal city, to serve as the core of this formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Following her instructions, I managed various affairs in the city. Because everyone in the city, of both high and low status, was grateful to Senior Sister Meng, I had a flash of inspiration and proposed making the talisman paper giant statue in Senior Sister Meng's likeness. This matter easily gained widespread support, and soon, it was done."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo took a light breath, falling into a state of reverie, his tone slightly probing: "Such a paper statue must surely possess considerable power. Meng... Senior actually took the initiative to leave it behind. Such noble character and integrity, it makes one feel admiration."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"My Senior Sister Meng is more than just noble character and integrity!" Wen Ruanyu shook his head; the more he mentioned Meng Yaoyin, the more a radiance emanated from the depths of his heart, feeling honored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"You don't know how perilous it was when we resisted the Ghost Tide back then."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Several times, the city walls were breached, and the situation was precarious. To overcome the difficulties, Senior Sister Meng even went so far as to consume her own lifespan, unleashing forbidden techniques to salvage the situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"What? Consumed her own lifespan?!" Ning Zhuo finally couldn't hold back, his tone changed, his eyes narrowed, trying his best to hide the gaze that was gradually becoming dangerous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Yes." Wen Ruanyu was immersed in his own memories, not noticing Ning Zhuo's unusual state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He continued: "It was precisely Senior Sister Meng's immense dedication and sacrifice that ultimately saved the entire White Paper Immortal City. Therefore, although Senior Sister Meng primarily cultivates Mechanical Arts, I have always believed she is more suited for Confucian cultivation. The core tenet of Confucianism is the character 'Ren' (benevolence). Senior Sister Meng's benevolence is not petty benevolence, but great benevolence; it is the great benevolence and great love that considers the lives of the entire White Paper Immortal City, willingly sacrificing herself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, his eyes slightly reddening: "Senior Meng showed such benevolence to the world. Although this is the first time I've heard of it, I don't know why, but I feel from the bottom of my heart that she is precisely the kind of person who could do such things."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Wen Ruanyu nodded repeatedly: "Senior Sister Meng not only possessed extraordinary strength, courage and strategy, great benevolence and great love, but also had exceptional foresight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Jiao Ma, I don't know if it's appropriate to call you this, but you should be new here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo's heart stirred, knowing that just now, by his own power, he had captured three Golden Core Ghost Generals alive, causing Wen Ruanyu to already strongly suspect his identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo had no intention of revealing his true identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Currently, only two people in White Paper Immortal City knew his true identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Because of the unknown factor that the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth posed, Ning Zhuo did not want to expose his real identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Wen Ruanyu did not dwell on this point, but continued: "Therefore, probably don't know, but the arrangements Senior Sister Meng left in White Paper Immortal City profoundly changed the structure of this city and protected it many times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The White Paper Immortal City Lord's condition is worsening year by year."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Senior Sister left behind many ingenious arrangements, such as setting up the Ink Pool to educate the city residents, arranging treasures to attract others to actively participate in the city defense battles and so on. Relying on these, White Paper Immortal City smoothly weathered multiple subsequent Ghost Tides."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Sigh, it's still the White Paper Immortal City Lord's worsening condition that has dragged us down. If it were another normal Nascent Soul cultivator, we wouldn't have fallen into the current predicament of internal troubles and external threats. Even Senior Sister's giant statue was not well protected... This is all my fault!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Speaking to this point, Wen Ruanyu showed a look of deep self-reproach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Alright." Wen Ruanyu scanned the surrounding mess, his anxiety gradually increasing, "Let's leave this place for others to repair. You have established battle merits this time; you should go back and report to the City Lord, there will surely be rewards issued!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"The City Lord's paper clone is still reliable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">At this moment, Sun Lingtong suddenly sent a divine sense transmission: "Little Zhuo, be careful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"The White Paper City Lord once went into seclusion with your mother for seven days and seven nights to discuss formations, and even fought side by side with her. But when you revealed your identity, she still deceived you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"She gave you three talismans and told you to leave through the South Gate; she's obviously plotting against you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"We don't need to get bogged down here; just leaving would secure us an invincible position."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo nodded: "Boss, you're right. The White Paper Immortal City Lord is plotting against me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He then shook his head again: "But my mother paid such a huge price to protect this immortal city. As her son, shouldn't I do my best to act and safeguard her past achievements?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Of course, if the overall situation becomes impossible to salvage, like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, we will seize the opportunity to withdraw without hesitation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"But now, the White Paper Immortal City Lord knows I am the son of an old acquaintance, and my mother gained such strong recognition from all the city's residents. What kind of support will she give me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Putting the future aside for now, I captured these three Golden Core level Ghost Generals alive for her; there should at least be some recognition for that, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Also..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"I am very curious about what treasures my mother arranged in White Paper Immortal City. No matter what they are, I really want to get them back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong nodded: "Little Zhuo, you understand our priorities better than I do, so what you propose is best."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Before persuading him, he already knew what choice Ning Zhuo would make.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Since it was his sworn brother's decision, he would naturally support it wholeheartedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">But at the same time, he also added a sentence: "I'll warn you in advance: If in the future, Little Zhuo, you lose your head and act emotionally, I will forcibly intervene and bring you back alive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo made an 'en' sound: "Boss, I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Wen Ruanyu issued some instructions for the cultivators present to repair this place, while he himself took Ning Zhuo and immediately returned to the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">They proceeded unimpeded all the way, directly arriving at the inner hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Wen Ruanyu said to Ning Zhuo: "I will go in first to report. You stay here and don't move around; you will definitely be summoned for an audience later."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Just as he finished speaking, a paper figure attendant pushed open the door, walked before the two, and brought the City Lord clone's order: "Lord Wen, please wait a moment. The City Lord wishes to see Young Master Jiao Ma alone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Wen Ruanyu: ?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Then Senior Wen, I shall go in first." Ning Zhuo cupped his hands towards Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After witnessing Ning Zhuo's combat strength, Wen Ruanyu immediately returned the gesture, and with a smile on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo entered the inner hall and saw the City Lord's paper clone looking into a huge mirror, braiding long hair for herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">She kneaded talisman paper into thin long strips, then stuck them onto the top of her head, quickly using spiritual energy to bond them tightly together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Sigh! Nowadays, White Paper Immortal City is beset by internal troubles and external threats, precarious like being tossed in wind and rain. I am weighed down by worries, unable to sleep peacefully and have lost much hair these days."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">While speaking, the paper clone turned around and looked at Ning Zhuo: "Little Ning Zhuo, you truly are Meng Yaoyin's son. Like your mother, you have helped me greatly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo frowned slightly, first performed a salutation, then said: "Lord City Lord arranged things cleverly, letting this youngster know of my mother's past actions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Those three attacking Golden Core level Ghost Generals have all been captured alive by me, which can be considered as not failing Your Lordship's entrustment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Additionally, Lord Wen reminded me, saying that your side would definitely give me a large reward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The paper clone paused for a moment, then smiled lightly: "On this point, you are a bit different from your mother. However, I quite appreciate your frankness and directness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Little Wen spoke correctly, I will certainly reward you greatly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"But before that, I still have many secrets I need to tell you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"'Ghost tides surge, White Paper in peril,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">A lone goose carries a candle, piercing heavenl's veil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The guest star appears in the north of the literary pivot,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Myriad Manifestations Lamp ignites, shattering calamity.' </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">This prophecy poem was written by Sang Le Youling before her death."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">"I believe, this poem very likely pertains to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">"Little Ning Zhuo, you are very likely our city's savior. Just like over thirty years ago, your mother was White Paper Immortal City's great savior!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">The paper clone deliberately paused, specifically leaving time for Ning Zhuo to receive and react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">It was as if something gently exploded in Ning Zhuo's mind, and he blurted out: "No wonder Lord Wen specifically took that Yang Weida away separately earlier."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Pausing for a moment, Ning Zhuo said: "From my heart, I certainly do not wish for my mother's efforts and painstaking work in White Paper Immortal City to all come to nothing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">"But if you want me to take action, we need to properly discuss the price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">"Furthermore, I can not guarantee the final outcome, therefore I will not sign any contracts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">"According to my thinking, I would prefer to see that the savior in this poem is not me, but someone else."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">The paper clone threw back her head and laughed three times, waved her sleeve, and said with considerable boldness: "That's easy to say."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">"I see that although you are young, your cultivation is superb, actually reaching the middle-to-late Foundation Establishment stage. Your three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit are all full and abundant, not inferior in the slightest to the outstanding True Inheritors of those major sects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">"Moreover, I see your physical body's foundation is profound, rounded and harmonious, fitting with heaven and earth. One can imagine that many resources must have been invested, which is quite rare."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">"Only your soul is relatively shallow. Therefore, at first glance, I saw the truth of your soul, determined you were not Jiao Ma, and unexpectedly discovered you bear a strong resemblance to Meng Yaoyin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">"And what White Paper Immortal City has the most of, are soul cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">"A region's environment nurtures its cultivators. Your arrival here makes you White Paper Immortal City's savior; it is my opportunity. Likewise, it is also an opportunity for your, Ning Zhuo's, cultivation journey."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">The Paper clone immediately took out four treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">One was the Underworld Punishment Scroll, one was Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine, one was Nine Springs Tranquil Incense, and the last was a Hungry Ghost Backlash Cauldron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">"You captured three Golden Core Ghost Generals alive; this Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine is your reward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">"The remaining three items can all be considered advanced payments to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">"This jade slip records the detailed usage instructions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">"These treasures are all of the Nascent Soul level, without exception. Even within the Soul Devouring Sect, they would be considered superior treasures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Ning Zhuo agreed with the Paper clone's assessment of value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Ning Zhuo had "confiscated" almost the entire fortune of the cultivator Heavenly Ghost from Twin Ghosts; inside were numerous jade slips recording many secrets of soul cultivation, ghost cultivation, and the Soul Devouring Sect itself, worth cities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Therefore, Ning Zhuo felt very surprised, not expecting the White Paper Immortal City Lord to be so generous. This was far more abundant than the reward he had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">In fact, just the portion of Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine alone greatly exceeded the upper limit of Ning Zhuo's expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"I'll use most of this wine, leave some; in the future when I return to the Myriad Medicine Sect, I can give Brother Linghu a meeting gift. He will definitely like it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Seeing Ning Zhuo accept the four treasures, the White Paper Immortal City Lord sighed leisurely: "Back then, I once promised to give your mother the position of Vice City Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">"But in the end, your mother refused."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">"Little Ning Zhuo, if you truly are this city's savior, then my promise from the past still stands!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">"You will be the Vice City Lord of White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Ning Zhuo was stunned again, then immediately cupped his hands and asked how many Vice City Lords there were in White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Paper clone: "Currently none, it is rarely established. If you succeed, you will be the sole Vice City Lord. Rest assured, it will not restrict your freedom; being absent from the city long-term is fine, and you will have a share in all of White Paper Immortal City's various outputs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">This time, even Sun Lingtong was somewhat astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Such status and benefits were practically second only to one person and above ten thousand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Sun Lingtong processed this, couldn't help but worry, and transmitted to Ning Zhuo: "Little Zhuo, this paper woman is offering such a high price; I'm afraid her main body's condition is quite terrible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Ning Zhuo nodded inwardly, analyzing: "On one hand, her condition is poor, and the prophecy poem prompted her to place a heavy bet on me. On the other hand, my mother gave so much, was noble back then, and refused much. Therefore, this reward for merit has fallen onto me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">"I am reaping the benefits left behind by my mother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Ning Zhuo decided to offer assistance, but also instructed the White Paper Immortal City Lord: he wanted to maintain the identity of Jiao Ma as much as possible, hoping she would not inform others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">The White Paper Immortal City Lord agreed: "Now, Sang Le Youling is already dead. White Paper Immortal City's greatest danger lies within the city. Little Ning Zhuo, I see your thinking is agile, you remain calm in crisis, and when previously slandered, you could quickly think of a way to prove your innocence. It's clear you have a talent for investigation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">"So please, next, investigate the identity of the traitor within the city. If you can find them, there will surely be more rewards!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
