<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The conversation between the Ban Clan's Supreme Elders and Escaped One changed Ban Ji and the entire Ban Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After three days and three nights of intense debate, the Supreme Elders made a momentous decision: to fully support Ban Ji's claim to kingship!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">They secretly activated the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain, forging an unbreakable bond between the Ban Clan and Ban Ji, ensuring their fates were intertwined: shared glory or mutual ruin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This became the clan's greatest secret!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">They continuously expended Escaped One's precious materials to divine Ban Ji's path forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ban Ji, guided by these calculated paths, grew rapidly. Despite practicing the Demonic Path and occasionally acting recklessly, he maintained a strong relationship with the clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Ban Clan and Ban Ji had been preparing for this year's Flying Cloud Assembly for over a decade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">They prepared for whatever the divinations revealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Of course, due to the long time intervals, earlier divinations sometimes contradicted later ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Divination was merely a form of calculation and deduction; the actual course of events in the real world could be altered by countless unforeseen factors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Several years ago, the Supreme Elders of the Ban Clan used the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain to calculate the starting point of Ban Ji's Royal Mandate: the main gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. The timing was set for the current Flying Cloud Assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Subsequent divinations consistently confirmed this result.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Qing Huangzi's legacy - the Empty Valley Syllable Azure Mechanism Cylinder - Che Zhuzi's Void Spider Silk, and the Blind Foolish Old Man's Blind Fool Divine Art were all destined to become Ban Ji's cultivation resources, the fuel for the Royal Mandate's full manifestation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Beyond the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, there were also various tasks to be completed upon officially arriving at the Flying Cloud Assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Ban Clan had meticulously arranged the order in which Ban Ji should acquire these opportunities. The frequent divinations had continuously drained the clan's Qi Luck, secretly consuming vast resources and exacting an immense price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Though the Ban Clan maintained a facade of prosperity, their relentless investment in Ban Ji had nearly emptied the clan's treasury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Fortunately, this was the final phase of investment. Once the Royal Mandate fully manifested, its power would become apparent. At that point, fortune would rain down from the heavens, prosperity would flow like a river, and even minor setbacks would transform into blessings in disguise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Ban Clan's decades-long, no-expense-spared investment was finally about to bear fruit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">-----</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">Mechanism Cave-Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">Ban Ji, drenched in sweat, gritted his teeth as he severed the mechanical anomaly at the end of his right leg.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">A spray of blood erupted, but the wound was instantly sealed with spiritual energy, halting the bleeding almost immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">Ban Ji activated his healing techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">His movements were so practiced they had become instinctive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">After all, he had endured this situation far too many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Soon, his right leg regenerated, the newly grown skin noticeably paler and more tender than the surrounding areas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">Ban Ji flexed his calf, ankle, and toes, then weakly stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">He approached the carriage-sized cluster of mechanisms before him and carefully retrieved a scroll, channeling spiritual energy into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">Countless runes erupted from the scroll, swirling around him to form a three-dimensional spiritual formation that enveloped the mechanical construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Ban Ji chanted softly, intensifying the flow of spiritual energy. The runes blazed with light as the formation activated at full power, its radiance blindingly intense before vanishing abruptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Along with the formation, Ban Ji's right calf disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">The scroll grew heavy, several times heavier than before. Countless runes formed concentric circles, at the center of which lay a carriage-like diagram of a mechanism. Beneath the mechanism extended a massive iron hand. The entire construct radiated wisps of purple energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">This purple energy had already begun to permeate and corrode the surrounding runes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">The runes remained temporarily stable, but Ban Ji knew they could only withstand the onslaught for a few months at most before collapsing. At that point, he would need to reactivate the formation to reseal the Myriad Transformations Demon Abomination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">Of course, this was no longer his concern, but rather the Ban Clan's responsibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">For over a decade, Ban Ji had employed various methods to suppress his Immortal Talent, the Myriad Transformations Demon Abomination, allowing it to activate and unleash its power only at intervals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">Each time the Demon Abomination manifested, Ban Ji's body would undergo a grotesque transformation, coalescing into a bizarre and terrifying amalgamation of mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">These mechanical constructs, infused with the principles of Mechanism Art, the Demonic Sect, and the Strange Path, appeared sinister and harmful, yet their actual value was immeasurable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">They were essentially living scriptures, recording the divine truths of these three domains - truths bestowed by heaven itself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">It was thanks to the Myriad Transformations Demon Abomination Immortal Talent that Ban Ji's physical body could bear these divinely bestowed principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Over the past decade, the number of these flesh-and-blood scriptures had swelled to nearly ten thousand volumes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">Yet Ban Ji had failed to successfully comprehend even a single one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">"If it were just Mechanism Art or Demonic Sect doctrines, any ordinary person could read and learn them. But the Strange Path is mixed in... Alas!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">Ban Ji sighed deeply, rolled up the sealed scroll, and temporarily tucked it into his robes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">His eyes gleamed with sharp intelligence as he mused, "This time, enduring the Immortal Talent's manifestation was far easier than before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">"All thanks to the Blind Fool Divine Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">"Heh. The world believes I mastered the Blind Fool Divine Art to use against enemies. But its true purpose was always for myself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">In the past, Ban Ji had to sever at least both legs, and sometimes even bisect his lower body, to withstand the torrent of divinely bestowed principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">This time, however, he only needed to amputate his right leg - and not even the entire limb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">The Blind Fool Divine Art's assistance was undeniably immense and evident to all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">"My father nearly bankrupted our family and sacrificed his dignity to activate the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain multiple times, all to calculate my path forward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">"The Blind Fool Divine Art truly works wonders for me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">"So, the Empty Valley Syllable Azure Mechanism Cylinder and the Void Spider Silk..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">As these thoughts crossed his mind, Ban Ji's expression darkened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Clenching his teeth, a chilling murderous intent surged from the depths of his heart. "Ning Zhuo, I'll temporarily entrust these two opportunities to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">"Hmph, when the time is right, I'll personally come to claim them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">"I will personally overcome my Human Tribulation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">"And when that day comes, taking your life will be a mere afterthought."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">"Until then, the inheritance of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor remains my top priority. If I can obtain this armor, it might positively influence - or even control - the mechanical constructs that manifest from my flesh and blood when my Immortal Talent activates!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Time was limited, and this inheritance was clearly more crucial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Ban Ji had no choice but to set Ning Zhuo aside for now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">The next day, Ban Ji arrived at Armament Peak before dawn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">The mountain peak pierced through the sea of clouds, resembling a colossal bronze blade pointing diagonally toward the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Its towering form was composed of countless layers of dark azure rock, between which veins of crimson-gold ore seeped through the cracks, resembling blood grooves on a quenched weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">The main mountain range's ridge was as sharp as a knife's edge, with hundred-forged rock slabs branching out on either side. Though still dark green, the slabs possessed a grayish-white sheen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">Veins of crimson gold ore were most visible within the mountain's interior. From a distance, they resembled streams of molten gold cascading down from the peaks, converging in the mountain's belly to form golden rivers and lakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">The inheritance site for the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor wasn't on the mountain's summit, but within a cave deep inside the mountain - the Profound Armor Cave!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">"It's Ban Ji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">"Just as I suspected."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">"Damn, why did we have to run into him here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">"Stay calm. The Rising Cloud Minor Trial for the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor happens every year. There's competition, but it's rarely intense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">"True. Fatalities are rare inside the Profound Armor Cave. Besides, as long as you reach the third stage, every cultivator gets a Ninefold Armor Plate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Many cultivators recognized Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Ban Ji had also obtained a stone tablet, though his performance hadn't been as dazzling as Ning Zhuo's or Situ Xing's initial surge. Still, he had distinguished himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">More importantly, recent rumors circulating within the Myriad Manifestations Sect's mountain gate had linked Ban Ji and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Leaning against the cave wall, Ban Ji listened to the murmurs about him, his eyes narrowing to slits that revealed amber-like glints of cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">As time passed, more and more cultivators gathered at the entrance to the Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">The cultivators sized each other up, exchanging polite greetings while silently calculating their rivals' strengths and their own positions in the competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Few cultivators could truly capture Ban Ji's attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">"Ao Pan. A Golden Core Body Cultivator specializing in whip techniques. His tendons and meridians stretch like a dragon's, allowing him to extend his whip beyond his body and crush magic treasures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">"Zhang Wangxing. A Foundation Establishment Body Cultivator with low-grade Innate Talent. He can drastically reshape his entire body - flesh, bones, and all - into unpredictable forms."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">"Tie Zheng. A Golden Core-level Martial Cultivator skilled in swordsmanship. He commands twelve Golden Core-level blade beasts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">"Lu Zeng. A Golden Core-level Mechanism Cultivator adept at crafting intricate mechanical components. He can adapt his creations to an immense variety of mechanical constructs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">The Rising Cloud Minor Trial for the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor naturally involved multiple rounds. Surveying the field, Ban Ji identified only four cultivators who warranted his caution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Because the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's True Form was a Spirit Treasure, and each individual armor plate was a magic treasure of considerable utility, it had attracted the participation of Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">In some Rising Cloud Minor Trials, the organizers strictly limited the cultivation levels of participants. For example, Qing Huangzi's trial only accepted Foundation Establishment cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">The two trials organized by the Confucian cultivators secretly favored Ning Zhuo by restricting the cultivation range to the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">The Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's trial, however, allowed cultivators from the Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, and Golden Core stages to participate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">In reality, few Qi Refining Stage cultivators participated in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial. The grand prize, the Ninefold Armor Plates, were magic treasures, far too advanced and impractical for Qi Refining cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">With so many Rising Cloud Minor Trials available, Qi Refining cultivators naturally chose those better suited to their level, offering greater assistance and higher chances of success. There was no need to force their way into the Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">It wasn't unheard of for Qi Refining cultivators to attempt the trial, but such efforts usually ended in ridicule, becoming a source of amusement for others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Ban Ji silently assessed his true opponents. "Only four pose a genuine threat. Given the large number of participants, the odds of encountering them are slim."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">"Even if we do clash, we should focus on eliminating the others first. That's the wisest course of action."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Ban Ji's cultivation base was at the peak of Foundation Establishment, yet his combat prowess rivaled that of a Golden Core cultivator. He felt no fear when facing Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">While he observed others, they observed him in turn. Ban Ji leaned against the mountain wall, adopting an aloof posture, his eyes narrowed as he scrutinized the crowd, radiating an aura of formidable presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">His Ban Clan lineage and his past victories against Golden Core cultivators had earned him considerable respect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">The assembled experts were also evaluating each other, strategizing how to avoid certain opponents in the upcoming Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Suddenly, Ban Ji's eyes widened. He shifted his stance, turning to face the mountain wall, his gaze piercing as he clenched his jaw, staring intently into the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Seeing Ban Ji's sudden alarm, the others realized something was amiss and turned to follow his gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">They saw a white-robed youth riding a mechanical python crafted from green bamboo, gliding toward them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">The youth's head was slightly large - it was Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">The mechanism he rode was none other than the Forest-Piercing Azure Python Chariot, inherited from the Empty Valley Syllable Azure Mechanism Cylinder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">"Ning Zhuo! What's he doing here?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">"Did he guess I'd be here? Or has my information been leaked?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Ban Ji's expression twisted in an instant, revealing a surge of anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">"The craftsmanship and style of that mechanical python... it must be Qing Huangzi's legacy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">"Damn it! That should have been mine!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">At this thought, a torrent of hatred surged in Ban Ji's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">The cultivators stirred with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">"It's Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">"Though he's not from our nation, his talent is extraordinary, his future boundless. He's the foremost genius of this generation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">"Has Ning Zhuo come for the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor, or is he here specifically to target Ban Ji?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">"Hahaha! Whatever the reason, this is going to be a good show!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Ban Ji couldn't leave - what would become of the Ban Clan's reputation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Ban Ji carried the secret of the Royal Mandate, a truth even he was unaware of. He had witnessed firsthand the immense sacrifices the Ban Clan had made for him, and he held their efforts close to his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">Therefore, he would always consider the Ban Clan's interests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Ning Zhuo landed gracefully on the ground, cupping his hands in a respectful greeting to the surrounding cultivators, a warm smile on his face as he introduced himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Most cultivators returned his smile or nodded in acknowledgment, eager to show goodwill. No one wanted to offend a promising young genius with a bright future. According to past precedent, nearly all the first wave of cultivators to emerge were invariably recruited by the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">After exchanging greetings, Ning Zhuo strode directly toward Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">The crowd parted instinctively, clearing a path for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">Expressionless, Ning Zhuo stood before Ban Ji. "Fellow Daoist Ban Ji, we meet again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">Ban Ji gritted his teeth, his killing intent palpable. He yearned to strike Ning Zhuo down on the spot, to reduce the white-robed youth to ashes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">But this was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main gate, where strict rules forbade violence. He couldn't act, nor did he dare to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">Ban Ji snarled, "Ning Zhuo, this isn't Green Bamboo Peak anymore. How dare you obstruct me again? Who gave you the audacity? What makes you think you can defeat me? Hah! You'll reap the bitter fruits of your arrogance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Ning Zhuo's expression turned solemn. "Reap the bitter fruits? I walk a righteous path, sit upright, and live with integrity. What evil have I committed to warrant such a fate?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">Frowning deeply, Ning Zhuo declared with righteous indignation, "It is you who will meet your end through your own wickedness! You plotted against me, driven by greed for my Golden Core Puppet. Know this: I'm here not just for myself, but for the countless innocent souls you've persecuted and betrayed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">"So, the Ban Clan wants to offer lavish gifts to smooth things over?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">"Hmph! Do you think Ning Zhuo is the kind to abandon righteousness for profit? You underestimate me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">"I've come here to confront you, to stop you, to show you what it means to reap the bitter fruits of your actions, to prove that evil can never triumph over righteousness, and that justice will always prevail!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
