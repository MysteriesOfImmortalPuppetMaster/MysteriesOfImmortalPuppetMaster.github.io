<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 133: Stealing the Formation and Seizing Energy</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The raging fire burned fiercely in front of Sun Lingtong, with thick smoke billowing into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Shouts and cries of battle also erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator and the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator were under siege.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This was Ning Zhuo's plan, contacting Sun Lingtong's subordinates before launching the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Lord Cheng Bai!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"He's a dignified Golden Core cultivator; how could such an explosion kill him? We should worry more about ourselves." "Where has Han Ming gone?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Not long ago, the setup we left in the underground prison was triggered. She went to investigate secretly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Damn it! The timing can't be this coincidental. The enemy used our setup against us, successfully dividing our forces!" The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator and the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator communicated telepathically, seeing through Ning Zhuo's tactics, but it was already too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">They were heavily surrounded and trapped in a bitter battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Interesting, very interesting." From the raging flames, Cheng Bai leisurely walked out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The violent explosion just now hadn't harmed him in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">A faint golden glow continuously enveloped him, protecting him completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Cheng Bai's face was dark, his gaze locked onto Chui Xu Ke: "You actually came to teach people?" "At your age, you should understand the difference between the Golden Core and Foundation Establishment stages." "Heh, mere peak Foundation Establishment, are you here to save people or to die?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">As he spoke, Cheng Bai's gaze fell on the unconscious Sun Lingtong, a complex emotion flickering in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"However, I can somewhat understand you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Cheng Bai revealed a cruel smile, like a venomous snake spitting its tongue from the shadows: "This makes me even more eager for the wonderful moment of marrying you both." "I will dismember you in front of him, hahaha!" Cheng Bai laughed wildly, his laughter filled with arrogance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Amidst his laughter, the surrounding crimson flames suddenly shifted, transforming into a ghastly green cold flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ghostfire!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He pointed his finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The ghostfire condensed into a pack of wolves, charging towards Chui Xu Ke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Chui Xu Ke's long black hair split into several strands, binding Sun Lingtong and retreating swiftly with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">During the retreat, Mechanical Thunder Silence Birds continuously flew out from under Chui Xu Ke's cloak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Thunder Silence Birds struck the ghostfire wolves, occasionally erupting with thunderous roars, shattering the ghostfire wolves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Cheng Bai's figure soared, shooting towards Chui Xu Ke. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">But in the next moment, the Fire Persimmon Immortal City Grand Formation surged up, condensing countless formation patterns in mid-air, like a cage, blocking Cheng Bai's attack route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Soul Devouring Sect's Golden Core, deal with the grand formation first, then come find me." Chui Xu Ke sneered, taking Sun Lingtong and disappearing into the shadows of the alley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Interesting!" Cheng Bai looked at the formation patterns around him that intercepted him and seemed to be contracting, yet he remained calm and composed, without a trace of tension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Chui Xu Ke, carrying Sun Lingtong, leaped a few times, crossing two or three streets, and then dived into the sewers. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The teleportation array activated, and they immediately entered an underground base. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Of course, this was not the base where Han Ming was previously held.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">After some emergency treatment, Sun Lingtong still did not wake up. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Moreover, his life force was gradually extinguishing. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">His injuries were too severe!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">A pill was fed into Sun Lingtong's mouth, quickly digesting with the help of spiritual power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Autumn Life-Saving Pill!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This pill was originally given by Zhu Xuanji to Yuan Er, intended to save Yuan Dasheng's life. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">After several twists and turns, it finally ended up in Ning Zhuo's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">As expected, the pill from the royal family had excellent efficacy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">With the use of the Autumn Life-Saving Pill, Sun Lingtong's life force stabilized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">But before Ning Zhuo could breathe a sigh of relief, an overwhelming pressure descended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The ground trembled, and a figure pierced through the earth nearly ten zhang, arriving at the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The divine sense of the Blind Judge Cheng Bai quickly enveloped the area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Where do you think you're escaping to?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"I've planted a unique mark on Sun Lingtong's body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Hehehe, Chui Xu Ke, unless you abandon him, you have no chance of survival. Otherwise, you are doomed!" Chui Xu Ke's voice was hoarse, filled with hatred and anger: "You talk too much nonsense!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">In the next moment, the formation patterns surged again, encircling Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Again with this trick?" Cheng Bai snorted coldly, his expression disdainful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But in the next moment, the formation patterns radiated brilliantly, causing blood to flow from Cheng Bai's nostrils, ears, and eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Chui Xu Ke sneered: "The base on the surface was deliberately restrained to avoid implicating Boss Sun. But here, deep underground, even if discovered, they can't drag out Boss Sun, so we can go all out. Enjoy it, Cheng Bai!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The formation patterns radiated brilliantly, frantically eroding Cheng Bai's defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Damn it!" Cheng Bai tightly closed his lips, sweeping away his previous arrogance, fully resisting the Fire Persimmon Immortal City Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Time rewinds to several years ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Little Zhuo, your mother was quite impressive as a mechanical cultivator," Sun Lingtong remarked, looking around the underground base in awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">While Ning Zhuo was practicing mechanical techniques, he accidentally discovered a map hidden in the underground workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Following the map, they navigated through a section of the sewer and eventually arrived at the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Your mother really put a lot of thought into this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"She deliberately hid this mechanical map, ensuring that only when your mechanical skills reached a certain level could you unlock it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"This place is indeed not very safe!" Sun Lingtong commented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"I understand," Ning Zhuo nodded. "Inside and outside Fire Persimmon Mountain, there is the Immortal City Grand Formation. Creating a secret space underground in the city is extremely difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Once you touch any formation pattern of the grand formation, you'll be discovered."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"I'm actually quite surprised that this underground base has remained hidden for so many years without being discovered," Sun Lingtong chuckled. "I get it now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo: "What?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong: "Under normal circumstances, the Immortal City Grand Formation needs to be re-planned and arranged periodically. Although it is very costly, it ensures the reliability of the grand formation, preventing enemies with ulterior motives from probing its secrets and paralyzing it at critical moments."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"The situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City might be special, possibly related to the Lava Immortal Palace, causing the grand formation to remain unchanged."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Or perhaps, a certain city lord was corrupt and didn't genuinely carry out the renovation of the Immortal City Grand Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"That being said, Fire Persimmon Immortal City is located in the heart of the Southern Bean Immortal Kingdom. Even if a large-scale war breaks out, it wouldn't reach here immediately."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Perhaps the successive city lords thought: when the flames of war ignite, there will be enough time to adjust the formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo's eyes suddenly lit up: "In that case, we can set up several more underground bases like this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"We just established a gang and need to maintain expenses, so we have to do business."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"We can use the underground bases for transit and engage in smuggling. This place can also serve as our warehouse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong praised, "Brilliant! This way, we can raid other factions' warehouses, and they won't be able to find ours!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"However, once this place is discovered, it won't hold up for long. The defenses are too weak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The underground base couldn't be equipped with defensive formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Because the operation of any formation would interfere with the Immortal City Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The City Lord's Mansion would also get clues and eventually trace it back here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong stroked his chin: "Later, I'll set up some Void Sect talismans to minimize the presence of this place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"When I reach the peak of Foundation Establishment, I can barely use the magical treasures my master left me to set up some formation patterns here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"These formation patterns can weakly connect with the Immortal City Grand Formation, so even if the grand formation discovers them in the future, it will mistakenly think they are part of it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo's eyes widened in astonishment: "That powerful?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sun Lingtong smiled proudly: "Our Void Sect's expertise in formations runs deep. Because in this world, the most valuable treasures are almost always protected by layers of formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"My method is called Joyous Array Energy Theft."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"When we have our own gang's base in the future, I will use this method in the base to steal a lot of spiritual energy from the Immortal City Grand Formation, while paying very little in fees."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In the process of taking control of the black market and eliminating dissenters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The two led their subordinates to heavily surround the enemy gang's base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Little Zhuo, are you confident?" Sun Lingtong transmitted his voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Boss Sun, just watch." Ning Zhuo was very confident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">With a wave of his hand, the mechanical carts charged forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Each cart was filled with numerous explosives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The enemy gang activated their defensive formation, and the explosions did not harm a single person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The enemy gang members all laughed mockingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo, however, stood by calmly, counting down clearly: "Three, two, one!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">When he counted to one, the enemy's defensive formation suddenly collapsed, and the high-ranking members of the main formation all suffered backlash, either severely injured or dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Sun Lingtong loudly praised and curiously transmitted his voice: "Little Zhuo, how did you do it?" Ning Zhuo replied, "It's simple. Boss Sun, didn't you teach me the method of stealing array energy?" Sun Lingtong was even more curious: "But I am restricted by sect rules and never taught you any related spells or talismans." Ning Zhuo shrugged: "It's simple. You told me the principles, and I used other methods to achieve the same effect. Practically speaking, it works, right?" Ning Zhuo looked at Sun Lingtong for approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Sun Lingtong's expression remained calm, and he nodded slightly: "Hmm, it's acceptable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Finally, they became the controllers of the black market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Sun Lingtong's face turned pale: "Little Zhuo, there's no need to secretly bury so many explosives in my residence, right?" Ning Zhuo shook his head: "Boss, it's very necessary. We must be cautious, humble, and prepared for all possible adverse situations. For example, if a cultivator far more powerful than us comes to cause trouble. Nascent Soul level and above cultivators are beyond our scheming, the gap is too large. But for Golden Core cultivators, we can put in some effort."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"That Fei Si is insidious and ruthless, not a good person. Maybe one day, he will personally come to eradicate our black market forces?" "We must be fully prepared!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sun Lingtong could only nod helplessly: "If a Golden Core cultivator comes, can't we just run?" "Well, making more preparations is always good."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
