<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit?!" Ning Zhuo heard its voice through the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo immediately stopped, feeling a trace of joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: "Little... Little Spirit has finally contacted you again, Little Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit tried hard to show its weak yet excited state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The fire whip lashed again, causing the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit to grimace in pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">It sucked in a breath of cold air and continued to persuade: "Little Master, please stop and listen to me. What I am about to say is very important. The Old Master set up three paths for assessment and training with a special purpose."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"The Buddhist Path, which Little Master has already passed, should have left a deep impression. This path emphasizes commanding other mechanical constructs for combat and repair." Smack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"The Daoist Path focuses on the application of Five Elements spells. Therefore, cultivators who pass the Daoist Path all possess excellent spellcasting abilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"And the Five Elements spells are quite balanced, covering almost all aspects. Besides attack, defense, control, healing, and other aspects are not weak either." Smack smack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"The final Demonic Path is specifically designed to cultivate the ability to break through defenses. Like those powerful body cultivators on the battlefield, who often charge into enemy formations, killing enemy generals amidst thousands of troops."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"I can only tell Little Master this much. Little Master, please be cautious." Smack smack smack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The more the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit spoke, the more it violated the rules, and the more frequently it was whipped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo heard the sound of the whip and couldn't help but curiously ask: "Strange, what is that sound?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: "Wuuu..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo felt something odd: "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, are you crying?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit stiffened its neck: "Of course not, I am just being whipped! Ah!" It finally couldn't bear it and let out a painful cry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"I... I am the Palace Spirit and should maintain absolute fairness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"But what I just said was a crucial reminder to Little Master, which violated this principle, so I am being punished by the Immortal Palace, ah!!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit said this and couldn't help but let out another painful scream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Despite feeling very embarrassed, it was willing to go all out to gain Ning Zhuo's trust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath: "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, thank you for everything you've done for me. When I seize the Immortal Palace in the future, I will remember your kindness and greatly reward you!" Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: .......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Hearing Ning Zhuo's consolation, it couldn't help but feel even more pain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit." Ning Zhuo called.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, in too much pain to speak, closed its mouth, retracted its limbs and head into its shell, and silently endured the whipping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">From time to time, due to unbearable pain, it let out muffled groans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Smack smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Smack smack smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo clenched his fists tightly and sighed deeply: "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, hang in there!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Where are you in the Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Is there anything I can do to help you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Right, the Life Hanging by a Thread!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"I can use the Life Hanging by a Thread to link to you, cast spells, and help you resist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but stick its head out, glaring with wide eyes, its gaze piercing through the air, staring at Ning Zhuo: Look at you, are you even speaking human words?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Its head was whipped again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit let out a whimper of pain and had to retract again, muttering curses under its breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo called out to the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, but seeing no response for a long time, he assumed it was too weak from the whipping and had lost contact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He pondered the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's words and quickly understood its implied meaning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Since the Demonic Path is designed to cultivate breakthrough warriors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Then relying on Yuan Dasheng to pass the trial greatly violates the intention of the three sects' elders in setting up this checkpoint."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Surely, the intention of the three sects' elders cannot be ignored."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Just like when I cast spells earlier, triggering the blood veins of the puppet, which had a counterproductive effect on the entire battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit disregarded its own punishment to remind me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"This indicates that if I continue to rely on Yuan Dasheng to help me pass the trial, I will suffer great losses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"No, to be precise, it came to remind me before I pushed the door open... indicating that I cannot bring Yuan Dasheng in?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"The final trial must be done by myself?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Seeing Ning Zhuo arrange Yuan Dasheng for the second trial and planning to push the door open alone, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit felt relieved and transmitted another message: "Little... Little Master." Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Why are you in such a hurry to pass the trials?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Little Spirit believes that Ning Xiaohui is your greatest threat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo replied: "I am passing the trials precisely to deal with the threat of Ning Xiaohui."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Passing the Buddhist Path grants a Medical Pavilion position token. I suspect that the position token for the Historical Records Pavilion is among the rewards for passing the Demonic Path or Daoist Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"As long as I obtain the corresponding position, I won't fear anyone taking up positions related to the Historical Records Pavilion in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"I can demote them all with a single thought, achieving a once-and-for-all solution!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gritted its teeth in pain: "Ah, Little Spirit's worry was indeed correct."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Little Master, none of the rewards for any path include the position token for the Historical Records Pavilion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo was stunned: "How can that be?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit revealed: "The power of the Lava Immortal Palace is mainly divided into three parts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"One part is me, the Palace Spirit, responsible for the operation and functions of the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"One part is the Palace Seal, responsible for the inheritance of the three sects' laws. This is the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, which allows Little Master to influence the trial checkpoints."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"The last part is the Palace Master, responsible for personnel changes." Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Of course, the three powers are not strictly separated, and we also manage other areas concurrently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"For example, besides managing the operation of the Lava Immortal Palace, I can also slightly interfere with the inheritance of the three sects' laws and the performance evaluation of various positions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"The Palace Seal and Palace Master are the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"After passing the trials, the positions chosen by the disciples are all related to inheritance. For example, the Medical Pavilion's positions continue to train disciples in practical repair and healing abilities." Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Another example is the Commander Platform after the Demonic Path, which trains disciples in command abilities during large battles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"The position of the Historical Records Pavilion is not related to inheritance and falls under my jurisdiction as the Palace Spirit. It is one of the functional buildings of the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"To obtain the position of the Historical Records Pavilion, one must accumulate contributions and merits. Of course, the position of the Historical Records Pavilion is significant. Only our own people can hold this position. Outsiders cannot be promoted to this position." Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo suddenly understood: "So that's how it is. But even so, I still want to try passing the trials!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so anxious that it felt like it was on fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">It had explained so clearly, yet Ning Zhuo was still stubbornly persistent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo: "I have another plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit wanted to ask about the plan, as it concerned its grand plan for freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo, however, stopped talking and suddenly asked about the Foundation Establishment method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He voiced his speculation and sought confirmation from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was silent for a moment before finally speaking the truth: "Little Master, your speculation is correct." Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Passing one path grants a Foundation Establishment method, which can only be considered a single Dantian Foundation Establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Combining the methods from two paths results in Dual Dantian Foundation Establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"The methods from all three paths form the true Triple Dantian Foundation Establishment!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"However, Little Master, why rush? The current focus should be on..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo directly interrupted it and immediately asked: "What auxiliary means should be used for Triple Dantian Foundation Establishment?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was silent for a moment before choosing to answer: "No auxiliary means are needed." Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"People often use Foundation Establishment Pills to increase the success rate of Foundation Establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Essentially, Foundation Establishment Pills provide a large amount of essence, energy, and spirit while coordinating the relationship between the three Dantians." Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"The three sects' laws created by the Old Master train the three treasures of essence, energy, and spirit, greatly enhancing them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"At the same time, in the later stages of the seventh to ninth levels, the three sects' laws emphasize the synchronization and connection of the three Dantians."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Therefore, as long as disciples cultivate all three laws to the peak of the ninth level, they can smoothly establish the foundation, the process being natural and without any obstacles." Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo was overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">This meant that as long as he obtained the complete Foundation Establishment method, he could smoothly establish the foundation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">But he quickly calmed down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He thought about his current situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Even with the Foundation Establishment method, he was under the surveillance of Golden Core Stage ancestors, and Floating Cloud was no longer safe, making it difficult to find an opportunity for Foundation Establishment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit anxiously asked: "Little Master, what exactly is your plan?" Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo replied: "No rush, no rush."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Let me ask you, what exactly is the matter with the Palace Examination? When will the Palace Examination be initiated, allowing me to compete for the position of the Immortal Palace Master?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit took a deep breath, suppressed its irritation, and had to answer: "The condition for initiating the Palace Examination is for a certain cultivator to meet the standards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"His cultivation level, corresponding mechanical technique proficiency, and contribution must all reach a certain standard to trigger the Palace Examination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"The lower the cultivation level, the higher the required contribution." Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"When the Palace Examination is initiated, according to the comprehensive ranking of standards, the thirty-two cultivators below the key figure will also qualify for the Palace Examination simultaneously, competing on the same stage with the key figure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"The Old Master set it up this way to prevent those with ulterior motives from engaging in some irregular operations. It also provides the key figure with an opportunity to showcase themselves and intimidate others." Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo asked again: "How do I meet the standards?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit replied: "The contribution must reach the level of a first-grade position."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He had been studying the tasks of the Medical Pavilion recently and knew the contribution evaluation for each task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Although he held a second-grade position, it did not mean he had second-grade contributions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">This goal was too high!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo's contribution was very awkward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">It... was negative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">One must know, Ning Zhuo had previously blown up the Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Little... Little Master." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't bear it any longer, "I am about to lose contact with you again. What is your plan? Quickly tell Little Spirit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo finally revealed his plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, upon hearing it, couldn't help but feel both joy and fear: "This... this is too dangerous...."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
