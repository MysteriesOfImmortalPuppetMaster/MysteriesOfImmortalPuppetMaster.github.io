<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 761: Azure Flow Lake</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Bronze Fan unleashed a tempestuous offensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A gentle flick of the fan sent wind blades whistling through the air, while a vigorous wave conjured fiery waves that swept across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Its movements were fluid and elusive, like a butterfly, and its attack range was vast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo huddled behind his shield, pinned down and forced into a purely defensive stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The scorching flames singed the ends of his hair, while wind blades skimmed the ground, slashing at his lower body and injuring his legs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Gritting his teeth, Ning Zhuo endured the relentless pressure. "Even with my shield blocking most of the attacks, the pressure is overwhelming," he thought. "How are the others faring?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">As he had predicted, the sixth Profound Armament Armor marked a qualitative leap in combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Previous iterations, even with the Renowned Master realm's "no technique surpassing technique", it remained limited to conventional martial arts. Their primary threats stemmed from the Bronze Artifacts' inherent sharpness or blunt force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">But the sixth armor incorporated the use of spiritual energy into its Martial Dao, allowing it to unleash blade light and sword Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This newfound ranged capability rendered Ning Zhuo's ability to sense "kinetic force" almost useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Bronze Fan's assault was like a torrential storm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Caught in the eye of the storm, Ning Zhuo retreated step by step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In a mere moment, the surface of his bronze shield was already riddled with deep gashes from wind blades, and the shield itself was scorched red-hot from the fiery waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Veins bulged on Ning Zhuo's arms as he braced his shield against the relentless onslaught, repeatedly deflecting the most lethal attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">If he had relied solely on the shield for passive defense, Ning Zhuo's defeat would have been inevitable. But he still had four other Bronze Artifacts at his disposal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Guarding Simplicity Wheel-Slaying Formation, activate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The four Bronze Artifacts began to orbit Ning Zhuo, spinning continuously around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Guided by his divine sense, the artifacts launched alternating strikes, constantly disrupting the Bronze Fan's attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Initially, the Bronze Fan's assault remained relentless. But as Ning Zhuo grew more accustomed to the battle and his control over the formation deepened, the artifacts' disruptive effect steadily increased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Bronze Fan, being a single entity facing a coordinated assault, was forced to defend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">This weakened its offensive, granting Ning Zhuo a crucial opportunity to catch his breath and regroup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo seized this chance, gradually regaining his footing. Activating the formation, he unleashed wave after wave of counterattacks, slowly leveling the playing field.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">A fiery torrent, laced with wind blades, surged toward him once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Raising his shield, Ning Zhuo abandoned brute force. Instead, he angled it precisely, skillfully redirecting the momentum, dispersing the force, and rotating the shield to maintain his defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The shield channeled the violent fire and wind energy, diverting most of it into the surroundings, while the remaining force pressed against the shield's surface without causing Ning Zhuo any harm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">His battle gradually drew the attention of more and more Cultivators from Profound Armor Cave, who gathered to watch the spectacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"When did Ning Zhuo become so formidable?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"To fight the sixth Profound Armament Armor to a standstill in the Rising Cloud Trial... there are only a handful who could achieve such a feat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"That's an understatement. Even Golden Core-level cultivators like Ao Pan couldn't handle it with such ease."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The cultivators were momentarily stunned, the image of Ning Zhuo's initial encounter with the first Bronze Artifact flashing before their eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Clang! Clang! Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The bronze spear served as the primary offensive weapon, while gauntlets and blades provided support. With a series of strikes, they shattered the Bronze Fan, sending it crashing to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo pounced like a bear, pinning the Bronze Fan with his shield. Employing both Divine Refinement and spiritual Refinement, he began to refine the artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The sixth one... defeated!" Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed with triumph, his heart soaring with elation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The cultivators from Profound Armor Cave who witnessed this scene fell into stunned silence once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Overall, Ning Zhuo sustained the least damage in the sixth battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"His battle formation is remarkably well-designed, perfectly tailored to the Profound Armament Armor at his disposal. This formation allows him to combine his forces, achieving a synergy where one plus one equals more than two. In contrast, other cultivators rotate their armor, essentially fighting a series of one-on-one battles. Ning Zhuo, however, has achieved true group combat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"But... this feels like a dream. I still remember how clumsy he was against the Bronze Blade, his combat skills utterly pathetic and deeply disappointing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">How had Ning Zhuo suddenly become so strong?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The crowd was stunned, struggling to process what they were witnessing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">They quickly reviewed Ning Zhuo's trial journey, and the reason became clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Ah! I understand now. Ning Zhuo's learning ability is truly extraordinary. He seized every opportunity to learn, training methodically and without panic."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Though he stumbled and even crawled through the early stages, each setback yielded immense growth, propelling him forward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"He's a completely different person now! That's why he's handling the sixth Profound Armament Armor with such ease."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The crowd reached a consensus, their admiration for Ning Zhuo renewed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">In the projection, Ning Zhuo, despite his victory, remained pensive, his brow slightly furrowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Cultivator Hao, arms crossed, spoke up, "I have reason to suspect that Ning Zhuo has been acting with purpose and planning since the start of the trials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"He's acutely aware of his learning capabilities. Even if his Martial Dao strength fell short, he possessed unwavering confidence in his ability to defeat Ban Ji."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He sighed deeply, his expression bleak. "Ning Zhuo shows no hint of arrogance, as if this were commonplace for him. This is the hallmark of a first-rate genius - a level of mastery in a particular domain that we can only dream of achieving in our lifetimes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The cultivators who had secretly harbored jealousy toward Ning Zhuo now found their resentment dissolving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">When the gap between them became too vast, and the laggards realized they were fundamentally different beings from Ning Zhuo, their envy naturally dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">However, some cultivators remained unwilling to concede. One of them asked, "Does this mean Ning Zhuo is currently the strongest?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Cultivator Hao immediately shook his head. "No, he merely possesses exceptional strength, placing him among the elite of this cohort. In the third trial, he'll face other cultivators. Human intelligence and strategic acumen far surpass anything a Profound Armament Armor can offer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Ning Zhuo's hastily devised battle formation is superficial and could easily be countered."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Moreover, the third trial will be a chaotic free-for-all. The situation will be unpredictable, and anything could happen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">While the cultivators debated Ning Zhuo's merits, the man himself remained immersed in thought, occasionally discussing matters with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong, currently in the Jade Cleansing Hall, had already activated two techniques: "Head Hanging from the Rafters" and "Thigh Pricked by the Awl." With the Luoshu's enhancement, he was fully focused on collaborating with Ning Zhuo to refine the Guarding Simplicity Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Practical combat served as the best teacher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The recent battle had exposed numerous flaws in their hastily devised formation, while simultaneously sparking countless inspirations in Sun Lingtong's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">After reviewing the battle, the pair agreed that instead of rushing to the next stage, they should consolidate their position and focus on enhancing the formation's power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The latter option would fully leverage Sun Ning's strengths, making it the more reliable choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the cultivators' vision suddenly expanded. The formation shifted, transporting them into the true Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The cavern's vast dome stretched high above, devoid of natural light. Here, time had carved a breathtaking spectacle, using water as its blade and stone as its anvil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Crystalline stalagmites rose from the ground like a forest of spears, while stalactites hung from the ceiling like an array of lances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The cave walls were layered with countless ridges and valleys, their sedimentary patterns resembling frozen tidal waves or the hammer marks left by a blacksmith forging armor plates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The constant drip-drip-drip of liquid echoed through the cavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Bronze droplets seeped from the stalactites, falling into a small lake at the center of the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Profound Armor Cave, the Azure Flow Lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The lake's waters were still and dense, like a massive piece of jade. Its deep bronze hue was so intense it seemed to absorb all light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This bronze liquid was the primary material for the Profound Armament Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The cultivators' gazes were drawn to the lake. They all knew the rules: before the third trial officially began, each cultivator would have the opportunity to come to the lake, refine some of its waters, and obtain a blank Profound Armament Armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Profound Armament Armor the cultivators had seized earlier was not theirs to keep. After the Rising Cloud Trial, all of it would have to be returned to the Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">However, the Azure Flow Copper they had obtained from the Bronze Lake was a gift from the Profound Armor Cave, theirs to keep. After the Rising Cloud Trial, they could take it with them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">A voice echoed from the Grand Formation, reverberating through the cavern, announcing the rules of the third stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo listened carefully and found that the rules remained unchanged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He quickly scanned the other cultivators: Ao Pan, Tie Zheng, Lu Zeng, Rust Disaster Craftsman, Ban Ji... and a pool of mangled flesh pierced with swords and blades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The flesh slowly reformed into Zhang Wangxing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He knelt on the ground, coughing up blood, but his heart surged with elation. "Finally... finally, I've made it through!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Having relied on tricks and cheating throughout the trial, he had been utterly helpless against the sixth Profound Armament Armor, forced to flee desperately to buy himself time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Having already secured five Profound Armament Armor, he had qualified for the next round and was now waiting for the Formation to activate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo didn't spot Zhang Dadan and sighed inwardly. "The cultivators who advanced to the third stage are exactly as I predicted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Instead of confronting Ban Ji, Ning Zhuo immediately headed toward the lake's edge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The others followed suit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The immediate priority was to refine some Azure Flow Copper Lake water and obtain an Empty Profound Armament Armor. Each additional Profound Armament Armor a cultivator possessed significantly increased their chances of victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Zhang Zheng was the first to approach the lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">His face was as stern as iron, his feet sinking deep into the ground. He slowly raised his arms, palms facing downward, and pressed down on the lake surface from a distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Spiritual energy surged forth, plunging into the lake, then swirling up a massive plume of Azure Flow Copper that slowly levitated into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Zhang Zheng continuously channeled spiritual energy, rapidly refining the copper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Before everyone's eyes, the Azure Flow Copper gradually transformed into a shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He already possessed swords, blades, and various Profound Armament Armor pieces, but lacked a shield. His previous battles had made him keenly aware of the immense value of a defensive weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ao Pan leisurely approached the lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He drew forth his spiritual energy, condensing it into a long whip, and lashed it against the water's surface, drawing up a massive plume of Azure Flow Copper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The copper was absorbed by his spiritual energy, solidifying into a long whip mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Lu Zeng was the last of the three Golden Core cultivators to arrive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He retrieved his Lifebound Treasure, the Heavenly Mechanism Seal, and surprisingly tossed it directly into the lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ban Ji and the Rust Disaster Craftsman moved closer together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ban Ji immediately asked, his voice urgent, "Do you have a sword?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ban Ji already possessed the Bronze Blade and had finally encountered the Bronze Sword, but he couldn't defeat it. As the battle dragged on, they entered the third trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Without hesitation, the Rust Disaster Craftsman handed his Bronze Sword to Ban Ji. These weapons could be transferred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Moreover, during the refinement of Azure Flow Copper, cultivators were permitted to use healing techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">For Ban Ji, this was the perfect opportunity to reclaim his blades and restore their combined attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">However...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ban Ji stared at the Bronze Sword in disbelief. "This is your Bronze Sword?!" he emphasized the word "sword," conveying his astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The Bronze Sword in the Rust Disaster Craftsman's hand had shrunk into a dagger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Rust Disaster Craftsman shrugged. "You know about my Heavenly Gold Fiend energy. These Profound Armament Armor aren't suitable for me. Every time I use them, they're corroded by my Fiend energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ban Ji snorted coldly. "Keep it then."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Still unwilling to give up, he pressed, "The Ban Clan entrusted you with assisting me. Ban Jie wouldn't have sent you with just this. What other support did she provide?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Rust Disaster Craftsman's eyes flickered before he slowly shook his head. "She might have sent others. I'm just one of them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ban Ji snorted again and fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He needed to focus on healing his injuries and reattaching his severed fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ban Ji carefully gathered his severed fingers and stored them securely, which would greatly reduce his healing time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Time was of the essence for Ban Ji. He needed to heal his injuries and refine his Profound Armament Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">After a moment, he clenched his fist. Though still weak, he could at least wield a sword again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ban Ji surveyed the area and noticed that nearly everyone was gathered around the small lake, refining Azure Flow Copper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">During his long period of healing, no one had offered to help him, leaving Ban Ji deeply disappointed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Now that I have a Bronze Blade, the Empty Profound Armament Armor I refine can only be structured as a sword."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Ah, if only I had a shield, it would give me a significant advantage in the melee."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ban Ji's gaze lingered briefly on Ning Zhuo before shifting away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged by the lake. His Profound Armament Armor had been disassembled into individual pieces, which he kept close to his body. To outward appearances, Ning Zhuo seemed unarmed, and no one knew how much Profound Armament Armor he possessed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Using a combination of his divine sense and spiritual energy, Ning Zhuo extracted ordinary Azure Flow Copper from the lake and drew it toward himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He refined the copper and incorporated it into all his Profound Armament Armor, thoroughly repairing and reinforcing each piece.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Profound Armament Armor wasn't particularly durable and wore down easily. However, due to the special materials used in its construction, it was also remarkably easy to repair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Even those who chose to repair their equipment only fixed one or two items at most. Ao Pan, for example, preferred to let his bronze whip break rather than repair it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The bronze whip had been the first bronze weapon he'd encountered, and it was far too weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">For him, forging a new bronze whip that perfectly matched his Cultivation Art and whip techniques was the optimal choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo's impartial approach, benefiting everyone equally, was also his optimal choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Because he had a battle formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Soon, a steady stream of Azure Flow Copper had completely repaired all of Ning Zhuo's Profound Armament Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Only then did Ning Zhuo begin forging new pieces of Profound Armament Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The cultivators from Profound Armor Cave stared at Ning Zhuo's Profound Armament Armor with strange expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">None of Ning Zhuo's Profound Armament Armor resembled any conventional weapon. Instead, it looked like a human calf!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The crowd could only sigh: A genius's thinking truly differs from that of ordinary people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The brief respite passed in the blink of an eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The Grand Formation's power surged again, suppressing Golden Core cultivators to Foundation Establishment and elevating Qi Refining cultivators to Foundation Establishment. With cultivation disparities eliminated, the competition now centered entirely around the Profound Armament Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Tie Zheng moved first, slowly approaching Ao Pan. "Care for a spar?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">With this gesture, the chaotic battle of the third trial began.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
