<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div><br/>
Zhu Xuanji was utterly shocked that Ning Zhuo's second letter arrived so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
When he received the letter, his heart was pounding, though he still held onto hope that it might just be a thank-you note.<br/>
<br/>
But when he opened it—<br/>
<div style=" padding: 8px; font-style: italic;"><br/>
Respected Elder Brother Zhu Xuanji:<br/>
<br/>
I write to you in desperation, forced by circumstances of extreme urgency to seek your aid.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I ventured into the Myriad Demons Cave, where I discovered extraordinary secrets. The implications are grave, involving demonic chaos and even connecting to the Ethereal Master "Five Elements Divine Lord."<br/>
<br/>
The situation threatens national security and could affect countless citizens of the Southern Bean Kingdom. This cannot be ignored!<br/>
<br/>
I write to inform you that if there is sudden activity at the Medicine Gate, such as the activation of the mountain-guarding formation or other unusual phenomena, it means I am in grave danger. At that time, I implore you to come quickly to help, for the sake of both country and people. This concerns the survival of our society and the safety of all living beings. I beg you to take this seriously and not be negligent.<br/>
<br/>
The situation is dire; I dare not say more. I entrust this to you, hoping you will consider it carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Yours sincerely,<br/>
Ning Zhuo<br/>
</div><br/>
After reading this letter, Zhu Xuanji was greatly alarmed.<br/>
<br/>
What's going on? What's happening!<br/>
<br/>
The previous letter had been about drinking wine and celebrating, but this one took a sharp turn—suddenly it was about saving the nation and protecting the people?<br/>
<br/>
"The Child of Destiny, this is truly the Child of Destiny!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was inclined to believe that Ning Zhuo's plea for help was genuine. Even if there was some exaggeration, it couldn't be by much.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately sprang into action!<br/>
<br/>
Although he desperately wanted to avoid any involvement with Ning Zhuo, this concerned the Southern Bean Kingdom and national security—he couldn't stand idly by.<br/>
<br/>
He urgently reported the situation to the monarch.<br/>
<br/>
Within an hour, he received a summons.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji made his way to the palace, following familiar routes.<br/>
<br/>
However, at the great hall's entrance, guards stopped him.<br/>
<br/>
"His Majesty commands that you wait here for orders," the guard said.<br/>
<br/>
"What?" Zhu Xuanji became furious immediately. "I have urgent matters to discuss directly with His Majesty. How can this be treated so lightly?"<br/>
<br/>
"Xuanji, calm yourself." At this moment, an elderly man walked out of the great hall.<br/>
<br/>
He was imposing in stature, with white hair and beard, large-knuckled hands, and a vigorous spirit that emanated the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the elder, Zhu Xuanji quickly bowed: "Prince Wang, greetings."<br/>
<br/>
The elder's surname was Zhu and given name Zhu, a prince of the royal Zhu family, a Nascent Soul cultivator and one of the kingdom's pillars of support.<br/>
<br/>
Prince Zhu nodded slightly and said to Zhu Xuanji: "To be frank, Xuanji, having you wait outside the hall was my suggestion."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji: "Please explain why, Prince. Otherwise, I cannot accept this."<br/>
<br/>
Prince Zhu's eyes narrowed as he transmitted: "Can't accept it? You'll wait regardless!"<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, don't you understand your situation?"<br/>
<br/>
"This great hall was designed with formations to stabilize imperial fortune. Standing outside, you won't disturb His Majesty's destiny. But if you enter and we're all within the formation, who knows what might happen?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's face darkened.<br/>
<br/>
Prince Zhu snorted: "You fool, know your place! That Child of Destiny has contacted you repeatedly. —The Magma Immortal Palace, Misty Hidden Mountain, and now the Myriad Demons Cave..."<br/>
<br/>
"What does this mean?"<br/>
<br/>
"You're already too deeply entangled with him."<br/>
<br/>
"And I fear these connections will only grow deeper!"<br/>
<br/>
"Fortunately, your own destiny is remarkable enough to withstand it."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's heart sank as he transmitted back with a bitter smile: "No, Your Highness, I can't withstand it, I really can't!"<br/>
<br/>
Prince Zhu glared: "Whether you can or not, you must. This is your karmic connection—cutting it forcibly would only invite terrible backlash."<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, let nature take its course."<br/>
<br/>
The bitterness on Zhu Xuanji's face deepened: "Your Highness, why do I feel like you're saying I won't live much longer?"<br/>
<br/>
Prince Zhu's expression turned solemn: "Also, in the future, don't stand close to me when speaking. Just bow from a distance when we meet, don't come near this old man."<br/>
<br/>
With that, Prince Zhu retreated into the great hall.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji could only communicate with the monarch through voice transmission.<br/>
<br/>
The monarch told him: Ning Zhuo's plea for help must be taken very seriously. After all, he is the Child of Destiny. But from now on, all such letters should be forwarded to you, Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
For this Medicine Sect matter, you're being sent! Use the emergency relay stations for transportation, spare no expense, and reach the Medicine Valley as quickly as possible!<br/>
<br/>
But don't worry, the royal family will also send a Nascent Soul master to accompany you.<br/>
<br/>
And so, without even seeing the monarch's face, Zhu Xuanji urgently left the capital.<br/>
<br/>
He traveled through relay stations, constantly teleporting.<br/>
<br/>
Halfway there, he met up with Nascent Soul cultivator Shen Lingshu.<br/>
<br/>
They traveled without rest, teleporting so frequently that both were dizzy and nauseous, rushing at maximum speed to reach the vicinity of Medicine Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Standing on a mountaintop, Zhu Xuanji saw the Medicine Sect's great formation suddenly rise.<br/>
<br/>
This was exactly as Ning Zhuo had described in his letter.<br/>
<br/>
With this, Zhu Xuanji's last hope vanished.<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Shen, I'll go negotiate directly first, to rescue that troublemaker. Please hide nearby as backup," Zhu Xuanji said.<br/>
<br/>
Though he was only at the Golden Core level, lower than his companion, on this mission he had royal orders marking him as the leader.<br/>
<br/>
After hearing this, Shen Lingshu smiled slightly: "No hurry, Friend Zhu. Let me divine first."<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu appeared youthful, with handsome features and bright eyes. He wore a light cyan robe embroidered with mountains and clouds. His black hair was simply tied back with a wooden hairpin, and an ancient jade compass hung at his waist.<br/>
<br/>
He had earned deep trust from the Southern Bean Kingdom's monarch. —Or more accurately, from the Zhu family.<br/>
<br/>
This was because he wasn't just skilled in the cultivation art of divination, but was also a son-in-law of the Zhu family, making him royal kin.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu calculated briefly, then said: "I've divined it. We should both appear and negotiate directly -this would be better. Of course, this is just my suggestion."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji replied: "Then let's follow your guidance, Senior."<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu rose into the air together.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's voice echoed through heaven and earth: "I am Zhu Xuanji of the Southern Bean Royal Family, serving in the Divine Constables Bureau, accompanied by Master Shen Lingshu. We come here on royal orders for a visit! Please open your gates and announce us."<br/>
<br/>
His voice resonated throughout Medicine Valley, echoing for long moments and startling everyone in the sect.<br/>
<br/>
On the Original Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Jufan heard Zhu Xuanji's announcement, his heart leaped with joy: "It's Divine Constable Zhu! Haha, why has he come?"<br/>
<br/>
"Oh! It must be Ning Zhuo, definitely Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"That clever boy, he's still so sharp, actually making arrangements in advance and calling for reinforcements."<br/>
<br/>
"This is truly a descendant of my Ning family! Haha, he could even outmaneuver Meng Chong, let alone Lin Bufan!"<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, Ning Jufan's confidence soared, and his bearing changed.<br/>
<br/>
Though he was essentially a captive in dire straits, he stroked his beard and smiled: "Sect Leader Lin, do you hear? It's Divine Constable Zhu!"<br/>
<br/>
"Months ago, Divine Constable Zhu visited our Fire Persimmon Immortal City, spoke with us several times, and got along harmoniously with our clan's Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"If you doubt my official status, you can verify it with him. Divine Constable Zhu is renowned throughout the nation, and appearing here on behalf of the Southern Bean royal family, he certainly wouldn't lie."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan: ...<br/>
<br/>
What a headache.<br/>
<br/>
Sect Leader Lin was getting a headache.<br/>
<br/>
He had thought that as a Nascent Soul cultivator who had carefully managed Medicine Valley for over a hundred years, with advantages in both terrain and people's support, dealing with a family that had migrated from the North would be effortless.<br/>
<br/>
But he hadn't expected Ning Jufan to be an official.<br/>
<br/>
He especially hadn't expected that after Ning Zhuo's disappearance, he would kidnap his daughter Lin Shanshan.<br/>
<br/>
And he certainly hadn't expected Zhu Xuanji to appear so quickly, bringing a Nascent Soul cultivator as backup.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan, who had thought he could control the situation, was struck by these successive changes. He painfully realized the situation had rapidly slipped from his grasp and become extremely dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jufan cupped his hands, appearing to have Lin Bufan's interests at heart, and advised: "Sect Leader Lin, please make a quick decision. After all, Divine Constable Zhu comes with royal orders. When he travels abroad, he represents the royal family's dignity."<br/>
<br/>
"If you refuse to receive him, causing criticism, even if the Southern Bean royal family doesn't mind, and even if Zhu Xuanji is magnanimous, others will observe and have their thoughts..."<br/>
<br/>
"In that case, Medicine Gate's business might decline severely. After all, who wants to maintain good relations with a force that has poor relations with the Southern Bean royal family?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan snorted coldly: "Your words are clever—is this the style of you Northern men?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jufan's smile froze slightly.<br/>
<br/>
But Lin Bufan walked out, flying to Original Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
He opened a thin gap in the mountain-guarding formation and, through the barrier, said to Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu: "Having two distinguished guests visit Medicine Gate truly brings glory to our humble sect. This formation was not raised to refuse guests, but because Young Master Ning Zhuo's whereabouts were unclear. We raised it to protect him and aid in the search, guarding against accidents. I hope you both understand."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan, a mighty Nascent Soul cultivator, even referred to Ning Zhuo as "Young Master." By elevating Ning Zhuo's status this way, he expressed his own good intentions.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said: "I came precisely for him..."<br/>
<br/>
Before he could finish speaking, Ning Zhuo appeared in the air, with Lin Shanshan beside him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo bowed apologetically: "Brother Zhu, Sect Leader Lin, causing such a commotion is entirely my fault. Earlier, I ventured into the demon cave to explore, without reporting it. Coming out to find such activity, affecting the entire Medicine Gate, and even making you come personally, Brother Zhu—this was truly beyond my expectations. I sincerely apologize to you both!"<br/>
<br/>
After speaking, Ning Zhuo bowed deeply.<br/>
<br/>
Beside him, Lin Shanshan smiled, first greeting Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu, then calling out publicly to Lin Bufan: "Father, you're too kind, thank you for your concern."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan's face bloomed with a spring-like smile as he said gently: "As long as you two are safe, I can rest easy. Next time, please don't wander off like this."<br/>
<br/>
Everyone's words were full of deeper meaning.<br/>
<br/>
After the interaction, Lin Bufan deactivated the Mountain-Guarding Formation and invited Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu to enter the mountain together.<br/>
<br/>
When they all landed on the mountain, the entire Myriad Medicine Sect was in an uproar.<br/>
People began discussing this matter with great enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
"So that's why the Mountain-Guarding Formation was suddenly activated - it was for Young Master Ning!"<br/>
<br/>
"I was startled - I thought there might have been a beast tide coming up from the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave!"<br/>
<br/>
"How could that be? The Ten Thousand Beasts Cave hasn't had any monster outbreaks in many years. When I saw Zhu Xuanji appear, I thought there might have been some serious criminal that Sect Leader Lin had activated the formation to capture."<br/>
<br/>
"I never expected it was because of Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"Did you just hear? Even Sect Leader Lin addressed Ning Zhuo as 'Young Master'!"<br/>
<br/>
"I've looked into it - the Ning family of Fire Persimmon Mountain isn't even that prominent. Why would Ning Zhuo receive such courtesy from Sect Leader Lin?"<br/>
<br/>
"I don't know! I only know that even the renowned Zhu Xuanji, the famous divine investigator known throughout the country, came specifically for Ning Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
"Just who is Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
"More than that, I'm curious why the Young Miss of our Sect, Sect Leader Lin's beloved daughter Lin Shanshan, would suddenly be seen walking arm in arm with Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
"Now that you mention it, I'm very curious too!"<br/>
<br/>
"What else could it be? They're of equal status, like a golden boy and jade girl - they must have taken a liking to each other."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing such discussions, Hua Guzi's face turned pale.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Han Zhou shook his head and sighed: "Everyone suffers. Hua Guzi, you..."<br/>
Before he could finish consoling, Hua Guzi coldly interrupted: "Shut up!"<br/>
Han Zhou sensed an unprecedented dangerous aura from Hua Guzi and quickly fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi gritted their teeth secretly: "Young Master Ning must have encountered danger earlier, otherwise he wouldn't have needed help from Lin Bufan and Zhu Xuanji."<br/>
<br/>
"It must be that Lin Shanshan!"<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, Lin Shanshan must have been captivated by Young Master's beauty and put him in danger. How terrible, this woman is terrible! Actually trying to steal the Young Master from me!!"<br/>
<br/>
The senior and junior disciples were also in shock.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Junior Sister? How did Little Junior Sister suddenly appear, and standing together with Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
"Wasn't she under house arrest? How did she sneak out?"<br/>
<br/>
"I know Master well. He wouldn't suddenly activate the Mountain-Guarding Formation unless something major happened."<br/>
<br/>
"What are you suggesting?"<br/>
<br/>
"Could it be that Little Junior Sister and Ning Zhuo tried to elope, and Master discovered them, so he used the formation to seal them in?"<br/>
<br/>
"This Ning Zhuo has ulterior motives, plotting meticulously. For their elopement to succeed, he even specifically invited Zhu Xuanji as backup. Now that he and Little Junior Sister are sealed within Wanyao Valley by Master, they'll eventually be found, so Zhu Xuanji had no choice but to appear."<br/>
<br/>
The fellow disciples: ......<br/>
Many of them clutched their chests, feeling as if their hearts were about to break.<br/>
<br/>
"How could Little Junior Sister..."<br/>
<br/>
"I've always disliked that pretty boy Ning Zhuo. This guy must have a silver tongue, that scoundrel, he's nothing but a scoundrel!"<br/>
<br/>
"Where's Senior Brother? I need to tell Senior Brother! This is too serious!"<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother must be worried sick in the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave!"<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, let's go find Senior Brother and report the situation."<br/>
<br/>
"Wait, these are just our speculations..."<br/>
<br/>
"What are we waiting for? It'll be too late if we wait any longer!"<br/>
<br/>
Several people hurriedly went to the back mountain of Dazheng Peak, but when they reached the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave, it was completely empty.<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother?"<br/>
<br/>
"Where's Senior Brother?"<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother is gone!"<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, in the formation within the formation...<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu paced back and forth, practicing his sword techniques until he was gasping for breath: "Damn it, what kind of formation is this? How do I get out?!"<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Ning Zhuo! Brother Ning Zhuo!!"<br/>
<br/>
Being unskilled with formations, he could only futilely call out Ning Zhuo's name, hoping for help.</div></body></html></div>
