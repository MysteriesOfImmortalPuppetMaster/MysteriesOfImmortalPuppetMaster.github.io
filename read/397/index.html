<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji was utterly shocked that Ning Zhuo's second letter arrived so quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">When he received the letter, his heart was pounding, though he still held onto hope that it might just be a thank-you note.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But when he opened itâ€”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="6"><div style=" padding: 8px; font-style: italic;"><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Respected Elder Brother Zhu Xuanji:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">I write to you in desperation, forced by circumstances of extreme urgency to seek your aid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Recently, I ventured into the Myriad Demons Cave, where I discovered extraordinary secrets. The implications are grave, involving demonic chaos and even connecting to the Ethereal Master "Five Elements Divine Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The situation threatens national security and could affect countless citizens of the Southern Bean Kingdom. This cannot be ignored!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">I write to inform you that if there is sudden activity at the Medicine Gate, such as the activation of the mountain-guarding formation or other unusual phenomena, it means I am in grave danger. At that time, I implore you to come quickly to help, for the sake of both country and people. This concerns the survival of our society and the safety of all living beings. I beg you to take this seriously and not be negligent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The situation is dire; I dare not say more. I entrust this to you, hoping you will consider it carefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Yours sincerely,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">Ning Zhuo</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21"></paragraph></div></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">After reading this letter, Zhu Xuanji was greatly alarmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">What's going on? What's happening!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">The previous letter had been about drinking wine and celebrating, but this one took a sharp turnâ€”suddenly it was about saving the nation and protecting the people?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">"The Child of Destiny, this is truly the Child of Destiny!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">Zhu Xuanji was inclined to believe that Ning Zhuo's plea for help was genuine. Even if there was some exaggeration, it couldn't be by much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">He immediately sprang into action!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">Although he desperately wanted to avoid any involvement with Ning Zhuo, this concerned the Southern Bean Kingdom and national securityâ€”he couldn't stand idly by.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">He urgently reported the situation to the monarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">Within an hour, he received a summons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">Zhu Xuanji made his way to the palace, following familiar routes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">However, at the great hall's entrance, guards stopped him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">"His Majesty commands that you wait here for orders," the guard said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">"What?" Zhu Xuanji became furious immediately. "I have urgent matters to discuss directly with His Majesty. How can this be treated so lightly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">"Xuanji, calm yourself." At this moment, an elderly man walked out of the great hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">He was imposing in stature, with white hair and beard, large-knuckled hands, and a vigorous spirit that emanated the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">Seeing the elder, Zhu Xuanji quickly bowed: "Prince Wang, greetings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">The elder's surname was Zhu and given name Zhu, a prince of the royal Zhu family, a Nascent Soul cultivator and one of the kingdom's pillars of support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">Prince Zhu nodded slightly and said to Zhu Xuanji: "To be frank, Xuanji, having you wait outside the hall was my suggestion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Zhu Xuanji: "Please explain why, Prince. Otherwise, I cannot accept this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Prince Zhu's eyes narrowed as he transmitted: "Can't accept it? You'll wait regardless!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">"Hmph, don't you understand your situation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">"This great hall was designed with formations to stabilize imperial fortune. Standing outside, you won't disturb His Majesty's destiny. But if you enter and we're all within the formation, who knows what might happen?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Zhu Xuanji's face darkened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">Prince Zhu snorted: "You fool, know your place! That Child of Destiny has contacted you repeatedly. â€”The Magma Immortal Palace, Misty Hidden Mountain, and now the Myriad Demons Cave..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">"What does this mean?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">"You're already too deeply entangled with him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">"And I fear these connections will only grow deeper!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">"Fortunately, your own destiny is remarkable enough to withstand it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">Zhu Xuanji's heart sank as he transmitted back with a bitter smile: "No, Your Highness, I can't withstand it, I really can't!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Prince Zhu glared: "Whether you can or not, you must. This is your karmic connectionâ€”cutting it forcibly would only invite terrible backlash."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">"Ah, let nature take its course."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">The bitterness on Zhu Xuanji's face deepened: "Your Highness, why do I feel like you're saying I won't live much longer?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">Prince Zhu's expression turned solemn: "Also, in the future, don't stand close to me when speaking. Just bow from a distance when we meet, don't come near this old man."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">With that, Prince Zhu retreated into the great hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">Zhu Xuanji could only communicate with the monarch through voice transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">The monarch told him: Ning Zhuo's plea for help must be taken very seriously. After all, he is the Child of Destiny. But from now on, all such letters should be forwarded to you, Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">For this Medicine Sect matter, you're being sent! Use the emergency relay stations for transportation, spare no expense, and reach the Medicine Valley as quickly as possible!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">But don't worry, the royal family will also send a Nascent Soul master to accompany you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">And so, without even seeing the monarch's face, Zhu Xuanji urgently left the capital.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">He traveled through relay stations, constantly teleporting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">Halfway there, he met up with Nascent Soul cultivator Shen Lingshu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">They traveled without rest, teleporting so frequently that both were dizzy and nauseous, rushing at maximum speed to reach the vicinity of Medicine Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Standing on a mountaintop, Zhu Xuanji saw the Medicine Sect's great formation suddenly rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">This was exactly as Ning Zhuo had described in his letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">With this, Zhu Xuanji's last hope vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">"Senior Shen, I'll go negotiate directly first, to rescue that troublemaker. Please hide nearby as backup," Zhu Xuanji said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">Though he was only at the Golden Core level, lower than his companion, on this mission he had royal orders marking him as the leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">After hearing this, Shen Lingshu smiled slightly: "No hurry, Friend Zhu. Let me divine first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Shen Lingshu appeared youthful, with handsome features and bright eyes. He wore a light cyan robe embroidered with mountains and clouds. His black hair was simply tied back with a wooden hairpin, and an ancient jade compass hung at his waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">He had earned deep trust from the Southern Bean Kingdom's monarch. â€”Or more accurately, from the Zhu family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">This was because he wasn't just skilled in the cultivation art of divination, but was also a son-in-law of the Zhu family, making him royal kin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Shen Lingshu calculated briefly, then said: "I've divined it. We should both appear and negotiate directly -this would be better. Of course, this is just my suggestion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Zhu Xuanji replied: "Then let's follow your guidance, Senior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">The next moment, Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu rose into the air together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">Zhu Xuanji's voice echoed through heaven and earth: "I am Zhu Xuanji of the Southern Bean Royal Family, serving in the Divine Constables Bureau, accompanied by Master Shen Lingshu. We come here on royal orders for a visit! Please open your gates and announce us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">His voice resonated throughout Medicine Valley, echoing for long moments and startling everyone in the sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">On the Original Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">When Ning Jiufan heard Zhu Xuanji's announcement, his heart leaped with joy: "It's Divine Constable Zhu! Haha, why has he come?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">"Oh! It must be Ning Zhuo, definitely Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">"That clever boy, he's still so sharp, actually making arrangements in advance and calling for reinforcements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">"This is truly a descendant of my Ning family! Haha, he could even outmaneuver Meng Kui, let alone Lin Bufan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Instantly, Ning Jiufan's confidence soared, and his bearing changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Though he was essentially a captive in dire straits, he stroked his beard and smiled: "Sect Leader Lin, do you hear? It's Divine Constable Zhu!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">"Months ago, Divine Constable Zhu visited our Fire Persimmon Immortal City, spoke with us several times, and got along harmoniously with our clan's Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">"If you doubt my official status, you can verify it with him. Divine Constable Zhu is renowned throughout the nation, and appearing here on behalf of the Southern Bean royal family, he certainly wouldn't lie."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Lin Bufan: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">What a headache.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Sect Leader Lin was getting a headache.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">He had thought that as a Nascent Soul cultivator who had carefully managed Medicine Valley for over a hundred years, with advantages in both terrain and people's support, dealing with a family that had migrated from the North would be effortless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">But he hadn't expected Ning Jiufan to be an official.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">He especially hadn't expected that after Ning Zhuo's disappearance, he would kidnap his daughter Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">And he certainly hadn't expected Zhu Xuanji to appear so quickly, bringing a Nascent Soul cultivator as backup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">Lin Bufan, who had thought he could control the situation, was struck by these successive changes. He painfully realized the situation had rapidly slipped from his grasp and become extremely dangerous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Ning Jiufan cupped his hands, appearing to have Lin Bufan's interests at heart, and advised: "Sect Leader Lin, please make a quick decision. After all, Divine Constable Zhu comes with royal orders. When he travels abroad, he represents the royal family's dignity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">"If you refuse to receive him, causing criticism, even if the Southern Bean royal family doesn't mind, and even if Zhu Xuanji is magnanimous, others will observe and have their thoughts..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">"In that case, Medicine Gate's business might decline severely. After all, who wants to maintain good relations with a force that has poor relations with the Southern Bean royal family?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">Lin Bufan snorted coldly: "Your words are cleverâ€”is this the style of you Northern men?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Ning Jiufan's smile froze slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">But Lin Bufan walked out, flying to Original Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">He opened a thin gap in the mountain-guarding formation and, through the barrier, said to Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu: "Having two distinguished guests visit Medicine Gate truly brings glory to our humble sect. This formation was not raised to refuse guests, but because Young Master Ning Zhuo's whereabouts were unclear. We raised it to protect him and aid in the search, guarding against accidents. I hope you both understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Lin Bufan, a mighty Nascent Soul cultivator, even referred to Ning Zhuo as "Young Master." By elevating Ning Zhuo's status this way, he expressed his own good intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Zhu Xuanji said: "I came precisely for him..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Before he could finish speaking, Ning Zhuo appeared in the air, with Lin Shanshan beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">Ning Zhuo bowed apologetically: "Brother Zhu, Sect Leader Lin, causing such a commotion is entirely my fault. Earlier, I ventured into the demon cave to explore, without reporting it. Coming out to find such activity, affecting the entire Medicine Gate, and even making you come personally, Brother Zhuâ€”this was truly beyond my expectations. I sincerely apologize to you both!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">After speaking, Ning Zhuo bowed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Beside him, Lin Shanshan smiled, first greeting Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu, then calling out publicly to Lin Bufan: "Father, you're too kind, thank you for your concern."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Lin Bufan's face bloomed with a spring-like smile as he said gently: "As long as you two are safe, I can rest easy. Next time, please don't wander off like this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Everyone's words were full of deeper meaning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">After the interaction, Lin Bufan deactivated the Mountain-Guarding Formation and invited Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu to enter the mountain together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">When they all landed on the mountain, the entire Myriad Medicine Sect was in an uproar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">People began discussing this matter with great enthusiasm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"So that's why the Mountain-Guarding Formation was suddenly activated - it was for Young Master Ning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"I was startled - I thought there might have been a beast tide coming up from the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"How could that be? The Ten Thousand Beasts Cave hasn't had any monster outbreaks in many years. When I saw Zhu Xuanji appear, I thought there might have been some serious criminal that Sect Leader Lin had activated the formation to capture."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"I never expected it was because of Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Did you just hear? Even Sect Leader Lin addressed Ning Zhuo as 'Young Master'!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"I've looked into it - the Ning family of Fire Persimmon Mountain isn't even that prominent. Why would Ning Zhuo receive such courtesy from Sect Leader Lin?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"I don't know! I only know that even the renowned Zhu Xuanji, the famous divine investigator known throughout the country, came specifically for Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Just who is Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"More than that, I'm curious why the Young Miss of our Sect, Sect Leader Lin's beloved daughter Lin Shanshan, would suddenly be seen walking arm in arm with Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Now that you mention it, I'm very curious too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"What else could it be? They're of equal status, like a golden boy and jade girl - they must have taken a liking to each other."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Hearing such discussions, Hua Guzi's face turned pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Seeing this, Han Zhou shook his head and sighed: "Everyone suffers. Hua Guzi, you..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Before he could finish consoling, Hua Guzi coldly interrupted: "Shut up!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Han Zhou sensed an unprecedented dangerous aura from Hua Guzi and quickly fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Hua Guzi gritted their teeth secretly: "Young Master Ning must have encountered danger earlier, otherwise he wouldn't have needed help from Lin Bufan and Zhu Xuanji."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"It must be that Lin Shanshan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Hmph, Lin Shanshan must have been captivated by Young Master's beauty and put him in danger. How terrible, this woman is terrible! Actually trying to steal the Young Master from me!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The senior and junior disciples were also in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Little Junior Sister? How did Little Junior Sister suddenly appear, and standing together with Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">"Wasn't she under house arrest? How did she sneak out?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">"I know Master well. He wouldn't suddenly activate the Mountain-Guarding Formation unless something major happened."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">"What are you suggesting?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">"Could it be that Little Junior Sister and Ning Zhuo tried to elope, and Master discovered them, so he used the formation to seal them in?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">"This Ning Zhuo has ulterior motives, plotting meticulously. For their elopement to succeed, he even specifically invited Zhu Xuanji as backup. Now that he and Little Junior Sister are sealed within Wanyao Valley by Master, they'll eventually be found, so Zhu Xuanji had no choice but to appear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">The fellow disciples: ......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Many of them clutched their chests, feeling as if their hearts were about to break.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"How could Little Junior Sister..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"I've always disliked that pretty boy Ning Zhuo. This guy must have a silver tongue, that scoundrel, he's nothing but a scoundrel!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Where's Senior Brother? I need to tell Senior Brother! This is too serious!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Senior Brother must be worried sick in the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Sigh, let's go find Senior Brother and report the situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Wait, these are just our speculations..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"What are we waiting for? It'll be too late if we wait any longer!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Several people hurriedly went to the back mountain of Dazheng Peak, but when they reached the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave, it was completely empty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Senior Brother?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"Where's Senior Brother?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"Senior Brother is gone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Meanwhile, in the formation within the formation...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Linghu Jiu paced back and forth, practicing his sword techniques until he was gasping for breath: "Damn it, what kind of formation is this? How do I get out?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Brother Ning Zhuo! Brother Ning Zhuo!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Being unskilled with formations, he could only futilely call out Ning Zhuo's name, hoping for help.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
