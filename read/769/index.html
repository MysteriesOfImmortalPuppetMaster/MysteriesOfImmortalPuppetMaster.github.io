<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Inside the Profound Armor Cave, the cultivators were discussing spiritedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Sure enough, the victor of this match belongs to Tie Zheng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Tie Zheng is too strong! When he eliminated Lu Zeng and Ao Pan, it already foreshadowed the ending of this Small Test."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Cultivator Hao chuckled, "That is not necessarily true."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The surrounding cultivators immediately cast doubtful gazes at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Cultivator Hao did not explain. However, looking at the projection of the battlefield in the center of the formation, his eyes held a faint look of anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Cloud Sea Cliff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">With a crisp sound, the teacup in Ban Jie's hand revealed a crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"What? Ban Ji was actually eliminated!" Upon receiving this intelligence, Ban Jie felt a massive shock in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">According to the divination results, this inheritance was supposed to have a significantly major effect on Ban Ji. How could he be eliminated?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"The most critical point is, he wasn't eliminated by Ning Zhuo, but by that Tie Zheng!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"No, not being eliminated by Ning Zhuo is actually good. After all, he is Ban Ji's Human Tribulation..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"I just wonder if he can ultimately seize the first place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ban Jie frowned deeply, her eyes losing focus. At this moment, her heart was in turmoil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The final battle of this Small Test had already unfolded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo and three others surrounded Tie Zheng, launching attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Various weapons collided, kicking up waves of air and producing a series of explosions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">After fighting for a short while, the intensity of the battle dropped sharply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Having fought in the chaotic melee for so long, the cultivators present had all consumed a massive amount of energy and were physically and mentally exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Tie Zheng first fought two against one, then took out Ban Ji's group. Now facing Ning Zhuo, he, too, had fallen into a state of exhaustion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He held a bronze cleaver in one hand, gasping for breath. Sweat and blood mixed together, flowing down his entire body and soaking the messy hair on his forehead. His aura was chaotic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo and the others cast wary gazes at the bronze cleaver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Throughout the fight, this bronze weapon had repeatedly demonstrated formidable power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Tie Zheng narrowed his eyes. Double vision was appearing in his sight; he knew well that after fighting desperately in multiple matches, he had reached his physical and mental limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"I cannot drag this out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He looked down, scanning his surroundings, and finally, his gaze locked onto Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">In the next moment, he slashed out with his blade!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Unadorned and lacking flash, it was just a blur of black shadow, yet it carried a fierce and tough power capable of cleaving mountains!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo and the other three retreated in succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Fighting until now, Tie Zheng's physical stamina had dried up; his slashing speed was not even thirty percent of what it was before. But Ning Zhuo and the others had also reached their limits, and their dodging speed was quite slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">With two clang sounds, the cleaver chopped down. Its trajectory was straight, snapping two Mystic Weapons in half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The cleaver's momentum did not diminish, lunging straight for Ning Zhuo's chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Tie Zheng regarded Ning Zhuo as the number one target, prioritizing the elimination of this competitor who posed the greatest threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">However, Ning Zhuo did not panic. His right hand grabbed at the air, and a brand-new Mystic Weapon flew out. It landed in his hand, transforming into a long bronze whip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The long whip moved with the turning and trembling of Ning Zhuo's wrist and arm. The body of the whip was like a fragile willow in the wind, flexible to the extreme, lightly brushing against the cleaver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Using softness to bear the hard, using curves to dissolve the straight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The intent within the cleaver was neutralized just like that. Its offensive momentum plummeted, and it was easily blocked by Ning Zhuo's other bronze weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"You also got through and obtained a seventh Mystic Weapon?!" Tie Zheng stared wide-eyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The other three cultivators felt astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo was too good at hiding things. After fighting in the melee for so long, he was actually concealing such a big trump card!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">At this moment, even the cultivators of the Profound Armor Cave felt surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"What is going on? Where did he get a seventh Mystic Weapon?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"I clearly saw that after he collected the sixth one, he rested in place, waiting until the third stage opened!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"No, perhaps like Tie Zheng, this is an external Mystic Weapon he brought in himself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">At this time, Cultivator Hao spoke up, "No, this is precisely a Mystic Weapon from within our cave. Ning Zhuo did not cheat; it was I who disguised and covered up his actions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Cultivator Hao was the leader of this Small Test. His voluntary admission immediately drew many inquiring gazes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Cultivator Hao had a draft prepared in his heart. His expression remained unchanged as he spoke slowly, "Back in the second stage, I had already sensed it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"I had a premonition that Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji would have a confrontation, so on a whim, I camouflaged Ning Zhuo's subsequent performance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Sure enough, in the third stage, the Ban family cheated openly, disregarding our side's reputation and infiltrating so many people just to forcefully prop up their family's Ban Ji."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Cultivator Hao possessed the highest authority in the venue and was able to manipulate the Profound Armor Cave's Grand Formation more deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In fact, Ning Zhuo had refined the seventh Mystic Weapon. But right under the eyes of all the cultivators, Cultivator Hao faked a disguise, deceiving everyone - including those who had been nearby waiting for the third stage to open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In reality, after Ning Zhuo refined the sixth item, the bronze fan, he only rested for a moment before rushing non-stop to the location of the seventh weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After a bitter struggle, he successfully obtained the bronze whip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Later, when he arrived at the limestone cave, Ning Zhuo kept this trump card hidden, not easily revealing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Now that Cultivator Hao revealed the truth, the crowd could not help but exclaim repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"This Ning Zhuo is too good at hiding!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"He really can endure. To think he held back such a trump card until the very end."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"It's not that he didn't want to use it, right? You have to realize that during the first half of the melee, Ao Pan was present. If he had seen such a good long whip, he definitely would have competed for it with all his might."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Tie Zheng's luck is also a bit too good! Not only did he collect a seventh Mystic Weapon, but in terms of Martial Dao intent, it happens to be countered by Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Tie Zheng closed in, the cleaver in his hand carrying the force of ten thousand jun as it chopped toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo took a step back, extending his arm slightly forward to give the whip in his hand time to react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The bronze long whip undulated like waves, guided by Ning Zhuo's arm and wrist, and driven by the infusion of spiritual energy. The whip followed the momentum and flew out, its tip sticking to the outer edge of the cleaver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Zzzzz - Hum!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Amidst violent friction, golden sparks splashed in all directions, the sound setting one's teeth on edge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The fierce and unyielding cleaver was cleverly led astray by three points due to the whip's flexible arc. It smashed heavily into the cave wall on the side, sending gravel flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"It's like this again!" Tie Zheng gritted his teeth, his heart sinking to rock bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This was not the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">His several attacks had all returned without success under the long whip. All his efforts turned into bubbles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Tie Zheng breathed heavily, panting like a bellows. Air poured into his body, seeming to tear at his lungs. Every breath brought a burning pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Huff huff huff...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">What made him even more anxious was the heavy double vision before his eyes. Mental exhaustion brought waves of drowsiness that grew stronger and stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Although the cleaver was strong, activating the Martial Dao intent within it required intense consumption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This consumption was not just physical, but mostly mental.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Although Tie Zheng was a Martial Artist, he cultivated the Lower Dantian. In the trinity of Essence, Qi, and Spirit, Spirit was actually his shortest stave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Tie Zheng knew very well he could not persist for long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He used the cleaver hoping to break the deadlock, but he didn't expect Ning Zhuo to actually pull out a weapon of the same level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">If it had been the sixth weapon, which could only use spiritual energy to project a sharp edge, it would not have been enough to withstand the cleaver's intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Tie Zheng could already smell the scent of defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo and the other three cultivators were united in resisting him, a Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"To break this situation, I need to persuade these three, point out the balance of power, and join hands to attack Ning Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">This thought flashed through Tie Zheng's Divine Sea like a meteor, then vanished without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He opened his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He opened his mouth, but ultimately sighed faintly in his heart, giving rise to a feeling of helplessness and irritability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">If it were a cultivator like Ao Pan, perhaps they could take such action. But Tie Zheng's nature was solitary and arrogant. He had cultivated in the wilderness for many years; asking him to engage in such diplomatic maneuvering was difficult for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">It wasn't that he couldn't see the path to victory, but he had no interest in even attempting it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">At that moment, Tie Zheng also understood the truth of a minor injury he had sustained earlier - discarding his shield had been an intentional act by Ning Zhuo! Fighting until now...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Clang clang clang...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Various weapons collided in mid-air. Five figures constantly flipped and moved, engaging in a back-and-forth of advance and retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Finally, exhaustion reached its peak, causing Tie Zheng's retreating footsteps to slow slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Opportunity!" Light burst from Ning Zhuo's eyes. Treading a mystical step, his body was led by the bronze whip, and his Martial Dao intent permeated his whole body, making him sway like bamboo in the wind - agile and unpredictable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo easily dodged several of Tie Zheng's weapons, then shook his wrist violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The long whip danced in mid-air, instantly snapping straight like a bowstring. A soft, elastic force accumulated to the extreme, then exploded with a bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Tie Zheng's web between his thumb and forefinger split open, blood shooting out. The cleaver in his hand was shaken from his grip and flew out, landing far away with a clang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The other three cultivators were overjoyed and rushed forward. One of them, with a sly look in his eyes, changed course midway, lunging for the cleaver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo ignored it, taking the opportunity to launch a wild attack on Tie Zheng. Seeing this, the other two cultivators were severely affected and lost their bearing for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Tie Zheng cultivated the Martial Path; his nature was tenacious and unyielding. Naturally unwilling to accept defeat like this, he finally reached out and slapped his waist, releasing a hanging bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Blade Beast: Ravaging Light!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">A stream of green-bronze poured out, emitting a chilling blade light. In an instant, it solidified into a form - a bladed leopard beast with no eyes or ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">A massive number of blades emitted a buzzing sound as the blade beast transformed into a streak of bronze lightning, pouncing straight at Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Wherever it passed, whether stalactites or stalagmites, everything shattered with a bang, turning into dust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The other three cultivators hurriedly dodged, wishing for Tie Zheng and Ning Zhuo to tear each other apart and both end up wounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Facing the Blade Beast, Ning Zhuo showed no fear; he had expected this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Pushing with both palms, the various bronze weapons he controlled flipped and danced before him, transforming into a Battle Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">In the next moment, the Blade Beast brazenly charged into the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">A series of metallic explosions rang out as the weapons collided with the Blade Beast with full force. The Blade Beast was like a meteor, full of momentum. The weapons, however, coordinated with each other, forming a defensive line that rose and fell like waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Although Ning Zhuo had discarded his bronze shield, it was replaced by the stronger bronze long whip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The long whip overcame hardness with softness, crack-crack whipping sounds ringing out as it continuously weakened the Blade Beast's momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The Blade Beast felt incredibly stifled. Many of its heavy, powerful attacks were redirected, landing on the stone ground without achieving any results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The vibration of its blades weakened rapidly, and amidst the uniform whistling, disjointed noises began to appear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo's sixth weapon, the bronze fan, was also a main offensive weapon. The wind blades and waves of fire it kicked up successively forced the Blade Beast back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">This scene stunned everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The cultivators of the Profound Armor Cave almost had their eyes pop out. The scene they envisioned of the Blade Beast crushing everything like dry weeds did not appear. Instead, Ning Zhuo's hastily assembled Battle Formation was displaying excellent defensive capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"The Blade Beast is obviously much weaker than before!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"This type of weapon isn't good for prolonged battles, is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"No wonder Tie Zheng hasn't used it again since eliminating Lu Zeng and Ao Pan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"That is to say, the ultimate winner of this Flying Cloud Small Test is still unknown!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Tie Zheng is a Golden Core cultivator after all..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Looking at it now, it's possible for Ning Zhuo to win too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Or perhaps both sides will be wounded, eventually letting the remaining three cultivators take the advantage. This situation isn't unheard of."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The cultivators exchanged words frequently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In their eyes, the result had originally been set. Unexpectedly, at the final juncture, suspense arose again. This undoubtedly added to the excitement of watching the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The Blade Beast Ravaging Light fought its way through the Battle Formation. Although Ning Zhuo dodged, he still sustained injuries, blood flowing freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ravaging Light pounced at Ning Zhuo, but his Battle Formation intercepted it once again. Ravaging Light's impacts were whittled down time and time again. The buzzing of its blades dropped from ear-piercing to ear-grating, and then to a hoarse rasp...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The shiny bronze luster all over its body also dimmed amidst the continuous grinding. The blades even began to show a large number of rolled edges, and even gaps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">A gleam of light flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes. Feeling the time was ripe, he shouted at Tie Zheng:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"Fellow Daoist, you and I fight for supremacy, but this beast is your personal item. If it breaks here, it is truly destroyed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The Blade Beast Ravaging Light was not a Mystic Weapon from within the Profound Armor Cave, but one Tie Zheng brought himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">That meant that even if it was damaged to the point of meeting the criteria, it would not be transported out by the Grand Formation; it would eventually fall into a state of total destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Hearing this, the corner of Tie Zheng's eye twitched. He slowly lowered the bronze longbow in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Fighting to this point, Ning Zhuo was also in a sorry state. Blood and sweat mixed together, he was gasping for air, and his whole body was covered in wounds. But Ning Zhuo was still full of fighting spirit, and his shout just now was full of vigor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">This kind of physical and mental foundation made Tie Zheng look at him with new eyes. It was hard to believe a Foundation Establishment cultivator could have such robust basic qualities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Tie Zheng, on the other hand, had a dried-up Divine Sea. Bleeding from his seven orifices, seeing layers of double images, and feeling drowsy, he was holding on by sheer will alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Tie Zheng was not worried about himself. In the Profound Armor Cave's Small Test, his life would be preserved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">But he was truly worried about the safety of the Blade Beast Ravaging Light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Tie Zheng was different from others. Having suffered a great deal of betrayal, he trusted his Blade Beast the most, treating it as his only partner in the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Tie Zheng released his weakened Divine Sense, mobilizing it with difficulty. Ravaging Light retreated a few steps, suddenly turned around, and ran back to Tie Zheng's feet, still baring its fangs and growling at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Tie Zheng extended his palm, gently stroking the Blade Beast's head as if it truly possessed life and was his beloved pet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Whatever, I concede." Tie Zheng sighed, looking at Ning Zhuo with a complex gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">In the next moment, the Grand Formation activated, transporting both him and the Blade Beast out of the arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Without their master, the Mystic Weapons he had refined earlier became ownerless objects, falling to the ground one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
