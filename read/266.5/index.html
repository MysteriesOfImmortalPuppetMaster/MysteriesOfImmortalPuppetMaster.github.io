The judge’s scene of seeking justice is extremely, extremely, extremely important!<br/>
<br/>
The entire first major volume serves to portray Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
If the events involving Sun Lingtong and Cheng Bai are to reveal Ning Zhuo's complete character, then this scene uncovers the core essence of Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
To perfect this scene, I’ve been working tirelessly for three consecutive days, staying up until 5 a.m. each day.<br/>
<br/>
Today, I even pulled an all-nighter.<br/>
<br/>
I’m personally quite satisfied with it.<br/>
<br/>
This scene is likely the peak of my recent years' literary work.<br/>
<br/>
The overall plot has two intertwining lines: one revolves around the stage of the children's orphanage while the other is centered on the Historical Pavilion of the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
These two lines intersect and unfold simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, the performance of "Seeking Justice" on stage, directed by Ning, intertwines with the events involving Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, Ning Xiaohui, and others.<br/>
<br/>
Both space and plotlines are interwoven.<br/>
<br/>
Through the play within the play, we depict Ning Zhuo’s hesitation, his wavering, and ultimately, his self-redemption.<br/>
<br/>
His final psychological transformation—from the once cowardly admission of being a thief to proudly acknowledging his true nature as a thief.<br/>
<br/>
(Through Sun Lingtong's recollections, the concept of "thief" is elevated.<br/>
<br/>
Here, "thief" no longer refers merely to a surface-level "robber" but symbolizes a spirit of adventure, a challenge, a refusal to compromise with the outside world, and a firm adherence to one's true self.) There are multiple parallels within this literary scene.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, the parallel between Zhu Xuanji and the judge.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's encouragement of the judge also indirectly portrays Zhu Xuanji's true nature and personal ideals.<br/>
<br/>
The parallels between Ning's criticisms and the judge, the powerful ministers, and the criminals.<br/>
<br/>
These three represent the three facets of Ning Zhuo's personality.<br/>
<br/>
The parallels between Sun Lingtong and Li Leifeng.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji wants to use Li Leifeng's influence to inspire Ning Zhuo, but ultimately fails.<br/>
<br/>
This is because Sun Lingtong nurtured Ning Zhuo, awakening within him the elements of adventure, challenge, and resistance.<br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng, sitting high on the stage, sheds light on Ning Zhuo, just as Zhu Xuanji, lofty and distant, strives to win Ning Zhuo over.<br/>
<br/>
But Sun Lingtong is different.<br/>
<br/>
He is a friend, a brother, someone who stands alongside Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning recalls his past with Sun Lingtong, he is actually coming to terms with himself.<br/>
<br/>
So, when he sees his younger self in the audience, he sees Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
When he finally understands his true nature and realizes who he really is, he is no longer confused.<br/>
<br/>
Yun Shang once offered him a second path in life, Zhu Xuanji gave him a third, both causing him to hesitate.<br/>
<br/>
But now, he will no longer hesitate.<br/>
<br/>
From this moment on, he completes his psychological transformation and becomes a steadfast warrior who can maintain his original resolve!<br/>
<br/>
And with this unwavering stance, he will face the final battle for the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Such a plot design is even more challenging than "The Legend of the Human Ancestor." It involves a play within a play and so many characters, requiring an extremely intricate structure.<br/>
<br/>
This level of design is relatively rare in online novels.<br/>
<br/>
Consider this a small gift to all the readers who have supported this book.<br/>
<br/>
Here, I must also apologize to everyone!<br/>
<br/>
The climactic ending of the volume has been delayed again and again, making everyone wait anxiously.<br/>
<br/>
I genuinely wanted to write up to the climax on time.<br/>
<br/>
Really, I don't think anyone in this world wanted it more than I did.<br/>
<br/>
But do you know something?<br/>
<br/>
For the scene with the judge seeking justice, I initially estimated it would take me 3-5 drafts to finish it.<br/>
<br/>
But I couldn’t do it!<br/>
<br/>
Starting from Chapter 257 up until now, Chapter 266, it's already been 9 chapters.<br/>
<br/>
And that doesn't even count the long chapters within those 9.<br/>
<br/>
For example, Chapter 266, "I Will Ignite This Fire with My Own Hands," is 5,000 characters long.<br/>
<br/>
Plans are beautiful, but in practice, it’s hard to estimate things accurately.<br/>
<br/>
The main reason is that I’m innovating.<br/>
<br/>
What I’m writing doesn’t have a reference point.<br/>
<br/>
It’s not the typical "level up and fight, then level up and fight again" pattern.<br/>
<br/>
Every character has their own thoughts, personality, logic, and varying levels of information.<br/>
<br/>
They’re all colliding on the stage of Lava Immortal City, forming alliances, betraying each other, and constantly shifting.<br/>
<br/>
This makes it very difficult for me to estimate accurately!<br/>
<br/>
The upside is that the plot remains fresh, and readers can’t be sure how events will unfold.<br/>
<br/>
In my twenty-plus years of reading online novels, I’ve never come across a plot like this.<br/>
<br/>
The downside is that this kind of innovation is hard to predict.<br/>
<br/>
Even as the creator, I find it difficult to estimate the word count.<br/>
<br/>
Here, I apologize to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, well...<br/>
<br/>
I won't make predictions anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t even know which chapter will finally close out the first volume.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe don’t expect too much.<br/>
<br/>
The first volume might not have a grand climax; it could end up being similar to this smaller one, or maybe even worse.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, with this mindset, would it be better to continue reading this book?<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, in my view, there’s no need to get angry while reading an online novel.<br/>
<br/>
Our relationship should be a romantic one.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your support—there are so many leaders and so many readers buying extra chapters.<br/>
<br/>
That’s why I’m pulling all-nighters, striving to innovate, and writing such plots.<br/>
<br/>
This is our mutual response to each other.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I also worry that I might be getting too self-indulgent.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve made that mistake often, especially with "Reverend Insanity" and even more so with "Infinite Bloodcore."<br/>
<br/>
The outline for the first volume of "Mysteries of the Immortal Puppet Master" is fixed; it can’t be changed.<br/>
<br/>
I simply don’t have the time to revise the outline.<br/>
<br/>
Daily updates like these are something I’ve never done before.<br/>
<br/>
Old friends know this well.<br/>
<br/>
Haha.<br/>
<br/>
After all, I’m a self-proclaimed slow writer.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I’ve already given it my all! I’m literally bleeding while updating!!<br/>
<br/>
If the writing becomes stiff or if you didn’t like today’s plot, that’s on me.<br/>
<br/>
Well… let’s just say this is my final act of defiance.<br/>
<br/>
The first major volume can only be like this; in the second volume, I will try to make some changes.<br/>
<br/>
As for whether it will succeed or fail, I can't predict.<br/>
<br/>
All I can say is that I’ve always been giving it my all to repay the support of the readers.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, thank you all!<br/>
