<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">When Cave Master Moxin proposed recruiting the Old Stone Monster, Lu Tu immediately agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">However, they did not expect that multiple attempts at recruitment would fail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Lu Tu, of course, also knew the sinister intentions of Cave Master Moxin and others, but he could not care; after all, before a great war, manpower was urgently needed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">But he could not allow these people to play tricks. After much thought, he simply decided to take action personally, bringing along the two Nascent Soul cultivators Moxin and Xueying to put pressure on the Old Monster in the Stone, forcing him to come out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Deep within the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes. Although exhausted, his eyes were full of joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Stone Forged Earth Treasure Divine Ability... sixty percent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He was about to rest when he found that Sun Lingtong was missing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Huh? Where did the boss go?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Sun Lingtong had specially left a flying message, like a bird, circling around Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo took the message and immediately understood the cause and effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"The boss has come up with something new again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo shook his head helplessly and smiled bitterly. He immediately chiseled open the stone skin and saw the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat that had become a stone ship. The latter was struggling to survive, and the full text of the "Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing" shone brightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo came to the stone ship and penetrated his divine sense. Sun Lingtong sensed it and immediately communicated with Ning Zhuo using divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Little Zhuo, this is so fun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Using this method, not only has my physical foundation greatly increased, but I can also learn about the past experiences of the Old Monster in the Stone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"As an Earth Spirit, it's really boring. But occasionally, many novel things happen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"You should try it too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sun Lingtong enthusiastically invited Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo breathed a sigh of relief: "Boss, as long as you're okay."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"I'll go to the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to rest first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"This is the Thousand Peaks Forest, after all, the enemy's territory. We'd better mine quickly to avoid accidents."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">As soon as Ning Zhuo finished speaking, a powerful fluctuation of energy occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The fluctuation quickly covered the entire mountain peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">On the periphery, an enormous formation was activated, forming a barrier that enveloped the entire sky-pillar giant tree!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun and Ning: ?!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Sun Lingtong could no longer care about cultivation: "Not good, could this be a trap? Little Zhuo, let's run quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo reacted even faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">As soon as Sun Lingtong transmitted the thought with divine sense, he grabbed the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, taking the boat and Sun Lingtong, and plunged into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Sun Lingtong's stone skin was already several inches thick, struggling with his small arms and legs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo, who had now mastered sixty percent of the divine ability, took one look and saw through it. He transmitted with divine sense to Sun Lingtong: "Don't move, boss. I need to undo this stone skin for you. Wait a moment; let's leave here first!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">As a result, when Ning Zhuo arrived at the dragon head cabin, he discovered an extremely bad reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Boss, we can't run. This formation has suppressed space; the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon can't shuttle through. Forcibly using it would be like an egg hitting a stone wall," Ning Zhuo transmitted with divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"?!!" Sun Lingtong was struck as if by a bolt from the blue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"I'll release you first." Ning Zhuo just reached out, preparing to remove Sun Lingtong's stone skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The voice of Cave Master Mo Yuan echoed throughout the mountain peak: "Lu Hong of the Six Caves Sect, together with Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying, has come to pay respects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Old Monster in the Stone, how about coming out to talk?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The sound waves were vast, penetrating all the way along the cave entrance, eventually reaching the deepest part of the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon shook slightly in the sound waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Inside the dragon head cabin, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong's hearts also jumped heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Lu Hong? The Great Cave Master of the Six Caves Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"And Moxin, Xueying... Why have they come?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"They want to contact the Old Monster in the Stone; with such a posture, they want to force him out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Sun and Ning exchanged thoughts via divine sense and realized the seriousness of the situation almost instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Since the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon could not shuttle through space, the area they could maneuver in became extremely limited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Once the three Nascent Soul cultivators discovered that the Old Monster in the Stone was dead and that there were traces of mining, they would certainly not withdraw the formation but conduct a large-scale search.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">At that time, could the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon continue to hide and avoid their search?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The possibility was too small!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Because before, Sun Lingtong had tried. In the main hall of the Six Caves Sect's headquarters, they were discovered by Cave Master Moxin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">And now, Cave Master Moxin was among them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Not only that, but the universally acknowledged stronger Mo Yuan Cave Master had also personally come!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">A desperate situation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Life's ups and downs came too fast, too suddenly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Just now, Sun and Ning were still elated, envisioning a bright future in a beautiful reality. The next moment, the situation took a sharp turn, and they fell into a desperate situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The pressure of death came upon them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo's face turned pale, feeling it difficult even to breathe: "How can we break this predicament?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong subconsciously struggled within the thick stone skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Suddenly, Sun Lingtong's movements froze, and his divine sense fluctuated violently: "Little Zhuo, I have an idea!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Let's both drill into the stone sphere and let the stone skin wrap around us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"In this way, we can pretend to be the Old Stone Monster."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo shook his head: "I thought about it. This is unreliable! Because Mo Yuan and others will certainly test the Old Monster in the Stone. We are not even familiar with his tone and manner of speech..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Speaking of this, Ning Zhuo paused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He suddenly remembered his earlier exchange with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">By actively enduring the divine ability 'Stone Forged Earth Treasure' and using the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, Sun Lingtong entered a fetal breath state and learned many of the Old Monster in the Stone's memories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Voice tone and manner of speech would naturally not be a problem!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Outside the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Mo Yuan, Moxin, and Xueying hovered in the sky, waiting for a moment, but did not see a response from the Old Monster in the Stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Hmph, this old monster is so sullen; could he still be in a deep sleep?" Cave Master Xueying snorted coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Impossible. We have blocked the void and suppressed earth movement. Although the Old Monster in the Stone is a Nascent Soul cultivator, he was born as an Earth Spirit, and the instinct to burrow underground has been ingrained in his bones for a long time. This time, with earth escape being forbidden, he must have reacted. He just doesn't dare to come out seeing that we have the Great Cave Master with us!" Cave Master Moxin flattered Mo Yuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Mo Yuan's expression was indifferent: "Let's go, let's meet the Old Monster in the Stone together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Saying that, he took the lead in descending.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Afterward, Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying exchanged glances and followed closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This sky-pillar giant tree's cave was complex, with many secret passages, but it could not trouble Nascent Soul-level cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Moreover, they had previously sent cultivators to pay respects and had figured out the path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Although these cultivators were killed by Cave Master Moxin, the intelligence they brought back was not destroyed. Therefore, Mo Yuan and the others quickly arrived at the final cave hall behind the mountain wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The huge cave entrance was pitch black, seeming to swallow even light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The previous group of Six Caves Sect cultivators had stopped here, set up a formation, and even sacrificed many companions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Throughout, they did not dare to enter the giant cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Mo Yuan and the three others did not slow down, proceeding directly forward, passing through a passage, and saw the stone sphere at the bottom of the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">When Mo Yuan and the other three were ten steps away from the stone sphere, they took the initiative to stop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Old Monster in the Stone," Mo Yuan called softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying kept their faces solemn, secretly on guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Although they had strength in numbers, after all, this was the Old Monster in the Stone's territory, and he had the geographical advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Old Stone Monster had been residing here for many years and might have developed some powerful trump cards here. In any case, being cautious was never wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">They did not know that the Old Stone Monster had long since died, and hiding inside was a Mechanical dragon and Sun and Ning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong and the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat were both taken out and tightly attached to the stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">As for Ning Zhuo, he was gasping for breath, almost collapsing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Just now, he had raced against time, fully squeezing his essence, energy, and spirit, urging the 'Stone Forged Earth Treasure' divine ability in his sea of consciousness and dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Even though he had mastered over sixty percent of the divine ability and had the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon providing a vast amount of mana, Ning Zhuo had thrillingly managed to restore the stone sphere before the three cultivators arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Previously, Ning Zhuo would never have thought that he would actively help restore the stone sphere to its original state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">But the life-and-death trial had just begun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The stone sphere temporarily bluffed the three Nascent Soul cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Cave Master Mo Yuan softly called "Old Monster in the Stone"; Sun and Ning had to respond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Not responding would be disrespecting Lu Hong, a high-level Nascent Soul cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">So, Sun Lingtong, according to the fragments of memory, made a hoarse and aged voice: "Lu Hong, did you finish the Thousand Peaks Earth Vein Map you promised to make for me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Cave Master Mo Yuan's face immediately sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">This involved an old matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Cave Master Mo Yuan was skilled in painting. In those years, seeking a breakthrough in his painting skills, he wanted to depict the Earth Vein Map of the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He took the initiative to find the Old Monster in the Stone, spent a lot of time, and paid a considerable price, finally persuading the Old Monster in the Stone to cooperate with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Old Monster in the Stone was himself an Earth Spirit; if he could grasp the Thousand Peaks Earth Vein Map, it would greatly benefit his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">As a result, the two joined forces, and just after completing thirty percent of the exploration, they were mercilessly suppressed by the Ginseng Beard Dragon King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The Ginseng Beard Dragon King was a Soul Formation level existence, the undisputed strongest in the Thousand Peaks Forest, possessing the most faith, with tens of thousands of dragon beards reaching deep underground, entangling numerous sky-pillar giant trees and intertwining roots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Although Mo Yuan and the Old Monster in the Stone joined forces, after all, they were only at the Nascent Soul level and were no match for the Ginseng Beard Dragon King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Moreover, their attempt to explore the entire Earth Vein of the Thousand Peaks Forest also touched upon the interests of the Ginseng Beard Dragon King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Such a significant matter as the Earth Vein, naturally, one feelt safe only when controlling it oneself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">There was no surprise that Mo Yuan and the Old Monster in the Stone suffered a heavy defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Their first cooperation ended in failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Old Monster in the Stone was seriously injured and held great resentment towards Cave Master Mo Yuan. Because beforehand, Lu Hong had promised that the possibility of success was great, had hyped it up for a long time, and had seriously neglected the existence of the Ginseng Beard Dragon King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Now, Sun Lingtong brought up this old matter proactively, with two purposes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The first purpose was naturally to show his identity, confirming that he was the Old Monster in the Stone. The second purpose was to preemptively block their invitation. Because once the Old Monster in the Stone had to act, he would no longer be in stone sphere form, and Sun and Ning would be exposed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Lu Hong snorted coldly: "Old monster, you still have the face to bring up what happened back then?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"If you hadn't withdrawn in advance, if we had fought side by side, we could have at least cut off a hundred of the Dragon King's ginseng beards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"As a result, you deserted in the face of battle, causing me to fight alone. After cutting off more than thirty ginseng beards, I could only admit defeat and surrender."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"You were indeed seriously injured, but wasn't I also?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Moreover, since then, our Six Caves Sect has had to set up a Dragon King Temple, offering incense to the Ginseng Beard Dragon King from then on!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"It was precisely because we paid a huge price that we calmed the Dragon King's anger. From this perspective, you owe me a favor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Sun Lingtong immediately retorted: "Hmph, if it weren't for your instigation back then, I was doing fine alone; how could I have been injured?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"This time, no matter what you say, I won't go out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"The armies of the Two Note Kingdom are coming to attack; let them come. At worst, I'll just leave the Thousand Peaks Forest!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Sun Lingtong's heart was pounding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Even though he was wrapped in stone skin, it was hard to stay calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">However, this speech was not improvised but suggested by Ning Zhuo. In Sun Lingtong's view, these words were too risky, as if provoking the three Nascent Soul cultivators to take action!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Lu Hong's expression sank further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Sun Lingtong's words hit upon the deepest worry in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">If the Old Monster in the Stone threatened to surrender, he could handle it. At least, if they took action, they would occupy the moral high ground among the natives of the Thousand Peaks Forest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">But if the Old Monster in the Stone wanted to leave, he couldn't stop him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">If he took action, it would be too overbearing and would arouse resentment and suspicion among the various forces and individuals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">And these were things Lu Hong very much did not want to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">So, Lu Hong smiled lightly and took out a piece of soil from his bosom, displaying it in front of everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">It was a piece of white soil, presenting a bright white color, pure and flawless. It had no earthy smell at all but emitted a faint fragrance, like a breeze brushing one's face, similar to the sandalwood incense of temples.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">An Earth Attribute Merit Supreme Treasure, and also one of the Buddhist supreme treasures: the Western Pure Land!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">There was a poem that said:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265"><div style=" padding: 8px; font-style: italic;">"White earth shines, illuminating the soul,<br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">All thoughts are purified, Buddha Dharma arises.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Western Bliss, immaculate earth,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Washes away dust and troubles, returning to the pure realm."</paragraph></div></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Wherever this soil exists, it is a place beyond the mundane, capable of cleansing dust, purifying pollution, eliminating karmic hindrances, and offsetting the erosion of evil spirits, transforming everything it touches into purity and harmony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Not only that, for cultivators, it can purify the soul, eliminate worries and obsessions, and guide practitioners into the sacred realm of the Western Pure Land.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">As soon as this soil appeared, Buddhist fragrance lingered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying immediately took a step back, revealing looks of disgust and apprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Sun and Ning: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">They never expected that Cave Master Lu Hong came prepared. Coercion and inducement were his means. Secretly setting up a formation was his coercion, and taking out the Western Pure Land was his inducement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"Old Monster in the Stone, haven't you always wanted to seek the Western Pure Land?" Lu Hong smiled, "Now, it's right in front of you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Sun and Ning urgently discussed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"Old Monster in the Stone" was silent for a moment before speaking: "Leave the Pure Land, and when the armies arrive here, I will take action."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Lu Hong laughed: "Such a precious treasure as the Western Pure Land, how could I let you obtain it so easily?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"Moreover, this place of yours isn't any important location; the armies might not even attack here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">"Don't say such opportunistic words; otherwise, you'll be looked down upon by us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Speaking of this, Lu Hong paused and revealed an astonishing plan: "The vanguard of the Two Note Kingdom has already stationed below the Thousand Peaks Forest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"The commander Du Tiechuan is also commanding the central army, located at Muwheel Town."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"Both places are heavily defended; we will not attack them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">"City of Green Forest is the rear base for this war, continuously training and reorganizing new troops."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">"We have learned that one of the forbidden armies, the Golden Halberd Army, has arrived at Celestial City of Green Forest. They are about to set off to Muwheel Town to join the central army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">"Therefore, we have decided to gather more than half of the Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators in the Thousand Peaks Forest to ambush them on their marching route!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">"If you want the Western Pure Land, sign this contract, and we'll act together then."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Sun and Ning: ....</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Lu Hong took out a divine decree and, under the guise of a reminder but actually applying pressure, said: "I need to make it clear to you beforehand, old monster, that this is a divine decree personally made by the Ginseng Beard Dragon King. After you sign it, you must carry it out; otherwise, you will suffer divine punishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">"You and I have both experienced the Dragon King's might, haven't we?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Sun and Ning: ....</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying's expressions became increasingly dangerous, itching to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">After Lu Hong finished speaking, he quietly stared at the Old Monster in the Stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">The atmosphere in the cave gradually became heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">"Fine." Sun and Ning were forced to agree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">What else could they do?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">The situation was clear: if they didn't agree, they would fight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">Let's survive this crisis first and talk about other things later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">The two could only hold their noses and sign this contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">Seeing the Old Monster in the Stone behave like this, Lu Hong's expression relaxed: "On the day of action, we will meet at the top of Aramu Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Sun Lingtong snorted coldly and said in the tone of the Old Monster in the Stone: "No need; I will go to ambush the armies myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">Lu Hong nodded, left the Western Pure Land, and turned to leave with Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">The three cultivators' figures disappeared into the darkness of the cave, and Lu Hong's final instruction echoed: "Old Stone Monster, don't try any tricks of shirking responsibility; the constraints of the Dragon King's divine decree are far beyond your and my imagination!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
