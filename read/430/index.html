When Cave Master Moxin proposed recruiting the Old Stone Monster, Lu Tu immediately agreed.<br/>
<br/>
However, they did not expect that multiple attempts at recruitment would fail.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Tu, of course, also knew the sinister intentions of Cave Master Moxin and others, but he could not care; after all, before a great war, manpower was urgently needed.<br/>
<br/>
But he could not allow these people to play tricks. After much thought, he simply decided to take action personally, bringing along the two Nascent Soul cultivators Moxin and Xueying to put pressure on the Old Monster in the Stone, forcing him to come out!<br/>
<br/>
Deep within the cave.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes. Although exhausted, his eyes were full of joy.<br/>
<br/>
"Stone Forged Earth Treasure Divine Ability... sixty percent!"<br/>
<br/>
He was about to rest when he found that Sun Lingtong was missing.<br/>
<br/>
"Huh? Where did the boss go?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had specially left a flying message, like a bird, circling around Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took the message and immediately understood the cause and effect.<br/>
<br/>
"The boss has come up with something new again."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head helplessly and smiled bitterly. He immediately chiseled open the stone skin and saw the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat that had become a stone ship. The latter was struggling to survive, and the full text of the "Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing" shone brightly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo came to the stone ship and penetrated his divine sense. Sun Lingtong sensed it and immediately communicated with Ning Zhuo using divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, this is so fun."<br/>
<br/>
"Using this method, not only has my physical foundation greatly increased, but I can also learn about the past experiences of the Old Monster in the Stone."<br/>
<br/>
"As an Earth Spirit, it's really boring. But occasionally, many novel things happen."<br/>
<br/>
"You should try it too!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong enthusiastically invited Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo breathed a sigh of relief: "Boss, as long as you're okay."<br/>
<br/>
"I'll go to the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to rest first."<br/>
<br/>
"This is the Thousand Peaks Forest, after all, the enemy's territory. We'd better mine quickly to avoid accidents."<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Ning Zhuo finished speaking, a powerful fluctuation of energy occurred.<br/>
<br/>
The fluctuation quickly covered the entire mountain peak.<br/>
<br/>
On the periphery, an enormous formation was activated, forming a barrier that enveloped the entire sky-pillar giant tree!<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning: ?!!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong could no longer care about cultivation: "Not good, could this be a trap? Little Zhuo, let's run quickly."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo reacted even faster.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Sun Lingtong transmitted the thought with divine sense, he grabbed the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, taking the boat and Sun Lingtong, and plunged into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's stone skin was already several inches thick, struggling with his small arms and legs.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, who had now mastered sixty percent of the divine ability, took one look and saw through it. He transmitted with divine sense to Sun Lingtong: "Don't move, boss. I need to undo this stone skin for you. Wait a moment; let's leave here first!"<br/>
<br/>
As a result, when Ning Zhuo arrived at the dragon head cabin, he discovered an extremely bad reality.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss, we can't run. This formation has suppressed space; the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon can't shuttle through. Forcibly using it would be like an egg hitting a stone wall," Ning Zhuo transmitted with divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
"?!!" Sun Lingtong was struck as if by a bolt from the blue.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll release you first." Ning Zhuo just reached out, preparing to remove Sun Lingtong's stone skin.<br/>
<br/>
The voice of Cave Master Mo Yuan echoed throughout the mountain peak: "Lu Hong of the Six Caves Sect, together with Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying, has come to pay respects."<br/>
<br/>
"Old Monster in the Stone, how about coming out to talk?"<br/>
<br/>
The sound waves were vast, penetrating all the way along the cave entrance, eventually reaching the deepest part of the cave.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon shook slightly in the sound waves.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the dragon head cabin, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong's hearts also jumped heavily.<br/>
<br/>
"Lu Hong? The Great Cave Master of the Six Caves Sect!"<br/>
<br/>
"And Moxin, Xueying... Why have they come?"<br/>
<br/>
"They want to contact the Old Monster in the Stone; with such a posture, they want to force him out!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning exchanged thoughts via divine sense and realized the seriousness of the situation almost instantly.<br/>
<br/>
Since the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon could not shuttle through space, the area they could maneuver in became extremely limited.<br/>
<br/>
Once the three Nascent Soul cultivators discovered that the Old Monster in the Stone was dead and that there were traces of mining, they would certainly not withdraw the formation but conduct a large-scale search.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, could the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon continue to hide and avoid their search?<br/>
<br/>
The possibility was too small!<br/>
<br/>
Because before, Sun Lingtong had tried. In the main hall of the Six Caves Sect's headquarters, they were discovered by Cave Master Moxin.<br/>
<br/>
And now, Cave Master Moxin was among them.<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, but the universally acknowledged stronger Mo Yuan Cave Master had also personally come!<br/>
<br/>
A desperate situation!<br/>
<br/>
Life's ups and downs came too fast, too suddenly.<br/>
<br/>
Just now, Sun and Ning were still elated, envisioning a bright future in a beautiful reality. The next moment, the situation took a sharp turn, and they fell into a desperate situation.<br/>
<br/>
The pressure of death came upon them.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face turned pale, feeling it difficult even to breathe: "How can we break this predicament?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong subconsciously struggled within the thick stone skin.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Sun Lingtong's movements froze, and his divine sense fluctuated violently: "Little Zhuo, I have an idea!"<br/>
<br/>
"Let's both drill into the stone sphere and let the stone skin wrap around us."<br/>
<br/>
"In this way, we can pretend to be the Old Stone Monster."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: "I thought about it. This is unreliable! Because Mo Yuan and others will certainly test the Old Monster in the Stone. We are not even familiar with his tone and manner of speech..."<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of this, Ning Zhuo paused.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly remembered his earlier exchange with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
By actively enduring the divine ability 'Stone Forged Earth Treasure' and using the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, Sun Lingtong entered a fetal breath state and learned many of the Old Monster in the Stone's memories.<br/>
<br/>
Voice tone and manner of speech would naturally not be a problem!<br/>
<br/>
Outside the cave.<br/>
<br/>
Mo Yuan, Moxin, and Xueying hovered in the sky, waiting for a moment, but did not see a response from the Old Monster in the Stone.<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, this old monster is so sullen; could he still be in a deep sleep?" Cave Master Xueying snorted coldly.<br/>
<br/>
"Impossible. We have blocked the void and suppressed earth movement. Although the Old Monster in the Stone is a Nascent Soul cultivator, he was born as an Earth Spirit, and the instinct to burrow underground has been ingrained in his bones for a long time. This time, with earth escape being forbidden, he must have reacted. He just doesn't dare to come out seeing that we have the Great Cave Master with us!" Cave Master Moxin flattered Mo Yuan.<br/>
<br/>
Mo Yuan's expression was indifferent: "Let's go, let's meet the Old Monster in the Stone together."<br/>
<br/>
Saying that, he took the lead in descending.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying exchanged glances and followed closely.<br/>
<br/>
This sky-pillar giant tree's cave was complex, with many secret passages, but it could not trouble Nascent Soul-level cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, they had previously sent cultivators to pay respects and had figured out the path.<br/>
<br/>
Although these cultivators were killed by Cave Master Moxin, the intelligence they brought back was not destroyed. Therefore, Mo Yuan and the others quickly arrived at the final cave hall behind the mountain wall.<br/>
<br/>
The huge cave entrance was pitch black, seeming to swallow even light.<br/>
<br/>
The previous group of Six Caves Sect cultivators had stopped here, set up a formation, and even sacrificed many companions.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout, they did not dare to enter the giant cave.<br/>
<br/>
Mo Yuan and the three others did not slow down, proceeding directly forward, passing through a passage, and saw the stone sphere at the bottom of the cave.<br/>
<br/>
When Mo Yuan and the other three were ten steps away from the stone sphere, they took the initiative to stop.<br/>
<br/>
"Old Monster in the Stone," Mo Yuan called softly.<br/>
<br/>
Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying kept their faces solemn, secretly on guard.<br/>
<br/>
Although they had strength in numbers, after all, this was the Old Monster in the Stone's territory, and he had the geographical advantage.<br/>
<br/>
The Old Stone Monster had been residing here for many years and might have developed some powerful trump cards here. In any case, being cautious was never wrong.<br/>
<br/>
They did not know that the Old Stone Monster had long since died, and hiding inside was a Mechanical dragon and Sun and Ning.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong and the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat were both taken out and tightly attached to the stone sphere.<br/>
<br/>
As for Ning Zhuo, he was gasping for breath, almost collapsing.<br/>
<br/>
Just now, he had raced against time, fully squeezing his essence, energy, and spirit, urging the 'Stone Forged Earth Treasure' divine ability in his sea of consciousness and dantian.<br/>
<br/>
Even though he had mastered over sixty percent of the divine ability and had the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon providing a vast amount of mana, Ning Zhuo had thrillingly managed to restore the stone sphere before the three cultivators arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Ning Zhuo would never have thought that he would actively help restore the stone sphere to its original state.<br/>
<br/>
But the life-and-death trial had just begun.<br/>
<br/>
The stone sphere temporarily bluffed the three Nascent Soul cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Cave Master Mo Yuan softly called "Old Monster in the Stone"; Sun and Ning had to respond.<br/>
<br/>
Not responding would be disrespecting Lu Hong, a high-level Nascent Soul cultivator!<br/>
<br/>
So, Sun Lingtong, according to the fragments of memory, made a hoarse and aged voice: "Lu Hong, did you finish the Thousand Peaks Earth Vein Map you promised to make for me?"<br/>
<br/>
Cave Master Mo Yuan's face immediately sank.<br/>
<br/>
This involved an old matter.<br/>
<br/>
Cave Master Mo Yuan was skilled in painting. In those years, seeking a breakthrough in his painting skills, he wanted to depict the Earth Vein Map of the Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
He took the initiative to find the Old Monster in the Stone, spent a lot of time, and paid a considerable price, finally persuading the Old Monster in the Stone to cooperate with him.<br/>
<br/>
The Old Monster in the Stone was himself an Earth Spirit; if he could grasp the Thousand Peaks Earth Vein Map, it would greatly benefit his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, the two joined forces, and just after completing thirty percent of the exploration, they were mercilessly suppressed by the Ginseng Beard Dragon King.<br/>
<br/>
The Ginseng Beard Dragon King was a Soul Formation level existence, the undisputed strongest in the Thousand Peaks Forest, possessing the most faith, with tens of thousands of dragon beards reaching deep underground, entangling numerous sky-pillar giant trees and intertwining roots.<br/>
<br/>
Although Mo Yuan and the Old Monster in the Stone joined forces, after all, they were only at the Nascent Soul level and were no match for the Ginseng Beard Dragon King.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, their attempt to explore the entire Earth Vein of the Thousand Peaks Forest also touched upon the interests of the Ginseng Beard Dragon King.<br/>
<br/>
Such a significant matter as the Earth Vein, naturally, one feelt safe only when controlling it oneself.<br/>
<br/>
There was no surprise that Mo Yuan and the Old Monster in the Stone suffered a heavy defeat.<br/>
<br/>
Their first cooperation ended in failure.<br/>
<br/>
The Old Monster in the Stone was seriously injured and held great resentment towards Cave Master Mo Yuan. Because beforehand, Lu Hong had promised that the possibility of success was great, had hyped it up for a long time, and had seriously neglected the existence of the Ginseng Beard Dragon King.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Sun Lingtong brought up this old matter proactively, with two purposes.<br/>
<br/>
The first purpose was naturally to show his identity, confirming that he was the Old Monster in the Stone. The second purpose was to preemptively block their invitation. Because once the Old Monster in the Stone had to act, he would no longer be in stone sphere form, and Sun and Ning would be exposed!<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hong snorted coldly: "Old monster, you still have the face to bring up what happened back then?"<br/>
<br/>
"If you hadn't withdrawn in advance, if we had fought side by side, we could have at least cut off a hundred of the Dragon King's ginseng beards."<br/>
<br/>
"As a result, you deserted in the face of battle, causing me to fight alone. After cutting off more than thirty ginseng beards, I could only admit defeat and surrender."<br/>
<br/>
"You were indeed seriously injured, but wasn't I also?"<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, since then, our Six Caves Sect has had to set up a Dragon King Temple, offering incense to the Ginseng Beard Dragon King from then on!"<br/>
<br/>
"It was precisely because we paid a huge price that we calmed the Dragon King's anger. From this perspective, you owe me a favor."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong immediately retorted: "Hmph, if it weren't for your instigation back then, I was doing fine alone; how could I have been injured?"<br/>
<br/>
"This time, no matter what you say, I won't go out."<br/>
<br/>
"The armies of the Two Note Kingdom are coming to attack; let them come. At worst, I'll just leave the Thousand Peaks Forest!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's heart was pounding.<br/>
<br/>
Even though he was wrapped in stone skin, it was hard to stay calm.<br/>
<br/>
However, this speech was not improvised but suggested by Ning Zhuo. In Sun Lingtong's view, these words were too risky, as if provoking the three Nascent Soul cultivators to take action!<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hong's expression sank further.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's words hit upon the deepest worry in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
If the Old Monster in the Stone threatened to surrender, he could handle it. At least, if they took action, they would occupy the moral high ground among the natives of the Thousand Peaks Forest!<br/>
<br/>
But if the Old Monster in the Stone wanted to leave, he couldn't stop him.<br/>
<br/>
If he took action, it would be too overbearing and would arouse resentment and suspicion among the various forces and individuals.<br/>
<br/>
And these were things Lu Hong very much did not want to see.<br/>
<br/>
So, Lu Hong smiled lightly and took out a piece of soil from his bosom, displaying it in front of everyone.<br/>
<br/>
It was a piece of white soil, presenting a bright white color, pure and flawless. It had no earthy smell at all but emitted a faint fragrance, like a breeze brushing one's face, similar to the sandalwood incense of temples.<br/>
<br/>
An Earth Attribute Merit Supreme Treasure, and also one of the Buddhist supreme treasures: the Western Pure Land!<br/>
<br/>
There was a poem that said:<br/>
<br/>
<div style=" padding: 8px; font-style: italic;">"White earth shines, illuminating the soul,<br/>
<br/>
All thoughts are purified, Buddha Dharma arises.<br/>
<br/>
Western Bliss, immaculate earth,<br/>
<br/>
Washes away dust and troubles, returning to the pure realm."</div><br/>
<br/>
Wherever this soil exists, it is a place beyond the mundane, capable of cleansing dust, purifying pollution, eliminating karmic hindrances, and offsetting the erosion of evil spirits, transforming everything it touches into purity and harmony.<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, for cultivators, it can purify the soul, eliminate worries and obsessions, and guide practitioners into the sacred realm of the Western Pure Land.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as this soil appeared, Buddhist fragrance lingered.<br/>
<br/>
Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying immediately took a step back, revealing looks of disgust and apprehension.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning: ?!<br/>
<br/>
They never expected that Cave Master Lu Hong came prepared. Coercion and inducement were his means. Secretly setting up a formation was his coercion, and taking out the Western Pure Land was his inducement.<br/>
<br/>
"Old Monster in the Stone, haven't you always wanted to seek the Western Pure Land?" Lu Hong smiled, "Now, it's right in front of you."<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning urgently discussed.<br/>
<br/>
"Old Monster in the Stone" was silent for a moment before speaking: "Leave the Pure Land, and when the armies arrive here, I will take action."<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hong laughed: "Such a precious treasure as the Western Pure Land, how could I let you obtain it so easily?"<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, this place of yours isn't any important location; the armies might not even attack here."<br/>
<br/>
"Don't say such opportunistic words; otherwise, you'll be looked down upon by us."<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of this, Lu Hong paused and revealed an astonishing plan: "The vanguard of the Two Note Kingdom has already stationed below the Thousand Peaks Forest."<br/>
<br/>
"The commander Du Tiechuan is also commanding the central army, located at Muwheel Town."<br/>
<br/>
"Both places are heavily defended; we will not attack them."<br/>
<br/>
"City of Green Forest is the rear base for this war, continuously training and reorganizing new troops."<br/>
<br/>
"We have learned that one of the forbidden armies, the Golden Halberd Army, has arrived at Celestial City of Green Forest. They are about to set off to Muwheel Town to join the central army."<br/>
<br/>
"Therefore, we have decided to gather more than half of the Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators in the Thousand Peaks Forest to ambush them on their marching route!"<br/>
<br/>
"If you want the Western Pure Land, sign this contract, and we'll act together then."<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning: ....<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hong took out a divine decree and, under the guise of a reminder but actually applying pressure, said: "I need to make it clear to you beforehand, old monster, that this is a divine decree personally made by the Ginseng Beard Dragon King. After you sign it, you must carry it out; otherwise, you will suffer divine punishment."<br/>
<br/>
"You and I have both experienced the Dragon King's might, haven't we?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning: ....<br/>
<br/>
Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying's expressions became increasingly dangerous, itching to move.<br/>
<br/>
After Lu Hong finished speaking, he quietly stared at the Old Monster in the Stone.<br/>
<br/>
The atmosphere in the cave gradually became heavy.<br/>
<br/>
"Fine." Sun and Ning were forced to agree.<br/>
<br/>
What else could they do?<br/>
<br/>
The situation was clear: if they didn't agree, they would fight!<br/>
<br/>
Let's survive this crisis first and talk about other things later.<br/>
<br/>
The two could only hold their noses and sign this contract.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the Old Monster in the Stone behave like this, Lu Hong's expression relaxed: "On the day of action, we will meet at the top of Aramu Peak."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong snorted coldly and said in the tone of the Old Monster in the Stone: "No need; I will go to ambush the armies myself."<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hong nodded, left the Western Pure Land, and turned to leave with Cave Masters Moxin and Xueying.<br/>
<br/>
The three cultivators' figures disappeared into the darkness of the cave, and Lu Hong's final instruction echoed: "Old Stone Monster, don't try any tricks of shirking responsibility; the constraints of the Dragon King's divine decree are far beyond your and my imagination!"</div></body></html></div>
