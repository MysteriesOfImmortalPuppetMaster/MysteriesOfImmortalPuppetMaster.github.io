<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The ghost tide surged once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Countless spirits encircled the entire perimeter of White Paper Immortal City, sealing it tight and launching a frenzied assault on its walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Big-Headed Ghosts stirred up sinister winds, while Little-Headed Ghosts rode those winds upward, giggling as they drifted toward the battlements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">At the heart of the ghost tide, heavily guarded, lay the enormous Ghost Mother. She sprawled on the ground, endlessly birthing more Big-Headed and Little-Headed Ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Lantern Ghosts spewed ghostly fire, Noose Ghosts climbed the walls like spiders, and Drowned Ghosts moved in coordinated swarms, channeling ghost techniques to summon the waters of the Forgetful River. Those waters washed away layer after layer of the city’s pale wallpaper defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Tie Guezheng sat in command with a grim expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">His experience in defense was formidable, and he directed the troops with unshakable calm. With him as the central pillar, the City Guard held fast to the battlements, refusing to yield even a single step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Human cultivators and ghostmen alike manned sections of the wall, supporting the City Guard as auxiliary forces and doing their part to hold the line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Suddenly, a Ghost Yaksha soared onto the battlements and slew two ghostman defenders, securing a foothold on the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">It had to be eliminated quickly. The longer it held its position, the more ghosts would rally to it, creating a forward stronghold. If that happened, this section of the wall would inevitably fall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Get down from there!” a ghostman cultivator shouted, charging the Ghost Yaksha with all his strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But after just two clashes, the ghostman cultivator’s head was lopped off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">More ghostman reinforcements rushed forward, hoping to drive it off. Some were wounded, others killed. None succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“It’s at the Golden Core level! Only a Golden Core can take it down!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“Report this! Have headquarters send someone, or we’ll lose this position!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Hurry!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">A ghostman cultivator shouted the alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In the short time it took to speak, five or six more ghost creatures had already climbed onto the wall, forming up around the Ghost Yaksha.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This trend was disastrous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The more ghosts established themselves on the battlements, the harder it would be to reclaim the position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“No need to call for help. I’ll handle it.” At that critical moment, a young ghostman girl leapt into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">It was Qing Chi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Take this!” she shouted, swinging her fist and launching a burst of flame through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">At first, the green-blue fire merely wrapped around her fist. But once released, it rapidly expanded - first to the size of a washbasin, then to the size of a millstone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Ghost Yaksha swung its ghostly weapon, scattering the green flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Qing Chi’s pupils narrowed slightly. She took a deep breath and exhaled a stream of azure fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The flame roared forth, sounding like a wind-tunnel in reverse. It took the shape of an inverted cone and engulfed the Ghost Yaksha.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The creature withstood it for only three breaths before its defenses crumbled. With a shrill, miserable scream, its entire body melted in the blaze and quickly disintegrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The azure flame surged forward like floodwaters bursting through a dam, devouring everything around it and cascading down the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">All ghost creatures in its path were incinerated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The cultivators on the battlements were stunned for a moment, then erupted in cheers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">At a crucial moment, Qing Chi had turned the tide. With only Foundation Establishment cultivation, she had slain a Golden Core-level ghost, greatly boosting morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Many members of the City Guard, having witnessed the scene, began asking around - who was this girl who’d distinguished herself so brilliantly?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">That single feat in battle made Qing Chi’s name resound across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Yet Qing Chi’s expression shifted slightly. Within her, she felt the “military spirit” undergo a fundamental transformation - becoming whole and complete at last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">She had been slowly condensing her military spirit over time. But this battle, and her dazzling victory, won her immense morale and loyalty, pushing her decisively past the final threshold and into breakthrough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The military spirit pulsed like a living organ, glowing with a rich cyan light. Upon closer inspection, one would see that it was composed of hundreds of individual points of light, each one representing a fragment of morale gathered from the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Some of these points glowed brightly, others dimly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The military spirit beat steadily. If one listened closely, one could hear the clang of armor, the whistle of blades piercing flesh, the roar of warriors, the pounding of war drums, the clash of battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">A wave of elation rose in Qing Chi’s chest. She nearly threw her arms wide and cheered aloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">But then she remembered Ning Zhuo’s advice - and forced herself to hold back the impulse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Qing Chi fought on a little longer, but her spiritual power and stamina were nearly spent. Only then did she retreat from the battlements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The ghost tide still battered White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Each new wave was larger and more relentless than the last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Father! I’ve formed my military spirit!” Qing Chi sent a jubilant message to Qing Yan through their soul-link.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Truly?” Qing Yan’s eyebrows rose in surprise, but he quickly steadied himself. “Chi’er, you did it! For someone with Trash Dragon aptitude, that’s no small feat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Qing Chi replied, “Senior Li’s talent was definitely a key factor, but the reason I was able to form my military spirit so quickly is all thanks to Jiao Ma.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Father, don’t forget - it was he who gave me Burden-Bearing Tactics. That battle manual is incredibly rare, and he gave it to me for free.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Qing Yan: ……</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Qing Chi giggled, ignoring her father’s expression. “Right now I just want to go tell Jiao Ma!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Qing Yan quickly held out a hand to stop her. “Don’t be hasty. Rest first, then go. Remember - we still haven’t found the traitor hiding inside the city.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Qing Chi knew better than to act rashly. After a short rest to recover most of her spiritual energy and stamina, she hurried toward the South Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">These past few days, Ning Zhuo had been cultivating within the giant paper statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Once inside, Qing Chi activated her mind and summoned her military spirit, showing it off for Ning Zhuo to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo’s eyes widened in astonishment. “So this is the military spirit? Truly mysterious.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He stepped forward, eager to examine it further - but Qing Chi withdrew it with a thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">She stepped closer, her gaze intent. “Little Ma, if you want to study the military spirit, I can let you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“But we’re still outside - too many people around. Weren’t you the one who reminded me to keep a low profile and hide my strength for now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“I’ve done exactly as you said. I haven’t told a soul. Right now, the only ones who know about this are you, me, and my father.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“So… why don’t you come with me into the secluded cultivation chamber, and we can study the military spirit there, just the two of us?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Her eyes burned as she stared at Ning Zhuo, her mischievous intent plain as day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo was speechless, though inwardly amused by how forthright she was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After a moment’s thought, he said, “The greatest contributor to your breakthrough was none other than Senior Li Xiangshang.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“I’ll take the lead and host a banquet for you both - to celebrate your achievement.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Seeing that she couldn’t trick Ning Zhuo into being alone with her, Qing Chi pouted in frustration. “Hmph. Fine. I’ll thank Senior Li properly myself. But first, I want to thank you. Without Burden-Bearing Tactics, I wouldn’t have formed my military spirit so quickly!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">This exchange had Sun Lingtong laughing so hard on the ox’s back that he nearly fell off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Keeping a constant link through Life Hanging by a Thread, he could follow Ning Zhuo’s every move and was clearly enjoying the spectacle. He egged Ning Zhuo on gleefully, “Little Zhuo, just say yes already! Let’s see how she plans to thank you! Heeheehee!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo responded via divine sense, sternly rejecting the idea. “I am not Jiao Ma. Why would I deceive an innocent girl? If Qing Chi learned the truth, she’d be heartbroken. I’m not the kind of man who takes advantage of others when they’re vulnerable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Unable to change Ning Zhuo’s mind, Qing Chi had no choice but to settle for second best - she agreed to attend the banquet he offered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Oddly enough, Li Xiangshang, the one who’d contributed most to Qing Chi’s breakthrough, was the last to hear the news about her military spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But he wasn’t upset in the least. In fact, he was visibly delighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">At the banquet table, he continued to speak up on Qing Chi’s behalf, even trying to persuade Ning Zhuo to return to her side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo refused. “I became the prince consort because it was needed by the Jiao Clan. Everything I’ve achieved in cultivation is thanks to their support. I can’t abandon duty for the sake of personal feelings.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Qing Chi didn’t want to hear that and immediately pushed back. “Xiao Ma, then why did you give me Burden-Bearing Tactics?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo looked her in the eye, calm and unwavering. “I gave it to you not out of sentiment, but for the greater good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“With Senior Li’s help, you had the best chance of forming a military spirit. I did it for the sake of White Paper Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Hearing this, Qing Chi felt a stab of pain. She stood abruptly, stepping toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“Xiao Ma, why are you treating me like a stranger?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“Have you forgotten our promise?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“By the riverside, under the rare moonlight, we vowed to stay together for a lifetime!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Have you already thrown all that away?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo’s scalp tingled. His expression turned icy, and he waved a hand sharply. “Qing Chi, if you keep pressing me like this, I’ll walk away right now. And from then on, we’ll never meet again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Qing Chi was stunned by the coldness in his face. She froze, clenched her fists, and stood there in silence. Her eyes welled with tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Meanwhile, in the underworld, Sun Lingtong was laughing so hard atop his ox that he nearly toppled off again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Li Xiangshang quickly stepped in to smooth things over, gently coaxing Qing Chi back into her seat and easing the tension in the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo then turned to more serious matters. “Senior Li, now that Qing Chi has formed her military spirit, what comes next?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Li Xiangshang looked to Qing Chi. “Now that the military spirit is formed, the next step is to assess military intelligence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“With the military spirit in hand, Miss Qing Chi can now listen to the thoughts of her forces and gain a clearer understanding of their condition.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“This ability to perceive will improve rapidly with practice.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“When her grasp of the army’s state reaches a certain level, an answer will naturally arise from within - she’ll know how to shape and form her unique troop type.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo asked with concern, “How long will that take?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Li Xiangshang replied, “That depends on the individual. Some achieve it in moments. Others may take a year or more. It comes down to the size of the force, the complexity of its composition, the commander’s ability, and so on.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He looked at Qing Chi again. “In your case, I estimate it won’t take long.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“First, the Qing Clan ghostman troops are quite simple in structure, and their numbers are small - only two to three hundred.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“Second, they have full faith in you. The will of the troops is aligned with yours. That makes all the difference.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He added with a sigh, “It’s a rare and fortunate situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“Miss Qing Chi, you should thank your father. He willingly gave up his own authority to give you this opportunity.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“By all rights, he should have been the one to serve as general.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“I never truly understood the depth of a parent’s love until now,” said Li Xiangshang quietly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“When I first gained sentience, my parents were long gone. And for a carp like me, the concept of ‘parents’ doesn't carry the same meaning to begin with.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Everything I’ve achieved since beginning cultivation has been thanks to Lord Dragon Sovereign’s support.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo couldn’t help but feel a ripple in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Li Xiangshang’s reflection on his parents stirred something deep within him. In a way, Ning Zhuo could relate - his father had died before he was born, and his mother passed when he was just over two years old. He understood the loneliness behind those words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">In fact, Ning Zhuo even felt a hint of sympathy for Li Xiangshang. “Compared to him, maybe I’ve had it a little easier after all,” he thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“There’s always someone worse off in this world.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“My greatest fortune has been Big Brother’s guidance. And now, even with Mother gone, there’s still a sliver of hope she might be brought back someday.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Not wanting to see Li Xiangshang lost in melancholy, Ning Zhuo offered him sincere encouragement. “You’ve cultivated alone all this time. Even with some help along the way, climbing from the depths of the Weakwater to its surface took sheer grit and willpower. That kind of perseverance is truly admirable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Heaven may be cold, but it’s fair. It takes some things away, yet it grants others in return.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Perhaps if you’d had a complete family, you wouldn’t be where you are today.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Li Xiangshang looked at him with quiet gratitude. “Jiao Clan boy, I like what you said.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“But you give me too much credit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“The only reason I was able to rise from the Weakwater was that... it wasn’t entirely pure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“Every so often, the deep pool would be replenished with living water, diluting the Weakwater.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“I managed to rise by seizing those rare moments when fresh water flowed in.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Qing Chi had never heard this before and immediately asked, “Why add living water at all?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Li Xiangshang explained, “It’s simple. Water flows downward. To maintain the purity of Weakwater over time requires immense resources. Without proper measures, it will gradually self-dilute until it’s nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“To keep it stable and cost-effective, cultivators proactively introduce living water, letting the mix resemble the surrounding waters so it reaches a natural equilibrium.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">“If it had been pure Weakwater all along, I would have remained just a carp, struggling forever beneath the surface. There’s no way I could’ve broken through.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He shook his head and added quietly, “There wouldn’t have been even the slightest chance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">When the banquet ended, Ning Zhuo took the initiative to speak to Qing Chi. “Now that you’ve formed your military spirit, there’s no need for you to keep coming to the South Gate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“Your focus should be on mastering military intelligence and discovering the path of your troop type.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Of course Qing Chi didn’t want to part ways, but Li Xiangshang pulled her aside and advised her in private. “Miss Qing Chi, Jiao Ma has his reasons. If you keep pushing him now, it won’t end well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">“Look at it this way - if you can take charge of White Paper Immortal City’s only army, your status will rise naturally. When that time comes, asking the City Lord for a prince consort will be a simple matter.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Qing Chi’s heart raced. “That’s a brilliant idea!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">“I’ll grow stronger. I’ll lead my troops. I’ll win Jiao Ma back!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The ghostman girl clenched her fists, eyes full of resolve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Her motivation now fully ignited, she threw herself into the task of mastering military intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Just as Li Xiangshang predicted, it took only a day and a half for her to complete the process. She gained insight into three potential troop types.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The first: Paper Money Spirit Envoys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The second: Yin Sigil Bane Wardens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The third: Ghost Wail Gatebreakers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Faced with these options, Qing Chi found herself at a loss. She didn’t know which to choose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo, who had been keeping an eye on her all along, was surprised to learn of this. “Back then, the Three General Battalion was freshly established. There wasn’t even a choice of troop types - it all came together easily.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">So then... which one should she choose?</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
