<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The mechanical puppets stood quietly, arranged neatly and uniformly.<br/>
<br/>
They were mostly wooden, with simple metal armor plating covering their chests, legs, and feet.<br/>
<br/>
In their hands, most carried long spears, but some held swords and shields.<br/>
<br/>
"Six hundred mechanical puppets! The mechanical puppets controlled by the strategist have increased quite a bit compared to before," Zhang Hei’s divine sense swept over them; upon discovering the increased number of soldier puppets, he immediately transmitted a telepathic message, his tone carrying congratulatory intent.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers of the Three Generals Camp also turned their gaze toward these mechanical puppets, their expressions filled with astonishment.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong stroked his beard and communicated through divine sense, "According to the strategist’s wealth, he could very well manufacture these mechanical puppets to be even more exquisite. It appears that the strategist intends to use the Warrior’s Return Technique."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, "General Guan, your martial eye is without error."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, of course, could use metal as the primary material to manufacture mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
However, firstly, the production time would be longer and the cost higher; secondly, in actual combat they would not be easily damaged, which would impede the effectiveness of the Warrior’s Return Technique; thirdly, the wood was sourced from Thousand Peaks Forest and Green Forest Immortal City, which were local specialties and relatively inexpensive, while metal was more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Before departing, Liu Er walked to Ning Zhuo’s side, grabbed his hands, and with concern admonished, "The strategist going out alone is because of our own incompetence!"<br/>
<br/>
"Remember, your own life is the most important."<br/>
<br/>
"If you encounter Luo Chen, the strategist can immediately withdraw, lure the enemy to our army, and then engage in combat!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo grunted in acknowledgment and said to Liu Er, "General, you need not blame yourself. Without you, how would I, relying only on myself, have reached this day?"<br/>
<br/>
"It is precisely because the three generals paved the way that I have the opportunity to use my talents today."<br/>
<br/>
"This was the moment for me to launch an attack. If I could break the Great Bell in one strike, it would break the current deadlock and usher in final victory."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if it was risky, it was worth a try!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo bid farewell to Liu Er, mounted a Foundation Establishment–level horse, led the mechanical army, broke away from the Three Generals Camp, and hurried along the direction from which the bell sound came.<br/>
Raging flames soon obscured the figures of Ning Zhuo and his mechanical army.<br/>
<br/>
"Strategist... it is because we at the Golden Core Level are incapable that when the situation becomes critical, Foundation Establishment cultivators must step forward," Liu Er lamented. At this point, we could only rely on Ning Zhuo’s performance.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei clutched his wrist and said, "If there is any blame, blame these soldiers for being too poor. If we could have obtained two hundred elite soldiers, I, leading the army alone, could also directly attack the Yellow Dragon!"<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong stroked his beard and said, "Though the strategist is only at the Foundation Establishment stage, if we consider combat power alone, he far exceeds any one of the three of us. Launching an attack at this moment, he is the most appropriate choice, exactly in line with military strategy."<br/>
<br/>
The three generals gritted their teeth and, for the time being, could only hold this position, waiting for Ning Zhuo to return.<br/>
<br/>
And watching Ning Zhuo, however, were not only the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang, but also Luo Chen and others from the opposing side.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, there was another cultivator, moving stealthily at the side, closely monitoring the progress of this offensive and defensive battle.<br/>
<br/>
This person had the surname Gao and the given name Cuo. In his early years, he had an extraordinary encounter and once served at Bikun Mountain. The evil god’s bone marrow he had secretly discovered was, through a twist of fate, obtained by Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
"Good, although the main force of the Three Generals Camp is inadequate, Ning Zhuo can strike."<br/>
<br/>
"If he managed to break the Great Bell by taking advantage of the situation, he would be able to change the battle’s situation and tip the scales of victory in favor of the Three Generals Camp."<br/>
<br/>
"If he performed even better, managed to locate the place where the Vermilion Bird Incense Furnace was, and destroyed this grand array, that would be even better."<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo, estimating the situation, furrowed his brows, "I only fear that Luo Chen might take the initiative to strike, intercepting Ning Zhuo midway, causing his mission to be aborted."<br/>
<br/>
An old voice rang in his heart, "There is also a method to consider."<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo asked, "Old Sword, what method are you thinking of?"<br/>
<br/>
Old Sword continued, "We infiltrated here precisely for the Wood Fire. This fire is one of the Samadhi; even if in the future you cannot gather the entire set of Samadhi, this one alone will be enough for you to use until the Nascent Soul stage."<br/>
<br/>
"Luo Chen must also be searching for this!"<br/>
<br/>
"At present, the situation was very clear: the Ten Li Burning Forest, which was close to the main battlefield, would inevitably be swept away by the two major national armies."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if this time the Three Generals Camp’s attack failed, subsequent punitive troops would undoubtedly be sent continuously."<br/>
<br/>
"The Ten Li Burning Forest could not possibly be held; Luo Chen, with responsibilities on his shoulders, intended to retreat with dignity. The Fire-Crowned Divine Fir and the like, he could not take with him. Only the Wood Fire served as his best excuse."<br/>
<br/>
"Look, ever since the Three Generals Camp launched their attack, he had never made a move. He was definitely fully focused on searching for the Wood Fire."<br/>
<br/>
A flash of inspiration lit up Gao Cuo’s mind, "I understand. Old Sword, you want me to forge a Wood Fire, to lure Luo Chen, so that he sees the prospect of obtaining it, and thereby indirectly keep him tied down?"<br/>
<br/>
Old Sword smiled with satisfaction, "The lad is teachable. The Li Xing Cuoying Book you cultivated is just right for forging such things. Hmm?"<br/>
<br/>
Old Sword suddenly halted.<br/>
<br/>
"What's wrong?" Gao Cuo immediately asked.<br/>
<br/>
Old Sword said, "Another outsider has descended to this place, with cultivation at least at the Nascent Soul level."<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo said, "Long nights breed many dreams! If this battle continues, it will surely attract more cultivators. If the Three Generals Camp fails to win with one strike, and the battle prolongs, our interference will only increase."<br/>
<br/>
Above the Ten Li Burning Forest,<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan concealed himself in the clouds, overlooking the forest that burned with raging flames.<br/>
<br/>
"I possess the One-Leaf Obscuring Technique; I doubt that Luo Chen can discover me."<br/>
<br/>
"Hmm, has the main force of the Three Generals Camp been pushed here?"<br/>
<br/>
"Strange, where is Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
At the center of the Ten Li Burning Forest stood the Fire-Crowned Divine Fir.<br/>
<br/>
Under the fir tree sat a cultivator in a meditative posture, and it was none other than Luo Chen.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Chen closed his eyes to nurture his spirit; his eyelids twitched, parting slightly to reveal a glimmer of brilliance.<br/>
<br/>
"From the clouds, a strange Nascent Soul cultivator has arrived..."<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, as is fitting."<br/>
<br/>
"As the battle prolongs, those who catch the scent will come in greater numbers."<br/>
<br/>
"The more spectators there are, the harder it will be for me to retreat on my own accord."<br/>
<br/>
"Enough. First, eliminate this detached mechanical army! At the very least, it would yield a measure of battle merit."<br/>
<br/>
"The most important thing remains the Wood Fire."<br/>
<br/>
"Without it, how could I retreat with honor? Hm?!"<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he suddenly widened his eyes, his face filled with astonishment, "Found it! Truly, Heaven is assisting me!!"<br/>
<br/>
How to hide a leaf? It’s very simple: hide the leaf on some branch in the forest.<br/>
<br/>
How to hide a spark? It’s very simple: just merge it into the all-encompassing sea of fire.<br/>
<br/>
Since the end of the first great battle, after the Three-Needle Dragon King had been slightly defeated and fled, and the two main national forces had directly set up camp there, Luo Chen had already begun, with the help of the Fire-Crowned Divine Fir, to continuously infuse his divine sense and search for the Wood Fire.<br/>
<br/>
However, the boundless sea of fire was too vast. Luo Chen’s divine sense could not cover the entire Burning Forest, and he could only search continuously.<br/>
<br/>
He exerted great effort, but he could not find even the slightest trace of the Wood Fire.<br/>
<br/>
Now that he suddenly sensed the aura of the Wood Fire, he was thrilled and immediately abandoned the matter of destroying Ning Zhuo’s army.<br/>
<br/>
Even if he struck, it would only be a minor accomplishment, causing no significant harm.<br/>
<br/>
Only by obtaining the Wood Fire and bringing it back to the alliance could he ensure a retreat that was meritorious and without fault. That was the overall strategy!<br/>
<br/>
Which one was more important had long been clearly measured in Luo Chen’s mind.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, naturally unaware of what was happening behind him, had marched the entire way with caution and had not encountered any interception by Luo Chen.<br/>
<br/>
He consulted with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Both of them felt that the situation was peculiar and required heightened vigilance.<br/>
<br/>
So much so that, when they reached the Great Bell, they could hardly believe it.<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin’s face was as solemn as water.<br/>
<br/>
He had bitterness in his heart, but could not express it.<br/>
<br/>
After all, Luo Chen’s ability to find the Wood Fire was a matter concerning their smooth retreat.<br/>
<br/>
In this situation, having Yan Jin and Immortal Liu Yan coordinate to resist the mechanical army was also the decision that best served their interests.<br/>
<br/>
Immortal Liu Yan exerted her power, and through the great array, created a curtain of flame that enveloped Ning Zhuo’s army.<br/>
<br/>
Heavenly Art Forging Sound Score!<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin waved his palms and fiercely pounded the treasure-level Great Bell.<br/>
<br/>
"Clang—!"<br/>
<br/>
The bell’s sound resonated, quickly covering the entire mechanical army. The bodies of the mechanical puppets, from inside out, developed many cracks.<br/>
<br/>
And the simple armor on them, being even worse than the wooden bodies, crumbled and split apart.<br/>
<br/>
First Strike: Tremor Ore Tune!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes brightened, "It really is the Heavenly Art Forging Sound Score!"<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin formed a fist with his left hand and swung his right hand, slapping the Great Bell.<br/>
<br/>
The bell rang dong dong, clang clang, forming a series of hurried melodies.<br/>
<br/>
The fragments of the armor on the mechanical puppets, within the bell’s sound, disintegrated again, refined into countless tiny particles.<br/>
<br/>
Their wooden bodies likewise shrank, and some of the mechanical puppets collapsed directly to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Second Strike: Chime of Gathered Gold!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo exclaimed in a clear voice with admiration, "I had once read about the introduction of this technique in the classics, and had always wanted to witness it. I never expected to personally experience the wonder of this technique in such a way."<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin coldly snorted and telepathically transmitted, "A mere Foundation Establishment, yet you still offer judgments on Yan’s abilities!"<br/>
<br/>
He switched his combination of fists and palms; this time, he used his left hand as a palm and his right hand as a fist.<br/>
<br/>
Third Tremor: Molding Form Rhythm!<br/>
<br/>
This time, the bell’s sound was alternately robust and high-pitched, shifting tones with great rapidity.<br/>
<br/>
Countless mechanical puppets, under Yan Jin’s intent and divine sense, were refined on the spot into various forms. Some were compressed into spheres, some were forged into wooden rods, and some were directly shattered into pieces...<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin telepathically transmitted, "Young man, your army has already been reduced by more than half."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo clapped his hands, his voice resonating throughout the battlefield, "Wonderful, Senior Yan’s refining prowess exceeds that of ten of me put together."<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin’s eyelids twitched, and he immediately transmitted telepathically to retort, "Kid, even if twenty of you came together, it would only be a death sentence!"<br/>
<br/>
The bell rang again.<br/>
<br/>
This time, Yan Jin spread both his hands; both palms pounded on the bronze bell, producing a long-lasting chime.<br/>
<br/>
Aftertone: Quenched Fire Chant!<br/>
<br/>
"Ka ka ka……"<br/>
<br/>
"Beng beng beng……"<br/>
<br/>
A large number of mechanical puppets, having experienced the previous three bell chimes, had already become deformed; at this moment, they finally could no longer hold together, completely disintegrating into countless fragments and pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Before setting out, Ning Zhuo had exactly six hundred mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the number of puppets standing by his side was less than a hundred, which was rather desolate.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo saluted Yan Jin with one hand, smiling, his eyes filled with eager anticipation, "Senior Yan, your prowess and technique are excellent. My mechanical puppets are nothing extraordinary; from now on, let me personally have a go!"<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin was surprised and telepathically transmitted, "Wait, you..."<br/>
<br/>
Before he could finish speaking, he saw Ning Zhuo utter a light shout and then spring up from the ground, leaping into the air.<br/>
<br/>
He clapped his palms and released a torrent.<br/>
<br/>
The water surged massively, like a flood after opening the sluice, directly smashing the curtain of fire, and then gushing forward, sweeping toward the Great Bell and Yan Jin.<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin quickly stomped his right foot, triggering the defensive formation on the bell’s pedestal.<br/>
<br/>
The formation activated, forming a spherical light shield that enveloped Yan Jin and the Great Bell.<br/>
<br/>
In the sky, suddenly flames in the shape of a Vermilion Bird appeared, plunging violently into the water, triggering a roaring explosion.<br/>
<br/>
Sixty percent of the water was instantly evaporated, transforming into an expanse of steam in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Then, within a few breaths, the steam was quickly dispelled by the surrounding high temperatures.<br/>
<br/>
This was Immortal Liu Yan coming to the rescue!<br/>
<br/>
The enemy Ning Zhuo faced was not solely Yan Jin; there was also the Flame-Flow Immortal controlling the array.<br/>
<br/>
"Again!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, undeterred, his fighting spirit soaring even higher.<br/>
<br/>
He took a deep breath, with both hands performing finger seals; after a few breaths, he suddenly raised both palms.<br/>
<br/>
The ground rapidly swelled, transforming into earthen mounds.<br/>
<br/>
The mounds coalesced, forming two earthen giants, one on the left and one on the right, treading on the significantly lowered water level, attacking the Great Bell.<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin waved his fists and palms, invoking the bell’s sound, and fiercely attacked the two giants.<br/>
<br/>
The giants moved slowly, but with great strides; braving the bell’s sound, they charged toward the light shield, swinging their fists and continuously striking.<br/>
<br/>
Boom, boom, boom.<br/>
<br/>
Every blow was powerful and heavy, causing deep cracks in the light shield.<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin exerted all his strength; the Great Bell swung left and right, generating surging sound waves, matching attack for attack.<br/>
<br/>
The two giants, refined by the bell’s sound, lost their arms, their fists turned into soft mud, and their entire bodies suddenly shrank to half their height, as they were cut in half at the waist.<br/>
<br/>
In the sky, the Vermilion Bird–shaped flames reformed, swooping towards Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, handling two tasks at once, formed finger seals with his left hand, while his right hand directly reached for the Vermilion Bird fire in the air.<br/>
<br/>
Accompanying his movements, a torrent miraculously reappeared from thin air.<br/>
<br/>
The torrent spiraled upward, taking form in the air, becoming a flood dragon.<br/>
<br/>
The flood dragon bared its wide mouth and precisely bit into the Vermilion Bird fire.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
With an explosion, the water dragon and the fire bird were destroyed together.<br/>
<br/>
On the other side, the finger seal sequence of Ning Zhuo’s left hand had been entirely completed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, with his fingers like swords, emitted a beam of golden light from his index and middle fingers.<br/>
<br/>
The golden light shone brilliantly, swift as a meteor, and as soon as Yan Jin saw it, it struck the light shield.<br/>
<br/>
The light shield held for only half a breath before being pierced.<br/>
<br/>
The golden light, undiminished in force, hit the Great Bell, shooting out a small hole in it.<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin’s face completely changed, and he telepathically questioned Ning Zhuo, "How can such power be possible? This does not match the intelligence! Have you been hiding your strength all along?!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, full of a sense of achievement, and, imitating Sun Lingtong by placing his hands on his hips, said, "You guessed correctly!"<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Yan, did you think that I came here alone merely to take a risky shot?"<br/>
<br/>
"Naturally, I was confident!"<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest with you, even if Luo Chen came, I would have the means to handle him."<br/>
<br/>
He blustered ostentatiously.<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin learned of Ning Zhuo’s information, but the combat strength the latter exhibited at that moment indeed far surpassed what the intelligence had indicated.<br/>
<br/>
It was not that Ning Zhuo had previously concealed his strength, but that he himself had advanced at a truly rapid pace during this period.<br/>
<br/>
All along, his Warrior’s Return Technique had been constrained by his physical foundation, making it difficult to fully empower.<br/>
<br/>
But by employing the demonic methods of the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, Ning Zhuo’s physical foundation skyrocketed, making him incomparable to his former self.<br/>
The destruction of over five hundred mechanical puppets not only propelled his combat strength to the Golden Core Level, but also far surpassed his previous peak, making him a top-tier figure at the Golden Core Stage!<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin’s mind began to stir uneasily along with the Great Bell.<br/>
<br/>
"Calm down!"<br/>
<br/>
"I still have Lord Luo Chen and Immortal Liu Yan to help me; I am not fighting alone."<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Immortal Liu Yan transmitted through the grand array, "Great Craftsman Yan, you must hold on. The Three Generals Camp has resumed its march, moving in my direction."<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals waited for a moment, and then noticed that the bell’s sound had diminished, and the flame curtain had slowed.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er acted decisively, leading his army forward, with the obstacles along the way being reduced by more than half compared to before.<br/>
<br/>
Immortal Liu Yan was preoccupied.<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin quickly inquired of Luo Chen, "Lord, have you made any progress in searching for the Wood Fire?"<br/>
<br/>
Luo Chen, with a gloomy expression, said, "That Wood Fire is extremely elusive, almost as if it had a spirit of its own; I have not yet obtained it. You hold on first!"<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin was speechless.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes shone brightly, with the flames and the Great Bell reflected in them.<br/>
<br/>
With his fighting spirit high, he said, "Boss, I feel I still have reserve strength; I have not reached my physical limit. I want to test the very limits."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong chuckled and said, "Little Zhuo, you go ahead and have fun; I’ll keep an eye on the surroundings for you. If Luo Chen comes, I’ll alert you."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then deployed three hundred mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then again controlled the puppets, forming a Light Body Swift Wind Formation.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical army moved as swiftly as the wind. Ning Zhuo soared above the army, and again performed finger seals; his left hand summoned the previously seen sword-finger golden light, while his right palm, aimed at the higher sky, condensed a gigantic meteor.<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Yan, take this!"<br/>
The young man’s might surged once again, his excited and impassioned voice echoing across the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin: "......"</div>
