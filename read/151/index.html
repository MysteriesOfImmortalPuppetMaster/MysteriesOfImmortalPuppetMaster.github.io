<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
After the injuries of the two geniuses from the Zhou family healed, they couldn't wait to form a three-family alliance team to jointly explore the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The three forces clearly hadn't gathered accurate information about the City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Before setting out, they were still fantasizing about gathering everyone's strength to deal with Yuan Dasheng if they encountered the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng again!<br/>
<br/>
As a result, the three-family alliance team launched a heavy assault, repeating the mistakes of the City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
More than twenty Qi Refining Stage cultivators were all devoured by souls, allowing Ning Zhuo to absorb to his heart's content!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo arrived at the third gate of the Buddhist Gate, repeatedly entering and exiting with an arrogant demeanor, which infuriated the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit to the point of pounding its fists on the throne.<br/>
<br/>
The Illusory True Lotus Seeds were his only option.<br/>
<br/>
The embryonic form of the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability surged once again.<br/>
<br/>
The lotus leaves, which were once the size of a palm, expanded fiercely, becoming as large as a basin, and were as green as jade.<br/>
<br/>
At Sun Lingtong's proactive request, Ning Zhuo also planted the Life-Hanging Thread in the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
This way, even if Sun Lingtong's soul returned to his body and he was no longer in the trials of the Lava Immortal Palace, he could still leave Cheng Bai behind for Ning Zhuo to control.<br/>
<br/>
"Cheng Bai's spirituality has diminished by eighteen percent," Ning Zhuo lamented.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest cost of the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai participating in battles and devouring others' souls was the loss of spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
Without reaching ten percent, spirituality couldn't be self-sustaining, which meant it couldn't recover.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo had tried multiple methods and still hadn't found a way to increase its spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
"Look on the bright side, brother!" In this regard, Sun Lingtong was more carefree.<br/>
<br/>
"I think this deal is worth it!"<br/>
<br/>
"Losing some spirituality ultimately allows you to absorb the Illusory True Lotus Seeds faster and more abundantly, enhancing the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability. This is a huge gain."<br/>
<br/>
"So, even if all the spirituality is consumed, it's still worth it."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed, knowing that Sun Lingtong made a good point.<br/>
<br/>
But he had always loved mechanical constructs and didn't want to see the "death" of the mechanical Cheng Bai from the bottom of his heart.<br/>
<br/>
In the following ten days, Ning Zhuo rarely obtained a period of peaceful cultivation time.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui still guarded the mountain top, sealing off the Zhou remnants, but couldn't stop Zhu Xuanji from leading the three Golden Core Stage cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji knew the importance of priorities.<br/>
<br/>
Since discovering the weakness of the Lava Immortal Palace, he had put the investigation aside.<br/>
<br/>
He frequently entered the Immortal Palace, investigating everywhere while increasing his own contributions.<br/>
<br/>
After the City Lord's Mansion recovered, they launched two assaults under Meng Chong's leadership.<br/>
<br/>
The three-family reformation team regrouped, but under the joint attack of the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng, they decisively abandoned the idea of collective action after a second comprehensive failure.<br/>
<br/>
According to their speculation, the Lava Immortal Palace had a mechanism to adjust the difficulty of the trials based on the challengers' specific strength.<br/>
<br/>
So, as long as they acted alone or in small groups of two or three, they wouldn't encounter the overly powerful mechanical constructs Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did as they expected, greatly reducing the appearances of Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, Cheng Bai's spirituality had dropped below ten percent after several rounds of large-scale soul devouring.<br/>
<br/>
Although Sun Lingtong didn't mind, Ning Zhuo decided to preserve the fire of spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng, it wasn't without battle damage.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Ning Zhuo's mechanical skills couldn't truly repair him, at most patching him up, and the overall combat power of the construct was actually in constant decline.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Ning Zhuo didn't want to completely crush the three-family alliance or the City Lord's Mansion, making them lose all hope.<br/>
<br/>
He needed to give these people some hope, motivating them to continue moving forward and increasing their resource support.<br/>
<br/>
The various cultivation resources provided by the three-family alliance had greatly helped Ning Zhuo's own cultivation progress.<br/>
<br/>
With the soul essence returned by Cheng Bai, Ning Zhuo's soul foundation had grown tremendously once again.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to before encountering Han Ming, it had increased by more than one hundred and fifty times!<br/>
<br/>
This allowed Ning Zhuo's soul power to stand out in the Qi Refining Stage, enabling him to use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal more frequently and continuously, helping himself to crazily select rewards.<br/>
<br/>
The Illusory True Lotus Seeds... were all chosen by him.<br/>
<br/>
The embryonic form of the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability also changed its appearance.<br/>
<br/>
In Ning Zhuo's divine sea dantian, on the jade-like lotus leaf, there was a pink and white lotus bud.<br/>
<br/>
The bud was full, giving a sense of imminent blooming.<br/>
<br/>
"Just a little more to perfection." "No, still a long way to go..."<br/>
<br/>
The embryonic form of the divine ability gave Ning Zhuo a contradictory understanding.<br/>
<br/>
After discussing with Sun Lingtong and guessing, they both felt: the embryonic form of the divine ability was very close to perfection! But this last step, though seemingly small, was extremely crucial.<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty of crossing it was very high; if it couldn't be crossed, it couldn't undergo a qualitative change to reach a state of ten percent perfection.<br/>
<br/>
Just like the previous ten percent spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
So, the distance to divine ability perfection was both a little and a lot.<br/>
<br/>
"Why can't there be more Illusory True Lotus Seeds?" Sun Lingtong felt regretful.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: "I think the last step must be crossed by the cultivator alone." He wasn't guessing wildly but had a basis.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "The last dozen or so Illusory True Lotus Seeds had very little help to the embryonic form of the divine ability. The growth rate of the embryonic form was not significant; the benefits from the Illusory True Lotus Seeds were genuinely decreasing."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong pondered for a moment, nodded, and agreed with Ning Zhuo's guess.<br/>
<br/>
But what to do next?<br/>
<br/>
How to achieve divine ability perfection?<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning discussed for a long time but couldn't come up with a reliable guess.<br/>
<br/>
At the volcano's peak, deep within the clouds and smoke.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui invited Zhu Xuanji for a discussion.<br/>
<br/>
"Master Zhu, rumors are spreading, and the wind is incessant."<br/>
<br/>
"Even though I sit here all day, I can't stop the news from spreading further and further."<br/>
<br/>
"Recently, more and more foreign cultivators have entered Fire Persimmon Immortal City. There are even rumors that the Soul Devouring Sect and the Void Sect have sent true disciples. The Taiqing Palace and the Purple Xiao Pavilion have also sent invitations, using the excuse of combating demonic forces to send true disciples into Fire Persimmon Immortal City."<br/>
<br/>
"In such a situation, relying on me alone to guard may not be sufficient. I hope Master Zhu can join me in petitioning the court to send reinforcements!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji looked deeply at Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
He had also observed the evolution of the situation during this period and nodded slightly: "Alright, I will join you in petitioning."<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
Early Stage of Qi Refining Sixth Layer.<br/>
<br/>
Mid Stage of Essence Refining Sixth Layer.<br/>
<br/>
Peak of Spirit Refining Sixth Layer!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo ended a day of arduous cultivation and exhaled a breath of turbid air.<br/>
<br/>
In just over ten days, his cultivation had made significant progress again.<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, by the mid-stage of the Qi Refining period, the cultivation speed would slow down considerably compared to the early stage.<br/>
<br/>
But the three sects' arranged three cultivation techniques all had advantages in cultivation speed.<br/>
<br/>
As long as the resources were sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
And Ning Zhuo's resource sources were abundant from various aspects.<br/>
<br/>
His strongest aspect was still his divine sea cultivation, which had been climbing steadily without slowing down, reaching the peak of the sixth layer.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Ning Zhuo could finally push the door forward once again.<br/>
<br/>
"It's time to showcase my extraordinary talent in mechanical constructs once more." With this thought, Ning Zhuo summoned Ning Chen and Ning Yong.</div>
