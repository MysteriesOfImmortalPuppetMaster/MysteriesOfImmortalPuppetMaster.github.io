<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Sun Lingtong asked bitterly, "Is there truly no way for me to obtain the Divination Art?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zeng Jide gave him a deep look. "Under normal circumstances, you could have someone else perform a divination. Just like how the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord enlisted the Ash Bone Elder's help this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"But if you were to obtain the Divination Art, it would mean..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Lingtong: "Mean what?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"It would mean that you occupy a crucial role in the Heavenly Script. Heaven has entrusted you with a great mission. The cosmos itself deems you insufficiently strong, willing to risk future consequences of creating an uncontrollable powerhouse just to strengthen you enough to fulfill a specific destiny!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sun Lingtong felt a chill in his heart, momentarily speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After a long pause, he frowned and said, "Even if obtaining the Divination Art isn't part of my destined path, I still want to try every possible means to acquire it, to strive with all my might!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"I desperately want to steal others' Qi Luck! It must be an incredible feeling!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zeng Jide laughed heartily again, patting Sun Lingtong on the shoulder. "Little Ghost, you have great ambition!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"If that's what you truly wish to do, then go ahead and do it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Perhaps this is your Dao Path. Heaven requires the Theft Path Methods to renew and evolve the Qi Luck, and it has entrusted this solemn responsibility to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Sun Lingtong's heart stirred, and he latched onto a key phrase: "Dao Path?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Zeng Jide stroked his beard. "This involves the Soul Transformation level and the cultivation beyond it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Soul Transformation comes after the Nascent Soul stage. As the Nascent Soul matures into the Primordial Spirit, one must naturally choose a direction for cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Take the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, for example. He is at the Soul Transformation level. His True Form cultivates the Water Element, while his Divided Spirit cultivates the Earth Element. The Water Element and Earth Element represent two distinct Dao Paths."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"You can think of the Dao Path, for now, as the direction of your cultivation. Of course, this simplifies things for your understanding, but it's not entirely comprehensive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong recalled the Dao Path conflict between the Ash Bone Elder and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, and his heart stirred. "Could it be that the Dao Path isn't just about what we cultivate, but also about our life philosophies? Some accept their fate as heaven's will, while others seek to defy heaven and change their destiny?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zeng Jide let out a surprised sound. "To grasp this layer of understanding is unexpected."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He laughed heartily. "Even geniuses like you and me shouldn't be measured by ordinary standards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Sword cultivators often prefer to break rather than yield, while martial artists tend to advance through courage and perseverance. Those on the Demonic Path can be either deeply passionate or ruthlessly cold. The Daoist School includes those who follow the path of effortless transformation and self-cultivation, as well as those who advocate for grand unification, simplification of rites to adapt to common practices, and lenient punishment and streamlined governance. The Buddhist Sect is divided between the Mahayana and Hinayana traditions, focusing on either guiding others or self-cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Although the Confucian school is relatively young, it has many branches. These include those who advocate for moral governance and benevolent rule, those who prioritize the people over the ruler, and those who debate whether human nature is inherently good or evil."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"All of these are valid Dao Paths."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Sun Lingtong listened as if hearing celestial music! Such profound and insightful words were far beyond his usual experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">If his master hadn't passed away, perhaps he could have received such guidance from him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Every word of this guidance was worth its weight in gold!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun Lingtong pondered deeply, completely forgetting that he was in Forgetful River Immortal City, currently committing theft. He asked himself, "Senior, how should I determine my Dao Path?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zeng Jide offered direct guidance without reservation. "First, consider your innate talent for cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"If you possess innate talent, it's a sign of Heaven's expectations for you. Starting from your innate talent will inevitably lead to greater success than other paths."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Second, consider your cultivation resources. Do you understand the four aspects of Technique, Land, Companion, and Resources?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Sun Lingtong nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Method refers to cultivation arts, spells, and such. Land refers to Blessed Grotto-Heavens, the places where cultivation takes place. Companion refers to Dao Companions, those who share the same aspirations. Wealth refers to Spirit Stones and other such resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Seeing that Sun Lingtong understood, Zeng Jide skipped the second point and continued, "Finally, there's one's personal temperament and aspirations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"The path you want to walk and the path you don't want to walk feel different. Those who act in accordance with their nature often find their thoughts flow smoothly. At the very least, they won't suffer excessive internal conflict or even Heart Demons during cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong finally understood. "So, Senior was encouraging me to persistently seek the Divination Art because it aligns with my aspirations?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zeng Jide replied, "I'm your senior Fellow Sect Member, and an expert in the Theft Path Methods. Naturally, I'm also skilled at reading people's expressions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"When you mentioned stealing others' Qi Luck earlier, your eyes lit up. That told me this is what your heart truly desires."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"This is crucial for you. Treasure it and don't give up easily!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Take the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, for example. He's been scheming for a century to advance his Dao Path, fully aware of the obstacles he'd face, yet remained unwavering."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"That's the power of holding fast to your aspirations, walking steadfastly toward the direction you truly want to go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Sun Lingtong was immediately captivated. "From what you're saying, Senior, it seems you have a deep understanding of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's current objectives?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zeng Jide replied, "To steal the River of Oblivion Vortex Eye, I naturally had to prepare thoroughly beforehand. The cost of gathering intelligence alone exceeded half the value of the treasury before you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Thus, I have a thorough understanding of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's movements and circumstances."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"He possesses the Innate Talent 'Drowning in Obliteration,' allowing him to immerse himself in the waters of the Forgetful River, reading various memories and experiencing endless emotions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"However, this talent is merely high-grade, not Immortal Talent. Therefore, it comes with a fatal flaw: oblivion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Once he becomes immersed in these memories and emotions and forgets to return in time, he risks being drowned in the River of Oblivion, perishing from excess."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"That's why he has schemed relentlessly for a century, devising countless plans to obtain an Innate Talent from the Heavenly Ghost's skull to compensate for his own deficiency."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Innate Talent, Innate Talent—these are gifts bestowed by the heavens."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"But any Innate Talent artificially enhanced through human means is almost always a defiance of heaven's will. That's why the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord faces such immense difficulties. He had to accumulate resources and painstakingly prepare for a century before gaining the strength for this decisive move."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Sun Lingtong felt his throat go dry, his heart pounding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">For a moment, Sun Lingtong considered seizing the opportunity to directly reveal his purpose to Zeng Jide—to cause chaos in the Forgetful River Immortal City and coordinate with his comrades to stop the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But Sun Lingtong ultimately restrained himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Through his recent exchange with Zeng Jide, he had realized that despite his bold demeanor, the man was extremely cautious. He had meticulously chosen the timing and conducted thorough reconnaissance. By using Buddhist cultivation methods to enhance his theft techniques, Zeng Jide was taking risks, but it promised a substantial increase in both his cultivation and resources—a highly profitable venture!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Zeng Jide's sole purpose was to advance his own cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Asking him to help stop the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord would be obstructing the Prefecture Lord's Dao Path—a completely different matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Even if Zeng Jide stole items like River of Oblivion Vortex Eyes, it would merely be plucking a few teeth from a tiger's mouth. With so many teeth, losing a couple wouldn't harm the beast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But if Zeng Jide assisted Sun Lingtong, it would incur the Prefecture Lord's deadly enmity. This was far more severe than plucking teeth—it would be like trying to kill the tiger outright!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Would Zeng Jide help?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong believed the chances were exceedingly slim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Would you risk your life to help someone you've just met, angering a Prefecture Lord? A whole cultivation nation in the Underworld?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zeng Jide had advised Sun Lingtong out of respect for his junior fellow sect member, whom he admired. To actually ask for his help would have offended this senior member of the Thief Sect, ruined this opportunity, and shown a complete lack of tact and propriety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Let nature take its course, let nature take its course," Sun Lingtong repeated to himself, remembering Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's counsel. In the end, he didn't mention his request even a little bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After Zeng Jide retrieved the three precious materials from the secret chamber, his expression suddenly changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Watch out!" In the next instant, he unleashed his Lifebound Treasure, disregarding the risk of exposure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">It was a monkey-faced Buddha statue, its golden monkey features making exaggerated expressions beneath a pitch-black kasaya.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">A furry monkey hand emerged from the opening in the kasaya's chest, but clearly, the monkey's actual hands extended from the kasaya's sides, converging at the Lower Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This was a three-handed Buddha monkey statue!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The moment it was released, the statue pierced through the roof and soared into the sky, transforming from lifeless to living, from tangible to ethereal. In an instant, it became a towering, several-zhang-tall Buddha monkey phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The phantom brought its two hands together in prayer, while the third hand on its chest stretched upward with great force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The hand grew longer and longer, its palm expanding until it resembled a dark cloud looming overhead, casting a vast shadow over the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">A deafening roar, like thunder, exploded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">What followed was a hurricane-like blast of qi that swept across the surroundings, triggering defensive formations in countless buildings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">A streak of black lightning shot back and was reabsorbed into Zeng Jide's dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He spat out a mouthful of blood, then swept his hand to gather the blood, his face pale as he pulled Sun Lingtong along and fled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Thieving Art - Shadow Escape!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The two transformed back into a Black Shadow and slipped through the threshold, swiftly moving through the door seams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Soon after, countless patrolling cultivators swarmed the area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Over here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"I never thought the Painted Skin Rakshasa had accomplices!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"The No. 3 warehouse is empty! All the precious materials are gone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"I know who it is! That immoral Zeng Jide!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"He sent a letter of intent earlier, claiming he would steal the River of Oblivion Vortex Eye, and he actually succeeded!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Quick, chase them! They haven't gotten far!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In an instant, a myriad of detection spells were cast, and defensive formations activated one after another. The City Lord's Mansion roared to life like a lion awakened from slumber, revealing the true might of a nation's capital!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Zeng Jide scanned the area with his divine sense, witnessing the array of spells and formations, his heart pounding with unease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">With the City Lord's Mansion fully mobilized, the difficulty of infiltration had increased by dozens of times, practically on a completely different level than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">If Zeng Jide had been alone, he might have managed. But with Sun Lingtong in tow, things became complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Refusing to abandon his junior fellow sect member, Zeng Jide carried Sun Lingtong and pushed the Shadow Evasion Technique to its limits. He simultaneously deployed over a dozen countermeasures against various detection spells and defensive formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Many of these formations acted like fortresses, restricting their movement and forcing them to evade rather than confront.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After a series of twists and turns, Zeng Jide spotted a weakness and slipped through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">They had entered a hidden layer within the Formation Space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Zeng Jide, having lost his Black Shadow form, knelt half-bent over, gasping for breath. His clothes were soaked with sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Completely exhausted, he was a far cry from the composed mentor he had been moments earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong also resumed his human form. After checking on Zeng Jide, who waved him off, he immediately sat down cross-legged, closed his eyes, and began regulating his breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Sun Lingtong, however, was in good shape. Having been dragged along by Zeng Jide the entire way, he hadn't expended much physical or spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He carefully examined their surroundings. Behind them was a shimmering emerald membrane, occasionally crossed by hurried figures. Before them lay a dense fog.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">From within the mist came intermittent sounds of fierce combat and the shrill cries of female cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Suddenly, voices echoed from behind:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"How come we can't find that Zeng Que De?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Do you think he might have hidden here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"This is the Restraining Wave Formation that entrapped the Painted Skin Rakshasa. If those two were to join forces, we'd be in real danger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Right! Void Sect cultivators are experts at breaking formations and infiltrating. If Zeng Que De helps the Painted Skin Rakshasa escape, capturing that Demonic Cultivator again would be much harder!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Sun Lingtong glanced back and saw a group of cultivators closing in beyond the emerald-green light membrane.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The green membrane rippled as the cultivators approached, their figures and features becoming increasingly distinct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Sun Lingtong's hair stood on end, his heart pounding in his throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Zeng Jide sat with his eyes closed, recuperating, seemingly unable to focus on anything outside. The approaching cultivators were about to discover them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">What should he do?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth, just about to use a Theft Path Method to conceal himself, when he received a mental message from Zeng Jide through their shared divine sense: Don't panic, boy. Don't act recklessly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">If you rashly use those Theft Path Methods, you'll only draw attention to us!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Sun Lingtong immediately froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The group of cultivators swept past them. Even at this close range, a layer of green membrane remained between the two sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The cultivators filed into the mist one by one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Soon, the sounds of fierce combat within the mist intensified. The Painted Skin Rakshasa giggled coyly: "Hee hee hee! So many gentlemen have come to 'take care' of me? Come on, then! Let me 'take care' of you properly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Screams erupted one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Clearly, the incoming cultivators were suffering a crushing defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">One of them roared furiously, "You treacherous demoness! May you die a miserable death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Painted Skin Rakshasa laughed. "Whether I die or not remains to be seen, but several of you have already met your end!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Another cultivator, suppressing his anger, snarled, "Your triumph won't last! Struggle within the Restraining Wave Formation until your strength and spiritual energy are utterly drained. We'll capture you alive, tear out your tendons, and flay your skin to avenge our fallen comrades!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The Painted Skin Rakshasa retorted, "You can't be certain. Your Prefecture Lord might already be dead outside. After all, I wasn't the only one confronting him. Even Lord Yin Jiuzhu alone would have been a formidable opponent for your Prefecture Lord. And then there's the Soundless Ghost Monk and the Lady of Sorrowful Bones to consider."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The cultivators retreated in disarray, their voices rising in defiance: "You vile demoness! Cease your treacherous lies! We'll settle this later!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">As they fled, they once again brushed past Sun Lingtong, remaining oblivious to the old man and young disciple of the Void Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Let nature take its course... Let nature take its course..." Sun Lingtong gazed at the swirling mist, his heart swelling with admiration. "That old brother's mother is truly something else!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Then, he sent a telepathic message through his divine sense to Zeng Jide: "Senior, I've got a brilliant idea!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Let's release the Painted Skin Rakshasa. She'll draw all the attention while we make our escape!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
