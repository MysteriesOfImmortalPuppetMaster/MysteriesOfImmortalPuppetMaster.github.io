<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Ning Clan patriarch smiled bitterly and said, “Tell me your conditions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">His expression became darker and darker with each condition Ning Xiaohui listed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Five items in, the patriarch couldn’t bear it any longer and raised his hand to stop her. “Stop, stop for a moment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Granny Ning, who held very high seniority, said unhappily: “Why stop? My granddaughter is risking her life for this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The talisman hall elder also chimed in. “Sir Patriarch, did you know? The City Lord Mansion has already sent city guards to patrol Fire Persimmon Immortal City and strictly investigate anyone who cultivates the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Once Xiaohui joins this competition, the danger won’t just be limited to inside the Lava Immortal Palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Granny Ning snorted coldly. “It’s not like we’re outsiders of the branch family. All of us here are main family members. Patriarch, why are you being so stingy?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">By the time Ning Zhuo woke up, it was already noon of the next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He was feeling much, much better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Looks like I’ll need some pills for nourishing and restoring the soul.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Although Ning Zhuo had a lot of pills stored away, very few of them dealt with the soul. But from his first foray into the Lava Immortal Palace, he could tell that this kind of pill would be indispensable in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“It’s not just the logs in Room 2 that can weaken the soul. When my soul is drawn out and attached to the mechanical puppet, that also slowly consumes its power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“In that case, the stronger my soul foundation is, the easier it will be to explore the Lava Immortal Palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After coming to a decision, Ning Zhuo immediately took action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He planned to go out and buy soul-nourishing pills from the various pill pavilions and pharmacies in the city. Of course, he would also purchased other pills along with them so as to conceal his true intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But soon after he set out, he heard someone complaining that the city guards were going around arresting people everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">At the same time, he saw many notices posted on the wall – the City Lord Mansion was currently testing the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation, concerned that it might be a demonic technique disguised as a Daoist one. In order to prevent any accidents, the cultivators in Fire Persimmon Immortal City were temporarily forbidden from cultivating it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo immediately changed his plans, no longer daring to go around buying pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">As he hurried back, he heard some other rumors that made him feel nervous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Meng Chong, Zheng Jian, and Zhou Zhu were all attacked?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“How terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Those are all geniuses protected by the full power of their clans. If even they encountered such a thing, then an ordinary person like me will only be worse off if I’m exposed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“My mother was right. I have to conceal myself well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo returned to his house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He still needed to stockpile soul-nourishing pills, but the situation right now was too tense, so that would have to wait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo thought about the black market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">But during the bombing of the immortal palace, his Iron Will Gray Armor had been heavily damaged. The armor’s back in particular was almost completely worn out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Most importantly, the critical Foundation Establishment Pill had been greatly depleted, with only one tenth of its power remaining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This was Ning Zhuo’s trump card. He couldn’t use it up carelessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“For now, I’ll just practice the spell I received as a reward from the immortal palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The spell Ning Zhuo had obtained was called the Icy Embrace Art. Once it was used, whatever was in the caster’s embrace would turn to ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After studying the spell for a bit, Ning Zhuo’s first thought was that this spell was a little weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He had previously cultivated the frost-type Snowy Region Talisman Illustration Scripture and mastered several related spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">For example, there was the Ice Spear Art, Frost Flower Art, Snowball Art, etc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“The biggest drawback of this Icy Embrace Art is that it only works in close quarters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Most common spells like the Ice Spear Art and the Snowball Art can be used to attack from a distance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Only being usable in close quarters was a huge problem when it came to actual combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">This made Ning Zhuo think about the Ice Spear Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In fact, he had wanted to use this spell inside the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The problem was that he couldn’t!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Cultivation techniques and spells were different, but they were also connected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Cultivation techniques were things like the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation or the Snowy Region Talisman Illustration Scripture. Their main purpose was to refine magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As for spells like the Ice Spear Art, Frost Flower Art, or Icy Embrace Art, they were methods of using that refined magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">And a cultivator’s spells were based on their cultivation technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">There were various kinds of magical power. Someone who cultivated ice-type magical power could never use the Fire Dragon Art; at most, they could cast the Ice Dragon Art, Snow Whale Art, etc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After Ning Zhuo obtained his five elements magical power, he had attempted to cast the Ice Spear Art, but couldn’t do it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Since his magical power contained all five elements, if he wanted to use a spell of a single element, he first needed to extract the corresponding type of magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Ice Spear Art he had mastered was incompatible with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He needed to modify the spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">This was a very common situation in the world of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">If Ning Zhuo had instead cultivated a different ice-type technique, he would most likely still be able to use his current Ice Spear Art. However, the spell wouldn’t be completely compatible with his new magical power, so its power would drop unless he made suitable adjustments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">As for the Icy Embrace Art, Ning Zhuo could use it without modification. It was a spell that was completely compatible with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After several practice attempts, water element magical power split off from Ning Zhuo’s five elements magical power, and he cast the Icy Embrace Art successfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The wooden stool in Ning Zhuo’s arms was instantly covered in frost. The frost spread rapidly, becoming thicker and thicker, and a few seconds later, the wooden stool had turned into a block of ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo couldn’t hide his surprise. “The Icy Embrace Art is so powerful?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Compared to common spells like the Ice Spear Art, Snowball Art, or Frost Flower Art, the power of this Icy Embrace Art was clearly several levels higher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">For the next period of time, Ning Zhuo devoted himself to practicing this spell in his underground workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He grabbed benches, chairs, mirrors, bricks, etc… and turned them all into blocks of ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo was addicted to his practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The floor and the corners of the walls were covered with ice blocks of varying sizes. The entire underground workshop was filled with icy air, turning it into an underground ice cellar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“The three choices from the first door were a spirit stone, a hanging ring, and ‘One Gust of Air’.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“If I think carefully, it’s obvious that the three choices were designed to help me pass the second room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Nothing needs to be said about the spirit stone. The hanging ring is probably something similar to my Up-Down As-You-Wish Cables, and the ‘One Gust of Air’ spell would most likely enable my puppet body to change direction in midair, or even levitate for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Thinking along this line, the rewards from the second door should help me in the next room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“The spirit stones are still spirit stones. I didn’t see the mechanical component clearly. But judging from this Icy Embrace Art, Room 3 probably involves combat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo logically analyzed the situation, drawing a conclusion from the fact that Icy Embrace Art was a typical offensive spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Room 1 requires the cultivator to assemble a mechanical puppet. Room 2 tests the puppet’s ability to jump and run. Room 3 could require battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Looking at things from this point of view, the Lava Immortal Palace’s tests double as passing down teachings. It seems that Three Schools Supreme Sage isn’t just choosing worthy talents, but also actively training them in mechanical arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Sigh, my soul is almost fully healed, but I don’t know when I’ll be able to enter the immortal palace again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">That night, exhausted from practicing, Ning Zhuo fell asleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He felt that something was wrong and tried to open his eyes, but found that darkness was all he could see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After a few moments of confusion, he sensed his surroundings and instantly became excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“My soul is back inside the Lava Immortal Palace!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
