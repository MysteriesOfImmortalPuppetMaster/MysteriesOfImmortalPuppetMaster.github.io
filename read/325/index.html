<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 325: Zheng Danlian: I Will Kill! (Seeking Monthly Tickets)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div><paragraph index="0">At the final critical moment in the battle with Qi Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="2">A massive fist came crashing down, accompanied by a chilling wind, suffocating with a terrifying killing intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">Ning Zhuo raised his head, glaring fiercely at the Bull-Headed Ghost Soldier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="6">"Is this the moment I have to use the Buddha-Healer after all?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">Unexpectedly, the Bull-Headed Ghost Soldier’s attack was blocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">Suddenly, a figure appeared, standing like a mountain in front of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">Ning Zhuo's eyes widened as he stared at the figure, exclaiming in his heart: "Yuan Dasheng?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">Ning Zhuo had previously installed the Fire Essence Heart Furnace in his Golden Core-grade mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">He thought to himself, “Even with regular fire essence, it's hard to fuel such a heavy mechanical ape.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">However, he realized, "The difference between fire essences and fire persimmons is negligible. Using millennial or ten-thousand-year fire persimmons would work."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">"The Buddha-Healer’s mechanism is stored in the City Lord’s warehouse, and stealing some fire persimmons would be easy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">Zhu Xuanji, after consulting the royal calculations, determined that the one who had intervened was Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">He then flew into the sky, making a high-profile entrance, shattering the roof as he descended in front of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">"Why did you kill Yuan Dasheng?" Zhu Xuanji's voice was as cold as iron, without a trace of warmth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">The tremendous pressure from him was like an invisible mountain, crashing down on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">Ning Zhuo staggered, his back bending under the weight, but he didn't kneel. Instead, he braced himself, barely standing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">He was ready to deploy the Shadow Demon Buddha-Healer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">As the Golden Core chaos unfolded, Ning Zhuo saw a group of Shadow Demon cultivators making their moves, forcing him to abandon his original plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">The Buddha-Healer mechanism no longer needed to participate in the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">Zheng Danlian faced a true disciple from the Taiqing Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">A glimmer of cold light flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">With a mighty swing, the Great Serpent Scythe decapitated the Taiqing disciple!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">Within the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">Ning Zhuo transmitted a message to Sun Lingtong: “Boss, something's off with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit! If it contacts you in the future, don’t trust it blindly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">“And although we can communicate via the Life Thread, I fear the Immortal Palace’s powers might allow the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit to eavesdrop on our messages.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">“After all, each of us, upon entering the Immortal Palace, has a Life Thread hanging from the Lava Immortal Palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">“There’s even a possibility that the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could tamper with our communications!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">“To be safe, we should communicate face-to-face.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Sun Lingtong nodded, “Understood!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Ning Xiaohui was already dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">Ning Zhuo slightly opened the Spirit Box, letting out a small wisp of spirit energy, like fireflies, that flowed directly into the Flowing Cloud Talisman!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up: "It really worked!!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">For a moment, he was overwhelmed with joy, his eyes moist with emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">This had been just a theory of his, but now it was perfectly proven in practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Replenishing the Flowing Cloud Talisman’s spirit energy could indeed be drawn from a cultivator’s essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">Ning Xiaohui, in her lifetime, had cherished this talisman, practically treating it as her most precious item.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">Because of this strong connection, after being burned down to a spirit form, a small part of her essence could be absorbed by the Flowing Cloud Talisman, enhancing its power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">Ning Zhuo quickly shut the Spirit Box, holding the talisman in hand, standing still for a long while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit appeared before Ning Zhuo again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">“Master, Master, I am the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">Its tone sounded extremely weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">“That Zhu Xuanji is causing trouble again!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">“He’s trying to use the monster tide to investigate the Golden Furnace in the Gourd Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">“Master, I may have mentioned it before, but they used up one Golden Furnace to create Yuan Dasheng’s mechanism.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">“If Zhu Xuanji finds out…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit appeared both excited and anxious, continuing in a weak voice, “Master, you're decisive and bold. We should join forces now and use the Five Elements Cannon Tower to strike them hard!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Ning Zhuo was suspicious: “Why is the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit so nervous?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">“The Golden Furnace…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">“The fifth furnace was used on Yuan Dasheng, the third for the Great Serpent Scythe, and the fourth for my mother. The problem must be with the first or second furnace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">“There must be a vulnerability with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">Ning Zhuo composed a poem and handed it to Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Although Zhu Xuanji did not reveal what he was investigating, Ning Zhuo had a hunch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Buddha-Healer Meng Yao was tracking Zhu's movements, allowing Ning Zhuo to gather first-hand intelligence and make more accurate judgments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">“What exactly are they looking for?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">“Does it have something to do with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Buddha-Healer Meng Yao had gained enough spirit energy to act independently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">Even during Ning Zhuo's trials, she continuously gathered intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">During the third round of trials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Meng Kui intentionally lowered his defenses, guiding the attacks of the Scarlet Flame Beasts. As the Lava Immortal Palace's defenses weakened, many restrictions faded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Taking advantage of this, Buddha-Healer Meng Yao broke into the Secret Pavilion of Opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">When she saw Ning Zhuo lying on the ground, scorched by karmic fire, though she had no memory, an endless fury rose within her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Her spirit trembled as she tenderly helped Ning Zhuo to his feet, overflowing with boundless affection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Meanwhile, Meng Yao brushed past Ning Xiaohui’s grandmother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Sun Lingtong, unaware of the truth, charged in recklessly, trying to defend Ning Zhuo. Meng Yao easily subdued him with a single finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">As Ning Zhuo's wounds rapidly healed, the karmic flames in his eyes were purified by the Buddha’s light. He stood up suddenly, shouting, “Little Zhuo, you've hidden so much from me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Ning Zhuo smiled wryly, just about to explain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">“Watch out!” Sun Lingtong cried out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">He had spotted Zhu Xuanji charging toward Ning Zhuo from behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Although Ning Zhuo had just recovered, remnants of karmic fire still clung to him, and his divine sense could not extend beyond three feet. His senses had barely returned when Zhu Xuanji closed in on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">Divine Power - Golden Mountain Stance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Divine Power - Jade Pillar Posture!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Zhu Xuanji charged with unstoppable momentum, like a mountain pressing down, overwhelming and impossible to avoid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Facing him, Sun Lingtong felt his resolve waver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Compared to the massive Zhu Xuanji, Buddha-Healer Meng Yao seemed frail and delicate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Suddenly, she sidestepped and extended her palm to protect Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Divine Power - Jade Soft Petals!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">Divine Power - Cloud Wave Rebound!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">A delicate jade flower bloomed, tender and beautiful. Surrounding it, clouds began to roll.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">Zhu Xuanji's fierce attack, unmatched in its force, was suddenly neutralized by the Buddha-Healer Meng Yao’s defenses. The accumulated force was absorbed into the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">In the next moment, the clouds trembled, and the absorbed power shot back at Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">Caught off guard, Zhu Xuanji was forced back several steps, crashing through a small door and retreating out of the secret chamber where Ning Zhuo stood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">“What an incredible display of softness overcoming strength!” Zhu Xuanji exclaimed in surprise. He hadn’t expected that a mere mechanical puppet could execute not one but two divine powers in perfect harmony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">These two powers combined even more seamlessly than his own Golden Mountain Stance and Jade Pillar Posture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Zheng Danlian’s eyes burned with crimson fire. Already deep in a state of madness, his fury surged as karmic backlash filled him with murderous intent. He charged straight at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">Zhu Xuanji shouted in shock, “Stop!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Zheng Danlian, wielding his scythe, recklessly burst through the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">The scythe mechanism activated suddenly, its blade extending like a crescent moon. In a flash, the tip of the blade pierced Zheng Danlian’s forehead and exited through the back of his skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Zheng Danlian’s charging figure slowed to a walk. By the time he reached Ning Zhuo, he collapsed to his knees with a thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">He still clutched the scythe's handle, his eyes bloodshot and lifeless, his face frozen in a wild, crazed expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">Click, click, click.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">The mechanical scythe transformed, turning into a massive snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">The snake opened its jaws and swallowed Zheng Danlian’s body whole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">It hissed joyfully, then slithered over to Buddha-Healer Meng Yao, lowering its head in submission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">Meng Yao stood aside, gently stroking the snake's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">The mechanical serpent flicked its tongue, its tail wagging in excitement, affectionate and obedient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Chi Dun, Zhou Nongying, and Yang Chanyu, who had arrived just in time to witness this scene, gasped in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">The sight of the mechanical serpent devouring Zheng Danlian’s corpse sent chills down their spines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">They all realized that this was no coincidence but part of a meticulously crafted plot—one that had led directly to the death of a Golden Core stage cultivator from the Zheng family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Yang Chanyu, stunned by the depth of the scheme, finally grasped the full scope of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong’s machinations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"So this is how deeply their plot runs... So ruthless! No wonder they've been so confident in vying for control of the Lava Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">In that single, fleeting moment, Chi Dun, Zhou Nongying, and Zhu Xuanji, still standing in the darkness of the rain-soaked night, all understood the same truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">The mechanical serpent quickly reverted back into its scythe form, falling obediently into the hand of Buddha-Healer Meng Yao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">She turned and faced the small door outside the chamber, and with a simple, graceful motion, she made a single cut.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">A sense of profound despair, helplessness, and desolation swept over the onlookers as they were momentarily caught in an illusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Chi Dun’s neck erupted in a fountain of blood. A massive gash nearly decapitated him, and he staggered back, clutching his throat in a desperate attempt to heal himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Zhou Nongying was flung backward, his protective talisman shattered into two pieces, his eyes wide with terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Zhu Xuanji’s body radiated with golden light, but even the indomitable Golden Mountain Stance was cleaved at an angle, nearly splitting the mountain in four.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">The delicate golden branches and jade leaves adorning the mountain crumbled under the force, scattering with a series of sharp, brittle sounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">He coughed up blood, struggling to stay on his feet, but his body trembled uncontrollably as he was forced back several steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">His vision dimmed as a deep purple hue crept into his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Zhu Xuanji was horrified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">It wasn’t the frontal attack from Buddha-Healer Meng Yao and the mechanical serpent that had left him in such dire straits. The true threat lay in the hidden affliction within his body, which had combined with external forces to overwhelm him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">“When did I get hit?” he wondered in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">And then, suddenly, he remembered: “It must have been when I investigated the history of the Golden Furnace and was exposed to the Purple Qi Corruption. I thought I had cleansed it all… but I was wrong!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">Yang Chanyu's face turned deathly pale as she instinctively took several steps back, overwhelmed by fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Though she hadn’t been directly attacked, the devastating scene unfolding before her left her trembling in horror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Ning Zhuo, still weak, turned to Sun Lingtong and said, “Boss, we should leave.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Buddha-Healer Meng Yao immediately stepped forward to protect them, guiding the pair toward the chamber’s exit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">The Golden Core cultivators, still reeling from the attack, were momentarily frozen in place—some healing their wounds, others simply watching in stunned silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">Ning Zhuo was well aware of his own condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">Buddha-Healer Meng Yao had used a great deal of spirit energy to unleash two divine powers and control the mechanical serpent. She was nearing her limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Fortunately, Ning Zhuo’s bluff had worked, leaving their enemies too shaken to pursue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">As they reached the doorway, Ning Zhuo paused, his voice faint but resolute:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">"Anyone who dares to follow… will be cut down."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">The entire chamber remained silent. No one dared respond.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
