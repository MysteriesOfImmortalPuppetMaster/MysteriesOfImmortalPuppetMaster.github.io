<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had become a Ghost Cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">She wore a set of white mourning robes, their fabric as light as cold mist, faintly translucent. Her skirt drifted three inches above the ground as she moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Her face still bore traces of her former delicate beauty, but her brows were etched with an unyielding sorrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Long hair cascaded down like a black waterfall, its ends shimmering with misty threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Her eyes were no longer clear black and white, but clouded like veiled windows. Deep within their pupils burned two icy blue Soulfires.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Her fingers had grown longer than in life, their nails dark gray. Floating beside her arm hung a Burnt-Tail Ghost-Patterned Qin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">It was this magic treasure she had just activated, its chords summoning the South City Gate to open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This opening of the gates was no trivial matter!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">It immediately changed the battlefield's dynamics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Yet both sides stood frozen, unable to react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The White Paper Immortal City faction never expected a former high-ranking official to defect, directly activating the internal seal to open the gates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Meanwhile, the Underworld Army had no knowledge of Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer's existence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Even their commander Luo Si remained in the dark. He had no idea Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer existed at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">It was revealed that after learning of the prophetic poem from Ash Bone Elder (Beheading Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer will open the city gates...), the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had devised a clear course of action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">First, he sent assassins to kill Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, then transformed the corpse into a Ghost Cultivator under his strict control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Now, the results of this maneuver were becoming apparent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Why had he concealed the entire Underworld Army's existence?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Firstly, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord couldn't be certain if the controlled Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer could truly open the city gates. If it failed, he wouldn't lose face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Secondly, this was a critical military operation - the fewer people who knew about it, the safer it would be.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Thirdly, Luo Si had recently been promoted and maintained strong ties with the Ash Bone Elder. The Underworld Army deployed to the Living Realm, from top to bottom, wasn't composed of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's direct subordinates. Their level of trust was insufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer succeeded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Luo Si, having risen through the ranks from the bottom, immediately understood the situation even without prior knowledge. He decisively ordered the military formation at the South City Gate to launch a surprise attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Even if the gates opened, they would be narrow. Ordering the entire formation to charge would be foolish - only a portion should conduct a strong assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Without hesitation, Luo Si immediately ordered the Headless Ghost Riders to launch a desperate, all-out charge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The spectral cavalry surged forward, their iron hooves pounding against the earth in a deafening rhythm. Leading the charge were several Golden Core Ghost Generals, their cultivation at the Golden Core stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Thud! Thud! Thud!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">A series of muffled impacts echoed as the Ghost Cavalry's charge crushed countless Skeletal Dead Soldiers. The shattered bones and torn limbs were ground into dust beneath their steeds' hooves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">These soldiers had previously been valiantly charging the city walls, blocking the Ghost Cavalry's path. To save time, not only did the Ghost Generals continuously employ the "Speed is of the Essence" military tactic, but they even abandoned their own Withered Bone Dead Soldiers!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This fleeting opportunity to seize the city gate could not be missed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Disaster!" The cultivators on the southern city wall felt as if they'd plunged into an icebound cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Under the enhanced military tactic, the enemy cavalry charged with such ferocity that they even injured their own troops, demonstrating a terrifying and ruthless combat style.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">If these cultivators on the wall had been granted Military Power Amplification, perhaps some might have dared to leap down and block the city gate, buying crucial time for its closure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">But everyone knew that no such enhancement existed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Without it, jumping down to block the gate with one's bare body would be nothing but suicide!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Knowing death was inevitable, fear and terror overwhelmed these cultivators. Their eyes bulged with fury as they watched helplessly as the Ghost Cavalry trampled everything in its path, closing in on the city walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">If only the Qing-Jiao Army were here! The deputy commander of the City Guard, who was overseeing this section of the wall, sighed in frustration, clenching his wrist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He had indeed been tempted to jump down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">But when he surveyed his surroundings, he realized his forces were woefully thin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Even if I jump, how many would follow? And even if we all did, with just the City Guard's numbers, we'd be throwing away our lives for nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">We wouldn't be able to stop them at all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The toll of the Ghost Tide on White Paper Immortal City became clear in this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The City Guard's severe manpower shortages had forced the White Paper City Lord to summon cultivators from surrounding villages and towns, offering generous rewards to the bravest among them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">While this greatly bolstered White Paper Immortal City's defensive forces, it also diluted their quality. The overall competence of the defenders plummeted, making a desperate last stand impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Life or death hung on a single thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Such is the nature of war.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The influence of morale and spirit reaches far deeper and wider than what appears on the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">If this had been the original City Guard - a pure force composed of White Paper Immortal City's finest families, bound by unwavering loyalty - perhaps they might have truly blocked the gates with their bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Ghost Cavalry charged toward the city gates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had already taken the lead, rushing into the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"White Paper Immortal City is about to fall!" The leading Golden Core Ghost Generals wore expressions of bloodlust and frenzied excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">But at that moment, the city gates and walls suddenly erupted in flashes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Countless talismans flew out, transforming into spell scrolls that ignited instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The spells within surged skyward, unleashing a deadly display of multicolored light. A dazzling array of magical effects descended upon the Headless Ghost Riders, forcing them to experience every imaginable manner of death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Some burned to ashes, others froze solid, some struck by lightning, others buried alive, some corroded into dust, and some even manipulated by unseen forces...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Ghost Cavalry's assault was halted in its tracks!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The cultivators on the walls reacted first, breaking into cheers. In an instant, morale soared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Luo Si's pupils contracted as he murmured, "Tie Guzheng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The one who had acted decisively to snatch White Paper Immortal City from the jaws of defeat was none other than the City Guard commander.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Even if this move would severely deplete the defensive reserves at the South City Gate, Tie Guzheng didn't hesitate for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">His experience in defending cities was simply too extensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">How many times had he faced Ghost Tides?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Even he couldn't remember the exact number.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"This round alone has thinned the walls at the South City Gate by at least half!" Tie Guzheng's forehead glistened with cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Though they had repelled the terrifying charge of the Headless Ghost Riders, the weakened South City Gate would inevitably become the enemy's primary assault direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He had no choice but to act this way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Luo Si hurled multiple Military Tokens, distributing Military Might while simultaneously ordering a counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The numerous Ghost Generals, now boosted by Military Power Amplification, immediately braved the talisman explosions and charged through the South City Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Witnessing this, Tie Guzheng's heart clenched. "The enemy general is extraordinary, reacting with such speed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He urgently dispatched Cultivator experts to intercept them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">At the same time, Tie Guzheng wanted to mobilize numerous Wallpapers to block the Golden Core Ghost Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But at that moment, Luo Si issued another military command, ordering the Headless Ghost Riders to retreat, followed by the Drowned Ghosts on both flanks launching their assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Drowned Ghosts formed a continuous mass, their watery vapors intertwining to create a river flowing across land.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Hiding within this river, the Drowned Ghosts evaded most Talisman Paper attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The river meandered, surging toward the city gates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Tie Guzheng, forced into a difficult position, had no choice but to shift his focus to the Drowning River. Though he managed to halt the enemy advance once more, he lost the opportunity to contain the enemy general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Once the stalemate was broken, Luo Si demonstrated his command abilities, completely outmaneuvering Tie Guzheng and other capable generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sound Art: Nine Springs Burial Song!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Whoo... Whoo... Whoo...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Burnt-Tail Ghost-Patterned Qin floated beside Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer. Her fingers hovered in the air, never touching the strings, yet still producing a series of eerie musical notes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The music, resembling funeral dirges, bypassed most protective measures to reach the Divine Soul directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Cultivators who approached her found their movements instantly stiffening and slowing, their expressions twisting into pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Some dropped their weapons with a clang, staring blankly at the sky. Others collapsed to their knees, weeping uncontrollably. Some eyes glazed over, their bodies moving like walking corpses. Some even slit their own throats, ending their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Confucian technique - Literary Heart Protection!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In the next instant, Wen Ruanyu descended from the skies to provide support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He activated his Confucian technique, causing characters to rain down like a torrent, enveloping many cultivators and saving their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer! What are you doing?!" Wen Ruanyu roared, his expression pained as he glared at the ghost seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Confucian technique - Heart Cleansing and Reform!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He unleashed the spell, striking directly at Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The ghost seer's previously impassive face flickered with a fleeting emotion that vanished as quickly as it appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Wen Ruanyu, however, had already discerned some crucial details, leaving him feeling hopeless. In that fleeting moment, he had detected national power emanating from Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">This was clearly the national power of the Forgetful River Prefecture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Unless Wen Ruanyu joined a cultivation nation and could harness their national power, he would be unable to directly counter this threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">This wasn't a difference in the scale of power, but a fundamental disparity in their very nature!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"The problem is, national power is only effective within its own territory. Why is the national power of the Forgetful River Prefecture working here in the Living Realm?!" Wen Ruanyu's mind churned with perplexing questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He wielded his brush with vigor, unleashing another torrent of characters into the air!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Confucian technique - Cease Song, Sever Dance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The words coalesced in mid-air, forming an article that encircled the battlefield and severely curtailed the effectiveness of Sound Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had been playing the Nine Springs Burial Song continuously, its reactions sluggish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Clearly, this forced control had drastically diminished its combat capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Wen Ruanyu's pressure, however, surged dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Behind Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer stood six Golden Core Ghost Generals, their combined assault terrifying. More frightening still was their Military Might Amplification, which pushed their combat strength to the Nascent Soul level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"How can we fight this?" Though deeply attached to White Paper Immortal City, Wen Ruanyu could only temporarily avoid the onslaught, preserving his useful body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">In the next moment, Confucian techniques flared again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The gentle white light not only enhanced Wen Ruanyu's defenses but also reinforced the earlier article's power, suppressing the six Ghost Generals' offensive edge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Wen Ruanyu's divine sense swept behind him, easing his tension. He saw Zhou Wenyan leading a team of cultivators rushing to their aid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">It seemed Tie Guzheng had immediately recognized the South City Gate as the main assault point and swiftly transferred elite forces there. Zhou Wenyan, being closest to the scene, had arrived first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The six Golden Core Ghost Generals communicated through divine sense, immediately merging their forces. Their combined might surged forward with renewed vigor, charging toward Wen Ruanyu and Zhou Wenyan, the two Confucian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Despite being True Inheritors from a super sect, even their Golden Core cultivation proved insufficient to withstand this overwhelming assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The deafening explosion didn't occur between the two sides of cultivators and generals, but at the base of the South City Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The Drowning River erupted violently, its waters bursting upward as a colossal creature emerged from the waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">It was a massive Bone-Piercing Crocodile, its four feet alone towering over half the city wall's height. Its rugged bone armor, thick enough to discourage most attackers, was further fortified by massive, pale spikes that served both offensive and defensive purposes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">From within the Bone-Piercing Crocodile came the White Bone Crocodile Demon's furious roar: "Today, the White Paper Immortal City shall fall!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The Bone-Piercing Crocodile's massive body crashed against the weakened city wall like a siege hammer. The violent impact instantly created fissures in the masonry, which rapidly spread across the structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Cultivators on the wall staggered and fell, while those who managed to remain standing unleashed a barrage of attacks against the Spineback Colossus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Various attacks struck the giant crocodile's armor, but with little effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The Bone-Piercing Colossus was part of the military formation, benefiting from Military Power Amplification, making its strength nearly equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The Bone-Piercing Crocodile retreated a few steps before charging forward again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">If this charge connected, the city wall might not withstand the impact, collapsing a large section.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">City gates could be closed after being opened. But if a significant portion of the wall were destroyed, it would mean the fall of most of White Paper Immortal City into the Abyss of Defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Beast, meet my iron fan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">At the critical moment, Tie Guzheng's eyes blazed with fury, bloodshot as he charged forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">He stamped his foot, and his magic treasure Combat Boots erupted with yellow spiritual light. Activating the Earthshrinking Earth Element Spell Restriction, he leaped across the distance to land on the southern city wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">In the emergency, Tie Guzheng jumped onto the wall's edge, his entire body hurtling forward like a catapult-launched projectile, charging toward the Bone-Piercing Colossus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Mid-air, he raised his iron fan magic treasure above his head, pouring all his spiritual energy into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Martial Art - Mountain Crushing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The City Guard commander's seal glowed, White Paper Immortal City's Formation power amplifying!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The Geng Metal Qi from the iron fan surged forth, merging with all the forces to form a terrifying strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The air was compressed to its limit, emitting a mournful cry as it strained under the force!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">This strike was like a mountain of iron being swung down, carrying enough power to snap the earth's veins and shake cities to their foundations. It crashed down with terrifying fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">BOOM-!!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The iron fan struck the skull of the Spineback Colossus, releasing a deafening roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">A violent shockwave exploded outward, scattering in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The cultivators closest to the impact - friend and foe alike - were thrown into the air like ragdolls. Their bones shattered, tendons torn, blood spraying from their eyes, noses, and mouths. They crashed against parapets and buildings behind them, leaving behind bloody smears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The Spineback Colossus roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">The earth-shaking cry filled with unbearable pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Its massive body plunged downward, most of it sinking back into the Drowning River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Crack... Crack...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The impact shattered countless bone spurs across its body, sending fragments flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Inside the colossus, the White Bone Crocodile Demon coughed up a mouthful of blood and collapsed instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The Spineback Colossus, enraged by this attack, wanted to retaliate. But the White Bone Crocodile Demon urgently restrained it, forcing them deeper into the water to regroup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">The Spineback Colossus was the White Bone Crocodile Demon's greatest trump card and the source of his power. He couldn't afford to play it too early in the battle, lest he exhaust his resources against the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The White Bone Crocodile Demon intended to rely on the giant crocodile to dominate the battlefield later, sweeping up war spoils as he pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
