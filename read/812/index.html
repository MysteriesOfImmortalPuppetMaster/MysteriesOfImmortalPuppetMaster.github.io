<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Bluestone Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Inside the Cultivation Chamber, a mechanical loom stood silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The loom featured a dark silver frame, inlaid with twenty-eight constellation gems that glittered radiantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo had specifically borrowed it from the Confucian cultivator community.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">With his current reputation, and the impression he held within the hearts of the Confucian cultivators, borrowing a mechanical loom was merely a matter of saying the word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo was currently reviewing the paper-making method of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He always maintained the good habit of timely review.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This was the third chapter of the paper-making method: Its measure of warp and weft corresponds to the celestial scale above. The Yellow Aunt pauses her shuttle, borrowing the ingenious thoughts of the Weaver Girl; Lu Ban severs his hand, mimicking the loom of creation. Weaving clouds and mist as the weft, stitching stars as the warp. When first formed, it is like the River Map faintly appearing; upon second glance, it resembles the Luo Shu floating and sinking…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">As Ning Zhuo looked back on this now, he gained new comprehensions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Though there were no literary light paste threads before his eyes, he had already prepared substitute spiritual threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Eighty-one vertical, eighty-one horizontal…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The big-headed youth stood steadily before the machine. His left hand gently guided a strand of spiritual thread, placing it upon the loom's warp beam.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He deliberated for three breaths before making his move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The thread fell silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">This was the beginning of the foundation, corresponding to the position of the North Pole in the firmament. Ning Zhuo gauged the position with extreme precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He raised his right hand slightly, and the completely transparent shuttle flew into his palm of its own accord… He froze in this posture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He fell into thought once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Within the shuttle, seven-colored flowing light rotated slowly, illuminating his distinct knuckles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">A breath later, his right wrist pushed and pulled with extreme stability - the shuttle passed through the warp, carrying the first strand of "weft."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"The Qian position crosses Li, Yang gestating Yin…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo’s movements were not fast; they could even be called sluggish. But every minute displacement carried a certain serene rhythm. As the shuttle reached the end, his left index finger tapped lightly, and a trace of imperceptible blood qi seeped from his fingertip, condensing into an extremely fine rune at the intersection of warp and weft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The instant the rune formed, the gemstone corresponding to the "Horn Constellation" on the loom shone slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">His movements became increasingly practiced, and his efficiency grew higher and higher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He gained a new realization: "The angle at which the wrist turns requires attention. Because in actual weaving, there are subtle differences between spiritual threads, one must interlace them with varying degrees of force to keep the fabric smooth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo slowly stopped his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Although he had only woven a small patch, the overlapping between spiritual threads was nearly perfect, without a single bit of entanglement or disorder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">If Gu Qing were to see this scene, his heart would surely be shaken. Because this result of Ning Zhuo’s was a massive improvement in quality compared to what he had refined during the trial just now!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Regarding this, Ning Zhuo did not find it strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"My Artifact Refining realm has reached the level of a Renowned Artisan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"I also bear many principles related to Artifact Refining."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Weaving requires subtle movements, and by employing the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art, I am best able to control every minute movement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Artifact Refining was one of the four great arts, while weaving was only in the latter half of the hundred arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Pill Refining, Talisman Making, Artifact Refining, and Array Deployment were known as the four great arts for a reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">There were commonalities between the hundred cultivation arts; many were mutually derived, developed, expanded, and then established independently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo had a deep foundation in Artifact Refining, which gave him a natural talent in related cultivation skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Vertical is the Heavenly warp, horizontal is the Earthly weft."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"The position of every thread must correspond to the movement of a certain star in the vault of heaven; every rune dropped at an intersection must accord with the changes of mathematical generation and inhibition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Principles, weaving, astrology, formations…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo savored the deeper meaning, while also discovering that during the trial earlier, he had placed more attention on the "form."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Nine times nine is eighty-one, which is the number of extreme Yang in mathematics, implicitly matching the 'wearing nine and treading on one' arrangement of the Nine Palaces in the Luo Shu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"What is woven are actually pathways of spiritual intuition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"The art of weaving is using tangible threads to weave intangible logic. Truly interesting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">It wasn't that Ning Zhuo hadn't encountered weaving arts before, but this experience allowed him to truly appreciate the profound connotations of weaving, thereby generating a much stronger interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"I need to find time to thoroughly study the memories regarding weaving."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Oh, and the Nine Palace Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but think of Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The school notes Shen Xi had gifted him detailed many basics of the Nine Palace Formation, which benefited Ning Zhuo greatly. They had played a significant positive role in the trial just now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"The Nine Palace Formation is good stuff too; I need to find time to study it more!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Sigh… I only hate that time is too insufficient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo’s schedule was extremely tight, especially after arriving at the main mountain gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">There were too many things he had to attend to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Cultivation related to the Foundation Establishment Stage was daily homework that had to be done continuously without break.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Then there was the design, training, and improvement of mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo also had to spare a large portion of his mind to constantly monitor changes in the outside world and deal with all sorts of challenges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">What weighed most on his mind was still the Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, and waiting for any unusual movement from the Great Serpent Scythe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The current priority was the various Rising Clouds Minor Trials. This was an extremely rare opportunity. Ning Zhuo could learn a great many precious things, and by establishing these relationships, find the most suitable entry point for him to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Furthermore, this would pave the way for Ning Zhuo’s future life in the Myriad Manifestations Sect and bring positive assistance to White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Time was truly not enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Therefore, Ning Zhuo could only make trade-offs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A review opportunity like the current one might be the only one he would get in the near future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo reviewed the entire paper-making method of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page from start to finish and discovered that he had many shortcomings at the time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"By improving these defects, the Dao-Bearing Jade Page I produce will definitely be of higher quality!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"At least three grades higher."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After the review, Ning Zhuo began his daily cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Neither the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual in the Upper Dantian nor the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual in the Middle Dantian were the main focus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The profundity of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art far exceeded the other two cultivation arts, making it the primary object of Ning Zhuo’s comprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Because of his previous accumulation, every time Ning Zhuo contemplated the Demonic Art, he gained insights, maintaining good progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">And today, as he contemplated it again, he naturally associated it with the art of weaving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A spiritual light flashed through the Divine Sea in his Upper Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Following the inspiration, Ning Zhuo manipulated the energy within his body, transforming it into a layer of fascia.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He used the memories of weaving to create more structures for the fascia - first a plain weave, then changing to a twill weave, and finally a satin weave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">With the three weaving methods, the efficiency of blood qi flowing through them was completely different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Plain weave is dense, best for defense; twill weave is smooth, beneficial for speed and bursts; satin weave is flexible and tough, best at dissipating force…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Interesting!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo looked again at the spiral, layered, and spiderweb structures within the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art, and gained new realizations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Isn't this just a difference in weaving methods and the final product?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"The spiral weave is like twisting ropes and cables, best for force transmission. When bursting forth, the blood qi acts like a drill, so the penetration is extremely strong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"The layered weave is like a thousand-layered armor, protecting layer upon layer; its defensive capabilities crown all styles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"The spiderweb weave spreads out in all directions, catching wind and shadows, best at confinement and contamination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"And the palindrome weave, interweaving forward and reverse, creating an endless cycle, possessing the wonders of self-healing and regeneration."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"When I use the demonic tendons to contaminate another's blood qi, I am actually using my own 'weaving method' to forcibly overwrite and rewrite the structure of the other person's blood qi - this is 'Demonic Contamination'!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">A wave of joy surged in Ning Zhuo’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He had pushed aside another layer of mist, seeing more of the true face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Grasping analogies and achieving mastery through comprehensive understanding - this was precisely one of the joys of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">After his daily homework ended, Ning Zhuo communicated with Sun Lingtong through Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Boss, I gained quite a few insights from my cultivation today." He explained his progress to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong giggled and also explained his own recent insights from attacking the water formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The two exchanged ideas for a while, both sensing that they benefited greatly from each other and made huge progress, feeling happy for one another from the bottom of their hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I’ve already fully comprehended the water formation surrounding the Luo Shu, and I’ve thought of a method to unravel it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Relying on me alone won't work."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Little Zhuo, you and I need to act together to safely dismantle it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ever since Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong secretly explored the Rinse Jade Studio and discovered the page of the Dao Artifact Luo Shu hidden within, Sun Lingtong had been studying the water formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Now, he finally saw the finish line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo rejoiced: "That’s great. Boss, what should I do? I’ll listen to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong: "Hehe. In fact, you are the main force. You need to face the formation itself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Little Zhuo, your Five Elements realm is far deeper than mine; you need to use water to control water."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo didn't quite understand yet: "Oh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Sun Lingtong added: "But how to control water will test your formation deployment abilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo frowned: "In this aspect, Boss, can't you take action?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In the Rinse Jade Studio, Sun Lingtong shook his head slightly: "Difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"The water formation changes at any moment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Once the Luo Shu moves, the changes in the water formation will be even more drastic. And we happen to be trying to extract the Luo Shu from the center of the water formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Of course I can guide you, but there simply won't be enough time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Little Zhuo, acting as the main force, you need to calculate the changes in the water formation within a single breath, and then counter them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"So, this requires your ability in formation deployment to be at least on par with mine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo: "Boss, I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Then I'll arrange more time to spend on studying formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"But I don't have time recently. I have to immediately set out to participate in the Demon Subjugation Hall's second minor trial, and I have to go all out - it would be best to take first place!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Sun Lingtong: "Hehe. I've already thought of two methods so we can advance side by side."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"First, rely on your learning. I can help you purchase some Demonic Cultivator souls to accumulate a foundation in related formation deployment for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Second, rely on the Dao-Bearing Jade Page We already have the refining method for the Dao-Bearing Jade Page You refine some, and I will pour my understanding of the Dao of Formations into them. Then you can absorb it, and your realm in the Dao of Formations will rise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">By doing this, Sun Lingtong's realm in the Dao of Formations would drop as a result. He would have to rise back up through study and contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo was not polite about this, even eager to try: "Using the Dao-Bearing Jade Page might be more convenient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">His relationship with Sun Lingtong was too close; they barely distinguished between each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In fact, his previous plotting for the Dao-Bearing Jade Page was intended so that he could use his powerful learning ability to raise his realm and then help Sun Lingtong improve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">It was precisely the early learner driving the later learner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Now, it was just Sun Lingtong giving his realm of the Dao of Formations to Ning Zhuo first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo: "It's just that refining the Dao-Bearing Jade Page takes quite a bit of effort. Purchasing the related materials also takes time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Sun Lingtong: "The cultivators who reached the ninth chapter aren't just you, Little Zhuo. Aren't there a few others?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Let Old Chef make an appearance and contact those few to see if we can purchase them for a heavy price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo nodded, agreeing with this method very much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He didn't lack money right now, but he severely lacked time. If money could solve this problem, that would be ideal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"However, right now is the period of the Rising Clouds Minor Trial. Opportunities are everywhere. Will cultivators disregard these to make paper for someone else?" Ning Zhuo found it hard to estimate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Sun Lingtong shrugged, unconcerned: "Let's try and see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Mn." Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The two settled the plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The Dao Artifact Luo Shu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Even just one page was of extraordinary value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Everyone who used it said it was good!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had repeatedly mooched off it, and every time they had to give a thumbs up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Truly retrieving the Luo Shu would inevitably cause the calculation abilities of Sun and Ning to skyrocket, and it would also mean securing the prize.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Leaving it in the Rinse Jade Studio like this was very unsafe!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo continued to rest and reorganize, while Sun Lingtong disguised his identity and went to the black market in the mountain cave once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">When the gray-robed cultivator saw Sun Lingtong, his body and mind trembled, and he greeted him while bracing himself: "Elder Sun, y-you've come."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Sun Lingtong laughed secretly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">He and Ning Zhuo had discussed it long ago; knowing the inside story regarding Qin De, they were well aware that the gray-robed cultivator could not fulfill the previous agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">But Sun Lingtong feigned ignorance and said with a face full of anticipation: "I'm here! Having given you so much time, you should have succeeded, right? Where are the goods? Let me see them, quick!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"This, this…" The gray-robed cultivator was extremely awkward, his tone hesitant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Sun Lingtong's expression changed instantly, his gaze and tone becoming sharp: "Fellow Daoist, don't tell me you failed again? Or do you want to raise the price at the last minute?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"You must know, we signed a Divine Contract."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">A Divine Contract!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The moment the gray-robed cultivator thought of this, his scalp went numb. He already felt ten thousand regrets regarding that decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">He originally thought he could get his hands on Qin De's soul, but unexpectedly, despite going all out, he hadn't seen a single opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">He blew it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">He had completely botched this business deal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Now that the buyer had come knocking, the gray-robed cultivator could only smile bitterly and brace himself to explain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Sun Lingtong listened halfway, then waved his hand directly: "These are all excuses! I won't listen, I just want the goods!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"You aren't stringing this old man along, are you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">"This old man only wants the goods!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">"Just bring them out!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"If you can't bring them out, heh heh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Sun Lingtong's sneering voice made the gray-robed cultivator's heart tremble, and beads of fine sweat seeped from his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">"How was I to know the situation would be like this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">"I know now, the water here is very deep."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">"Elder Sun, you didn't set a trap for me knowing this situation, did you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Sun Lingtong immediately sneered: "Clearly you broke the contract first, yet you make a counter-accusation against me. Good, good, good! Since this deal is blown, have you thought about how to deal with the backlash of the Divine Contract?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">"Don't, don't, don't. We can talk this out, Elder Sun!" The gray-robed cultivator’s defense collapsed instantly, and he begged for mercy directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">As long as Sun Lingtong agreed to dissolve the contract, he wouldn't suffer the Divine Contract's backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Sun Lingtong glared, his attitude extremely firm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Dissolve it?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Dream on!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">The gray-robed cultivator's heart sank to the bottom of the valley, but he was prepared. Enduring the heartache, he gritted his teeth and said: "Elder Sun, don't be in a rush to refuse. I have good stuff to compensate you with!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
