<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the next moment, Zhu Xuanji saw the past of the third Golden Furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The door of the furnace was wide open, and a mysterious cultivator stood before it, holding a scythe, throwing the corpses of demon beasts and cultivators into the furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The number of corpses was so overwhelming that Zhu Xuanji squinted slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">A headless cultivator's body was taken out from a corpse bag. From his fingers, a jade thumb ring slipped and fell onto the floor tiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The mysterious cultivator moved his wrist slightly, using the end of the scythe's handle to pick up the jade thumb ring artifact, then raised his arm and sent the handle into the golden furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The interior of the golden furnace was almost full, but after the scythe handle was inserted, it created a bit more space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">When the mysterious cultivator retrieved the handle, the jade thumb ring artifact was gone, left inside the golden furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">It wasn't just this one artifact; Zhu Xuanji had already seen that many artifacts and robes on the cultivators were not removed and were thrown into the golden furnace together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Finally, the mysterious cultivator also placed the scythe into the golden furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The fire ignited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The golden furnace burned fiercely, conducting a melting process that exhausted its foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The melting process ended quickly, the flames extinguished, and the golden furnace was covered with pitch-black cracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In the next moment, the golden furnace shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">A mechanical black snake raised its massive head amidst the debris and smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It affectionately slithered towards the mysterious cultivator, who raised his head and stroked the mechanical black snake's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"It's Zheng Danlian's Night Rain Demon Weapon!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zhu Xuanji's heart pounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Who is this mysterious cultivator?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">His eyes shone with golden light, reaching an extreme intensity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The mysterious cultivator's vague appearance gradually blurred, leaving only a rough humanoid outline, within which a massive purple light trace was revealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The purple trace resembled the shape of a sea cucumber, emitting an eerie purple glow. The light trace was full, with countless protrusions on its surface, resembling the plump body of an insect or newly grown tentacles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">A strong purple aura penetrated, even reversing into Zhu Xuanji's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zhu Xuanji quickly closed his eyes, golden light spilling from beneath his eyelids.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After a while, he managed to dispel the traces of purple from his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Upon reopening his eyes, Zhu Xuanji's expression changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Who is this mysterious cultivator? Could it be Zheng Danlian?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhu Xuanji immediately recalled a conversation with Zheng Shuangjunâ€”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zheng Shuangjun: "About eight years ago, my clan brother, while entering the Immortal Palace, killed a Foundation Establishment cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"At that time, this Foundation Establishment cultivator, wielding a mechanical scythe, went on a rampage, indiscriminately slaughtering innocent cultivators. My clan brother couldn't stand by and uphold justice, striking him down on the spot, thus obtaining a damaged mechanical demon weapon and a complete mechanical blueprint."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zhu Xuanji had already seen that mechanical blueprint but couldn't understand the structure of the Night Rain Demon Weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">However, following the blueprint step by step, it was indeed possible to craft such a Night Rain Demon Weapon!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The mechanical scythe forged from the golden furnace should be the one Zheng Danlian held. It was once complete, so why was it later damaged? What happened in between? Is it truly as Zheng Shuangjun said?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Or is this just a carefully arranged play by the Zheng family? In fact, they had already forged this mechanical scythe?" Zhu Xuanji did not proceed with further deductions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He lacked more information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He discovered an important clue, but it brought more mysteries along with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zhu Xuanji began to move, running and constantly shuttling through the Secret Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He had now recovered to the Golden Core stage, and the arrangements in the Secret Pavilion were no longer a challenge, easily swept aside by him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Previously, Zhu Xuanji might have warned Zheng Danlian, but now, he wouldn't do so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Judging from the results before and after the golden furnace's forging, this Night Rain Demon Weapon is quite sinister, capable of devouring other corpses to enhance itself. Perhaps, the Night Rain Demon Weapon that Zheng Danlian later refined also grew stronger by slaying numerous enemies!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Under my Heaven-Piercing Eyes, the mysterious cultivator still hides his true face, revealing only a purple light trace. The purple light trace is not simple at all. What is its origin, that it can even erode my golden eyes! Fortunately, it's just a few strands of purple..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At this moment, Song Fuli suddenly appeared within Zhu Xuanji's divine sense range.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Song Fuli quickly approached Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Separated by several Secret Pavilions, Zhu Xuanji communicated through divine sense: "Song Fuli, stop there. If you proceed further, I'll consider you an enemy to be dealt with."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Song Fuli hurriedly said, "Lord Zhu, I am a friend, not a foe! The Night Rain Demon Weapon is too fierce, and I bring you firsthand information. I just want to find out where Sun Lingtong is."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"He is the one who stole my treasure, and I want to retrieve what was taken from me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhu Xuanji received Song Fuli's information, pointing out that Rudie Niang had already appeared and activated the Curved Light Weaving Formation. However, a small shift had already occurred, and Zhu Xuanji was unsure which Secret Pavilion the previous battle took place in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">His divine sense expanded, covering many square Secret Pavilions, but he could only detect the presence of cultivators within them, unable to penetrate inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Like Song Fuli, who hid his presence, Zhu Xuanji hadn't detected him before. It was only when Song Fuli exposed himself that Zhu Xuanji immediately noticed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's vision differed from that of the cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">It could see the internal scenes within the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities clearly and thoroughly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Ning Zhuo has moved! He's heading straight for Meng Chong. Damn it, damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Its speech quickened, urging Meng Chong to move faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">If it were divine thought, it couldn't expand outward. Qi Refining cultivators had to press jade slips against their foreheads to browse them. But now, Ning Zhuo had advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage, possessing divine sense, naturally able to observe external situations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator and Zheng Danlian formally converged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Song Fuli distanced himself from Zhu Xuanji, indicating his stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhu Xuanji headed towards the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator and Zheng Danlian!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo, under the cover of the Cloud Concealment Bud, pursued Meng Chong with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Electric light crackled, emitting a buzzing hum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">This time, there was no sound of mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">After the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities was opened, it created a barrier for the main hall, also affecting the small shift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Another small shift arrived even faster than the last one!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Thirty-six door attempts were not enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Song Fuli, Ning Zhuo, and Meng Chong rushed forward, exhausting most of their energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhu Xuanji, the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator, and Zheng Danlian were just one room away from encountering each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Another small shift once again pulled everyone apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Just three more Secret Pavilions to go." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so angry it slammed its fist on the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Smack! Smack! Smack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The speed of the flaming whip behind it was so fast that it created afterimages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was roused to ferocity, gritting its teeth, its eyes blazing with fire, remaining silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Outside Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">A Nascent Soul cultivator from the Great Purity Palace cursed angrily, "Meng Hu, don't push your luck!" Saying this, he took out a shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The shield was thin, yet it strangely withstood Meng Hu's powerful strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Recognizing the familiar pattern, Meng Hu spoke in surprise, "Night Rain Demon Weapon?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Nascent Soul cultivator from the Great Purity Palace sneered, "This is the Thin Fate Shield. If you can break this shield, I will retreat without hesitation." Meng Hu was provoked, attacking with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">However, no matter how he attacked, he couldn't break the thin shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Instead, his entire body was covered in purple wounds. This was the result of the Thin Fate Shield's counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"How about it?" The Nascent Soul cultivator from the Great Purity Palace smiled with his head held high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Nothing much!" Meng Hu spat out a mouthful of blood and charged again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Nascent Soul cultivator from the Great Purity Palace's face turned grim, and he had to send a message out: "The Meng family is determined to seize the Lava Immortal Palace, secretly dispatching Meng Hu for support. They ignore my explanations, truly wanting to isolate my Great Purity Palace. Such urgent actions further indicate that the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace has reached its final stage. You all go into the Immortal Palace and strive for the position of Palace Master with all your might!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Great Purity Palace had five people on this mission. Besides the Nascent Soul cultivator, there were two Golden Core cultivators and two Foundation Establishment followers of the Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Upon hearing the leader's order, the two Golden Core cultivators from the Great Purity Palace immediately took action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">They simultaneously took out black clothing, put it on, and disguised themselves as two shadow demon cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The two concealed their forms and rushed towards the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Inside the inner circle of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Scarlet flame beasts gathered in groups, like a flood breaking through a dam, breaching multiple gaps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Cultivators suffered heavy casualties but continued to resist with all their might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Sun Lingtong ignored this; he had obtained the latest information, knowing that the restrictions of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities had weakened significantly, allowing Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators to enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"I must go back!" Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth, his gaze firm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Yang Chanyu looked at him in astonishment, "Are you crazy? The front lines are shrinking, and there are many Golden Core cultivators active in the inner map. If we show ourselves, we'll surely trigger an encirclement. You've already been eliminated, so why go back?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong shook his head, "I must go back. Yang Chanyu... take care of yourself. If things look bad, retreat first!" After speaking, Sun Lingtong concealed himself and quietly sneaked towards the main hall of the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Hmph, wait." Yang Chanyu stopped him, "We've already fought to this extent, I'll go back with you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"What?" Sun Lingtong was surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Yang Chanyu snorted coldly, "Don't use invisibility techniques. If discovered, it's very easy to fall into a desperate situation. Use this instead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Sun Lingtong saw the clothing Yang Chanyu took out and immediately gave a thumbs up, "Great idea!" The two of them dressed up, becoming two shadow demon cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Elsewhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Clan brother, I'm going to act. I'll leave the Zhou family cultivators to you." Zhou Nongying transmitted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Another Golden Core ancestor of the Zhou family nodded slightly, "Rest assured and go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Thus, Zhou Nongying took out a set of black clothing, dressed himself, and became a shadow demon cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sometimes, pretending to be a demonic cultivator is the most convenient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">A righteous identity often becomes a hindrance in many critical moments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Finally, it's my turn to appear!" Luo Shang boldly charged into the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The beast tide was cleaved open by his Golden Core-level ghost general, creating a clear path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Luo Shang entered the inner circle of the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Then, he saw nearly ten shadow demon cultivators appearing one after another!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"What is going on?!" Luo Shang was shocked, "Has pretending to be a shadow demon cultivator become a trend now?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
