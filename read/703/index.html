<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Chu Xuangui finally breathed a sigh of relief when Ning Zhuo arrived at the summit of Inkdot Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Instead of immediately starting the test, he filled the blank space on the Xuan paper before him with ink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">After practicing on the paper, he slowly raised his head to address the dozens of cultivators gathered at the summit. With solemnity, he declared, "The time has come. Begin the test."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He pointed a finger skyward, and spiritual energy coalesced into the test question: Using talisman-making techniques, write the Primer for Young Scholars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The moment the question was announced, the cultivators exchanged bewildered glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">How bizarre!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This test format was completely different from previous years!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The question itself was utterly peculiar, requiring them to write a Confucian classic using the brushstrokes and techniques of talisman-making.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Primer for Young Scholars was not a profound text; on the contrary, its content was remarkably simple. The term "蒙童" (mengtong) referred to young children, and the book was designed as an introductory text for childhood education.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">It served as a primer on calligraphic fonts, covering four of the five major scripts: Clerical Script, Regular Script, Running Script, and Cursive Script. Seal Script, deemed too difficult for beginners, had been deliberately omitted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">These five major scripts formed the core of calligraphy and were used for writing various Confucian classics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Talisman-making emphasized spellcasting, demanding precise control over every brushstroke, pause, and detail. It required careful selection of Talisman Paper and ink, and reflected the cultivator's understanding of spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Stroke style?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">I've never considered that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">As long as the talisman works, it's considered a success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Why use talisman-making strokes to write Confucian texts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"What exactly is Mr. Chu Xuangui testing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"What font is used in talisman-making? I've cultivated for decades and never once pondered this question."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">These were two unrelated matters. For a moment, the cultivators couldn't fathom why Chu Xuangui would link them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Bai Jiyun, a prominent Foundation Establishment Confucian cultivator from the Flying Cloud Kingdom, was known for his travels and appreciation of scenic beauty, making him a well-traveled and knowledgeable figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Even he felt puzzled. "Legend has it that Ancestor Cang created Seal Script by drawing inspiration from talisman collections. Yet the Primer for Young Scholars specifically excludes Seal Script."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Liu Fushu, who deeply admired Chu Xuangui, thought to himself, "Mr. Chu's actions must have profound meaning. It's just that my dull mind can't grasp it immediately."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Chu Xuangui surveyed the crowd, taking in their bewildered expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">This reaction was precisely what he had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">It was natural for them to be confused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The true purpose behind Chu Xuangui's peculiar question was to bring Ning Zhuo to the forefront.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Without waiting for the cultivators to ponder further, Chu Xuangui retrieved a writing brush from his sleeve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He channeled spiritual energy to levitate the brush above the crowd, showcasing it for all to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"The victor of this Flying Cloud Minor Trial will receive this Intentional Brush."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo raised an eyebrow slightly. "A magic treasure?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He was genuinely surprised. He hadn't expected such a significant reward for a mere Flying Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The cultivators around him erupted into a frenzy of excited chatter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Heavens! Am I seeing things? Is that really an Intentional Brush?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"What's going on with this trial today? Why would Mr. Chu offer such a prize?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Crafting an Intentional Brush is no easy feat. Just obtaining the primary material, River Luo Jade, requires enduring a Thunder Tribulation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"That's just the beginning! This brush is a magic treasure, meaning it must have weathered at least three Calamities!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"The primary material is usually River Luo Jade. Surviving the Thunder Tribulation means passing the Heavenly Tribulation. But the Earthly and Human Tribulations still need to be overcome. Otherwise, it couldn't reach such a high level!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo remained silent, listening to the cultivators' discussion. He suddenly realized he had underestimated the brush's significance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Bai Jiyun narrowed his eyes, already understanding. "This Flying Cloud Minor Trial is no ordinary event. Offering an Intentional Brush... I fear those Golden Core Stage seniors will regret missing this opportunity for the rest of their lives."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Flying Cloud Minor Trial had always been a modest affair. The Confucian cultivator community had long maintained a low profile within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, and the rewards had never been so substantial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"It's easy to imagine how news of this trial will spread like wildfire throughout the sect and beyond."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Liu Fushu was the most excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He stared intently at the Intentional Brush hovering in mid-air, his fists clenched, his breathing growing heavy, and faint bloodshot streaks appearing in his eyes. "Legend has it that the number of Intentional Brushes is limited."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"When cultivators use these precious brushes to copy texts or calligraphy, they can grasp the author's profound intent. Over time, this accumulated understanding can elevate their cultivation realm in specific areas!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"These brushes are true treasures of cultivation. This one isn't just a Magic Artifact - it's a magic treasure! For most cultivators, it could serve them for a lifetime!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Precisely because these magic treasures can enhance cultivation realms and rapidly cultivate experts, they defy the natural order."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"The total number of Intentional Brushes in the world has never exceeded ten thousand! Each subsequent brush forged invites calamity. Only by overcoming these trials can the forging succeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Moreover, the difficulty of crafting each Intentional Brush grows exponentially."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Liu Fushu was a master calligrapher, intimately familiar with the world's most renowned brushes. Among the Thirty-Six Great Spirit Brushes, the All-Mysteries Comprehension Brush ranked twenty-seventh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Thirty-Six Great Spirit Brushes were the most celebrated treasures in the history of the cultivation world, each of Spirit Treasure grade or higher!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Every Intentional Brush in existence was crafted in imitation of the All-Mysteries Comprehension Brush. Though mere imitations, their scarcity made them exceedingly rare and precious. Any Confucian Scholar who had the chance would pursue one with all their might!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Kong Ran's eyes blazed with fervor, his chest heaving as his breath quickened. "A treasure! What a treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect was the right decision after all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Many have said I have an affinity for Confucianism, urging me to specialize in the Confucian path. Now it seems this brush was waiting for me here. Could this be the arrangement of fate?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Though young, Kong Ran possessed a mature mind. Despite his limited experience compared to others, he understood the political significance of the Intentional Brush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"This magic treasure is primarily used for daily cultivation, yet its value far surpasses ordinary combat treasures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"There's likely only one such brush in the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Whoever obtains it will undoubtedly be recognized as a promising newcomer among the sect's Confucian cultivators!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"If I get this brush, I'll have a significant head start right from the beginning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"No, not just a head start - it'll be several times ahead, several times ahead!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Chu Xuangui smiled inwardly as he observed the shifting expressions of the crowd, their minds completely captivated by the precious treasure he had revealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He then formed a sword-like gesture with his fingers, channeled his spiritual energy, and conjured a series of characters in mid-air: eighty-eight Eternal Characters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Imitate these characters using the Primer for Young Scholars I provided. The fastest and most accurate will be judged superior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"However, any mistake will invalidate your entire attempt. You must restart from the first character of that section."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Having swiftly explained the rules, Chu Xuangui didn't wait for questions. He immediately declared, "The Inkdot Peak Flying Cloud Minor Trial officially begins now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">No sooner had the words left Chu Xuangui's mouth than Ning Zhuo acted first, channeling his spiritual energy to conjure characters in the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The other cultivators jolted into action, immediately following suit, eager to compete.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Though they started almost simultaneously, within a dozen breaths, one cultivator surged ahead, his lead rapidly widening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">It was Liu Fushu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Born into poverty, this young cultivator had diligently practiced calligraphy since childhood, mastering the art. His exceptional skill had earned him considerable renown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The first chapter of the Primer for Young Scholars was the "Song of the Eight Virtues of the Eternal Character."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">In calligraphy, the Eternal Character is fundamental.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The "Song of the Eight Virtues of the Eternal Character" not only elucidates the essential strokes of the character but also embodies Confucian principles:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">A dot like the first stirrings of benevolence,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Two horizontal strokes like the righteous sword that pacifies borders,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Three vertical strokes like the staff of Rites that supports the heavens,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Four hooks like the blade of wisdom that turns back upon itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Primer for Young Scholars was widely circulated throughout the cultivation world, studied by nearly every child learning to write.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Liu Fushu completed the eighty-eight Eternal Characters first, barely breaking a sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Seeing this, Chu Xuangui immediately extended another finger, channeling his spiritual energy to write a poem in Clerical Script in the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Primer for Young Scholars consisted entirely of eighty-eight Eternal Characters, followed by twenty-two poems each in Clerical Script, Regular Script, Running Script, and Cursive Script. Each poem was not only melodious and easy to recite but also served as an excellent calligraphy practice piece.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The poem Chu Xuangui had written was the third poem in the Clerical Script section:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Silkworm's head opens, embracing sea and mulberry,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Swallows tailor clouds, their hidden rhymes profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Stone gates stand wide, guarding dragon and elephant,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Bamboo and silk record the Way's eternal sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Liu Fushu knew this poem by heart. He glanced at it once before burying his head in his writing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He was about to surge forward when he made a mistake on the third character, its strokes deviating from the standard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He had to start over from the beginning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Soon, he erred again on the seventh character, forcing him to restart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Then, he stumbled on the fifth character.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Three consecutive mistakes trapped him on the first line, preventing him from progressing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Liu Fushu stared in disbelief, utterly stunned by what was happening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"W-what's wrong with me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Is this still me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Am I just too nervous?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Chu Xuangui observed the scene with keen eyes. Deep within his gaze, a fleeting glint of calculation flashed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This was exactly as he had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Primer for Young Scholars was widely disseminated, and virtually every child with access to schooling practiced it extensively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Liu Fushu was no exception. His exceptional calligraphy skills were undoubtedly the result of countless hours of dedicated practice and painstaking effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Each time he practiced the Primer, he strove to perfectly replicate the requirements of each font and poem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">For him, these verses were not merely memorized; he could write them fluently in reverse. He could write these characters with his eyes closed, the strokes so deeply ingrained in his bones that they had become instinct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">But now, Chu Xuangui's exam required them to write the Primer using the techniques of talisman-making.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">This posed an immense challenge for those who had diligently practiced the traditional methods!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Liu Fushu had ingrained the writing of these verses into his very being. The stronger his instinctive muscle memory, the greater the difficulty he now faced in resisting it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Moreover, Chu Xuangui had revealed the Intentional Brush before the exam began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">This magic treasure-level reward was so significant that it drove the Confucian cultivators into a frenzy of competition, each fearing to fall behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Under such pressure, Liu Fushu, a young scholar from humble origins, would inevitably suffer from anxiety, disrupting his mental equilibrium and making errors more likely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Chu Xuangui scanned the crowd, secretly observing Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Hmm, not bad," he murmured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo's speed was impressive, placing him among the top five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Wen Ruanyu had shared some intelligence about Ning Zhuo with his fellow Confucian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Thus, Chu Xuangui knew that Ning Zhuo excelled at talisman-making more than calligraphy. The latter knew little about Confucian cultivators and likely didn't grasp the profound significance of the Intentional Brush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">This ignorance would help Ning Zhuo maintain a calm and ordinary demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo needed to remain composed to avoid revealing any flaws in his performance. This would allow the Confucian cultivators to elevate him to higher positions without raising suspicion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">If suspicion arose, not only would the Confucian cultivators face criticism, but their entire plan to assist Ning Zhuo would fail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Therefore, the Confucian cultivators had deliberately withheld their specific strategies from Ning Zhuo. Firstly, they feared his youth might lead to a poor performance, believing it better for him to act naturally. Secondly, any prior communication or scheming could leave behind incriminating evidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Should such evidence be discovered by someone with ulterior motives, it would plunge both the Confucian cultivators and Ning Zhuo into immense trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Given the stakes involving the White Paper Immortal City's profits, this matter would undoubtedly attract intense scrutiny.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The safest approach for the Confucian cultivators was to avoid any contact with Ning Zhuo or prior communication, proceeding directly with the Flying Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">This would test the Confucian cultivators' ability to control the situation - precisely one of their greatest strengths!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The trial began anew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Liu Fushu scanned the scene, realizing he was already severely- </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"No, no, no! How could this be? I should be far ahead!" Liu Fushu grew increasingly agitated, his eyes bloodshot, his expression rigid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The top three positions had remained stable for some time: Bai Jiyun, Kong Ran, and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Ning Zhuo is in third place... It's only natural that he lags behind the top two," Chu Xuangui mused inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He had a thorough understanding of Bai Jiyun, Kong Ran, and Liu Fushu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">At each Flying Cloud Assembly, various organizations and factions within the Myriad Manifestations Sect actively recruited fresh talent. The Confucian cultivator groups were no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">They secretly monitored promising newcomers, investing considerable time and effort in observing them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Chu Xuangui remained unhurried, confident that everything was under his control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">In the next moment, he conjured another poem in the air:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Wisp-Tied Peaks, a lingering grace,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Sweeping strokes, dew-kissed embrace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Dry and moist in spring's gentle rain,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Brush breaks, yet mountains rise again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">While Liu Fushu was still writing the previous poem in Clerical Script, this new verse was composed in Running Script.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Many cultivators were momentarily stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">According to the established order, Clerical Script should be followed by Regular Script, then Running Script, and finally Cursive Script.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Yet Chu Xuangui had abruptly skipped Regular Script, moving directly to the Running Script section.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Excellent! Now we're getting to my specialty," Bai Jiyun exclaimed, his spirits lifting. Running Script was his favorite font. At this point, he still failed to grasp the gravity of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Sure enough, he made his first mistake on the eleventh character.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Writing too smoothly, he unconsciously slipped into the style of Running Script.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Forced to start over, he stumbled again, and again, and again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Bai Jiyun became a mirror image of Liu Fushu's earlier struggles, his rank plummeting from first place due to repeated errors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"How could this be happening?" The once-composed and dashing Bai Jiyun now stood dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
