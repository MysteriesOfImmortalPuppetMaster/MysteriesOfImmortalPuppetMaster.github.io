<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ten Thousand Li Flying Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Sun Lingtong sat in the dragon's head cabin, observing the scene before him and activating his talent, his pair of spirit eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Ten Thousand Li Flying Dragon was penetrating through void space!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The surroundings were almost completely dark and dim. Silver lines streaked through the black curtain, shuttling straight past the Flying Dragon's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The silver lines were sometimes sparse, sometimes dense, and occasionally blocks of concentrated silver light would appear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This was the typical scene when Nascent Soul cultivators traversed void space. The Ten Thousand Li Flying Dragon was a Nascent Soul-level mechanism, with its main purpose being rapid travel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">However, without a Nascent Soul driving it, using the void-crossing ability this time would greatly deplete the fire essence, making it very costly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">For Sun and Ning's financial situation, it was like taking a heavy blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lingtong seized the opportunity to observe carefully, wanting to fully experience the void-crossing process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"This is a treatment only Nascent Soul leve cultivators get to experience. Being able to experience it at the Foundation Establishment stage will greatly benefit my future breakthrough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"It's a pity that Little Zhuo couldn't come, as he was in a hurry to treat his mother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Sun Lingtong felt regretful for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After leaving the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, the latter had eagerly entered the refining cabin and began the Fire Foundation Embryonic Breathing boat ritual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo held the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat in his hand and examined it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat could be either large or small. At this moment, it was minimized to its smallest size, like a model in Ning Zhuo's hand, very lightweight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Only when restored to its true size could it be used, and its weight would also be restored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo needed to use fire now, but there was no need to restore it - he could directly burn this small version.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Good boat, good boat." Ning Zhuo praised after just a brief glance at the small boat in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat appeared like a black yacht, its hull carefully carved from thousand-year spiritual wood. The wood was thick and sturdy, emanating a faint spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The entire spiritual vessel was streamlined, with a long and slender hull, slightly raised bottom, and somewhat rounded stern, full of spiritual and leisurely energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Both sides of the boat had exquisite carvings, with complex yet fluid patterns depicting natural scenes like mountains, rivers, cranes, pine and cypress trees, and celestial bodies, symbolizing the essence of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The boat's sail was woven from soft spiritual gauze, with a slightly arched top, the sail fabric gleaming with a gentle luster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Several small spiritual lamps hung on both sides of the sail, appearing delicate and elegant at this time, emanating dao rhythms as they swayed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo could see part of the boat's cabin interior. The cabin floor was covered with straw mats, and the four walls were painted with talismans. A small jade wind chime hung from the black ceiling, its clear tinkling barely audible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">After seeing this boat, Sun Lingtong had advised Ning Zhuo to use it for himself first. This spiritual vessel, as a treasured inheritance of the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, could help cultivators enter the embryonic breathing state and rapidly increase their spiritual sea cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">This would have been equally beneficial for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">But Ning Zhuo, concerned about his mother, didn't take this advice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Just as he had expressed to Zhu Xuanji - for the sake of saving his mother, he would sacrifice everything!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Fire Path Prajna Spirit-Resolving Scripture!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The flames blazed up, though extremely fierce, they were completely silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Tongues of fire swayed in the air, sometimes shooting up rapidly, sometimes swaying gently, as if an invisible hand was directing them. The dance of the flames was gentle yet elegant, filled with Buddhist halos, revealing the profound mysteries between life and death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">As Ning Zhuo performed the Fire Path Prajna Spirit-Resolving Scripture this time, he suddenly felt a stirring in his heart, gaining a completely new insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Following this insight, his fingers moved slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The flames became even gentler, their edges as light as gauze and as flowing as water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">While inside the flames, it became increasingly scorching and fierce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This was because Ning Zhuo's fire realm had deepened, allowing him to perform the Fire Path Prajna Spirit-Resolving Scripture with greater mystical power and effectiveness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Though the Fire Path Prajna Spirit-Resolving Scripture was a Buddhist scripture, it also contained the dao and principles of the fire path, thus receiving enhancement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"What?!" Ning Zhuo's face showed surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Under the burning of the flames, the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat remained completely motionless!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Looking carefully, Ning Zhuo saw that although the spiritual boat was amidst the flames, it wasn't being consumed by the fire tongues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Instead, a thin, translucent embryonic membrane appeared around the spiritual vessel. This membrane appeared delicate but contained infinite power, like a tough barrier tightly wrapping the spiritual boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I haven't infused any spiritual power into this treasure, and I'm certain there's no residual power from others, so how is this defense being activated?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He increased the burning intensity, and the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat underwent another transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Spiritual light dispersed from the surface of the spiritual vessel, projecting onto the embryonic membrane, forming many characters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo carefully distinguished them and found it was a cultivation method called the Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"The embryo nurtures the spirit, and breathing nurtures the qi. Essence is like water, spirit is like the moon, the moon moves due to water waves, the spirit sways due to essence patterns. When water is still, the moon is bright; when essence is stable, the spirit is wise. When spirit and essence embrace, reaching great stability, the inner dan naturally forms, thus it is called embryonic breathing..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"All living things possess essence, and life resides within essence and blood. All sensations and movements of living things are the workings of essence and blood. Without essence, there can be no movement, becoming a dead thing. All spring contains spirit, spirit is consciousness, and nature is hidden within consciousness. Without consciousness to govern, it would be like wood and stone - what is that if not death? Thus know that what gives life to the human body is essence and spirit..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"When first learning to regulate breathing, one must imagine the qi exiting from the navel and entering through the navel, adjusting until extremely fine. Then, without using mouth or nose, breathe only through the navel, as if in the womb, thus called embryonic breathing. Initially hold one breath, breathing through the navel, count to eighty-one or one hundred and twenty, then exhale through the mouth, making it extremely fine - place a goose feather at the mouth and nose, exhaling so the feather doesn't move is the standard. Gradually practice to increase the count, eventually reaching thousands... then the old will become young again, returning one day at a time..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">After roughly reading through the entire "Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing," Ning Zhuo immediately understood why the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat couldn't be burned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"So it was my burning with flames that triggered the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, making it fight for survival by fully manifesting its magical restrictions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"These restrictions are the complete 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing,' which put the spiritual boat into an embryonic breathing state, able to absorb heaven and earth's essence to strengthen itself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The natural essence came in threads, though blocked by the flames' light speed, but looking carefully at the gathered embryonic membrane, it was colorful and radiant, containing the principles of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Though the embryonic membrane was just a thin layer, it had endless staying power. The spiritual boat in this state coexisted with heaven and earth, treating the cosmos as its mother's body and itself as the fetus within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">When Ning Zhuo tried to burn the spiritual boat, heaven and earth as the mother would naturally come to its aid, making the fire completely ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"What an impressive Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat. It seems frequent use has given it a thin spirituality, allowing it to spontaneously seek survival."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"The Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing... even the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect hadn't mastered this cultivation method."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Ten Thousand Medicines Sect obtained it before Lin Bufan's rise to power, but they never discovered the "Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing" through the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">They would never burn their own inherited treasure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Yet Ning Zhuo did exactly that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">And the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat had already developed some spirituality, transitioning from a magical treasure toward a spiritual treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"To completely burn this spiritual boat, I'll need to break through this state."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"And to accomplish this, I must master this 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing'!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">This was an unexpected gain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo studied this cultivation method again and confirmed this unexpected gain was quite significant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Though this method's level couldn't match the "Five Organs Temple Divine Art," in the present day, it definitely qualified as a first-rate cultivation method.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
