<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ten Thousand Li Flying Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sat in the dragon's head cabin, observing the scene before him and activating his talent, his pair of spirit eyes.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Li Flying Dragon was penetrating through void space!<br/>
<br/>
The surroundings were almost completely dark and dim. Silver lines streaked through the black curtain, shuttling straight past the Flying Dragon's body.<br/>
<br/>
The silver lines were sometimes sparse, sometimes dense, and occasionally blocks of concentrated silver light would appear.<br/>
<br/>
This was the typical scene when Nascent Soul cultivators traversed void space. The Ten Thousand Li Flying Dragon was a Nascent Soul-level mechanism, with its main purpose being rapid travel.<br/>
<br/>
However, without a Nascent Soul driving it, using the void-crossing ability this time would greatly deplete the fire essence, making it very costly.<br/>
<br/>
For Sun and Ning's financial situation, it was like taking a heavy blow.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong seized the opportunity to observe carefully, wanting to fully experience the void-crossing process.<br/>
<br/>
"This is a treatment only Nascent Soul leve cultivators get to experience. Being able to experience it at the Foundation Establishment stage will greatly benefit my future breakthrough."<br/>
<br/>
"It's a pity that Little Zhuo couldn't come, as he was in a hurry to treat his mother."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt regretful for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
After leaving the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, the latter had eagerly entered the refining cabin and began the Fire Foundation Embryonic Breathing boat ritual.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo held the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat in his hand and examined it.<br/>
<br/>
The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat could be either large or small. At this moment, it was minimized to its smallest size, like a model in Ning Zhuo's hand, very lightweight.<br/>
<br/>
Only when restored to its true size could it be used, and its weight would also be restored.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo needed to use fire now, but there was no need to restore it - he could directly burn this small version.<br/>
<br/>
"Good boat, good boat." Ning Zhuo praised after just a brief glance at the small boat in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat appeared like a black yacht, its hull carefully carved from thousand-year spiritual wood. The wood was thick and sturdy, emanating a faint spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
The entire spiritual vessel was streamlined, with a long and slender hull, slightly raised bottom, and somewhat rounded stern, full of spiritual and leisurely energy.<br/>
<br/>
Both sides of the boat had exquisite carvings, with complex yet fluid patterns depicting natural scenes like mountains, rivers, cranes, pine and cypress trees, and celestial bodies, symbolizing the essence of heaven and earth.<br/>
<br/>
The boat's sail was woven from soft spiritual gauze, with a slightly arched top, the sail fabric gleaming with a gentle luster.<br/>
<br/>
Several small spiritual lamps hung on both sides of the sail, appearing delicate and elegant at this time, emanating dao rhythms as they swayed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could see part of the boat's cabin interior. The cabin floor was covered with straw mats, and the four walls were painted with talismans. A small jade wind chime hung from the black ceiling, its clear tinkling barely audible.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing this boat, Sun Lingtong had advised Ning Zhuo to use it for himself first. This spiritual vessel, as a treasured inheritance of the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, could help cultivators enter the embryonic breathing state and rapidly increase their spiritual sea cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
This would have been equally beneficial for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo, concerned about his mother, didn't take this advice.<br/>
<br/>
Just as he had expressed to Zhu Xuanji - for the sake of saving his mother, he would sacrifice everything!<br/>
<br/>
Fire Path Prajna Spirit-Resolving Scripture!<br/>
<br/>
The flames blazed up, though extremely fierce, they were completely silent.<br/>
<br/>
Tongues of fire swayed in the air, sometimes shooting up rapidly, sometimes swaying gently, as if an invisible hand was directing them. The dance of the flames was gentle yet elegant, filled with Buddhist halos, revealing the profound mysteries between life and death.<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo performed the Fire Path Prajna Spirit-Resolving Scripture this time, he suddenly felt a stirring in his heart, gaining a completely new insight.<br/>
<br/>
Following this insight, his fingers moved slightly.<br/>
<br/>
The flames became even gentler, their edges as light as gauze and as flowing as water.<br/>
<br/>
While inside the flames, it became increasingly scorching and fierce.<br/>
<br/>
This was because Ning Zhuo's fire realm had deepened, allowing him to perform the Fire Path Prajna Spirit-Resolving Scripture with greater mystical power and effectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
Though the Fire Path Prajna Spirit-Resolving Scripture was a Buddhist scripture, it also contained the dao and principles of the fire path, thus receiving enhancement.<br/>
<br/>
"What?!" Ning Zhuo's face showed surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Under the burning of the flames, the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat remained completely motionless!<br/>
<br/>
Looking carefully, Ning Zhuo saw that although the spiritual boat was amidst the flames, it wasn't being consumed by the fire tongues.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, a thin, translucent embryonic membrane appeared around the spiritual vessel. This membrane appeared delicate but contained infinite power, like a tough barrier tightly wrapping the spiritual boat.<br/>
<br/>
"I haven't infused any spiritual power into this treasure, and I'm certain there's no residual power from others, so how is this defense being activated?"<br/>
<br/>
He increased the burning intensity, and the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat underwent another transformation.<br/>
<br/>
Spiritual light dispersed from the surface of the spiritual vessel, projecting onto the embryonic membrane, forming many characters.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully distinguished them and found it was a cultivation method called the Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.<br/>
<br/>
"The embryo nurtures the spirit, and breathing nurtures the qi. Essence is like water, spirit is like the moon, the moon moves due to water waves, the spirit sways due to essence patterns. When water is still, the moon is bright; when essence is stable, the spirit is wise. When spirit and essence embrace, reaching great stability, the inner dan naturally forms, thus it is called embryonic breathing..."<br/>
<br/>
"All living things possess essence, and life resides within essence and blood. All sensations and movements of living things are the workings of essence and blood. Without essence, there can be no movement, becoming a dead thing. All spring contains spirit, spirit is consciousness, and nature is hidden within consciousness. Without consciousness to govern, it would be like wood and stone - what is that if not death? Thus know that what gives life to the human body is essence and spirit..."<br/>
<br/>
"When first learning to regulate breathing, one must imagine the qi exiting from the navel and entering through the navel, adjusting until extremely fine. Then, without using mouth or nose, breathe only through the navel, as if in the womb, thus called embryonic breathing. Initially hold one breath, breathing through the navel, count to eighty-one or one hundred and twenty, then exhale through the mouth, making it extremely fine - place a goose feather at the mouth and nose, exhaling so the feather doesn't move is the standard. Gradually practice to increase the count, eventually reaching thousands... then the old will become young again, returning one day at a time..."<br/>
<br/>
After roughly reading through the entire "Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing," Ning Zhuo immediately understood why the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat couldn't be burned.<br/>
<br/>
"So it was my burning with flames that triggered the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, making it fight for survival by fully manifesting its magical restrictions."<br/>
<br/>
"These restrictions are the complete 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing,' which put the spiritual boat into an embryonic breathing state, able to absorb heaven and earth's essence to strengthen itself."<br/>
<br/>
The natural essence came in threads, though blocked by the flames' light speed, but looking carefully at the gathered embryonic membrane, it was colorful and radiant, containing the principles of heaven and earth.<br/>
<br/>
Though the embryonic membrane was just a thin layer, it had endless staying power. The spiritual boat in this state coexisted with heaven and earth, treating the cosmos as its mother's body and itself as the fetus within.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo tried to burn the spiritual boat, heaven and earth as the mother would naturally come to its aid, making the fire completely ineffective.<br/>
<br/>
"What an impressive Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat. It seems frequent use has given it a thin spirituality, allowing it to spontaneously seek survival."<br/>
<br/>
"The Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing... even the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect hadn't mastered this cultivation method."<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Medicines Sect obtained it before Lin Bufan's rise to power, but they never discovered the "Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing" through the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.<br/>
<br/>
They would never burn their own inherited treasure!<br/>
<br/>
Yet Ning Zhuo did exactly that.<br/>
<br/>
And the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat had already developed some spirituality, transitioning from a magical treasure toward a spiritual treasure.<br/>
<br/>
"To completely burn this spiritual boat, I'll need to break through this state."<br/>
<br/>
"And to accomplish this, I must master this 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing'!"<br/>
<br/>
This was an unexpected gain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo studied this cultivation method again and confirmed this unexpected gain was quite significant.<br/>
<br/>
Though this method's level couldn't match the "Five Viscera Temple Spirit Technique," in the present day, it definitely qualified as a first-rate cultivation method.</div>
