<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 483.1: 2025, hello!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">I touched my forehead. I felt a slight fever, but it was much better than yesterday.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">At this turn of the year, I felt very happy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This year I started a new book, “Xian Gong Kai Wu.” (Mysteries of Immortal Puppet Master) I intended it as a transition, to fully master the techniques of film script and web novel creation by integrating them in practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">I never expected that upon starting a new book, it would attract everyone’s attention. The level of buzz in the web novel world was extremely rare!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">I knew it was because everyone was propping me up!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">A thousand words could not convey the gratitude in my heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">I was just a very ordinary person who had simply persisted in writing for more than ten years, always doing something I genuinely loved from the bottom of my heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">I was like an ostrich, immersed in a dreamworld of my own making — I only wanted to create, without caring about anything else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">That sweet dream was shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Actually, there had already been cracks for a while, but this year I was suddenly jolted awake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Therefore, I changed my attitude toward life. I decided to walk out of the valley in my heart and actively face the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Thanks to everyone’s favor, I experienced the most spectacular new-book launch in over a decade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Starting in April, I entered an unprecedented state of busyness. For a while, from morning until night, I was almost always typing, with only thirty minutes a day to go for a walk and enjoy the sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">I participated in the “Yue Jian Fei Yi” essay contest award ceremony. Fortunately, “Xian Gong Kai Wu” (Mysteries of Immortal Puppet Master) won an award and was added to the collection of the Shanghai Library.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">I participated in an international forum in Shanghai and met many authors and fans. Speaking of which, during the roundtable discussion, when the foreign authors praised my novel’s overseas edition of the same title, it actually felt a bit embarrassing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">At the end of this year, I was lucky enough to enter the Lu Xun Literature Academy —the highest hall of Chinese literature —for further study. I met many outstanding editors and authors and saw various teachers who enjoy State Council allowances, each standing at the pinnacle of the industry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">I was getting to know society and searching for opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">From the very beginning of my writing, I always insisted on finishing every book. Yet fate played tricks, and there were two books—or rather two trees—that had not truly grown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">I wanted to save these two trees!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">I also knew the hope was very slim, and I knew there was a huge possibility of failure. But if I did not give it my all, I could not let it go, and I could not provide any proper explanation to everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Stumbling along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">There were many oversights: for example, getting my Douyin live-stream banned, the slow distribution of gifts to thank my fans, and the unstable updates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">I needed time—truly needed time to adapt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Thank you all for your support and for patiently waiting. You have treated me so gently; how could I be content with the status quo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">2025!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">I had to work hard to make up the updates I owed everyone. The leave of absence in December, plus 2 chapters for Golden Alliance membership, plus a bunch from August.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">I had to find a way to steadily distribute the gifts to thank my fans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">I also had to continue streaming. Wherever I fell, I would get back up, using my own example to say—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Everyone, I am here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">I was still here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">I was still here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">I still remained here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Gritting my teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Bumping and crashing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Shambling forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">I would keep optimizing. At the moment, it was clear that the reading experience of Volume Two was noticeably better than Volume One. Especially in recent updates, I felt once again the sense I had when updating “Gu Zhenren.” (Reverend Insanity)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">It was quite evident that my strength was gradually recovering, and the integration of the two writing techniques in practice had already begun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">It was very difficult to adjust writing techniques, style, and so on. It required a lengthy period of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">I lacked talent; I was just a mortal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Perhaps the only thing I could rely on… was persistence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">I was someone who came into his own late. My writing always started slow and then soared higher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Every major climax in each volume of “Xian Gong Kai Wu” (Mysteries of Immortal Puppet Master) made me so excited that my eyes even turned red and I shed tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">That was my greatest repayment for everyone’s support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Time would be the best witness!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Another thing—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Lately, Qidian started an event called “War of the Gods,” which caused a big stir across the internet. Thanks to the great love and persistence of you readers, the ranking of “Xian Gong Kai Wu” (Mysteries of Immortal Puppet Master) was looking pretty good!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This situation reminded me of Qidian’s 515 Event back in 2018. The “Gu Xian” team broke through in fierce competition and ranked near the top, which could not help but stir a lot of emotion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">We in the past, we today, and we tomorrow would be stronger, only stronger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">And now, an even more precious ranking was right before my eyes. I had to consider whether this might be the only chance of my lifetime! So here I shamelessly ask for a round of votes, hoping everyone could cast more votes to support me! I wish that we could move one step further, achieve a satisfying result, and see that persistence truly paid off!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Another note —The January Monthly Ticket Raffle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Prize: A New Year’s celebratory set of merchandise (one set includes: one Ning Zhuo window decoration + one Fang Yuan window decoration + four Ning Zhuo red envelopes + four Fang Yuan red envelopes + one Ning Zhuo protective charm + one Fang Yuan protective charm)!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">I hope everyone would vote more!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">From January 1 to January 7 at 8:00 p.m., we would randomly draw one hundred lucky monthly ticket numbers from the monthly tickets received, and afterward I would publish a single chapter announcing the winning monthly ticket numbers (you can find the monthly ticket number in the monthly ticket interface, in the top right under “Monthly Ticket Album”).</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">[Participation Eligibility]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">During the period from January 1 to January 7 at 8:00 p.m., readers who cast monthly tickets were automatically entered, and all had a chance to win.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">[Drawing Method]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">On January 7 at 8:30 p.m., in the Gu Alliance group, we would live stream the drawing of the winning monthly ticket numbers, and then announce them in a single chapter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">[Redemption Method]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After I publish the chapter announcing the winning monthly ticket numbers, winners would present a screenshot of their monthly ticket stub and join the event group to contact the admins, verify their ticket, and claim their prize (the event group would be announced after the drawing, and there would be a link to join at the very bottom of the book’s description, one click to jump).</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">[Redemption Deadline]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">After the winning monthly ticket numbers were drawn on January 7 at 8:30 p.m., please join the group to verify and claim your prize before 8:00 p.m. on January 14. Failure to do so on time would be treated as forfeiture!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Note: You can find your monthly ticket number in the interface for casting monthly tickets, in the top right under “Monthly Ticket Album,” or in “My Account” — “Monthly Tickets” — “Monthly Ticket Album.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">This event is limited to the Qidian platform, and the final right of interpretation belongs to the author. Thank you for voting and for your support!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Finally—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Happy New Year to everyone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“May the wind and rain hold a thousand layers of meaning, time flow like a song, stars be like a dream, and the original aspiration remain, rising in splendor!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
