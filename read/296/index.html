<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo held a cup in his hand, took a light sip, and then smiled at the Ning family Clan Leader, "Clan Leader, don't you wish for your son to return to the family?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Ning family Clan Leader was taken aback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He never expected such words to come from Ning Zhuo's mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">After all, it was Ning Zhuo who had brought Ning Xiaoren down!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">According to the Clan Leader's understanding, Ning Zhuo should be extremely disdainful of Ning Xiaoren. How could he say such a thing?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Clan Leader was shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">At this moment, he suddenly saw a part of Ning Zhuo's true nature!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The young man before him was deeply rooted in the righteous path, just like himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">What kind of person was he?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Cold and ruthless! Placing interests above personal feelings!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Or rather, the emotions he displayed were merely masks, the most suitable disguises for his personal interests!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Clan Leader believed he had seen through Ning Zhuo's essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Thus, he showed an unprecedented solemn expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">For the first time, he treated Ning Zhuo as an equal and regarded him seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Xiaoren..." The Clan Leader mentioned his son, a gentle expression appearing on his face, "I do hope he can return. But how can I trust you to bring him back?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo remained expressionless, "Since I could bring him down, I can naturally bring him back." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Wasn't he trying to rely on me before?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"I can agree to this, let him work by my side. With my current status, it's not difficult to give him some tasks and credit." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Then, I will personally announce to everyone that Ning Xiaoren has turned over a new leaf and gained my forgiveness. Thus, his political blemishes will be washed away." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"See, what a perfect plan. Only I can achieve this." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"I believe this is also a scenario that Ning Jiufan would be pleased to see." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"After all, our branch and your main branch both bear the surname Ning; we're all one family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Hearing Ning Zhuo, who was fully committed to the separation of the family, say this, the Clan Leader sneered, "What shamelessness!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After pondering for a moment, the Clan Leader nodded heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Clan Leader left, leaving Ning Zhuo alone in the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Separation, separation..." He sighed deeply in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He always brought up this idea whenever there was a chance, and not just for fun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sects have soul lamps, countries have registries, alliances have covenants, and clans naturally have things to bind their members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">When a newborn in the family cries at birth, the cut umbilical cord is made into a bloodline artifact and sent to the ancestral hall for strict safekeeping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">After naming the child, blood from the heart, under the tongue, and the tip of the foot are used to form a name, inscribed in the family genealogy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">These were just two main conventional methods; there were more formidable binding methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Namely, the ancestors in the underworld!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This world is separated into the Yang World and the Yin World.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Yang World is where Ning Zhuo resides, with the sun rising and the moon setting — winds blowing and clouds moving — flowers, birds, insects, and fish. Full of life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Yin World, on the other hand, is filled with ghosts. It was gloomy and dark, with pervasive deathly energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The entrance and exit between the Yin and Yang Worlds is called the Ghost Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">People have yang lives and yin lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">According to the natural rules of this world, when cultivators and mortals die, their souls return to the Yin World, residing there for many days until their yin life is exhausted, marking their true demise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">To judge whether a family is a cultivation family, one must not only look at the scale and highest cultivation of the Yang World but also the scale and highest cultivation of ancestors in the Yin World.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Ning family is a genuine cultivation family, seemingly weak in the Yang World but strong in the Yin World.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This is because sixteen years ago, the Ning family migrated from the Northern Wind Kingdom, sacrificing many clan members. Even Golden Core cultivators fell!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The forces in the Yin World were strongly supplemented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The connection between the Yin and Yang Worlds is very strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Ning family's annual grand festival, the addition of new members, and funerals, all involve communication with the Yin World.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Therefore, for family members who violate family rules, executing family law was not just talk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo needed to gain the name to act independently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Without it, a flaw in his future actions would be created.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">If the family seized this flaw and pursued it, it would lead to big trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Even if Ning Zhuo didn't die, he would be skinned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Now, through the exchange of interests, the Clan Leader had agreed to this matter. The elders of the Ning family, controlled by other factions of the main branch, were also persuaded by Ning Zhuo through the matter of Ning Xiaohui's grandmother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo then gathered Ning Xiangguo, Ning Xiangqian, Ning Ze, Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">As soon as he started speaking, Ning Ze interrupted, "What? Let the murderer go and let her return?!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"I disagree!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"I absolutely disagree!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Ze couldn't sit still. Standing up directly, "Ning Zhuo, Ning Ji was your cousin, you grew up together." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Now, he's been killed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"And you want to compromise with the main branch — let the murderer go, and return her to them?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"If Ji'er knew, how would he see you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"I've supported you wholeheartedly until now! The Ning family side branch has supported you to this extent! You can't be spineless!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Ze originally had no worries, knowing the deep conflict between Ning Zhuo and the main branch. Who knew, this time when the meeting was called, Ning Zhuo's first sentence would be a thunderbolt striking him directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Ze couldn't understand why Ning Zhuo's attitude towards the main branch had changed so drastically!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Little Zhuo, how can you do this? How can you face Ning Ji? How can you face us? How can you face the family branch that supports you!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Ze cried, trying every way to pressure Ning Zhuo to change his decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Xiangguo and others also looked at Ning Zhuo, casting inquiring glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Yong opened his mouth to say something, but was stopped by Ning Chen, who pressed his arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, "Uncle, please sit down."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"I can't sit down! Little Zhuo, give me a definite answer, right now!" Ning Ze was very agitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo no longer looked at him, glancing around, his expression heavy, his tone steady, "Of course, I am worthy of you, worthy of the Ning family side branch." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"My cousin died. I am deeply saddened. I believe, in this world, besides uncle and aunt, I am the one who most wants to punish the murderer." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"I wish I could split Ning Xiaohui's grandmother in half right now!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"But at the critical moment, I thought of another aspect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"I am not alone. I am the hope of the Ning family branch; the future flag bearer. My revenge is just my personal desire." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"But if I vent my desire and strain the relationship between the Ning family side branch and the main branch at this critical moment, it will surely be taken advantage of by the enemy!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Do you agree with this reasoning?" Ning Zhuo paused, looking at everyone in the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Xiangguo was the first to nod, "Indeed, Zhuo Shao has considered this thoroughly. At this stage, it is a critical moment for the palace examination. In fact, because of this matter, your energy and time have been greatly disrupted. It is indeed not advisable to act rashly." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Others also showed agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Ze was indignant, "Even so, we can completely detain the murderer, there's no need to send her back, right?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo sighed, "This is the second reason that I wish to state, and also the main reason." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"I have used this matter to reach an agreement with important factions of the Ning family main branch, as well as with the Clan Leader." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"I will release the murderer and at the same time recruit Ning Xiaoren to work by my side. And in the future, I will publicly announce reconciliation, helping him return to the family." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"And what we get is the unanimous decision of the Clan Leader and the elders to grant me the right to split the family." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">A stone stirred a thousand waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Everyone was shocked, and several people exclaimed, "Split the family?!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">After reacting, Ning Xiangqian, Ning Yong, and others asked urgently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Is this true? Did I hear wrong just now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"If we really separate the family, that would be great!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"I didn't expect Zhuo Shao to accomplish such a big thing quietly. Wonderful, wonderful!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Only Ning Ze was as still as a stone statue. He stood in place, eyes wide, staring at Ning Zhuo, with his fists clenched, silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Dividing the family was not a simple matter, and quite rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">A family is a small country. A country is a big family. The division of a country is a big event. The division of a family is also a big event for a family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">After a family is divided, the family would inevitably fall into a period of weakness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The separated clansmen, however, could establish new foundations and open up new enterprises.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Everyone would have a huge opportunity for advancement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo's family branch would leap out and he himself would become the Clan Leader of the newly separated family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Xiangguo, Ning Xiangqian, and others may become elders of the separated family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and other juniors closely related to Ning Zhuo would receive focused resources from the separated family, and may become elders in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Not to mention the resources of the separated family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">For every sacrificial ceremony, the new family would be able to communicate with the ancestors in the underworld in the name and positions of the Clan Leader and elders, gaining huge benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In contrast, before division, Ning Xiangguo and his group couldn't even become family stewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Seeing the joy on everyone's faces, Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, "Although I wish to kill Ning Xiaohui's grandmother immediately, for the greater good, for the future of all of us, I am willing to suppress my desires, endure the pain, and make this decision. I hope you can understand and support me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Everyone in the hall was immediately moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Leader, I knew you were deeply emotional. Ning Ji was corrupt and deceitful during his lifetime. Many people reported to you, and you suppressed the matter. You must wish to cut the murderer into pieces; I understand you!" Ning Yong was the first to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Chen sighed deeply, "Leader, you have made too many sacrifices and carried too many burdens. I misunderstood you just now, I am sorry. Now I realize your good intentions, I was wrong!!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Xiangguo stood up and saluted Ning Zhuo, "Clan Leader, please instruct us on what to do next. I am willing to serve you!" These words made everyone look sideways.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Chen thought to himself, "I see, I see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo exhaled a breath of turbid air and nodded slightly, "I am very comforted to have everyone's support and understanding." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Uncle, what are your thoughts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Ze had been standing still for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Hearing Ning Zhuo's inquiry, he chuckled, looked at Ning Zhuo, and then scanned the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The sorrow and joy of people are not connected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Seeing the faint joy of others, Ning Ze, filled with the pain of losing a son, felt extremely desolate, feeling out of place with the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">While others were in high spirits, he felt like he was in a world of ice and snow, abandoned by the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Finally, Ning Ze's gaze locked onto Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Not long ago, he used righteousness to represent the Ning family side branch, pressuring Ning Zhuo to avenge Ning Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">But now, after Ning Zhuo lightly dangled the meat that was the separation of the family, the entire Ning family side branch had been tempted into madness, no longer caring about the death of a small Qi Refining stage junior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Ze's voice was hoarse, "Ning Zhuo, your cousin's death has become a bargaining chip for you; a tool to gain benefits!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"What else can I say?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"What else is there to say?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"I am just very cold-hearted, so extremely cold-hearted." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Farewell, farewell."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">After speaking, Ning Ze left without looking back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo quickly got up, wanting to salvage the situation, but Ning Ze left resolutely with his back hunched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo stood at the door, watching Ning Ze leave, and sighed sadly, "Time waits for no one, my uncle has become so old." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"I am ashamed to face him! Everyone, I feel blocked in my heart now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Did I do wrong, or did I do right? I am not sure for the moment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Xiangqian and others quickly gathered around. Speaking one after another, they affirmed Ning Zhuo's actions and praised his sacrifice and dedication.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"For the entire family side branch, you have indeed carried too much!" Ning Xiangqian said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Yes, Clan Leader." Ning Chen said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Xiangguo couldn't help but glance at Ning Chen, who then continued comforting, "Ning Ze's feelings are understandable. After all, a white-haired person sending off a black-haired person, losing a son in middle age, it is indeed painful." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"But I think, he just hasn't figured it out yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"He can still have more children. Once he figures it out, he will find that he is already part of the elder branch, and closest to you, the Clan Leader." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"To put it bluntly, Ning Ji did not die in vain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">These words received strong approval from Ning Yong, who loudly echoed, "Yes, yes. Ning Ji did not die in vain!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo finally instructed, "You must take good care of my uncle and aunt." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"I am participating in the palace examination and cannot spare time, so I entrust it to you all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The others quickly agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
