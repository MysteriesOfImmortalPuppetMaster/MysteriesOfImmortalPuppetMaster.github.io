<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo held a cup in his hand, took a light sip, and then smiled at the Ning family Clan Leader, "Clan Leader, don't you wish for your son to return to the family?" <br/>
<br/>
The Ning family Clan Leader was taken aback.<br/>
<br/>
He never expected such words to come from Ning Zhuo's mouth.<br/>
<br/>
After all, it was Ning Zhuo who had brought Ning Xiaoren down!<br/>
<br/>
According to the Clan Leader's understanding, Ning Zhuo should be extremely disdainful of Ning Xiaoren. How could he say such a thing?<br/>
<br/>
The Clan Leader was shocked.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, he suddenly saw a part of Ning Zhuo's true nature!<br/>
<br/>
The young man before him was deeply rooted in the righteous path, just like himself.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of person was he?<br/>
<br/>
Cold and ruthless! Placing interests above personal feelings!<br/>
<br/>
Or rather, the emotions he displayed were merely masks, the most suitable disguises for his personal interests!<br/>
<br/>
The Clan Leader believed he had seen through Ning Zhuo's essence.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, he showed an unprecedented solemn expression.<br/>
<br/>
For the first time, he treated Ning Zhuo as an equal and regarded him seriously.<br/>
<br/>
"Xiaoren..." The Clan Leader mentioned his son, a gentle expression appearing on his face, "I do hope he can return. But how can I trust you to bring him back?" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained expressionless, "Since I could bring him down, I can naturally bring him back." <br/>
<br/>
"Wasn't he trying to rely on me before?"<br/>
<br/>
"I can agree to this, let him work by my side. With my current status, it's not difficult to give him some tasks and credit." <br/>
<br/>
"Then, I will personally announce to everyone that Ning Xiaoren has turned over a new leaf and gained my forgiveness. Thus, his political blemishes will be washed away." <br/>
<br/>
"See, what a perfect plan. Only I can achieve this." <br/>
<br/>
"I believe this is also a scenario that Ning Jiufan would be pleased to see." <br/>
<br/>
"After all, our branch and your main branch both bear the surname Ning; we're all one family."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Ning Zhuo, who was fully committed to the separation of the family, say this, the Clan Leader sneered, "What shamelessness!" <br/>
<br/>
After pondering for a moment, the Clan Leader nodded heavily.<br/>
<br/>
The Clan Leader left, leaving Ning Zhuo alone in the room.<br/>
<br/>
"Separation, separation..." He sighed deeply in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
He always brought up this idea whenever there was a chance, and not just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Sects have soul lamps, countries have registries, alliances have covenants, and clans naturally have things to bind their members.<br/>
<br/>
When a newborn in the family cries at birth, the cut umbilical cord is made into a bloodline artifact and sent to the ancestral hall for strict safekeeping.<br/>
<br/>
After naming the child, blood from the heart, under the tongue, and the tip of the foot are used to form a name, inscribed in the family genealogy.<br/>
<br/>
These were just two main conventional methods; there were more formidable binding methods.<br/>
<br/>
Namely, the ancestors in the underworld!<br/>
<br/>
This world is separated into the Yang World and the Yin World.<br/>
<br/>
The Yang World is where Ning Zhuo resides, with the sun rising and the moon setting ‚Äî winds blowing and clouds moving ‚Äî flowers, birds, insects, and fish. Full of life.<br/>
<br/>
The Yin World, on the other hand, is filled with ghosts. It was gloomy and dark, with pervasive deathly energy.<br/>
<br/>
The entrance and exit between the Yin and Yang Worlds is called the Ghost Gate.<br/>
<br/>
People have yang lives and yin lives.<br/>
<br/>
According to the natural rules of this world, when cultivators and mortals die, their souls return to the Yin World, residing there for many days until their yin life is exhausted, marking their true demise.<br/>
<br/>
To judge whether a family is a cultivation family, one must not only look at the scale and highest cultivation of the Yang World but also the scale and highest cultivation of ancestors in the Yin World.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family is a genuine cultivation family, seemingly weak in the Yang World but strong in the Yin World.<br/>
<br/>
This is because sixteen years ago, the Ning family migrated from the Northern Wind Kingdom, sacrificing many clan members. Even Golden Core cultivators fell!<br/>
<br/>
The forces in the Yin World were strongly supplemented.<br/>
<br/>
The connection between the Yin and Yang Worlds is very strong.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family's annual grand festival, the addition of new members, and funerals, all involve communication with the Yin World.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, for family members who violate family rules, executing family law was not just talk.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo needed to gain the name to act independently.<br/>
<br/>
Without it, a flaw in his future actions would be created.<br/>
<br/>
If the family seized this flaw and pursued it, it would lead to big trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Even if Ning Zhuo didn't die, he would be skinned.<br/>
<br/>
Now, through the exchange of interests, the Clan Leader had agreed to this matter. The elders of the Ning family, controlled by other factions of the main branch, were also persuaded by Ning Zhuo through the matter of Ning Xiaohui's grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then gathered Ning Xiangguo, Ning Xiangqian, Ning Ze, Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he started speaking, Ning Ze interrupted, "What? Let the murderer go and let her return?!" <br/>
<br/>
"I disagree!"<br/>
<br/>
"I absolutely disagree!!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze couldn't sit still. Standing up directly, "Ning Zhuo, Ning Ji was your cousin, you grew up together." <br/>
<br/>
"Now, he's been killed!"<br/>
<br/>
"And you want to compromise with the main branch ‚Äî let the murderer go, and return her to them?" <br/>
<br/>
"If Ji'er knew, how would he see you?"<br/>
<br/>
"I've supported you wholeheartedly until now! The Ning family side branch has supported you to this extent! You can't be spineless!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze originally had no worries, knowing the deep conflict between Ning Zhuo and the main branch. Who knew, this time when the meeting was called, Ning Zhuo's first sentence would be a thunderbolt striking him directly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze couldn't understand why Ning Zhuo's attitude towards the main branch had changed so drastically!<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, how can you do this? How can you face Ning Ji? How can you face us? How can you face the family branch that supports you!" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze cried, trying every way to pressure Ning Zhuo to change his decision.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangguo and others also looked at Ning Zhuo, casting inquiring glances.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong opened his mouth to say something, but was stopped by Ning Chen, who pressed his arm.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, "Uncle, please sit down."<br/>
<br/>
"I can't sit down! Little Zhuo, give me a definite answer, right now!" Ning Ze was very agitated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo no longer looked at him, glancing around, his expression heavy, his tone steady, "Of course, I am worthy of you, worthy of the Ning family side branch." <br/>
<br/>
"My cousin died. I am deeply saddened. I believe, in this world, besides uncle and aunt, I am the one who most wants to punish the murderer." <br/>
<br/>
"I wish I could split Ning Xiaohui's grandmother in half right now!" <br/>
<br/>
"But at the critical moment, I thought of another aspect."<br/>
<br/>
"I am not alone. I am the hope of the Ning family branch; the future flag bearer. My revenge is just my personal desire." <br/>
<br/>
"But if I vent my desire and strain the relationship between the Ning family side branch and the main branch at this critical moment, it will surely be taken advantage of by the enemy!" <br/>
<br/>
"Do you agree with this reasoning?" Ning Zhuo paused, looking at everyone in the hall.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangguo was the first to nod, "Indeed, Zhuo Shao has considered this thoroughly. At this stage, it is a critical moment for the palace examination. In fact, because of this matter, your energy and time have been greatly disrupted. It is indeed not advisable to act rashly." <br/>
<br/>
Others also showed agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze was indignant, "Even so, we can completely detain the murderer, there's no need to send her back, right?" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed, "This is the second reason that I wish to state, and also the main reason." <br/>
<br/>
"I have used this matter to reach an agreement with important factions of the Ning family main branch, as well as with the Clan Leader." <br/>
<br/>
"I will release the murderer and at the same time recruit Ning Xiaoren to work by my side. And in the future, I will publicly announce reconciliation, helping him return to the family." <br/>
<br/>
"And what we get is the unanimous decision of the Clan Leader and the elders to grant me the right to split the family." <br/>
<br/>
A stone stirred a thousand waves.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone was shocked, and several people exclaimed, "Split the family?!" <br/>
<br/>
After reacting, Ning Xiangqian, Ning Yong, and others asked urgently.<br/>
<br/>
"Is this true? Did I hear wrong just now?"<br/>
<br/>
"If we really separate the family, that would be great!"<br/>
<br/>
"I didn't expect Zhuo Shao to accomplish such a big thing quietly. Wonderful, wonderful!" <br/>
<br/>
Only Ning Ze was as still as a stone statue. He stood in place, eyes wide, staring at Ning Zhuo, with his fists clenched, silent.<br/>
<br/>
Dividing the family was not a simple matter, and quite rare.<br/>
<br/>
A family is a small country. A country is a big family. The division of a country is a big event. The division of a family is also a big event for a family!<br/>
<br/>
After a family is divided, the family would inevitably fall into a period of weakness.<br/>
<br/>
The separated clansmen, however, could establish new foundations and open up new enterprises.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone would have a huge opportunity for advancement.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's family branch would leap out and he himself would become the Clan Leader of the newly separated family.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangguo, Ning Xiangqian, and others may become elders of the separated family.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and other juniors closely related to Ning Zhuo would receive focused resources from the separated family, and may become elders in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the resources of the separated family.<br/>
<br/>
For every sacrificial ceremony, the new family would be able to communicate with the ancestors in the underworld in the name and positions of the Clan Leader and elders, gaining huge benefits.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, before division, Ning Xiangguo and his group couldn't even become family stewards.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the joy on everyone's faces, Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, "Although I wish to kill Ning Xiaohui's grandmother immediately, for the greater good, for the future of all of us, I am willing to suppress my desires, endure the pain, and make this decision. I hope you can understand and support me."<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in the hall was immediately moved.<br/>
<br/>
"Leader, I knew you were deeply emotional. Ning Ji was corrupt and deceitful during his lifetime. Many people reported to you, and you suppressed the matter. You must wish to cut the murderer into pieces; I understand you!" Ning Yong was the first to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen sighed deeply, "Leader, you have made too many sacrifices and carried too many burdens. I misunderstood you just now, I am sorry. Now I realize your good intentions, I was wrong!!" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangguo stood up and saluted Ning Zhuo, "Clan Leader, please instruct us on what to do next. I am willing to serve you!" These words made everyone look sideways.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen thought to himself, "I see, I see."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo exhaled a breath of turbid air and nodded slightly, "I am very comforted to have everyone's support and understanding." <br/>
<br/>
"Uncle, what are your thoughts?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze had been standing still for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Ning Zhuo's inquiry, he chuckled, looked at Ning Zhuo, and then scanned the hall.<br/>
<br/>
The sorrow and joy of people are not connected.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the faint joy of others, Ning Ze, filled with the pain of losing a son, felt extremely desolate, feeling out of place with the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
While others were in high spirits, he felt like he was in a world of ice and snow, abandoned by the world.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Ning Ze's gaze locked onto Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, he used righteousness to represent the Ning family side branch, pressuring Ning Zhuo to avenge Ning Ji.<br/>
<br/>
But now, after Ning Zhuo lightly dangled the meat that was the separation of the family, the entire Ning family side branch had been tempted into madness, no longer caring about the death of a small Qi Refining stage junior.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze's voice was hoarse, "Ning Zhuo, your cousin's death has become a bargaining chip for you; a tool to gain benefits!" <br/>
<br/>
"What else can I say?"<br/>
<br/>
"What else is there to say?"<br/>
<br/>
"I am just very cold-hearted, so extremely cold-hearted." <br/>
<br/>
"Farewell, farewell."<br/>
<br/>
After speaking, Ning Ze left without looking back.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly got up, wanting to salvage the situation, but Ning Ze left resolutely with his back hunched.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood at the door, watching Ning Ze leave, and sighed sadly, "Time waits for no one, my uncle has become so old." <br/>
<br/>
"I am ashamed to face him! Everyone, I feel blocked in my heart now."<br/>
<br/>
"Did I do wrong, or did I do right? I am not sure for the moment."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian and others quickly gathered around. Speaking one after another, they affirmed Ning Zhuo's actions and praised his sacrifice and dedication.<br/>
<br/>
"For the entire family side branch, you have indeed carried too much!" Ning Xiangqian said.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, Clan Leader." Ning Chen said.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangguo couldn't help but glance at Ning Chen, who then continued comforting, "Ning Ze's feelings are understandable. After all, a white-haired person sending off a black-haired person, losing a son in middle age, it is indeed painful." <br/>
<br/>
"But I think, he just hasn't figured it out yet."<br/>
<br/>
"He can still have more children. Once he figures it out, he will find that he is already part of the elder branch, and closest to you, the Clan Leader." <br/>
<br/>
"To put it bluntly, Ning Ji did not die in vain."<br/>
<br/>
These words received strong approval from Ning Yong, who loudly echoed, "Yes, yes. Ning Ji did not die in vain!" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo finally instructed, "You must take good care of my uncle and aunt." <br/>
<br/>
"I am participating in the palace examination and cannot spare time, so I entrust it to you all."<br/>
<br/>
The others quickly agreed.<br/>
