<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 109: Enthusiastic Friend Ning Little Zhuo</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Que’s home also had a cultivation room. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After finishing his meal, Ning Zhuo entered the cultivation room to begin his practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">First, he thoroughly inspected the surroundings and found no surveillance measures. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He then carefully examined the array within the cultivation room. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The array was intricate and interconnected with the main array of the Ning family. The Ning family’s main array, in turn, was linked to one of the array pillars of the Great Array of Lava Immortal City. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This layered and refined relationship allowed the array in Ning Que’s cultivation room to provide abundant spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The source of this spiritual energy was the endless fire elemental energy within the Lava Mountain. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The massive fire elemental energy, laden with toxic elements, was purified by the Great Array of Lava Immortal City, yielding purified fire elemental energy. This energy was then converted into neutral spiritual energy through various complex arrays. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">By the time it reached the Ning family’s domain, the neutral spiritual energy had been further converted into ice elemental or water elemental energy. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This was because the Ning family’s primary cultivation methods involved ice or water elemental techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After his alteration in cultivation techniques, Ning Zhuo now used the Five Elements Breathing Technique, which covered a wide range and could absorb any spiritual energy related to the five elements. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Hence, this cultivation room was perfectly suitable for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Soon, clouds began to drift within the cultivation room. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The layers of clouds enveloped Ning Zhuo entirely, wrapping him into a large cotton-like ball. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">However, due to the large space in the cultivation room, the clouds only gathered around Ning Zhuo and did not fill the entire room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The Ning family had invested significant effort and resources when setting up their family compound. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Wrapped in clouds, Ning Zhuo first took out some spiritual food pastries, enjoying the lingering taste on his tongue. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He then drank a bottle of specially made juice worth hundreds of spiritual stones, causing spiritual energy to surge within him, making his whole body feel almost swollen with energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Taking too many pills could lead to medicinal toxicity, so he avoided them for now. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Spiritual food had no such drawbacks, although it spoiled easily, was difficult to preserve for long periods, and was expensive. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Spiritual food was much pricier than pills. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">But Ning Zhuo was wealthy! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">His current income included profits from the Fireburst Monkeys, periodic rewards from the Lava Immortal Palace leaderboard, and the resources tricked out of his uncle. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The largest portion came from the cultivation resources distributed by the three families in their joint effort. His share had always been substantial. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The recent assaults on the three family prodigies had greatly alarmed the families, causing them to increase resource distribution by three to four times!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo had already demonstrated his cultivation level and potential innate talent, which had not yet been fully tested. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">As a result, the resources he received were top-tier, on par with those of Zheng Jian and others. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Thus, Ning Zhuo had the means to lavishly indulge in these spiritual foods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After consuming spiritual food, Ning Zhuo prepared to take some pills. Additionally, his meditation cushion, a high-quality auxiliary cultivation tool, was ready. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Today, the joint efforts of the three families had delivered a new batch of resources. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Among these, the Sharp Advancement Needle and the Ice Light Strong Meridian Talisman caught Ning Zhuo's eye. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">These were usually reserved only for geniuses like Ning Xiaohui from the main branch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Using the Five Elements Breathing Technique, refining the Devil-Dyed Blood Vessel Technique, and meditating with the Mirror Platform Spiritual Communication Technique, Ning Zhuo's progress with these three cultivation methods was visibly rapid due to the abundance of resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">At the start, Ning Zhuo was surrounded by a halo of five colors, which dyed the surrounding clouds. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Then, his face was enveloped in a red glow, and blood energy surged outward. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Finally, his aura receded, and a Buddhist tranquility ascended, filling his face with a look of compassion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">After reaching the physical limits of his body, Ning Zhuo decisively stopped. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Progressing too quickly with cultivation techniques wasn't good either. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The body, especially the three Dantians, needed time to adapt and buffer. Rapid improvement could lead to unstable foundations, which is why a balance was necessary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">However, among the resources Ning Zhuo used were many items that accelerated the adaptation process. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He didn't hold back and used them all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Right now, I need to go all out, moving at the maximum speed to seize the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Money is just an external thing. If I fail to capture the palace and lose my life, no amount of spirit stones will matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo understood this deeply. He opened the door of the secret room and walked out, smiling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The results of this cultivation session were greater than any before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"The Sharp Advancement Needle and the Ice Light Strong Meridian Talisman were indeed effective. If only I could also use the Gather-Disperse Wishful Spiritual Breath Formation, it would be even better. Unfortunately, I can't use it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo was very wary of the strength and style of the Zhou family. Among the three families, he understood the Ning family well and had a certain grasp of their actions. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Zheng family was straightforward, making it easy to predict their next move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Zhou family was different. In terms of strength, the Zhou family was undoubtedly the strongest among the three, a fact even the Zheng family acknowledged. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">However, the most prominent family in Lava Immortal City was not the Zhou family but the Zheng family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Zhou family preferred careful planning and had deep strategies. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Zhou Zhu was an exception; Zhou Ze Shen represented the typical Zhou family cultivator, embodying many of the family's traits and characteristics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"I accidentally uncovered the Zhou family's little secret while using the Golden-Blooded War Ape, Da Sheng. To this day, the Zhou family has kept silent about it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo certainly wouldn't reveal it on his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Zhou family's secrecy was advantageous to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Masters, this way, please. Young Master Ning Zhuo is in the side hall," a servant guided Ning Chen and Ning Yong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Entering the side hall, the two saw Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Ah Zhuo!" Ning Yong raised his arm and waved excitedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Chen smiled and bowed to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo waved his hand dismissively, "With our friendship, there's no need for formalities. Let's sit down and chat while we eat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Exactly, no need to be polite with Ah Zhuo! We've been through life and death together," Ning Yong said heartily, taking a seat and seeing the array of spiritual food and pastries on the round table. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">His eyes widened in amazement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Oh my, so much spiritual food!" Ning Yong exclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Chen, also astonished, sat down. They had been cultivating at home when a servant came with a message saying Ning Zhuo had invited them. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Given Ning Zhuo's elevated status, the two felt a mixture of affection, admiration, and hidden guilt, readily agreeing to come.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The three chatted leisurely in the side hall. Ning Yong ate voraciously, his cheeks never deflating. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Chen initially felt reserved, but under Ning Zhuo's encouragement, he also indulged in many pastries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">From the moment he saw them, Ning Zhuo began to use his embryonic spiritual ability, the Thread of Fate. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">It took two full tea breaks before he successfully wove a thread of fate above each of their heads. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">These threads were much finer and more translucent compared to those he had used on his cousin Ning Ji and aunt Wang Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Understanding the target greatly influences the manifestation of the Thread of Fate!" Ning Zhuo thought to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The embryonic spiritual ability merely informed him that he had learned this skill. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">It was like growing legs, making Ning Zhuo realize he could walk, run, and jump, but how far he could go, how fast he could run, and how high he could jump still required practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Upon observation, Ning Zhuo realized his previous estimates were too optimistic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Ning Chen and Ning Yong have been my classmates for fourteen years. Although we weren't particularly close, we were familiar enough to know each other's general information. My cultivation level is also higher than theirs, yet it still took two tea breaks to establish the Thread of Fate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">This showed that the practical value of the Thread of Fate in combat was limited. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Most opponents in battle were not well-known to him. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">In the heat of battle, with rapid shifts in offense and defense and life-threatening situations, who could methodically establish the Thread of Fate? </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">At least for now, Ning Zhuo couldn't.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"This spiritual ability is mainly for managing influence rather than excelling in combat. Unless I set up the Thread of Fate in advance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"But as it stands, setting up the Thread of Fate requires us to be very close to each other. Anything beyond three steps is extremely difficult!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Once the Thread of Fate was established, Ning Zhuo stopped the idle chatter and said proactively, "I invited you both here to lend a helping hand. Your cultivation levels are currently behind mine. I've reached the peak of the third layer and have plenty of experience. I can share all this experience with you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Yong and Ning Chen exchanged glances, each seeing the delight in the other's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"That's fantastic!" Ning Yong cheered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Chen stood up, his expression serious, and bowed deeply to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo immediately stood up, smiling as he helped him up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Seeing this, Ning Yong also hurriedly expressed his thanks with a bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"We've been classmates for over ten years and have faced life and death together. There's no need for such formalities," Ning Zhuo said with a hearty laugh. "Let's head to the training chamber in the main house. I'll personally guide you both."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The three of them went into the main house's training chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"This is the main family's training chamber. In our house, it’s mostly used by my grandfather, then my father. I only get to use it occasionally," Ning Yong sighed. "Ah Zhuo, it seems your uncle isn't too bad to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Chen chuckled, "That must be a recent change! If mistreatment was just a rumor, it couldn't have been the case throughout all our years at school, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo smiled, neither confirming nor denying, "My uncle has a secret mission. He's been away on duty recently, so I got to use this chamber." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This was the official line they were sticking to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Gui's situation hadn't become public knowledge, restricted to only a few individuals. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">On one hand, Ning Xiao Ren knew it was his own scheme and wouldn't publicize it. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">On the other hand, Ning Gui valued his reputation and would never admit to it. Lastly, Ning Ze had no incentive to reveal this scandal. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Wang Lan and Ning Ji were doing everything to keep it a secret, let alone spread it around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo had the two sit down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">They were also part of the reform team and took out their meditation mats from their storage pouches, beginning to breathe and circulate their energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo circled around them and immediately began administering acupuncture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">They had brought their own sets of Sharp Advance Needles and Ice Light Strong Pulse Talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">They used their own sets of Sharp Advance Needles, but for the Ice Light Strong Pulse Talismans, Ning Zhuo used part of their supply and part of his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This served as a layer of concealment, a precaution against unforeseen events.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
