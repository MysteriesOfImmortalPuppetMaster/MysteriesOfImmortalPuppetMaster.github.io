<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The talisman was oval-shaped, with a deep, glossy base, as if it was imbued with a faint sheen of oil. At the center of the talisman was a smooth silver rune, undulating like water waves, showcasing a soft and agile power. From the edges of the rune, lines extended to the upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right corners. These lines stretched to their ends and then coiled into clusters, depicting structures similar to the central rune, albeit much smaller. The structure of one large and four small runes was very clear.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan handed this talisman to him and introduced, "This is the Oil-Slick Talisman, imbued with spirituality and sealed with much of my golden core mana. As long as you are attacked, its spirituality will activate, enveloping you in a protective layer akin to oil and water. Most attacks, unless they exceed the golden core stage, can be deflected and neutralized by this oil-slick shield." Ning Zhuo was overjoyed, exclaiming repeatedly, "Good talisman, good talisman!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan snorted, "You little rascal, truly greedy. However, if you want this talisman, it's not impossible. You should know what to do next, right?" Ning Zhuo bowed again, "Ancestor, how could I be someone who fears death? I merely wish to preserve my life to repay your nurturing and contribute to the Ning family. Ancestor, I will give my all to secure more key positions for our Ning family. But, are you sure this talisman can guarantee my safety? Ancestor, just to be safe, could you give me a few more of these talismans?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan flicked his finger, knocking Ning Zhuo on the head, scolding, "Greedy like a snake swallowing an elephant! Don't overdo it. This talisman, imbued with spirituality, is a treasure of our family and can be used multiple times. Unless someone at the Nascent Soul stage from the Void Sect infiltrates, this talisman will surely keep you safe. Even against Yang Chanyu, it will hold until I come to rescue you. Now go, get out there and do your work!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan waved his sleeve, reluctantly parting with the spiritual talisman, feeling annoyed at Ning Zhuo's greedy demeanor. Ning Zhuo left his residence and first sought out many members of the Ning family's reformation team. They were visibly excited to see Ning Zhuo. Ning Zhuo informed them that he had been under the covert control of the Void Sect when he was weak, but now he had turned the corner and felt at ease. In the past two days, he had been by Ning Jiufan's side, receiving guidance and nurturing from the golden core ancestor. Although his strength hadn't increased significantly, his perspective had broadened greatly. The Ning family's reformation team was instantly invigorated.<br/>
<br/>
They complained to Ning Zhuo, saying that the reformation team members from the Zhou and Zheng families had changed their attitudes. Previously, they were friendly and warm when Ning Zhuo shared his experiences, but now, in the competition for key positions, they had almost turned hostile. Especially the Zheng family, known for their straightforward and rough demeanor, now felt proud because Zheng Jian was the second to obtain a medical officer position, and they began to look down on others.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gathered a lot of intelligence and, having achieved his purpose, bid farewell to everyone and headed to the Medical Pavilion. As he walked, he pondered and analyzed the current situation. The new political path had caused rapid and intense adjustments among the three families. Originally, the three families were closely united, forming a solid alliance. But now, due to the competition for positions, they began to compete with each other. "Such competition is bound to intensify."<br/>
<br/>
"Though competition among the righteous path doesn't usually involve fighting and killing, it can lead to various underhanded tactics when it reaches a certain level. Although the three families signed an alliance, they probably didn't anticipate this situation at the time. Therefore, the alliance's constraints on the current situation are minimal." Analyzing this, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but look up at the sky, feeling a sense of admiration, "Meng Kui truly deserves to be the strategist of the Meng family. A small political strategy has caused the alliance of the three families to begin fracturing. This isn't a conspiracy, but an open strategy!"<br/>
<br/>
"The three families and Zhu Xuanji all know Meng Kui's scheme, but they can't resist it and can only go along with it. As for the Zheng family..." Ning Zhuo understood well the Zheng family's desire to seize the Medical Pavilion. The Medical Pavilion was indeed one of the most valuable mechanical constructs, with many important positions associated with it. Whether in peace or war, it had its uses.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned slightly. The current situation posed some trouble for him. Among the Medical Pavilion, Command Platform, and Five Elements Tower, the Medical Pavilion was the most important. This was because the severe treatment room in the Medical Pavilion could temporarily shield Ning Zhuo from the detection of golden core cultivators. This function was not available in the Command Platform or the Five Elements Tower.<br/>
<br/>
"Having outsiders like Zheng Jian in the Medical Pavilion is acceptable. However, the constant comings and goings make it less convenient than before. But as the director, I hold the highest position in the Medical Pavilion, with significant authority. I can completely designate the severe treatment room as my exclusive territory. The Zheng family's significant investment is also beneficial to me. The only concern is..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo entered the Medical Pavilion. Zheng Jian was busy handling the mechanical puppet on the desk. Hearing the commotion, he quickly looked up at Ning Zhuo, showing a surprised expression. "Brother Ning Zhuo, you're here!" Zheng Jian laughed, then quickly lowered his head again, "I'm busy right now and can't leave. Let's catch up later." Ning Zhuo nodded, "Haha, Brother Zheng, let's not rush to catch up. I haven't taken on any tasks for two days."<br/>
<br/>
After a brief greeting, Ning Zhuo went to a corner of the main hall, choosing a desk behind Zheng Jian, and began his repairs. He completed the repair work on three mechanical constructs in succession, secretly using his position as director to assign a major task to Zheng Jian, then quietly ascended the stairs. He made his way to the severe treatment room and firmly closed the door.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian, busy and focused, didn't notice Ning Zhuo's small actions. Ning Zhuo first checked the supplies. Previously, Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu had stolen treasures from the cloud merchants, and a portion was given to Ning Zhuo. After checking, Ning Zhuo found that one drop of supreme virtuous water was missing, but there was an extra spiritual box. The spiritual box could store spirituality for a period of time. Ning Zhuo had long wanted to come to the Medical Pavilion to open the spiritual box. However, to keep it perfectly hidden, he endured for two days until Ning Jiufan couldn't stand it anymore, and then he acted.<br/>
<br/>
The spiritual box contained the spirituality of Ning Xiaohui! Ning Zhuo's heart stirred slightly, but he first took out a talisman. This talisman was long and slender, with a light blue hue, resembling a sapphire washed clean by water. The surface of the talisman was smooth, emitting a gentle water-like glow, and felt cool to the touch. The script was elegant, like clouds and water, and if one stared at it for a few breaths, they could see the runes flowing slowly on the talisman paper like water. It was the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman!<br/>
<br/>
This Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman was one of the Ning family's foundational treasures, similar to the Oil-Slick Talisman, both imbued with spirituality. Previously, the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman was given to Ning Xiaohui, and much of its spirituality was consumed. Ning Zhuo had been pondering how to replenish the spirituality of the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman. Now, he placed the talisman close to the spiritual box and slightly opened a small gap in the box. In the next moment, a small amount of spirituality, like fireflies, drifted out and directly merged into the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up, "It really works!!!" For a moment, he was overjoyed, his eyes reddening. Previously, this was just his hypothesis, but now, through practice, it perfectly validated his idea. To replenish the spirituality of the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, one could indeed draw from a cultivator. Ning Xiaohui, in life, had used this talisman and was quite fond of it, almost considering it a personal treasure. This relationship allowed a small portion of Ning Xiaohui's spirituality, after being refined into a spiritual essence, to be absorbed by the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, enhancing its foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly closed the spiritual box, holding the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, and stood still for a while. He gradually calmed his excitement, retrieved various materials from his storage, and began crafting a mechanism using the facilities of the severe treatment room. He had already planned the design, and his craftsmanship was quite skilled. Half an hour later, a pair of mechanical floating ice jade hands was created. At first glance, these arms appeared as if they were made of translucent ice. The ten fingers were long and delicate, like white jade, with each joint smooth and rounded, resembling a work of art. The surface of the palms and backs of the hands was adorned with intricate ice flower-like runes, exuding a cold and sacred aura. The entire pair of arms radiated a feminine grace and beauty.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical‚ÄîFloating Ice Jade Hands! Ning Zhuo attempted to control and verify the effectiveness of these Floating Ice Jade Hands. They could emit frost, freezing targets into ice blocks, but lacked healing capabilities. Ning Zhuo tried using them to draw talismans. They couldn't automatically inscribe talismans, but when Ning Zhuo used them to create some frost talismans, he felt a deep connection. Many rune paths that were difficult for him to execute personally were effortlessly achieved with these mechanical arms.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the innate talent‚ÄîIce Jade Hand!" "However, Ning Xiaohui's spirituality is currently insufficient and needs replenishment." Only when the spirituality reached a certain level could the innate talent of the Ice Jade Hand be fully realized, allowing the frozen ice blocks to possess healing capabilities. "Once it advances to the wisdom spirit stage and gains some intelligence, I can use it to create talismans daily without interruption!" "As for obtaining items frequently used by Ning Xiaohui in life, it shouldn't be too difficult..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo calculated the time and then pushed the door open to leave. Lingering too long in the severe treatment room could arouse suspicion. The newly created Floating Ice Jade Hands mechanism was left in the room and not taken out. His storage artifact could still be inspected by other golden core cultivators. Although this possibility was much lower than before, Ning Zhuo still wouldn't take such unnecessary risks.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Ning Zhuo! You're finally out. Please wait a moment while I finish my task, and then we can talk privately, okay?" Zheng Jian called out as soon as he saw Ning Zhuo emerge. Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement. Once Zheng Jian completed his repair task, he tidied up the desk and approached Ning Zhuo, "I didn't expect you to receive a task for the severe treatment room as soon as you arrived. Is there any secret to it?" Ning Zhuo shook his head, "Why? Haven't you seen it before, Brother Zheng? Perhaps each of our tasks varies from person to person."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian nodded, "Everyone's time is limited, Brother Ning Zhuo, so I'll get straight to the point. Our Zheng family wants this Medical Pavilion, and we hope you can accommodate us." Ning Zhuo couldn't help but frown slightly, "What do you mean by this?" He wanted to coexist peacefully with the Zheng family, but Zheng Jian's words suggested that the Zheng family wanted to monopolize the Medical Pavilion's positions and enjoy the benefits alone.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian chuckled, "This is our Zheng family's decision. Once made, it won't be easily changed. Brother Ning Zhuo, we've worked together before, and I know you're quite capable. Name your price. What will it take for you to lead the Ning family's reformation team to steer clear of the Medical Pavilion from now on?"</div>
