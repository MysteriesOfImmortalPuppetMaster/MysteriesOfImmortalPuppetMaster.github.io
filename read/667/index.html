<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">During the battle at the Altar Battlefield, Luo Si lost many of his magic treasures, leaving him with barely half of his Netherworld Ferrying Line. Using this remnant, he managed to retrieve the Lifebound Buddha Wheel of the Soundless Ghost Monk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Qing Chi, facing a life-or-death crisis, miraculously burned her own blood to ignite Azure Flame, refining away the Nether Dragon Scissors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">As for Ning Zhuo, while cleaning up the battlefield afterward, he discovered the Lord of Forgetful River Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This Precious Seal, also a National Artifact, had previously suppressed the Nirvana Buddha Phantom. However, after its seal was broken, it was instead subjugated by the phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">When the Nirvana Buddha Phantom was ambushed by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, recklessly ascended the altar, and perished under Divine Retribution, the Lord of Forgetful River Seal was left abandoned on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">By then, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form had already teleported back to Forgetful River Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He had utilized the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Two-Phase Formation, transitioning seamlessly from the Heaven Formation to the Earth Formation in a single, natural step. While reversing the process - from Earth Formation to Heaven Formation - was possible, it was exponentially more difficult, involving significant delays and massive energy consumption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Only the boundless, inexhaustible Earth Lung Turbid Qi, unburdened by a cultivator's physical limitations, could sustain the energy drain of such a teleportation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Thus, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord could only watch helplessly from afar, his reach falling short.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In truth, his True Form had already fainted from the pain of losing the Nether Dragon Scissors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">As for his Divided Spirit, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, it had voluntarily dissolved itself to deceive the Nirvana Buddha Phantom and reassure it, planning to gradually reform the Divided Spirit step by step in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo obtained this National Artifact but lacked the means to refine it. He had no Azure Flame at his disposal, and Qing Chi remained completely unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Only upon returning to the Living Realm did the deathly silent artifact suddenly react, violently shaking once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But that was all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Immediately afterward, it relapsed into its deathly silence, just as before. Ning Zhuo even sensed that this stillness was more profound than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He wasn't surprised by this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Having read extensively, Ning Zhuo knew a common principle: National Artifacts, Official Artifacts, and Military Armaments lose their effectiveness when removed from their designated domains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">For example, an Official Seal becomes useless if separated from its official and falls into another's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Military Armaments lose much of their power when detached from their affiliated army, sometimes becoming completely unusable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Lord of Forgetful River Seal, being a National Artifact equivalent to a monarch's imperial jade seal, naturally couldn't function outside the Forgetful River Prefecture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">These artifacts were deeply bound to their respective nations, officials, and armies, drawing upon national power, official authority, and military might for their operation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">National Power Bricks were distinct from these. They were consumable items, essentially artificial Spirit Stones, but instead of storing natural spiritual energy, they contained the national power of a specific nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">With authorization from the nation's high-ranking officials, cultivators could draw upon this national power for various purposes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Storing National Power Bricks was challenging. The longer they were stored and the farther they were from their source nation, the faster and greater their national power would dissipate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This was one of the reasons Ning Zhuo had rapidly depleted his National Power Bricks earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">A major reason the Lord of Forgetful River Seal had fallen into dormancy was its detachment from the Forgetful River Prefecture's jurisdiction. Having crossed from the Underworld to the Living Realm, it could no longer draw upon the ubiquitous national power within the Forgetful River Prefecture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo led the entire Qing-Jiao Army out of the Underworld Flood Dragon River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Upon entering the Living Realm, they immediately felt the oppressive pressure lift. During their march through the Underworld, an invisible weight had pressed upon their hearts, as if a colossal eye, hidden deep within the heavens, was malevolently watching them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Now, this strange pressure vanished abruptly. Moreover, despite the overcast skies, the entire Qing-Jiao Army felt a sudden warmth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"This is the favor of the Yang Heaven," Ning Zhuo and the others understood instinctively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The message left by Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin in the Jade Slip also addressed this point. She explained clearly: the Qing-Jiao Army had disrupted the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long grand plan, earning the Underworld Celestial Heavens' resentment while simultaneously gaining the favor of the Living Realm's Heaven!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This favor would last for a limited time. During this period, all cultivators in the Qing-Jiao Army would experience smooth sailing in their endeavors, even receiving Heavenly Assistance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">However, the greater the Heavenly Assistance triggered, the shorter the duration of Heaven's favor for the cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Naturally, the share of Heaven's favor each individual received varied. Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, Luo Si, and Sun Lingtong undoubtedly received the largest portions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo led the Qing-Jiao Army to withdraw a distance from the Underworld Flood Dragon River before establishing camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He sacrificed the Ceremonial Barracks, providing the Qing-Jiao Army with a secure place to rest and recuperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The march through the Underworld had been fraught with peril and danger. Thanks to Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's advance warning, Ning Zhuo, Luo Si, and others had intervened in time. Though many cultivators in the Qing-Jiao Army were wounded, very few had died.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This newly formed army's performance in their Underworld campaign was dazzlingly brilliant, almost blindingly so. Their low casualty rate, with most surviving, was nothing short of a miracle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The entire army rested and recuperated in the military camp, actively treating their wounds, and their morale steadily rose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"When we first captured this camp, I thought holding it within White Paper Immortal City would be of little use," Ning Zhuo remarked with a sigh. "Looking back now, this camp has proven to be our most crucial asset."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Sun Lingtong, who had taken a different route, didn't share the same sentiment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Luo Si, however, felt a peculiar mix of emotions. After all, he had previously commanded the Ten Thousand Rivers Army, using the Ghost Tide to launch a fierce assault on White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"To avoid complications, Luo Si, you should remain hidden for now," Ning Zhuo instructed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Luo Si didn't object and readily complied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo then gathered the entire army and ordered them to strictly adhere to the fabricated account of their battle. They were to claim that after entering the Underworld, they engaged in a brief skirmish before scattering in all directions. They eventually managed to escape back to the Living Realm by using the Underworld Flood Dragon River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord would undoubtedly avoid publicizing this incident. The Soundless Ghost Monk's True Form had never returned, and his Lifebound Buddha Wheel had fallen into Luo Si's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">As for the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Imperial Guard, they had been completely annihilated in the Black Cloud Battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Therefore, as long as the Qing-Jiao Army kept their mouths shut, the cultivators of White Paper Immortal City could only speculate, unable to confirm anything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">According to the message left by Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin, the Qing-Jiao Army needed to maintain strict secrecy about this matter for the time being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Given Ning Zhuo's temperament, he would have made this decision himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">After resting for half a day, the Qing-Jiao Army broke camp and swiftly moved away from the Underworld Flood Dragon River, approaching White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">When they were ten miles from the city, Ning Zhuo ordered them to set up camp again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This location was remarkably close to where the Forgetful River Ghost Army had previously encamped!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">As the Qing-Jiao Army marched, cultivators detected their movements and relayed this crucial intelligence to White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Thus, as soon as they settled into the Ceremonial Barracks, a cultivator arrived to pay his respects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The figure descended from the Void, landing gracefully with robes fluttering, exuding an otherworldly elegance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">His eyes were gentle and clear, radiating a profound understanding of worldly affairs. His features were soft yet refined, his smile warm and inviting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He possessed an inner radiance, like a meticulously carved piece of jade - its luster restrained, yet warm to the touch, evoking a sense of detachment from the mundane and fostering immediate familiarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">It was none other than Wen Ruanyu, the True Inheritor of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo mounted his Black Blood Paper Horses and stood at the camp entrance to greet him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Wen Ruanyu called out in a clear voice, "Nephew Ning Zhuo, you must be weary from your journey. Leading the Qing-Jiao Army deep into enemy territory and returning safely to White Paper Immortal City is truly our good fortune. This heavy weight on my heart has finally eased!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He had already known Ning Zhuo's true appearance and identity back in White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Now, seeing Ning Zhuo reveal his true form, he felt a flicker of surprise but maintained a composed expression, as if it were perfectly natural.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo dismounted, clasped his hands in a respectful bow, and welcomed Wen Ruanyu into the military camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Except for the wounded Cultivators, the entire Qing-Jiao Army had assembled, awaiting Ning Zhuo's commands. This display of unity and readiness for battle showcased their formidable spirit to Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Wen Ruanyu's smile deepened at the sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Though he didn't know how Ning Zhuo had resolved the misunderstandings with the Qing-Jiao Army and gained control of the entire force, such details mattered little. What truly mattered was Ning Zhuo's continued immense influence over the Qing-Jiao Army!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Senior Wen, these are our spoils of war," Ning Zhuo presented a massive pile of ghostly creature corpses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Wen Ruanyu's gaze swept over the scene, and he couldn't help but be moved. "I never imagined that on this expedition, Nephew, you could lead the Qing-Jiao Army to such a remarkable victory. On behalf of the countless citizens of White Paper Immortal City, I thank you all for your bloody sacrifices. And congratulations, Nephew, on achieving such an unparalleled feat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">As he concluded, Wen Ruanyu raised his voice, his words resonating throughout the entire military camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">On one hand, he represented White Paper Immortal City, confirming Ning Zhuo's identity and affirming his leadership over the Qing-Jiao Army. On the other hand, he was also reassuring the entire army and boosting their morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Qing-Jiao Army remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Many wore arrogant expressions, while others seemed completely indifferent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The spoils they had gathered far exceeded what was being displayed; what was shown was merely a negligible fraction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">This had been a legendary battle! If the full truth were revealed, it would surely shock the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo had ordered them to maintain secrecy, and they willingly obeyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo had won the army's complete respect through his undeniable, terrifying achievements in battle. Throughout this legendary campaign, he had repeatedly protected the entire army, culminating in his defeat of a Soul Formation-level powerhouse. This earth-shattering feat had even drawn the ire of the Underworld Celestial Heavens!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Such a heaven-shaking, ghost-and-deity-astounding performance was truly extraordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">In fact, even the ghosts and deities had been utterly defeated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">In Water Burial Valley, the Qing-Jiao Army had helped Ning Zhuo clean up the battlefield, with many personally participating in dissecting the corpses of ghosts and deities!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Having experienced such legendary events and achieved such remarkable feats, the Qing-Jiao Army had undergone a profound transformation, not in their physical strength, but in their spirit. They now possessed an unwavering resolve and pride, thinking, "We've been through all that - what future trials could possibly frighten us?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Wen Ruanyu couldn't help but glance sideways, thinking, These people have only taken a trip to the Underworld, yet they seem completely different now!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">After exchanging a few polite remarks, he transmitted a message to Ning Zhuo via divine sense: "Nephew, let's speak privately. There are... recent developments in the city you should be aware of."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo ushered Wen Ruanyu into the commander's tent. Before Wen Ruanyu could explain, Ning Zhuo preemptively asked, "Has the White Paper City Lord changed her mind about the Qing-Jiao Army?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Wen Ruanyu chuckled bitterly. "Your suspicions are correct, Nephew."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Her decision to send me to meet you was a pretext to stage a grand triumphal ceremony."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"At the appointed time, you, Qing Chi, Qing Yan, and other key figures will enter through the South City Gate, where the entire city's populace will welcome you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"However, I advise you to feign illness and remain in seclusion. The Qing-Jiao Army can continue to garrison here until the White Paper City Lord makes a genuine commitment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo nodded. "That's exactly what I had in mind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">According to the message on the Jade Slip, White Paper Immortal City was unaware of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's complete defeat and still believed the Ghost Tide and siege army persisted. This situation could be exploited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo had long understood the White Paper City Lord's domineering personality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Previously, the enemy army's siege and the overwhelming pressure of the Ghost Tide had forced the White Paper City Lord to fund the Qing-Jiao Army. She had relied on Ning Zhuo and other external forces to first secure her own position and then ensure the safety of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Now that the Ghost Tide had receded and the enemy army had withdrawn, White Paper Immortal City enjoyed a prolonged period of peace and recuperation. In the City Lord's eyes, the Qing-Jiao Army and Ning Zhuo had become an eyesore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">White Paper Immortal City had repeatedly attempted to establish its own cultivation army in the past, but all efforts had failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">This time, the Qing-Jiao Army's success was a result of perfect timing, favorable terrain, and harmonious cooperation - a confluence of factors that had converged to create this formidable force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The White Paper City Lord's ambition to create her own army would be fiercely opposed by both the North Wind Kingdom and the Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Qing-Jiao Army, capable of leveraging Nascent Soul-level combat power, had become the greatest force capable of challenging the White Paper City Lord. In the Ghostly Black Marshlands, her absolute dominance was now a thing of the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">To maintain her rule, the White Paper City Lord needed to devise a method to properly manage the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Previously, the Qing-Jiao Army had been stationed in the Underworld, while the White Paper City Lord was busy with post-war preparations. Now that the Qing-Jiao Army had returned, it had become a pressing matter demanding immediate resolution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">How this matter was resolved, and the outcome of that resolution, would likely determine the political landscape for the next century following the Ghostly Black Marshlands conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Wen Ruanyu, having learned that Ning Zhuo was the son of Meng Yaoyin, had clearly sided with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Deeply concerned that Ning Zhuo might underestimate the situation, Wen Ruanyu had come specifically to warn him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">But Ning Zhuo was thinking, "Does the White Paper City Lord not know Wen Ruanyu's attitude toward me? By sending Wen Ruanyu to greet me, her intention to continue our cooperation is already quite clear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Just as Mother predicted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">With this in mind, Ning Zhuo thanked Wen Ruanyu and asked him to wait a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">In Wen Ruanyu's presence, Ning Zhuo immediately wrote a flying letter, first showing it to Wen Ruanyu for review before entrusting him to deliver it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">After reading the letter, Wen Ruanyu finally set aside his worries, gave Ning Zhuo an admiring glance, and hurried back to White Paper Immortal City with the message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">That afternoon, the City Lord of White Paper's paper doll avatar arrived at the military camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Accompanying the City Lord were Yang Sanyan and Zhou Wenyan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"This is the Divine Contract, its contents exactly as described in Fellow Daoist Ning's letter. Please review it," Zhou Wenyan said, producing the document.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"It is my honor to witness this alliance between you two," he added.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo unfolded the contract and carefully examined it, finding its terms nearly identical to those in his flying letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Qing-Jiao Army will maintain its independent structure and remain outside the jurisdiction of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The military armaments previously borrowed by the Qing-Jiao Army will be converted from lease to ownership, with a portion of their war merits used to offset the purchase price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">White Paper Immortal City will provide daily supplies to the Qing-Jiao Army in exchange for their unconditional defense of the city against any major attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The Qing-Jiao Army's war merits will be compensated by White Paper Immortal City through the provision of abundant Ghost Corpse remains from the battlefield...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo ran his fingers over the Mechanism Ring, checking it thoroughly for any anomalies before passing it to Sun Lingtong for further inspection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">After examining the ring, Sun Lingtong gave Ning Zhuo a subtle nod.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">With these assurances, Ning Zhuo and the White Paper City Lord's clone formally signed the Divine Contract, solidifying the century-long power dynamics of the Ghostly Black Marshlands!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
