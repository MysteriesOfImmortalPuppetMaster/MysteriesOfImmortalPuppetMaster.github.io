<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 160: Ning Zhuo Ascends the Hall!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ancestral Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Honored Elder, there aren't enough seats," a subordinate reported.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Ancestral Hall Elder's face was as calm as water: "Bring over tables and chairs from the school, fill both the front and middle courtyards. Too many people are coming, and more keep arriving. Something's not right!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Ancestral Hall Elder smelled a conspiracy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Go, hurry up Ning Zhuo! Why is this kid walking so slowly? He hasn't arrived yet, and many elders are already here. Is he putting on airs?" The Ancestral Hall Elder knew well: the longer the delay, the worse it would be for the main branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">At this moment, someone suddenly reported: "The Young Clan Leader has arrivedâ€”!" The Ancestral Hall Elder and others immediately stood up and left the main hall to greet him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Xiaoren arrived at the Ancestral Hall a step ahead, saw the Ancestral Hall Elder, and quickly stepped forward, cupping his hands in salute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">His face was calm, but he secretly transmitted an anxious message: "Elder, for my father's sake, please save me!" The Ancestral Hall Elder's pupils shrank slightly upon hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At this moment, Ning Youfu and Ning Ze also arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Ancestral Hall Elder said a few polite words and quickly extricated himself from Ning Xiaoren to greet Ning Youfu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Ancestral Hall Elder smiled: "Elder Fu, you have arrived! It's truly rare, giving the younger generation another chance to hear your teachings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Youfu chuckled: "I don't have many days left, I wanted to live quietly, but this matter arose, so I had to come. Beside me is Ning Zhuo's uncle, Ning Ze." The Ancestral Hall Elder made a sound of acknowledgment, took the initiative to lead the way, and invited Ning Youfu and Ning Ze into the Ancestral Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">During this time, Ning Xiaoren tried to communicate with him, but he pretended not to know and did not respond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The people from the Ancestral Hall urged Ning Zhuo, whispering to him: "Ning Zhuo, you're causing a big scene. Many elders are already at the Ancestral Hall, and you haven't even covered half the distance." Ning Zhuo quickly apologized, explaining that many clan members had questions, and he had to explain to each one, which took some time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He asked the messenger to return and say that Ning Zhuo would arrive soon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">After the Ancestral Hall people left, Ning Zhuo continued at his own pace, even slowing down a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Thanks to his continuous explanations, more and more clan members gathered around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">His entourage swelled to over sixty people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Turning a corner, an elder with a cane, accompanied by three attendants, looked at Ning Zhuo from afar and waved slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Someone in Ning Zhuo's group exclaimed: "Ah, it's Elder Ning Houjun!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Houjun was also once an elder, specifically of the War Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">However, he voluntarily retired over a decade ago and had been enjoying his retirement at home.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Like Ning Youfu, Ning Houjun was also a branch clan member with high prestige.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo quickly quickened his pace, came before Ning Houjun, and bowed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Houjun looked Ning Zhuo up and down, praising: "Good, the young man is dignified and spirited, just like a young person should be. I've heard about your situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"This time, I'll accompany you to the clan's Ancestral Hall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo expressed his gratitude, and the clan members around him cheered, saying that with Elder Ning Houjun accompanying them, success was assured!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo and Ning Houjun walked side by side, conversing while secretly transmitting messages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Houjun asked via transmission: "Young man, do you know who the most crucial person in this action is?" Ning Zhuo replied without hesitation, via transmission: "It's the Ancestor." He was referring not to the ancestral patriarch but to the Golden Core Ancestor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Houjun glanced at Ning Zhuo, showing an appreciative look, and continued transmitting: "Correct, you see it clearly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Our clan's Ancestor is not from the main branch. The Golden Core Ancestor of the main branch has shown him great kindness. Therefore, the Ancestor often looks after the main branch. But he has no direct bloodline descendants."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Because of this, over a decade ago, our branch clan united to challenge the main branch. Although we failed, the Ancestor did not intervene throughout the process." Ning Zhuo nodded: "Given this, I am certain of victory this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Indeed." Ning Houjun chuckled and continued transmitting, "I always like to win. Otherwise, why would I join you? This time, it's only a matter of winning more or less."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Clan Ancestral Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Ning Clan Leader had arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Clan Leader's face was expressionless: "That Ning Zhuo still hasn't arrived?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Immediately, someone was sent to urge him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The messenger saw Ning Zhuo, initially arrogant, but was scolded by Ning Houjun: "I'm old, what's wrong with walking slowly?" "Go tell the Clan Leader, is he in such a hurry because he needs to relieve himself?" The messenger returned dejectedly, not daring to report the exact words, only saying that Ning Houjun was present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Clan Leader took a deep breath and endured it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The War Hall Elder laughed: "After all these years, Elder Ning Houjun's temper is still the same." "I wonder how his son has been since being expelled from the clan?" "Has he had any correspondence with Elder Ning Houjun in recent years?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">It wasn't until the sun was high, nearing noon, that Ning Zhuo and his group arrived at the clan's Ancestral Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The entourage had grown to over a hundred people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">However, there were even more people inside the Ancestral Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Most of the people with Ning Zhuo could only stand outside the Ancestral Hall and listen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Even so, there were no good spots left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The entire clan's Ancestral Hall was surrounded by clan members, layer upon layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo, Ning Houjun, and Wang Lan were led into the Ancestral Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">All the high-ranking members of the Ning Clan who could come had arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo saw Ning Ze, Ning Ji, the Clan Leader, and of course, Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Xiaoren's face was ashen, staring at Ning Zhuo with a fierce look, his neck stretched out like a vulture ready to fight to the death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo had just cupped his hands, about to speak, when Wang Lan suddenly wailed: "Husband, you were finally rescued! Did Ning Xiaoren not harm you again?" Ning Ze stepped out of the crowd, hugged Wang Lan, and said in a deep voice: "It was Elder Fu who personally saved me! He freed me from Ning Xiaoren's clutches!" Along the way, Ning Ze had already learned the whole story.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Despite Ning Xiaoren's constant threats and inducements, Ning Ze had made up his mind!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">What a joke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Did he really think I enjoyed being hit on the head every time?!" "Did he really think I had no temper?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Ze's wife, Wang Lan, had already stepped onto the stage, and the branch clan members were excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The momentum was unstoppable, and the truth was clear: Ning Xiaoren had indeed not provided Ning Zhuo with any cultivation resources and had indeed framed Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">All the humiliation and accumulated resentment Ning Ze had suffered made him unhesitatingly choose Ning Zhuo's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Hearing Ning Ze's words, Ning Xiaoren's heart sank to the bottom, his whole body cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">His only chance lay with Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">At this moment, it was like a leaf in the autumn wind, drifting away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">With both witnesses and physical evidence, Ning Xiaoren had no room for rebuttal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At the time, framing Ning Ze was a hasty decision, prompted by Ning Zhuo's sudden rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The whole incident had too many flaws, and if Ning Ze cooperated, it would be fine, but if he turned, the evidence would be invalid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Other clan members could easily verify the facts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The evidence was overwhelming!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Ning Xiaoren!" The Clan Leader roared, tearing off his waist token and throwing it at Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Xiaoren's head was hit, and blood flowed immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He knew the game was over, with no hope of escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In the end, he showed enough backbone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He let his head bleed, cupped his hands to his father, and said: "Clan Leader, I made a mistake and have no face to face the clan. I accept all punishment!" And this was Ning Xiaoren's final act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Clan Leader immediately announced the cancellation of Ning Xiaoren's position as Young Clan Leader, imprisoning him in the dungeon for three years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">After three years, he would be expelled from the clan, allowed to return only for the clan's grand ceremonies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"The Clan Leader is wise, sacrificing personal feelings for the greater good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Upon hearing the verdict, countless branch clan members inside and outside the Ancestral Hall cheered, their voices echoing far and wide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The main branch elders watched Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo had won brilliantly, stepping on Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">After today, he would be famous throughout the clan, his reputation soaring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Even with only "three layers of Qi Refining Stage," such character and actions could not be underestimated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">That night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Ze's residence hosted a small banquet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo and Ning Ze entertained Ning Youfu, Ning Houjun, and several family stewards like Ning Xiangguo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo frequently toasted, expressing his gratitude, showing humility and politeness, and sincerely seeking advice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Youfu pointed out: "After this incident, Ning Zhuo, you are now at odds with the main branch. Especially with the Clan Leader, don't expect any reconciliation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Houjun sighed: "It's a pity. The Clan Leader cut off his arm to save himself today, only taking down the Young Clan Leader. The victory is limited."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Xiangguo said: "Even so, it's the first victory for our branch in over a decade. A branch member bringing down the main branch's Young Clan Leader is truly inspiring!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo looked at the people at the table, guessing in his heart: Who among them is the Ning family traitor secretly allied with Fei Si?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo asked proactively how the main branch would deal with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Youfu smiled: "Ning Zhuo, you are now part of the reformation team, exploring the Immortal Palace with great skill. Plus, you are in the limelight. The main branch won't touch you, fearing you might cause another uproar at the Ancestral Hall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He glanced at Ning Xiangguo and said: "The main branch's retaliation will come soon, and you will suffer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Xiangguo smiled slightly: "I am mentally prepared. It doesn't matter! Even if I'm removed, so what? The main branch won't dare remove too many. After all, they are too few in number, haha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Houjun sighed: "To this day, there isn't a single elder position in the clan held by our branch. This is too passive, leaving us with no basic foundation. Even with many stewards, we are still at their mercy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Fortunately, Ning Zhuo, you have talent. With steady development, you will surely become an elder."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Our branch hasn't produced talent in a long time. To be honest, I've been waiting for someone capable of handling things for over a decade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Although your cultivation is weak now, you have spirit and skill."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"The key is, you have talent and are worth investing in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Rest assured, as long as I'm alive, I'll support you fully!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"You are now the banner of our branch, you must not fall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily: "Things have come to this point, partly due to the main branch's pressure, but also because I want to progress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"I have talent, I'm skilled at exploring the Immortal Palace, and I have your strong support. How can I not succeed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Everyone laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Amid the laughter, they clinked their cups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Ze downed his cup of fine wine in one gulp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">As he put down the cup, he looked at Ning Zhuo with a particularly complex expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Little Zhuo, so this is the real you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"I misjudged you, I misjudged you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Such skill, character, and capacity..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Ze felt that for the first time in his life, he truly saw Ning Zhuo clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
