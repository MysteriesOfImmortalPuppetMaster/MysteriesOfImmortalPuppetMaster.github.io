<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 44: The Demonic Cultivators are Too Arrogant!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Fei Si was still unsure about Han Ming’s status in the Soul Devouring Sect. If capturing Han Ming ended up provoking some old freak, that would be real trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">More critically, there was the Lava Immortal Palace. Right now, the four forces – including the City Lord Mansion – were all doing their best to explore the immortal palace, and didn’t want to stir up trouble anywhere else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Thus, Fei Si’s previous thoughts were along these lines: “Who cares? Sun Lie’s the one being bothered, not us. Won’t this matter be solved as long as Sun Lie can no longer bear it and leaves Fire Persimmon City on his own?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The City Lord Mansion turning a blind eye caused Han Ming to grow more and more arrogant – all the way until she was taken down by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">To a certain extent, Sun Lie’s high tolerance for harassment and the City Lord Mansion’s perfunctory attitude could be considered to have greatly helped Ning Zhuo in his capture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“This time is different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Han Ming actually attacked Meng Chong. This time, we must go all out to arrest her!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Hmm...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Let's catch Hanging-Hair Traveler first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Perhaps Han Ming will take the opportunity to escape from the city.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Fei Si knew that he had no choice but to capture Han Ming at all costs. However, he didn’t want to take any risks. If he really did capture Han Ming, that would only lead to sleepless nights for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">In comparison, Hanging-Hair Traveler was a much easier target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Hanging-Hair Traveler has always been close with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Sun Lingtong is a disciple of the Spaceless Sect. This major heterodox sect has always specialized in thievery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“Then, could it be that the third demonic cultivator was Sun Lingtong?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Fei Si quickly thought of this possibility, but had absolutely no intentions of verifying it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Like Han Ming, Sun Lingtong was backed by a major sect. After living in Fire Persimmon Immortal City for more than ten years, he had long taken root and was a true local snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Touching him would be even more troublesome than touching Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Fei Si ordered his subordinates to hunt down Hanging-Hair Traveler in the black market and arrest him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">But where was Hanging-Hair Traveler?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Not a trace of him was to be found!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After spending most of the day searching, the subordinates returned empty-handed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Fei Si made quite a fuss scolding them harshly. A short while later, he picked up a bottle of medicinal pills and poured one out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After swallowing it, a subtle change came over his sense of smell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He sniffed lightly, catching a faint medicinal fragrance that lingered in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Han Ming, I hope you’ve seen the situation clearly and have left Fire Persimmon Immortal City by now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Fei Si personally set out, turning into a long arc of light and soaring into the sky above Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Following the medicinal fragrance, he flew through the wind and clouds, passed over the walls of the immortal city, and arrived at the foot of the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Fei Si felt something was strange, and that feeling only grew stronger. In the end, he smelled an overwhelming fragrance and looked up to see a large bundle laying on the grass in Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Obviously, this bundle contained the stolen medicinal pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Hovering in the air, Fei Si was cursing internally. “Damn it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">His expression was extremely gloomy. “They didn’t even use a storage bag, they just wrapped them in cloth and tossed them into Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Arrogant, too arrogant!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Fei Si felt extremely provoked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">However, he didn’t dare to enter the forest and pick up the bundle of pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">After all, there was still the black shadow demonic cultivator hiding in Fire Persimmon Forest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“This is probably bait to lure me into the forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Sure enough, that black shadow demonic cultivator had accomplices.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“If it were Chi Dun, he would probably charge right in. But I’m not a reckless fool like him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">With these thoughts in mind, Fei Si decisively turned around and left, flying all the way to the place above the volcano to meet with the Fire Persimmon City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He quickly reported everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sitting cross-legged in the air, the Fire Persimmon City Lord nodded slightly. “It may not be an accomplice of the black shadow demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“It could be that someone else framed them and is trying to mislead the city.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">If this was the case, the situation would actually be even worse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Because that would mean that the major forces in the city had noticed something and were secretly targeting the City Lord Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Fei Si had previously proposed sending assassins to the geniuses of the Zhou Clan and Zheng Clan, and the City Lord had agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This plan was carried out successfully, but it also made the City Lord feel a sense of urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He had made arrangements for Sun Lie to help Meng Chong master the immortal talent of Ferocious Rushing Thunder as soon as possible. Sun Lie had reported his proposed method in advance, to which the City Lord had nodded in approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">But he hadn’t expected that during this period of time, demonic cultivators would suddenly attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“They might not be real demonic cultivators.” The City Lord couldn’t help but have this suspicion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">After thinking for a moment, he said to Fei Si, “You did a good job. Those medicinal pills are nothing, and hunting down the demonic cultivators isn’t important either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Take your time arresting them. There’s no need to rush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“As for Meng Chong, open up the treasury and give him plenty of heavenly materials and earthly treasures. After all, using Ferocious Rushing Thunder requires heavy consumption of the essence, qi, and spirit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">This was one of the reasons that the City Lord had always left Meng Chong on his own before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He knew his grandson’s personality well. Once Meng Chong fully mastered Ferocious Rushing Thunder, he would definitely start using it continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ferocious Rushing Thunder was extremely effective, but it was also very easy to overuse. Meng Chong could easily end up damaging his foundation and future prospects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But not long ago, the City Lord had felt pressure from the other two forces and worried that they would surpass him in the contest for the Lava Immortal Palace, so he changed his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">With the help of Sun Lie, Meng Chong successfully mastered his excellent talent of Ferocious Rushing Thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">As for the news of Meng Chong being attacked, the City Lord didn’t feel worried at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">In order to protect his grandson, he had already given Meng Chong a special talisman. As long as Meng Chong faced a life-and-death crisis, the talisman would burst out with immense power. Even if it didn’t directly kill the enemy, it would protect Meng Chong for enough time that the City Lord could arrive in person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Moreover, there were many other protective measures in place, including things similar to Space Escape Talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Midnight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo lay on the bed with his eyes open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Why isn’t it taking my soul? I want to enter the immortal palace!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The young man kicked his legs and gradually grew anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He had a hunch that if he just waited like this, he would only be delaying important matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Can I enter the immortal palace voluntarily?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo thought of the imprint that had been planted on him in the maintenance room previously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. After exerting effort for a while, the imprint reading “Trial Disciple” appeared on his chest again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The next moment, a Life-Hanging Thread pierced through space and touched his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo’s world went dark, his soul was drawn along the thread, and he entered the palace for the third time!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">In the main hall of the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, which had been sleeping soundly, suddenly trembled as it sensed that Ning Zhuo had successfully entered the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">It spat fire and leaped into the air again, flying around madly in the main hall and smashing into the pillars with its head and body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">All the while, it let out loud roars…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Lava Immortal Palace became active again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Countless treasure lights pierced out in all directions. Thick clouds of smoke churned as lava began to boil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“Huh? Shaking again?!” The Fire Persimmon City Lord’s eyes widened. He immediately took action, mobilizing the full power of the immortal city’s grand formation to suppress the immortal palace as best he could.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“What’s going on?!” Face red under the glow of the lava, the Fire Persimmon City Lord’s expression grew dark, and the doubts in his heart increased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
