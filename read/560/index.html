<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"The mechanical carriage is finally mine!" Ning Zhuo's heart surged with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Having previously intruded upon the Six Caves Sect's encampment, Ning Zhuo dared not rashly deploy his Mechanical Dragon again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A frontal confrontation became his primary choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ultimately, he caught Lin You completely off-guard, as Lin severely underestimated Ning Zhuo's hostility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo was a master of patience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He'd practiced restraint since the age of two, enduring silently for over a decade, achieving extraordinary success at the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Now, in Two Note Nation, his patience once again bore fruit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“My son!” On the frontline of Two Note Nation's main camp, the battling Demon Heart Cave Master suddenly paled dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Clutching his chest, he felt the warning method he'd placed on Lin You being triggered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This demonic master of the Six Caves Sect immediately realized his most prized successor had suffered greatly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Continue fighting!" Demon Heart Cave Master curtly instructed the nearby Poison Scorpion and Blood Shadow Cave Masters before rapidly retreating from the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"What?!" Poison Scorpion and Blood Shadow stared in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Unconcerned with their reaction, Demon Heart Cave Master, consumed by rage, swiftly pinpointed the culprit through his spiritual senses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"You dare attack my son?! You shall all die!" Demon Heart Cave Master roared as he soared toward Ning Zhuo’s forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Flying high, he immediately faced heavy artillery fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Technique - Demonic Sinew Scaled Armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He continuously maintained this demonic spell, enveloping himself in a thick, resilient armor of blood-red sinews.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Withstanding numerous attacks, Demon Heart Cave Master swiftly crossed the battlefield, positioning himself above his enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Technique - Nine Abyss Heart Devourer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It felt as if a drumbeat echoed within everyone's chests, abruptly causing hearts in the Three Generals Battalion and Red Flower Battalion to accelerate unnaturally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Another drum-like pulse surged, further accelerating their heartbeats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">By the third beat, many soldiers felt intense palpitations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Boom, boom, boom...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Three more consecutive heartbeats caused numerous soldiers to clutch their chests and collapse to their knees or fall outright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The formations of the Three Generals and Red Flower Battalions were instantly thrown into chaos, with nearly half of their ranks incapacitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Hearts raced faster still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Argh…” Some soldiers' eyes rolled back, bleeding from every orifice as their hearts exploded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Such was the terrifying strength unleashed by Demon Heart Cave Master, the second-ranked master of Six Caves Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">As the battalions faced disastrous casualties, Zhang Zhongyi quickly intervened, scattering numerous pills which instantly transformed into medicinal mist, protecting the soldiers' hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Even then, over fifty men lost their lives by the seventh heartbeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">These were cultivator-soldiers enhanced by strict military discipline!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“What a sinister and bizarre attack!” Liu Er coughed blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“We can’t let him continue!” Mu Lan, brows furrowed deeply, drew her bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Military Tactic - Feigning Strength!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">But Demon Heart Cave Master remained unbothered, pressing his assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The eighth heartbeat claimed over sixty additional lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Mu Lan’s feigned tactic was utterly ignored, her brows knitting tighter. Clearly, Demon Heart Cave Master had seen through her bluff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Liu, Guan, and Zhang also attacked, but with morale shattered and forces severely weakened, their strikes appeared feeble. Even attacks landing on Demon Heart Cave Master had little effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">This was the flaw of military cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">If an enemy targeted the soldiers directly, their foundational power could quickly collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Of course, not anyone could achieve this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Demon Heart Cave Master's demonic technique directly affected the heart, circumventing traditional defenses, resulting in devastating effectiveness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"You dare touch my son?! Who gave you such courage! Die, all of you!!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Clang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">A golden lightning-like light pierced Demon Heart Cave Master's chest, momentarily stalling his furious momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Immediately, countless five-element spells rained down on him, forcibly knocking him to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Covered in dust, Demon Heart Cave Master's sinew armor showed breaches, leaving him injured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Crucially, his Nine Abyss Heart Devourer magic was forcibly disrupted, causing severe backlash that forced him to spit a mouthful of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Impossible! Why weren’t you affected?” Demon Heart Cave Master stared at Ning Zhuo in disbelief and fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Standing proudly upright, Ning Zhuo showed no injury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">His previous displays of coughing blood and agony were purely feigned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Husband," Mu Lan gazed at him with radiant admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Strategist, truly impressive!" Zhang Hei enthusiastically raised a thumb, despite his exhaustion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Just as Jin Tunhe countered Ning Zhuo’s "Hero's Return Technique," Ning Zhuo’s Fire Heart Temple precisely countered Demon Heart Cave Master's lethal technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The white-robed youth’s heart had long been transformed, significantly mitigating the effects of the demon’s assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“You struck down the son, now you face the father,” Ning Zhuo shouted sternly. “Perfect! You and your son have committed endless evils. Now is precisely when I eliminate demons and uphold justice for all beings!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Demon Heart Cave Master’s eye twitched in fury, "Little brat, I'll scatter your bones and ashes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Boom, boom, boom…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Both sides engaged in fierce combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Demon Heart Cave Master unleashed overwhelming demonic qi, backed by his powerful physical strength and aggressive attacks, utilizing strange techniques targeting the heart that were nearly impossible to defend against.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo prioritized stability, relying on the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor and protection from the Fire-Element Heart Temple. With various Five Elements spells, he gradually wore down the Demon Heart Cave Master's momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Demon Heart Cave Master grew increasingly shocked and doubtful. After experiencing actual combat, he found the battle situation unbelievable: "What's happening? Isn't this kid just in Foundation Establishment? Yet he's actually exchanging blows evenly with me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Although he'd received intelligence earlier that Ning Zhuo could exhibit Golden Core-level power by utilizing military strategies, he himself was a dignified Nascent Soul cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Even though his strength was inferior to Lu Hongtu, and far below experts like Elder Long and Xiang Yue, he was still considered a relatively strong Nascent Soul cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Yet, he couldn't even suppress Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo grit his teeth, barely holding on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Earlier, he had only caught Demon Heart Cave Master off guard. Now that they were truly fighting, the youth felt immense pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Fortunately, Demon Heart Cave Master expended a lot of strength in the core battlefield and his combat power has significantly declined. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to resist!" Ning Zhuo inwardly rejoiced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After several exchanges, Ning Zhuo began to fall behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Without assistance, in a one-on-one fight, Demon Heart Cave Master would eventually gain the upper hand, converting this into victory and taking Ning Zhuo's life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But reality was different. Demon Heart Cave Master fought alone, whereas Ning Zhuo had allies - Liu, Guan, Zhang, Mu, and Sun - by his side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Centered around Ning Zhuo, a siege against the Demon Heart Cave Master began!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Demon Heart, where did you go?! Come back immediately!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Demon Heart, return quickly! We can't hold on much longer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Blood Shadow Cave Master and Poison Scorpion Cave Master frantically sent messages to Demon Heart Cave Master, but received no response, as if throwing stones into the ocean.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Without Demon Heart Cave Master, Thousand Peaks Forest suffered numerous weaknesses in the core battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Shen Qinghe seized this opportunity and launched a sudden strike:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">《Azure Spirit Purifying Poison Scripture》!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Tu Ming watched helplessly in grief as his poisonous techniques rapidly dissolved under Shen Qinghe's assault, melting away like snow under a blazing sun, completely unable to resist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Damn it! How could something like the Azure Spirit Purifying Poison Scripture even exist in this world!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Tu Ming fled miserably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">As the cleansing light of Azure Spirit struck him, purple poisonous mist billowed from his entire body, and the toxins he painstakingly accumulated quickly dissipated, causing unbearable pain that forced him to scream while fleeing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Such miserable screams naturally drew attention, dealing another heavy blow to Thousand Peaks Forest’s morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">But the next moment, Shen Qinghe staggered and nearly fell from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Hehehe, little girl, I'll get rid of you first!" Li Jiuchu had successfully ambushed Shen Qinghe. "My gu worms don't fear your purifying poison light."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">But right as his words fell, Li Jiuchu’s expression suddenly changed, turning sharply to look behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">A black shadow quietly approached and violently slammed into Li Jiuchu’s back!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Li Jiuchu was horrified to discover that his numerous defenses collapsed instantly, unable to block the strike at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Caw!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With a sharp crow, the black shadow that severely wounded Li Jiuchu swiftly retreated, dodging Li Jiuchu's terrifying counterattack, and soared into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">It was none other than Mo Yechen's beast companion, the Starling Bird.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Li Jiuchu had just ambushed Shen Qinghe, only to be ambushed in return by Mo Yechen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He stared fiercely at Mo Yechen in the distance, who was riding on a "giant starling." Clearly, the real starling had just inflicted heavy damage on Li Jiuchu, while Mo Yechen’s mount was merely an illusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Be careful, Fairy Shen." Mo Yechen's deceptive tactic succeeded, and he acted decisively to rescue Shen Qinghe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Shen Qinghe's beautiful eyes lingered on Mo Yechen, causing an unprecedented ripple in his usually calm heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Thank you. I will repay this favor after the battle," Shen Qinghe nodded in gratitude, then immediately flew out of the core battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">She wasn't fleeing from battle; she had gone after Tu Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">When Tu Ming looked back and saw Shen Qinghe chasing him, he shuddered in anger and distress: "This crazy woman is after me again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Mo Yechen stared at Shen Qinghe's departing figure, feeling a sudden impulse to follow her. However, this hesitation lasted only a brief moment before he turned his attention back to Li Jiuchu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Fellow Daoist Li, let's continue our battle," Mo Yechen challenged loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Li Jiuchu, enraged and filled with hatred, started healing himself even as he struck back at Mo Yechen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">This time, however, unlike before, they fought evenly, locked in a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Elsewhere in the sprawling battlefield:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Eat! I'll give it all to you!" Jia Wan raised a hotpot high, dumping all sorts of freshly-cooked spiritual delicacies in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The Golden River Swallower, transformed into its true form - a three-legged golden toad - immediately felt a mouth-watering aroma. Seeing all the delicious spiritual foods, greed overwhelmed its senses, and it eagerly devoured them without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The next moment, the three-legged golden toad suddenly froze in place, its body swelling uncontrollably as massive amounts of spiritual energy and magical power erupted from hundreds of thousands of pores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Golden River Swallower instinctively clamped its mouth shut, yet energy continued to flood uncontrollably from its entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Utterly horrified, it tried reverting to human form but found its spiritual energy chaotic and impossible to control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"My ‘Intestine-Penetrating Heavenly Soup’ isn't something ordinary beings can handle!" The spiritual chef Ding Bi smiled gently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">With one strike, he'd decisively defeated The Golden River Swallower and made a great contribution!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The Golden River Swallowing Toad desperately exerted force from its three legs, frantically discharging fluids as it fled in embarrassment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“Chen Lingfeng, you idiot!” Gu Ya cursed, feeling utterly powerless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">In his madness, Chen Lingfeng had completely lost his senses, severely devastating Gu Ya’s wolf pack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">After several battles, Gu Ya’s wolves had nearly been wiped out. The demonic beasts he painstakingly nurtured for more than half his life were almost entirely lost!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Without his beasts, Gu Ya instantly lost his sense of security, his battle power significantly diminished. He was forced to swing his wolf-toothed club and fight bitterly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">“Time to retreat!” Bi Tengyi’s golden Core husband, the Verdant Vine King put away his stringless bow, leading his Ancient Vine Tribe members to withdraw voluntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">More and more cultivators and groups from Thousand Peaks Forest began retreating. Even those initially positioned on the battlefield’s edge showed signs of leaving the field altogether!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The situation on the battlefield was becoming clearer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Within the vast battlefield’s core area, the walls of the Two Note Kingdoms’ main camp had already collapsed by more than half amid the chaos, with most heavy weaponry destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The battle between Qianye and Song Ji had also reached its climax.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Qianye was an illusionary fox demon whose divided images were indistinguishable from the real body, and each image had offensive power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Song Ji, on the other hand, was a national oracle skilled in divination. Although not outstanding in direct combat among Nascent Soul cultivators, his predictive techniques allowed him to pinpoint Qianye’s true form easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Song Ji also excelled in utilizing others' strength, forcing Qianye to retreat step by step and finally withdrawing from the core battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">As more and more people withdrew, the morale of Thousand Peaks Forest continuously declined, its collapse accelerating rapidly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Magic - Blood Vortex Rapids!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The Demon Heart Cave Master's eyes had no pupils, only swirling blood vortexes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The blood vortexes spun faster, gradually expanding and overflowing from his eye sockets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">It was both offensive and defensive, capable of absorbing external attacks and tearing enemies apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Zhang Hei’s arm had already been devoured by this blood vortex!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Buddhist Art - Vajra Body Protection!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Martial Array - Zen Wind Flying Fist Formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Buddhist Art - Moonlight Universal Salvation Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Combined as one!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Mechanical Art - Golden Moon Zen Wind Fist!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo once again unleashed endless fist shadows, winds roaring, forcibly breaking through the blood vortex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">“An opportunity!” Mu Lan again drew her bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">This time, it was no longer a bluff!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Phoenix Emperor Bow, Burning Heart Arrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Divine Ability - Scarlet Heart Homing Arrow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">The arrow nearly pierced through space, incredibly swift, especially given their close distance. Perhaps due to previous feints, the Demon Heart Cave Master had become complacent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Almost instantly, the arrow pierced through the Demon Heart Cave Master's body, directly puncturing his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Despite the severe injury, the Demon Heart Cave Master survived!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">If Long Ye or Xiang Yue had suffered such critical heart damage, it would have been fatal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Yet, the Demon Heart Cave Master was different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">“I still have a backup heart!” Just as the Demon Heart Cave Master gloated, Ning Zhuo suddenly opened his mouth and released another attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Metal Element - Mystic Gold Slash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Metal Element - Temple of the Metal Lung!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Channeling all his power into this final strike!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">The Mystic Gold Slash shot into the Demon Heart Cave Master's open wound at lightning speed, entering his body and obliterating all his internal organs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">“How can such a domineering, straightforward Metal Art even bend?!” The Demon Heart Cave Master fell into total shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">He glared furiously at Ning Zhuo with immense grief and rage - this brat had concealed his true strength all along! If Ning Zhuo had revealed this earlier, he would’ve certainly prepared a countermeasure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">“You shall die with me!” Even in death, losing all his hearts, the Demon Heart Cave Master still had some mobility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">His dying counterattack struck Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Mu all showed drastic changes in their expressions. The Demon Heart Cave Master's final strike was terrifying; if it landed on them, there would be no chance of survival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">“Strategist!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">“Husband!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Before Ning Zhuo could even scream, his body dissolved in bloody light and explosions, utterly vaporized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Yet, in the next instant, Ning Zhuo reappeared nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">He was still shaken, his face filled with lingering fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">The Demon Heart Cave Master twisted his head, glaring fiercely at Ning Zhuo as the last breath of life dissipated into the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">A Substitute Talisman!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">A Space Escape Talisman!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">And the timely warning from his mechanical ring at the critical moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Together, these items allowed Ning Zhuo to narrowly evade this deadly catastrophe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">Thus, Ning Zhuo slew the Demon Heart Cave Master!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
