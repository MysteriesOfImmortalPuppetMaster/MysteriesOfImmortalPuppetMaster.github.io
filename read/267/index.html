<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The play concluded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Seeking Justice performance officially ended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Applause thundered from the audience, accompanied by continuous cheers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"I truly didn't expect that the young Ning Zhuo's puppet manipulation skills would be so adept and seasoned!" Many spectators were filled with admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">People looked towards the stage, where Ning Zhuo was stepping down the stairs, with newfound respect and surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Ning Zhuo... truly lives up to being the rising star of the righteous path recently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Some cultivators, with reddened eyes, were deeply moved: "Watching this Seeking Justice play was almost identical to the old director Li Leifeng's style." "Seeing Ning Zhuo makes me view the Ning family differently. I used to think this family from the Northern Wind Kingdom wasn't much when they came to our Southern Bean Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo smiled and stood at the center of the stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At this moment, Zhu Hou walked onto the stage, approached Ning Zhuo, and took the puppet handed over by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhu Hou saw the clear tear stains on the young man's face, and his smile became even warmer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He softened his voice, surprisingly gentle: "Young Master Ning Zhuo, your performance was a great success. From you, I see the future. Your future, the Ning family's future, and the future of Fire Persimmon Immortal City!" "Come, say a few words to everyone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands in gratitude towards Zhu Hou, then faced the audience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The applause gradually subsided until the venue was silent once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">While pondering his words, Ning Zhuo communicated with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Boss, how's the situation?" Through the Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo's inquiry reached Sun Lingtong's ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong coughed up blood, looking quite excited: "Hehe, with me personally taking action, are you still worried?" "It's done!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Ning Xiaohui has been eliminated, and I've refined her spirit, all stored in the spirit box you gave me." "Later, I'll enter the Medical Pavilion and place this item in the critical care room in advance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"We've dealt with Ning Xiaohui, Zhu Xuanji, and the Ning family will surely be furious. The coming period will be tense." "I'll lay low for a while, you be careful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo replied: "Indeed, it will be tense because next, I'm going to report you all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Huh?" Sun Lingtong was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">On the stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo scanned the cultivators below, with a sincere expression, and began: "Ladies and gentlemen, the play has ended, yet my gratitude flows like an endless river." "Though the judge was wronged, thanks to the wise king, justice was served, and righteousness prevailed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Even amidst dark storms, the righteous path shines like the bright sun, illuminating all directions, and justice resides in people's hearts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Here, I express my gratitude to the old director Li Leifeng, whose spirit of benevolence and sacrifice has become a guiding light for us, never to dim!" "Congratulations to Lord Zhu Hou for taking over the children's orphanage, and thank you all for your support." "May everyone present be safe and joyful, and may righteousness prevail in the world!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">With that, Ning Zhuo stepped down from the stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Thunderous applause erupted from the audience, with cheers echoing continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After Ning Zhuo stepped down, someone shouted to donate spirit stones again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">For a moment, many followed suit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The voices of donation echoed one after another!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zhu Hou watched with a smile, never expecting the puppet show by Ning Zhuo to have such a great effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He thought to himself: "Perhaps in the future, we can invite Ning Zhuo for charity performances? The traditions and habits left by the old director Li Leifeng are a treasure. It would be a pity not to continue them!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo walked off the stage, bid farewell to Zhu Hou, and headed straight to the private box upstairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Meanwhile, in the Lava Immortal Palace, Sun Lingtong had already reacted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He said to Ning Zhuo: "So, you're retreating to the second line of defense?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He was well aware of the defenses Ning Zhuo had set up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">These defenses were laid out in advance for the contest over the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">During the setup, Sun Lingtong's cooperation and contributions were significant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo's second line of defense was Chui Xu Ke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Once Ning Zhuo's identity as Chui Xu Ke was exposed, he would shift the blame to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">As for reporting the Void Sect and Sun Lingtong, it was a pre-agreed contingency plan between the two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">While ascending the stairs, Ning Zhuo responded to Sun Lingtong: "I don't know what clues Zhu Xuanji has grasped, but he bypassed the second line of defense and reached the third."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I don't know what this crucial clue is, and it's hard to probe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"I suspect this clue is related to the children's orphanage and Li Leifeng, but I can't be sure. For now, I can only go along with it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Perhaps Zhu Xuanji hasn't grasped any concrete evidence, and he's bluffing me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"But the safest response is to 'surrender' to him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly, agreeing with Ning Zhuo's choice: "I have a feeling it's related to Li Leifeng. Remember when he wanted to take you as a disciple? When you were two or three years old, you hadn't yet developed, leaving a flaw."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo acknowledged: "To cover up a lie, one often has to tell more lies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"The truth cannot be faked, and the fake cannot be true."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Even if we've prepared meticulously for over a decade, fully disguising ourselves, there will always be flaws."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"We can't withstand scrutiny; these defenses are merely to buy us the most critical time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"As long as we seize the Lava Immortal Palace before complete exposure, we will succeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo reached the second floor and continued towards the third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He inquired more information from Sun Lingtong, including the current state of Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"This time, we've exposed a lot. Yang Chanyu will definitely react, and we need to handle it properly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong chuckled: "Don't worry, she's in trouble now. She's been marked by a spell and is being chased by five Golden Core cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Oh?" Ning Zhuo asked for more details, then said, "Boss Sun, you need to head to the critical care room and place the spirit box."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Then, take the supreme virtuous water and give it to Yang Chanyu to dispel the tracking spell."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong was reluctant: "If she uses the supreme virtuous water, what about the monitoring on you, Little Zhuo? No way!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo: "I'm well aware of my situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Three drops of supreme virtuous water are definitely enough. Two drops would just be a bit unstable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Yang Chanyu cannot be lost!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"She already knows a lot and has many suspicions in her heart. We can't let her fall into enemy hands."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Next, we'll face the furious Zhu Xuanji. We can't predict how strong he will be in full force."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Moreover, Meng Kui will not stand idly by. It's likely that Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui will join forces to fully target the third force, the Void Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Sun Lingtong's expression turned serious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo was absolutely right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The thought of facing the combined forces of Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui made him feel immense pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He chuckled: "The Lava Immortal Palace, Meng Kui can't enter. Even Zhu Xuanji has many places he can't reach. It's an excellent hiding spot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo sighed: "The Historical Records Pavilion has already been destroyed. Don't harbor such wishful thinking. Otherwise, you'll suffer greatly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sun Lingtong's heart sank, and he put away his smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Indeed, such things done by Ning Zhuo and the dragon turtle fire spirit could be imitated by Zhu Xuanji and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong's eyes shifted: "Perhaps... we should release the information about the imperial examination?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">As the saying goes, great minds think alike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo smiled lightly: "I've been considering this too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He reached the third floor and entered the private box.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Taking a deep breath, Ning Zhuo gently pushed the door open and walked in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Zhu Xuanji was sipping tea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Seeing him enter, he slightly raised his head, expressionless, with deep eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo also remained expressionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He gently closed the door, took a few steps forward, then half-knelt, and said in a deep voice: "Lord Zhu Xuanji, this junior Ning Zhuo, is guilty!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zhu Xuanji's gaze softened, his voice still calm, with a hint of coldness: "Oh? What is your crime?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo's Adam's apple moved, staring at the floor tiles, opened his mouth, and finally spoke: "I secretly contacted demonic cultivators and once secretly assisted them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Zhu Xuanji: "Oh? At your young age, misjudging people is a common mistake. Which demonic cultivators are they? How did you assist them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, as if making a firm decision, and said through gritted teeth: "It's Sun Lingtong, it's the Void Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"I developed the Mechanical Fire Monkey, which might be their scheme. I realized it too late."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"I suspect they've been plotting the Lava Immortal Palace all along."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"I..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo couldn't continue, his voice dry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Zhu Xuanji sighed, feeling pleased inside, and slowly stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">This time, he only had clues and some suspicions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">By leveraging the children's orphanage and the Seeking Justice play, he tricked Ning Zhuo into confessing, which naturally delighted him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">But outwardly, he maintained a heavy expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He walked to Ning Zhuo, bent down, and helped him up: "Young man, you seized the opportunity I gave you, turned from darkness to light, and confessed voluntarily. Well done."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"I didn't misjudge you, and you didn't disappoint me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"To err is human."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Besides, I've known your circumstances since childhood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"I allow you to redeem yourself through meritorious deeds!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Come, tell me everything you know in detail."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Zhu Xuanji turned, walking back to his seat, and said: "We still have enough time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Is it really enough?" Ning Zhuo followed behind Zhu Xuanji, looking at his back, and couldn't help but wonder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zhu Xuanji sat down, while Ning Zhuo stood beside him, speaking bitterly: "This matter is a long story. It starts from my childhood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Back then, shortly after my mother passed away, I accidentally saved someone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"This person appeared as a child like me, but he was actually a demonic cultivator..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">As Ning Zhuo spoke, a name popped into Zhu Xuanji's mindâ€”Sun Lingtong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Contacted over a decade ago?" Zhu Xuanji was surprised, not expecting Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong to have known each other for so long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">As Ning Zhuo continued, Zhu Xuanji's thoughts naturally followed, deducing how Sun Lingtong discovered and cultivated Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"So, my previous suspicions were correct."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"There really is a third-party force, the Void Sect, they are the masterminds!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
