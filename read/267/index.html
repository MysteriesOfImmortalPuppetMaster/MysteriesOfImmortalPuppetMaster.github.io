<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The play concluded.<br/>
<br/>
The Seeking Justice performance officially ended.<br/>
<br/>
Applause thundered from the audience, accompanied by continuous cheers.<br/>
<br/>
"I truly didn't expect that the young Ning Zhuo's puppet manipulation skills would be so adept and seasoned!" Many spectators were filled with admiration.<br/>
<br/>
People looked towards the stage, where Ning Zhuo was stepping down the stairs, with newfound respect and surprise.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo... truly lives up to being the rising star of the righteous path recently."<br/>
<br/>
Some cultivators, with reddened eyes, were deeply moved: "Watching this Seeking Justice play was almost identical to the old director Li Leifeng's style." "Seeing Ning Zhuo makes me view the Ning family differently. I used to think this family from the Northern Wind Kingdom wasn't much when they came to our Southern Bean Kingdom."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled and stood at the center of the stage.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Zhu Hou walked onto the stage, approached Ning Zhuo, and took the puppet handed over by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Hou saw the clear tear stains on the young man's face, and his smile became even warmer.<br/>
<br/>
He softened his voice, surprisingly gentle: "Young Master Ning Zhuo, your performance was a great success. From you, I see the future. Your future, the Ning family's future, and the future of Fire Persimmon Immortal City!" "Come, say a few words to everyone."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cupped his hands in gratitude towards Zhu Hou, then faced the audience.<br/>
<br/>
The applause gradually subsided until the venue was silent once more.<br/>
<br/>
While pondering his words, Ning Zhuo communicated with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss, how's the situation?" Through the Life-Hanging Thread, Ning Zhuo's inquiry reached Sun Lingtong's ears.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong coughed up blood, looking quite excited: "Hehe, with me personally taking action, are you still worried?" "It's done!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui has been eliminated, and I've refined her spirit, all stored in the spirit box you gave me." "Later, I'll enter the Medical Pavilion and place this item in the critical care room in advance."<br/>
<br/>
"We've dealt with Ning Xiaohui, Zhu Xuanji, and the Ning family will surely be furious. The coming period will be tense." "I'll lay low for a while, you be careful!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo replied: "Indeed, it will be tense because next, I'm going to report you all."<br/>
<br/>
"Huh?" Sun Lingtong was stunned.<br/>
<br/>
On the stage.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo scanned the cultivators below, with a sincere expression, and began: "Ladies and gentlemen, the play has ended, yet my gratitude flows like an endless river." "Though the judge was wronged, thanks to the wise king, justice was served, and righteousness prevailed."<br/>
<br/>
"Even amidst dark storms, the righteous path shines like the bright sun, illuminating all directions, and justice resides in people's hearts."<br/>
<br/>
"Here, I express my gratitude to the old director Li Leifeng, whose spirit of benevolence and sacrifice has become a guiding light for us, never to dim!" "Congratulations to Lord Zhu Hou for taking over the children's orphanage, and thank you all for your support." "May everyone present be safe and joyful, and may righteousness prevail in the world!"<br/>
<br/>
With that, Ning Zhuo stepped down from the stage.<br/>
<br/>
Thunderous applause erupted from the audience, with cheers echoing continuously.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo stepped down, someone shouted to donate spirit stones again.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, many followed suit.<br/>
<br/>
The voices of donation echoed one after another!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Hou watched with a smile, never expecting the puppet show by Ning Zhuo to have such a great effect.<br/>
<br/>
He thought to himself: "Perhaps in the future, we can invite Ning Zhuo for charity performances? The traditions and habits left by the old director Li Leifeng are a treasure. It would be a pity not to continue them!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo walked off the stage, bid farewell to Zhu Hou, and headed straight to the private box upstairs.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, in the Lava Immortal Palace, Sun Lingtong had already reacted.<br/>
<br/>
He said to Ning Zhuo: "So, you're retreating to the second line of defense?"<br/>
<br/>
He was well aware of the defenses Ning Zhuo had set up.<br/>
<br/>
These defenses were laid out in advance for the contest over the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
During the setup, Sun Lingtong's cooperation and contributions were significant.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's second line of defense was Chui Xu Ke.<br/>
<br/>
Once Ning Zhuo's identity as Chui Xu Ke was exposed, he would shift the blame to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
As for reporting the Void Sect and Sun Lingtong, it was a pre-agreed contingency plan between the two.<br/>
<br/>
While ascending the stairs, Ning Zhuo responded to Sun Lingtong: "I don't know what clues Zhu Xuanji has grasped, but he bypassed the second line of defense and reached the third."<br/>
<br/>
"I don't know what this crucial clue is, and it's hard to probe."<br/>
<br/>
"I suspect this clue is related to the children's orphanage and Li Leifeng, but I can't be sure. For now, I can only go along with it."<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps Zhu Xuanji hasn't grasped any concrete evidence, and he's bluffing me."<br/>
<br/>
"But the safest response is to 'surrender' to him!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly, agreeing with Ning Zhuo's choice: "I have a feeling it's related to Li Leifeng. Remember when he wanted to take you as a disciple? When you were two or three years old, you hadn't yet developed, leaving a flaw."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo acknowledged: "To cover up a lie, one often has to tell more lies."<br/>
<br/>
"The truth cannot be faked, and the fake cannot be true."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if we've prepared meticulously for over a decade, fully disguising ourselves, there will always be flaws."<br/>
<br/>
"We can't withstand scrutiny; these defenses are merely to buy us the most critical time."<br/>
<br/>
"As long as we seize the Lava Immortal Palace before complete exposure, we will succeed!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo reached the second floor and continued towards the third.<br/>
<br/>
He inquired more information from Sun Lingtong, including the current state of Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
"This time, we've exposed a lot. Yang Chanyu will definitely react, and we need to handle it properly!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong chuckled: "Don't worry, she's in trouble now. She's been marked by a spell and is being chased by five Golden Core cultivators."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh?" Ning Zhuo asked for more details, then said, "Boss Sun, you need to head to the critical care room and place the spirit box."<br/>
<br/>
"Then, take the supreme virtuous water and give it to Yang Chanyu to dispel the tracking spell."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was reluctant: "If she uses the supreme virtuous water, what about the monitoring on you, Little Zhuo? No way!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "I'm well aware of my situation."<br/>
<br/>
"Three drops of supreme virtuous water are definitely enough. Two drops would just be a bit unstable."<br/>
<br/>
"Yang Chanyu cannot be lost!"<br/>
<br/>
"She already knows a lot and has many suspicions in her heart. We can't let her fall into enemy hands."<br/>
<br/>
"Next, we'll face the furious Zhu Xuanji. We can't predict how strong he will be in full force."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, Meng Kui will not stand idly by. It's likely that Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui will join forces to fully target the third force, the Void Sect!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's expression turned serious.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was absolutely right.<br/>
<br/>
The thought of facing the combined forces of Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui made him feel immense pressure.<br/>
<br/>
He chuckled: "The Lava Immortal Palace, Meng Kui can't enter. Even Zhu Xuanji has many places he can't reach. It's an excellent hiding spot."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed: "The Historical Records Pavilion has already been destroyed. Don't harbor such wishful thinking. Otherwise, you'll suffer greatly."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's heart sank, and he put away his smile.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, such things done by Ning Zhuo and the dragon turtle fire spirit could be imitated by Zhu Xuanji and others.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes shifted: "Perhaps... we should release the information about the imperial examination?"<br/>
<br/>
As the saying goes, great minds think alike.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled lightly: "I've been considering this too."<br/>
<br/>
He reached the third floor and entered the private box.<br/>
<br/>
Taking a deep breath, Ning Zhuo gently pushed the door open and walked in.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was sipping tea.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing him enter, he slightly raised his head, expressionless, with deep eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also remained expressionless.<br/>
<br/>
He gently closed the door, took a few steps forward, then half-knelt, and said in a deep voice: "Lord Zhu Xuanji, this junior Ning Zhuo, is guilty!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's gaze softened, his voice still calm, with a hint of coldness: "Oh? What is your crime?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's Adam's apple moved, staring at the floor tiles, opened his mouth, and finally spoke: "I secretly contacted demonic cultivators and once secretly assisted them."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji: "Oh? At your young age, misjudging people is a common mistake. Which demonic cultivators are they? How did you assist them?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, as if making a firm decision, and said through gritted teeth: "It's Sun Lingtong, it's the Void Sect!"<br/>
<br/>
"I developed the Mechanical Fire Monkey, which might be their scheme. I realized it too late."<br/>
<br/>
"I suspect they've been plotting the Lava Immortal Palace all along."<br/>
<br/>
"I..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn't continue, his voice dry.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji sighed, feeling pleased inside, and slowly stood up.<br/>
<br/>
This time, he only had clues and some suspicions.<br/>
<br/>
By leveraging the children's orphanage and the Seeking Justice play, he tricked Ning Zhuo into confessing, which naturally delighted him.<br/>
<br/>
But outwardly, he maintained a heavy expression.<br/>
<br/>
He walked to Ning Zhuo, bent down, and helped him up: "Young man, you seized the opportunity I gave you, turned from darkness to light, and confessed voluntarily. Well done."<br/>
<br/>
"I didn't misjudge you, and you didn't disappoint me!"<br/>
<br/>
"To err is human."<br/>
<br/>
"Besides, I've known your circumstances since childhood."<br/>
<br/>
"I allow you to redeem yourself through meritorious deeds!"<br/>
<br/>
"Come, tell me everything you know in detail."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji turned, walking back to his seat, and said: "We still have enough time."<br/>
<br/>
"Is it really enough?" Ning Zhuo followed behind Zhu Xuanji, looking at his back, and couldn't help but wonder.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji sat down, while Ning Zhuo stood beside him, speaking bitterly: "This matter is a long story. It starts from my childhood."<br/>
<br/>
"Back then, shortly after my mother passed away, I accidentally saved someone."<br/>
<br/>
"This person appeared as a child like me, but he was actually a demonic cultivator..."<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo spoke, a name popped into Zhu Xuanji's mind‚ÄîSun Lingtong!<br/>
<br/>
"Contacted over a decade ago?" Zhu Xuanji was surprised, not expecting Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong to have known each other for so long.<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo continued, Zhu Xuanji's thoughts naturally followed, deducing how Sun Lingtong discovered and cultivated Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"So, my previous suspicions were correct."<br/>
<br/>
"There really is a third-party force, the Void Sect, they are the masterminds!"</div>
