<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
At the Little Contention Peak’s training grounds, Ning Zhuo and Han Zhou were sparring.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou's combat style was entirely different from Lin Shanshan's. His attacks were aggressive and domineering, dominating the battle with aggressive strikes, rarely defending unless his vital points were at risk. Once he began his assault, his attacks came relentlessly, like a snowstorm enveloping everything.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth and held his ground, feeling like he was once again back at the beginning when he first sparred with Lin Shanshan—forced into defense, unable to counterattack.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou noticed Ning Zhuo's tight defense, his posture solid and disciplined, and couldn't help but feel surprised.<br/>
<br/>
"How has he improved so much in such a short time?" Han Zhou thought.<br/>
<br/>
His intuition was more acute than others. Not long ago, he had actively challenged Ning Zhuo. During their fight, they engaged in close combat, and it didn’t take many exchanges before Ning Zhuo's defense crumbled, allowing Han Zhou to press the attack. If it hadn't been for Ning Zhuo’s use of talismans, he would have lost back then.<br/>
<br/>
But now, despite Han Zhou going all out with his offensive, Ning Zhuo was holding firm. Although Ning Zhuo appeared ragged and strained, his defense was solid, forcing Han Zhou to consider alternative ways to break through the stalemate.<br/>
<br/>
"Be careful, I’m going to use martial techniques now," Han Zhou warned in a low voice.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, his fists were covered in a layer of white frost, and the temperature around them plummeted.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Technique—Frost Fist.<br/>
<br/>
A biting cold radiated from Han Zhou's fists.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo knew better than to take it head-on. His toes lightly tapped the ground as he nimbly leaped backward, avoiding the attack. Han Zhou pursued closely.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo focused on evasion, moving fluidly, each step light and swift, displaying his well-practiced fundamentals.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Technique—Frozen Leg.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou's leg swept out, accompanied by a chilling wind. Ning Zhuo struggled to parry, clearly at a disadvantage. After a prolonged defense, he finally showed a flaw. Han Zhou's eyes flashed, seizing the opening. He struck out with a powerful punch infused with frigid energy, aimed directly at Ning Zhuo's face.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes narrowed as he tried to sidestep the blow. He managed to dodge most of it, but Han Zhou's punch still landed on his shoulder. Staggering back, Ning Zhuo's defensive stance finally collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
However, Han Zhou withdrew his attack, standing still without pressing his advantage.<br/>
<br/>
"Impressive, very impressive!" Ning Zhuo said, clutching his shoulder, though the pain was secondary to his satisfaction. He genuinely praised Han Zhou.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, Ning Zhuo's training with Lin Shanshan had yielded diminishing results, as his insights into martial techniques and combat gradually waned. But now, his sparring with Han Zhou reignited those feelings. Even though the match hadn't lasted long, Ning Zhuo felt he'd gained a lot, and there were many things he needed to review and commit to memory.<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you, Han Zhou. Sparring with you was exactly what I needed. I’ve learned so much today, thank you!" Ning Zhuo said sincerely.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou’s eyes flickered. He had ulterior motives—after all, the more Ning Zhuo sparred with him, the more susceptible he became to being converted to Han Zhou’s cultivation path.<br/>
<br/>
After all, Ning Zhuo was only in the Foundation Establishment stage, not the Golden Core stage. It was still possible to change his cultivation methods!<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou thought for a moment and acknowledged Ning Zhuo’s progress, noting how different this fight felt compared to their last.<br/>
<br/>
"But you're lacking in martial techniques. Otherwise, you could have resisted my Frost Fist and Frozen Leg," Han Zhou pointed out.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, the cultivation method you practice focuses heavily on the qi sea, which naturally puts you at a disadvantage in close combat."<br/>
<br/>
"I suggest you learn some martial techniques. Though they are not as profound as cultivation methods, they can still help you utilize your physical strength and energy more effectively."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s interest was piqued. "Do you have any recommendations, Brother Han Zhou? I'm all ears!"<br/>
<br/>
Without hesitation, Han Zhou offered, "If you're willing, I could teach you Frost Fist, Frozen Leg, and other martial techniques."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately frowned. "Would that be appropriate?"<br/>
<br/>
"It’s perfectly appropriate!" Han Zhou thought to himself with a grin. "Learning these techniques will only make you more inclined to cultivate cold-based methods. If I can ultimately convert you, wouldn't that be a great benefit?"<br/>
<br/>
On the surface, Han Zhou replied earnestly, "Ning Zhuo, you have a natural affinity for cold-based techniques, as shown by your ability to grasp the essence of the Frost Sutra so quickly. It’s fate!"<br/>
<br/>
"We’ve come to know each other through sparring, and passing on a few martial techniques is no big deal. They aren’t core cultivation methods, after all."<br/>
<br/>
"In fact, even the Frost Sutra is not something that can’t be taught. Back in the day, I was just a beggar, and I only started on the path of cultivation because someone taught me the Frost Sutra in a dilapidated temple amidst the snow."<br/>
<br/>
"By teaching you these martial techniques, I’m only paying forward the kindness I once received."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded thoughtfully. "Hearing you say this confirms some of my suspicions. The Frost Sutra is indeed a Buddhist scripture, isn’t it?"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou hesitated for a moment before nodding. "Yes, that's correct. But please, Ning Zhuo, keep this knowledge to yourself, as it reveals much about my background."<br/>
<br/>
"The Frost Sutra comes from Mahayana Buddhism and emphasizes self-liberation. As the saying goes, ‘The sea of suffering has no bounds; only by enduring the bitter cold can one cultivate the body and will.’ The Frost Sutra transforms the hardships and poverty of life into resources for cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. "In that case, I’ll have to ask Brother Han Zhou to teach me these martial techniques."<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou smiled faintly. "I have a method that can help you master them quickly."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked intrigued and asked for more details.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou then pulled out a small bowl from his storage belt. The bowl was filled with water, up to eighty percent.<br/>
<br/>
"Back when I was taught the Frost Sutra, this very object was used."<br/>
<br/>
"This water is known as Bitter Water, refined from countless hardships, containing deep insights into the Frost Sutra. If you drink just a small amount, you’ll instantly grasp the key elements of several martial techniques and master them completely."<br/>
<br/>
"However, this method isn't suitable for everyone. The bitterness of the water is so extreme that it can plunge a person into deep depression, making the world seem gray and lifeless, sometimes driving them to suicide."<br/>
<br/>
"But since you’ve already endured my cold energy and grasped parts of the Frost Sutra, I can tell that you’re highly talented and naturally attuned to this Buddhist scripture."<br/>
<br/>
"Why not give it a try?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked at the water, which had a deep, dark-blue color, its surface emitting a faint, cold light. Standing close, he could feel the bone-chilling cold radiating from it, as if it could freeze his very soul.<br/>
<br/>
"I’ve heard of Bitter Water before," Ning Zhuo remarked. "It’s a treasure of the water element, associated with sin and suffering."<br/>
<br/>
In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had encountered “Supreme Virtue Water,” a treasure of merit and virtue, and now he was seeing its opposite, Bitter Water—a treasure of sin.<br/>
<br/>
The existence of Bitter Water symbolized suffering itself. Legends said it was formed from countless tears of pain and regret. Those who held or touched Bitter Water would be forced to confront their deepest regrets, grievances, and sorrows. Prolonged exposure would erode one’s spirit, plunging cultivators into endless torment.<br/>
<br/>
This erosion could lead to hallucinations, with the afflicted hearing constant cries of sorrow in their ears, whispering of their miseries.<br/>
<br/>
It was a truly terrible torture.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo showed a cautious expression.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou reassured him, "Don’t worry, this Bitter Water has been refined. Under my guidance, it will allow you to comprehend parts of the Frost Sutra and master seven martial techniques instantly."<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, there is a risk."<br/>
<br/>
"The risk is that you must withstand the bitterness and learn from it, rather than letting it overwhelm your emotions and drown your mind in sorrow."<br/>
<br/>
"If you fail, you won’t just miss out on learning martial techniques—you might need a significant amount of time and resources just to recover."<br/>
<br/>
"The risk is high."<br/>
<br/>
After a brief consideration, Ning Zhuo smiled. "I trust you, Brother Han Zhou! Let’s give it a try."<br/>
<br/>
"However, the training grounds aren’t the best place for this."<br/>
<br/>
"May I take some of the Bitter Water with me?"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou nodded. "Of course."<br/>
<br/>
He carefully poured a small amount into a vial and handed it to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
After bidding farewell to Han Zhou, Ning Zhuo returned to his cave dwelling. First, he and Sun Lingtong inspected the Bitter Water carefully to confirm that it had indeed been refined and was no longer as dangerous as raw Bitter Water.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then asked Sun Lingtong to watch over him as he attempted to drink the water.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, always curious, eagerly requested that Ning Zhuo save him some so he could try it too, as he had never tasted it before.<br/>
<br/>
The two entered the Spirit Plant Chamber together.<br/>
<br/>
Inside, the golden-yellow soil had noticeably lightened since the last time, though it was only a thin layer. In reality, due to the array folding space, the soil was much deeper than it appeared.<br/>
<br/>
At the center of the chamber stood the Spirit Concealment Willow, its branches swaying gently in the soft breeze, producing a clear, melodious sound.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong both looked at the Spirit Concealment Willow, observing it closely. Ning Zhuo furrowed his brow, while Sun Lingtong smiled in delight.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother, look! The once-dried branches are starting to recover. They were completely withered before, but now they seem plumper," Sun Lingtong said.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed. "It seems the Spirit Concealment Willow is consuming more resources than I had anticipated."<br/>
<br/>
"We’ve already used the best materials available to us, but the recovery speed still isn’t ideal."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked down at the soil around the willow’s roots and released his spiritual sense into the earth, noticing that the Five-Colored Divine Sand and the Three-Treasure Spiritual Soil had nearly been depleted, with less than ten percent of the original amount remaining.<br/>
<br/>
They had also poured in Starlight Spiritual Liquid earlier, and while the soil had been moist, it now felt dry. The liquid had been entirely absorbed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo made a quick decision. "It seems this Spirit Concealment Willow will be difficult to sustain. We’ll need to continue investing resources just to keep it alive."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong frowned. "Standard methods probably won’t be enough. Lin Shanshan is the beloved daughter of the Nascent Soul Sect Master, and even she got locked up over this."<br/>
<br/>
"But I’m sure the Myriad Medicine Sect has more spiritual soil and divine sand available. Otherwise..."<br/>
