<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Outside White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Underworld Army Barracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Sun Lingtong scanned the surroundings, transmitting every sight and sound through Life Hanging by a Thread to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo "saw" massive numbers of Yin Soldiers applying a medicinal ointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The soldiers opened the ointment, then spread it evenly over their bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">As the ointment was applied, it often emitted the sounds of creatures' dying screams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">These sounds were absorbed into the Yin Soldiers' bodies, quickly dissipating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sun Lingtong provided a timely explanation: "I've inquired about this. This medicinal pill is called Death Echo Cascade Ointment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"It's primarily made from Underworld Grass, Moonshadow Dew, and Ghost Flower Mud. Currently, the entire Yin Soldier army applies this ointment daily at fixed times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"At first, the effects are negligible, but with repeated use, they accumulate. Eventually, the death echoes reshape the soul, forming a protective heavy armor effect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sun Lingtong added a crucial warning: "However, since this medicine temporarily alters the soul, once its effects wear off, it leaves the soul in extreme weakness. Without subsequent intake of other medicinal pills, it can cause severe aftereffects such as soul distortion, memory confusion, and loss of intelligence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo suddenly recalled the dangerous maneuver he had witnessed during the great battle in the Two Note Kingdom, where their army had increased their heavy armor at great risk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Realizing the severity of the situation, he exclaimed, "So the Yin Soldier army is actively preparing for a decisive battle!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"This Yin Soldier army initially stationed here was relatively small. But after enduring so many Ghost Tides, continuously absorbing ghostly creatures, and receiving reinforcements from the Forgetful River Prefecture, their numbers have now approached a hundred thousand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"If they launch a full-scale assault, can the White Paper Immortal City withstand it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo felt immense pressure weighing on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Although he held the title of Vice City Lord, the White Paper City Lord had never truly delegated authority to him. Therefore, Ning Zhuo remained completely unaware of the White Paper Immortal City's true capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">At most, he knew that the Paper Giant possessed Nascent Soul-level combat strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"The true key to this great battle lies not in the White Paper Immortal City, but in the Forgetful River Prefecture!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Due to Meng Yaoyin's arrangements, Ning Zhuo had access to comprehensive intelligence. However, he had not revealed details about the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual or the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Keeping these secrets intact did not hinder the White Paper City Lord, Yang Sanyan, Wen Ruanyu, and others from actively preparing their defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sun Lingtong asked, "Little Zhuo, we don't have much time left."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"How is the Qing-Jiao Army holding up?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Can you guarantee they'll have the courage to charge into the Underworld at the final moment, fighting to the death?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Even if you've used Life Hanging by a Thread to control Qing Chi, though this young lady has won the soldiers' hearts, can she order the Qing-Jiao Army to risk their lives in battle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo sighed. "We need to plan this carefully."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He severed his connection with Sun Lingtong, pondered briefly, then summoned Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Upon hearing Ning Zhuo wished to see her, Qing Chi's face lit up with delight as she hurried to his residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Little Ma, have you missed me?" Qing Chi greeted him with her usual enthusiasm. "You're always either cultivating or busy with the City Lord's affairs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Now that you've uncovered the Internal Traitor, you can finally rest properly. I'll keep you company, and we can do whatever we like!" Her eyes burned with passion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo's scalp began tingling with unease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He cleared his throat. "Miss Qing Chi, although we've identified an Internal Traitor, we didn't capture him alive. That means we can't obtain crucial intelligence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"We don't know if there are other traitors lurking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"In these circumstances, it's best to maintain our previous caution and vigilance. We shouldn't let our guard down."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Moreover, the enemy forces outside the city now number nearly a hundred thousand. With White Paper Immortal City's situation critical, we can't afford to relax our guard!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Qing Chi, though deeply fond of Jiao Ma, understood the bigger picture. She sighed, "Thanks to you, Little Ma, we secured the Myriad Manifestations Sect's investment. Now that we've cleared the Military Logistics hurdle, we have two foundational principles for the Military System in place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"When I grasp the third principle, we can advance to the next stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Once we perfect our weaponry, the Qing-Jiao Army will be officially established."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"It's a pity we're still a step behind. Had we formed our army earlier, we could have struck while the enemy was first establishing their camp. We might have even annihilated them then."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Now they've not only secured their position but grown in numbers. If the Qing-Jiao Army were to engage them outside the city walls, it would be certain death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo pondered silently, holding a different perspective on this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"This may well be the evolution of the Yang Heaven's fate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Yang Heaven intends to mete out divine punishment upon the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, hence all these preparations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"According to the Ash Bone Elder's plan, the Qing-Jiao Army is precisely the weapon meant to confront the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Under normal circumstances, establishing a new army would be too difficult. Not only would resources be required, but all factions would need to reach consensus. White Paper Immortal City possesses substantial wealth, so why hasn't it established a cultivation army yet?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Having spent considerable time here, Ning Zhuo gradually came to understand the deeper political dynamics at play.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"If this is Heaven's arrangement, then I must bring the Qing-Jiao Army to its destined stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"However, before that, I must do everything to strengthen this army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"I believe Yang Heaven chose me as the savior precisely because of what I possess."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Since that's the case, I'll follow Heaven's will."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo had long made up his mind. With this thought, he produced a helmet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Qing Chi immediately cast a curious gaze upon it. The helmet was half-spherical with a wide faceplate, its top slightly curved backward like a phoenix about to spread its wings. Its bronze hue bore numerous scratches and dents - clear marks of battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Ah, this is military equipment!" Qing Chi exclaimed in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Though military systems come first, military equipment is the next step."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"But receiving this now is too early."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The ghost girl then gazed tenderly at Ning Zhuo. "Little Ma, I knew you loved me. You've prepared so many treasures for me. Though this military equipment is damaged, I still cherish it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Thank you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo's expression turned solemn. "Miss Qing Chi, you misunderstand. This military equipment isn't a gift. It's merely on loan for your use."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"It's a component of the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Ghostmen girl: ?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Seeing her puzzled look, Ning Zhuo realized she knew nothing about the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor and proceeded to explain in detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Qing Chi couldn't help but examine the helmet again. "So it's actually a treasure. But if it's so prestigious, what use is it to us?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo replied, "You'll need to combine it with this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Qing Chi watched as the youth produced a book.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This book was made entirely of metal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">On its cover stood four bold characters - Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings - each stroke vigorous and forceful. The sight alone felt like a raging storm, radiating an indescribable pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"A military manual?" Qing Chi's eyes lit up. "I've read many manuals before. They're not difficult at all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">She curiously took hold of Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings, flipped through a few pages, then asked in confusion, "Aiya, this book is too damaged. The contents aren't complete at all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "These two items must be used together. Try it - the effect should be remarkable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Long ago, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had used these two treasures. One had comprehended the Light Body Swift Wind Formation, while the other had grasped the Hero's Return Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo, recognizing Qing Chi's innate talent as a Military Strategist, believed she would gain even greater insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Qing Chi nodded. "Alright, Little Ma, I'll follow your guidance. Teach me how to use them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After some instruction, Qing Chi donned the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor, channeled her divine sense into the Military Manual, and closed her eyes in deep contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Observing from the side, Ning Zhuo soon noticed something peculiar. Both the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor and Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings began to glow, resonating with the Military Seed within Qing Chi's body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The three radiant energies merged into a single luminous stream, shining brightly for the duration of an incense stick's burn before simultaneously fading away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Did you gain any insights?" Ning Zhuo asked as soon as Qing Chi slowly opened her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Seeing Ning Zhuo's concerned expression, a warm current flowed through Qing Chi's heart. She eagerly exclaimed, "I've comprehended two military strategies! One is called Money-Communicating Ghost, and the other is Life-Buying Coin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo was momentarily surprised but quickly accepted this development. He had always anticipated Qing Chi's exceptional talent in military arts, and now it proved true - she was indeed extraordinary!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Explain them in detail," Ning Zhuo pressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Qing Chi, holding nothing back from her beloved, immediately revealed the full details of both strategies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The military strategy Money-Communicating Ghost could consume military funds to recruit a batch of ghostly creatures as soldiers, supplementing the Qing-Jiao Army's ranks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The military strategy Life-Buying Coin would expend military funds to create a powerful healing force, curing the entire army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Both of these are remarkably practical!" Ning Zhuo nodded, feeling both delight and bewilderment. "But why are they both tied to military funds?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Qing Chi scratched her head, embarrassed. "Perhaps I've been too influenced by the recent expenses of building the army. Such vast resources - even if I worked for hundreds of lifetimes, I couldn't possibly earn that much!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo looked at Qing Chi, his admiration plain. "You possess extraordinary talent as a Military Strategist. Miss Qing Chi, you mustn't underestimate yourself. Your future achievements will undoubtedly be great."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Qing Chi was so delighted she nearly jumped up. "Little Ma, you believe in me that much? Haha, I knew it! You want to nurture me into greatness, then take me far away with you someday, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo coughed twice, denying it firmly. "Not at all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Enough with the distractions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Do you remember the spell the Qing-Jiao Army mastered - Human-Ghost Visage?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">With the support of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Military Seed had steadily advanced. The entire Qing-Jiao Army had been trained by the Military Seed, subsequently mastering numerous spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Among these techniques was one called Human-Ghost Visage. When activated, this spell allowed soldiers to temporarily transform into either a pure human form or a ghostly one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">In human form, they became members of the Human Race. In ghost form, they became ghostly creatures!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo observed, "Your recent study of military strategy has been heavily influenced by the Military Seed. I recommend immediate specialized training to master these two strategies as soon as possible. This will greatly benefit the Qing-Jiao Army and save many lives in future battles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Half of the Qing-Jiao Army members were related to Qing Chi by blood or marriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Hearing this, Qing Chi grew solemn. "I will practice diligently!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo then approached the City Lord, requesting access to her Cultivation Chamber. He sought to utilize the temporal development within to accelerate Qing Chi's practical training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">On the third day, Qing Chi rushed excitedly to Ning Zhuo's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Little Ma, I've comprehended a third Military System!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Just as she spoke, her stomach grumbled audibly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo, who was eating, chuckled at the sound. "Have you eaten? If not, let's eat together while we discuss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Qing Chi had been training relentlessly, day and night, striving to master the two military strategies as soon as possible. This would allow her to save the lives of one or two family members during combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">She truly hadn't eaten yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">She immediately sat down and took a few bites of food. "Pah! Pah! Pah!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Qing Chi spat it out immediately. "What is this? Is it even food for humans?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo shook his head solemnly. "The taste might not be great, but it enhances your foundation. Do you know how much that mouthful you just spat out was worth?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">When Ning Zhuo gave the number, Qing Chi's face paled. She stared at the Spirit Food with wide eyes. "I was wrong. I shouldn't have wasted it. I'll eat it—no matter how bitter, I can handle it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">With a twisted expression, Qing Chi swallowed the Spirit Food, experiencing both pain and a strange sense of satisfaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">These Spirit Foods were highly effective yet incredibly unpalatable, crafted by the Spirit Chef Elder of the Dark Cuisine School.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">It turned out that when the Spirit Chef Elder had initially agreed to the City Lord Clone's request to confess and use his life to stabilize the citizens' morale, Ning Zhuo had later uncovered the Internal Traitor, indirectly saving the elder's life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">After learning of this, the elder immediately sought out Ning Zhuo, expressing his desire to repay this life-saving grace by offering his humble services.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo arranged for the elder to prepare Spirit Foods for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">While they ate, Ning Zhuo asked Qing Chi about the third Military System.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Qing Chi answered, "It's called 'Father and Son on the Battlefield'!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo immediately understood what had triggered Qing Chi's realization of this principle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Qing Chi, single-mindedly focused on mastering the previous two military strategies, had come to deeply understand that the Qing-Jiao Army consisted of two main groups: the Ghost Clan Qing Family and the Human Jiao Clan. Regardless of which clan, Qing Chi felt a sense of familial connection to both.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">From this, they had grasped the third military system: "On the battlefield, father and son fight as one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Now they had collected all three military systems:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Strict discipline with swift execution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">A single year's training equals ten years' accumulation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Father and son fight as one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">These three military systems formed the foundational style of the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">First, their military discipline was strict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Second, their military funding was substantial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Third, they were bound by familial ties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">After establishing the army, they could continue adding more military systems. But with these three in place, they could proceed to the next phase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"It's time to prepare our military equipment," Ning Zhuo said, standing up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Qing Chi asked, "Aren't you going to eat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "I was just sampling. This food is all for the Qing-Jiao Army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"I'll go find some supporters right away. Maybe we can get some funding to help us through the military equipment phase."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Even though there are more stages after this, they're all just about building a strong and elite army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Once we finish preparing our military equipment, establishing the army will be complete!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Qing Chi was surprised again. Looking at the table full of spirit food, she said, "Are we really going to give all this spirit food to our Qing-Jiao Army? Isn't that too extravagant?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">When it came to the final battle, this was nothing. Moreover, Ning Zhuo had already obtained the approval of the White Paper City Lord and the Spirit Chef Elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The spirit food was prepared by the Spirit Chef Elder, and the meal expenses were covered by the White Paper City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Ning Zhuo had simply been responsible for persuading both of them earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
