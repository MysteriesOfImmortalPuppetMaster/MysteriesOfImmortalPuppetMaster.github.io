<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 327: I Insist on Holding On!!! (Massive 20,000 Word Update, Begging for Monthly Tickets!)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div><paragraph index="0">Ning Zhuo slowly shook his head, "Why would I seize the Immortal Palace? Itâ€™s for my mother. If there are monstrous sins to bear, I will bear them alone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="2">"You canâ€™t bear it!" Zhu Xuanji roared in fury, his body entwined by a mechanical serpent. "For your selfish desires, youâ€™d slaughter millions! Such a demonic path, I will never forgive you if you go through with it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">"Little Zhuo..." Sun Lingtong's face was full of concern. He knew Ning Zhuo's true nature very well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="6">If the end result was the city being overrun by beasts, Ning Zhuoâ€™s future would be dark. Worse, he would be consumed with endless guilt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">This was because, from beginning to end, Ning Zhuo firmly believed he was a righteous person!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">The throne melted more than halfway, and the flames were rapidly weakening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">Seeing this, both Zhu Xuanji and Sun Lingtongâ€™s expressions eased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">However, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit burst into loud laughter, staring at the space above Ning Zhuoâ€™s head, "Ning Zhuo, you canâ€™t do it! You canâ€™t do it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">"Even though youâ€™re the city lord, youâ€™re just one of the three powers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">"Youâ€™re endangering the Lava Immortal Palace and going against the intentions of the three masters who left it behind. The lives in the palace hang by a thread, stopping you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">"Stop now! This is the design of the three masters. We are mere ants, how can we compare to them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">Ning Zhuo's seven orifices bled as he widened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">"Why not?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">He shouted fiercely, raising his head to the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">"I refuse to be a puppet on this stage!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">"Do you know how much I loathe this puppet show called the Lava Immortal Palace? Even if it brought me power, Iâ€™d trade it all for just one more day of life for my mother..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">Ning Zhuoâ€™s voice was hoarse, and his eyes were bloodshot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">With a sharp pull, he grabbed the lifeline thread above him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">He yanked with all his might, distorting the thick lifeline thread into an unnatural shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gasped, but soon realized the thread, though heavily distorted, remained unbroken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">With a sneer, it mocked, "Ning Zhuo! Youâ€™re too naive. You think a mere mortal can sever the thread of life?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">But Ning Zhuo, stubborn as ever, continued pulling with all his strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">Inside his spiritual sea and dantian, the white lotus, as pure as jade, glowed brilliantly. Its green leaves sparkled with vitality, and the pink lotus petals bloomed like the dawn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">The lotus, formed by the divine powers of the lifeline thread, trembled slightly, releasing profound light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">This light surged upward, piercing through the skies and beyond, eroding the lifeline thread attached to the Immortal Palace above Ning Zhuo's head!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">In that instant, Ning Zhuo was enlightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">His hair hung wildly, his face covered in blood. He let out a sinister laugh and chanted loudly:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">"Five breaths nourish the soul, blood connects to life,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Three sects combined form the foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">Through sixteen winters and summers, my heart has endured bitter suffering,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After ten thousand trials, my will has grown stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Emotions and reason entwined pull the strings,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The world bows to the ruler of ages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Demonic roots sink deepâ€”who needs salvation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">With unyielding perseverance, I aim for the summit of the heavens!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">I will never let go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">I insist on holding on!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Who can control me? Even the three masters cannot!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">I am the one destined to wield emotions and reason, making all beings bow to my will!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Ahhhhhhhhhhh!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo roared loudly, like a madman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">His willpower surged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He held the lifeline thread with all his might, pouring his body, strength, and spirit into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Even Zhu Xuanji and Sun Lingtong, who couldnâ€™t see the thread, heard a faint snap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's vision, the lifeline thread had broken in two!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"!!!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spiritâ€™s mouth hung open, its eyes bulging as if they were about to pop out of its skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Shocked beyond words, it suddenly recalled a scene from hundreds of years ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">That afternoon, when it encountered the three masters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been compressed into a tiny size, looking up at the three masters like an ant before towering pillars and gods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">One of the masters had spoken slowly, "In eight hundred years, the calamity of the heavens will sweep through the world, blood will flow like rivers, and corpses will cover the land..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Youâ€™re a serpent born into sin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"From now on, you will serve as the palace spirit, guarding the Fire Persimmon Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"As long as the mountain enjoys good weather for the next seven hundred and twenty years, with no unnecessary slaughter or harm, youâ€™ll be freed from your sin and can leave the tortoise shell, truly becoming a dragon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had trembled violently, communicating its thoughts secretly to the masters. It had roared, "Seven hundred and twenty years?! Too long! Itâ€™s too long! Iâ€™d rather you kill me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">One of the masters had sent a message, "Seven hundred and twenty years is not a fixed number."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"During that time, if you encounter someone who can sever their own lifeline thread, follow them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Because..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"If they can sever their own, they can sever yours too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Hundreds of years later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">At this very moment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit looked up at Ning Zhuo and sensed the same majestic aura as the three masters!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Flames surged fiercely, even more violently than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Only thirty percent of the throne remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Burn! With a low growl, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit dove into the flames, letting its body be consumed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Ning Zhuo, stop!!" Zhu Xuanji couldnâ€™t hold back anymore. He temporarily abandoned his efforts to suppress the Buddha Doctor, Meng Yaoyin, and turned the mirror towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">A white light burst from Ning Zhuo's body, protecting him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">It was the protective talisman given to him earlier by Ning Jiufan and the others!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">In the next moment, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal suddenly flew out, hovering by Ning Zhuoâ€™s side for a moment before diving into his spiritual sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">A layer of Buddha light emerged, blocking the mirror light aimed at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This time, it was Zhu Xuanji's turn to be shocked, his eyes wide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"The Buddha Heart Demon Seal?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He had never forgotten the words left behind by the late emperor in the royal capital.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"The Buddha Heart Demon Seal is no ordinary object; its karmic ties are immense!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The Lava Immortal Palace is not something the three masters casually left behind..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zhu Xuanji remembered well the warning the current emperor of the Southern Bean Kingdom had given him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"In their later years, the three masters set up the Lava Immortal Palace in Fire Persimmon Mountain with profound intentions, beyond anyoneâ€™s understanding. On this journey, you must not act rashly, and let things take their course. Do not disrupt the mastersâ€™ painstaking plans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Zhu Xuanji's heart trembled, "The Buddha Heart Demon Seal recognized Ning Zhuo as its master? Could Ning Zhuo be the successor the three masters had planned for?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He was able to wield the Golden Phoenix Mirror because the mirror originated from the late emperor of the Southern Bean Kingdom. Though he had once offered it, it had never been fully refined and still answered to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But the Buddha Heart Demon Seal?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">In Zhu Xuanjiâ€™s view, this was Ning Zhuoâ€™s first contact with it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Even if Ning Zhuo was in the same situation as Zhu Xuanji, obtaining the Buddha Heart Demon Seal was already a monumental event!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">High atop Fire Persimmon Mountain, hidden in the clouds and mist, Meng Kui's face was ashen, his voice grim, "Finally, itâ€™s time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He had painstakingly manipulated the situation, borrowing the strength of three Nascent Soul-level beasts to continually weaken the Lava Immortal Palace. Now, at last, it was time for him to make his move!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Since the palaceâ€™s emergence, Meng Kui had waited at the cloudâ€™s peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Months passed as he sat in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Now, he had waited long enough!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He stood up, descending gracefully from the peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He pulled out a seal and smashed it down on the head of the Flame-Stepping Lizard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">With a loud noise, the lizardâ€™s skull was shattered, brains splattering everywhere. Though not yet dead, it fled in panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Meng Kuiâ€™s sleeve emitted a terrifying suction, capturing the rampaging fire snake, temporarily subduing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Then, with a powerful slap of his magic-infused hand, he sent the Nascent Soul demonic ape flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Before he could deliver the final blow, Ning Jiufan recklessly intervened, seizing the ape first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Meng Kui had no time to argue, the situation was urgent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The next moment, Zhu Xuanji, as if driven by some unseen force, turned the mirror towards Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Meng Kui cast aside the roof of the main hall with a wave of his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"This farce should end now!" His face dark, he descended once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The throne had completely burned away, and all its spiritual energy had been absorbed by the Buddha Doctor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Meng Kui snorted coldly, directing his magic-infused hand towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Hmm?" Meng Kui turned his gaze toward Zhu Xuanji, his expression growing colder by the moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Sun Lingtong, in a panic, grabbed Ning Zhuo's hand, preparing to use a spatial technique to flee. Even though he knew that using such a minor technique to escape a Nascent Soul cultivator was nearly impossible, it was his only option.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">However, Ning Zhuo gently patted Sun Lingtongâ€™s hand, a calm smile on his face. "Brother, don't be anxious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Donâ€™t forget, I am a righteous man."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">With that, he shook his sleeves, then turned toward Meng Kui, bowing deeply and respectfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"City Lord, I, Ning Zhuo, am willing to relinquish the position of palace master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Zhu Xuanjiâ€™s head whipped around to look at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Sun Lingtongâ€™s eyes widened, staring at Ning Zhuo in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Meng Kui paused in his descent, his gaze locking onto Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Silence fell over the entire scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo broke the stillness, speaking once more, "With my weak cultivation and limited ability, I can do little to avert this crisis. Only you, City Lord, can save us from disaster and restore peace to the people!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"This Lava Immortal Palace... no one is more suited to the position of palace master than you, City Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo, then at the throneâ€”or rather, the pit where the throne had once been. He then glanced at Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Meng Kuiâ€™s gaze drifted between Ning Zhuo, the remains of Meng Chongâ€™s body in Ning Zhuoâ€™s hands, and the sealed soul of Meng Chong held by the Underworld emissary, Qi Bai. Finally, his eyes fell on Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Zhu Xuanji, as if awakened from a dream, straightened his posture, adopting a solemn expression. "Ning Zhuo has answered the call of the recruitment order and is stepping down of his own accord, making him a hero of the Southern Bean Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"In the current crisis, even I am powerless to turn the tide. Only you, City Lord Meng Kui, with your Nascent Soul power, can subdue the beast tide and protect the citizens."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"This is, after all, your responsibility as the city lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Meng Kuiâ€™s eyes twitched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">At that moment, he remembered the prophetic verse he had calculatedâ€”"Right and wrong are but a thought apart, the new master will fill the old pit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">So this is what it meant by "right and wrong are but a thought apart!" And this is what "the new master will fill the old pit" meant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Damn it!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Meng Kui cursed silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
