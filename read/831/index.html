<paragraph index="1">Bluestone Cave Dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo sat alone in the cultivation chamber, his eyes slightly closed, legs crossed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The processes of the trials - the Nine Twists Corridor Formation, the Earth Fire Bountiful Field Formation, the Ten Thousand Li Icebound Formation, and the Map of Mountains and Rivers - flashed rapidly through the depths of his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"The Nine Twists Corridor Formation was the most complex and had the highest difficulty. It required identifying and dismantling layer by layer. My Master-level attainment in the Dao of Formations was the biggest contributor to my success."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"In the trial of the Earth Fire Bountiful Field Formation, I laid out four layers of formations to solve the problem. My attainment in the Fire Element provided crucial assistance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"For the Ten Thousand Li Icebound Formation, my Ice Dao attainment dragged me down, but I still managed to reach the level of third place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"The Map of Mountains and Rivers falls under the domain of Realm Formations. Although I passed with good results, it was actually because the assessment standards for this trial were too low. I am still very, very far from truly understanding this Realm Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The process of dismantling the Nine Twists Corridor Formation had given Ning Zhuo his first taste of practical experience in personally breaking a formation. It was far more vivid than the memories of the Demonic Soul, leaving a deeper impression on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The layers of the Nine Twists Corridor Formation were distinct. The accumulated experience allowed Ning Zhuo to choose a multi-layered formation approach during the Earth Fire Bountiful Field Formation trial, succeeding in one stroke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">By the time he reached the Ten Thousand Li Icebound Formation, Ning Zhuo’s ability to locate the formation core had been greatly exercised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">And within the Map of Mountains and Rivers, his ability to search for formation eyes was further tempered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">In the Rising Clouds Minor Trials, there were many formation trials. Ning Zhuo did not participate at random; he had selected them carefully beforehand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After several rounds of trials, Ning Zhuo not only achieved excellent results but also engaged in genuine practice. He accumulated experience unique to himself, increased his confidence in formations, and learned to more fully utilize his attainments in the Dao of Formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"But it’s not enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Water Formation of the Luo Shu was flexible and ever-changing. More importantly, Ning Zhuo had to succeed on his first attempt. Otherwise, if the Water Formation wasn't broken and caused a huge commotion like an explosion, it would inevitably attract attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Strictly speaking, Ning Zhuo spying into the Shuyu Zhai beforehand was a violation of sect rules. Of course, if the matter really came to light, he had his identity as Meng Yaoyin’s son to defend himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But ultimately, it would be a huge trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Even if Ning Zhuo wasn't punished by sect rules, a Daoist Artifact like the Luo Shu would likely be coveted by others and confiscated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">If such a thing really happened, while Ning Zhuo wouldn't be completely helpless, he would certainly have to pay a greater price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Therefore, the best outcome for Ning Zhuo was to succeed in one go, silently breaking the Water Formation and retrieving the Luo Shu page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"I need more practical combat drills."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo did not stop his pace of sweeping through the formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="45"/>
<paragraph index="47">The next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Deep Abyss Pond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The thousand-year-old ancient pond was bottomless. The water was still as a mirror, reflecting the skylight and clouds. A simple thatched cottage stood by the pond, and in front of it sat a gray-robed elder. It was the Nascent Soul cultivator, Zheng Yue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo walked slowly to stand before Zheng Yue and bowed: "Junior Ning Zhuo pays respects to Lord Zheng Yue."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zheng Yue’s expression was calm. He looked Ning Zhuo up and down before saying, "Go ahead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He had issued this trial, but he was strictly selective about the participants. Often, days would pass without a single person truly qualifying to take the trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">As a top-tier genius of the current generation, showing even a trace of the aura of a Heaven's Chosen, Ning Zhuo naturally was not among the ordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Receiving Zheng Yue’s permission, Ning Zhuo strolled to the edge of the pond and began his comprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo planted his feet by the pond, spread out his divine sense, regulated his breathing, and calmed his state of mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Zheng Yue had returned inside the thatched cottage, nowhere to be seen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">By the Deep Abyss Pond, only the big-headed youth in white clothes remained, quietly gazing at the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Sunlight spilled from overhead, casting a halo around him. His breathing became slower and lighter, until finally, it was almost imperceptible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Ning Zhuo finally took action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Thoughts constantly emerged in his divine sea, interweaving to form the embryonic form of a formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He used his own state of mind as the formation core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Controlling movement with stillness; responding to ten thousand changes with constancy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The formation began to slowly take shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">During this process, invisible formation patterns rippled out from around him like water waves, merging into the surrounding heaven and earth spiritual qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">One breath, ten breaths, one hundred breaths...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo remained motionless; not even his eyelashes trembled. His breathing had stopped, and his heartbeat had slowed to the point of being nearly undetectable. His mind was completely submerged in the water mirror, becoming one with the pond water, one with heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Time seemed to stand still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">His eyes were like an ancient well without ripples, utterly serene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Still Mountain Deep Abyss Formation - complete.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Not bad." Zheng Yue walked out of the thatched cottage and offered a lukewarm comment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Subsequently, he took out a jade slip from his bosom and handed it to him: "This is the Essentials of Still Mountain. It contains all my insights regarding the Still Mountain Deep Abyss Formation. You have passed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo accepted it and bowed with cupped fists: "Many thanks, Senior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zheng Yue nodded slightly and waved his hand, his voice dropping lower: "Go on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo bowed once more, turned, and left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Essentials of Still Mountain was the reward for passing the trial. Zheng Yue had set up this trial not only to carry forward his unique skills but also to select a suitable successor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">But although Ning Zhuo performed excellently, he had not raised such an idea from beginning to end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"This child is in the limelight, constantly entangled in affairs. Even if he can achieve inner stillness, his external environment will be full of changing winds and clouds, turbulent and ceaseless. No matter how outstanding his talent and aptitude, he does not fit my cultivation path." Zheng Yue sighed in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He had only truly met Ning Zhuo for the first time, but he had long since glimpsed Ning Zhuo's predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo was not the excellent successor he had in mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="115"/>
<paragraph index="117">Two days later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, took a step forward at the edge of the cliff, and stepped into the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">But in the next moment, raging gales swept him into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">More accurately, he was swept into the Wind and Thunder Formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The wind howled, surging from all directions, tearing at his robes and stinging his skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Overhead, thunderclouds churned incessantly. Bolts of lightning struck down, exploding around him and making his scalp numb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo stabilized his figure and spread his spiritual sense with full force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">However, as soon as his spiritual sense extended outside his body, it was shredded by the gales and scorched by the lightning, consumed rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo immediately changed tactics, once again scattering a large number of mechanical mirrors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The mirrors were similarly ravaged by the wind and thunder, constantly being damaged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo’s divine sense refracted continuously between the treasure mirrors, rapidly expanding his detection range.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo’s fingers fluttered like layers of butterfly shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">His profound attainments in mechanical arts allowed him to control countless treasure mirrors, weaving through the gales and roaming amidst the lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo did not resist head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">When the wind was strong, he retreated; when the wind was weak, he advanced. When lightning came, he evaded; when lightning left, he probed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">His Master-level formation attainment gave him a powerful intuition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Previously, Ning Zhuo wouldn't have been able to clearly grasp this formation intuition in such a crisis-ridden, intense environment. But having undergone the previous formation trials, his practical combat ability had been tempered!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Relying on intuition, he kept moving constantly, preventing himself and the majority of the treasure mirrors from being struck by the thunderbolts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Wind and Thunder Formation was a dynamic formation. The formation eye moved with the wind and clouds, seemingly untraceable. But Ning Zhuo had already detected a pattern: It was like breathing - wind rises and falls, thunder is born and dies, a cycle every thirty breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Having captured this crucial cycle, Ning Zhuo was only a few steps away from finding the formation eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Just as the third cycle began, a brilliant light exploded in Ning Zhuo’s eyes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He caught it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">In the place where the wind and thunder were most violent, there was a minute anomaly. The wind there was more chaotic than elsewhere, and the lightning there was denser than elsewhere. But behind the chaos was method, and behind the density was a pattern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The formation eye was hiding right there!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Formation-Gap Traversing Shuttle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The shuttle body trembled, shooting out a beam of azure-white light toward that direction. The light penetrated the gale, penetrated the lightning, and landed on a flickering point of light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Now!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo took out the Soul-Severing Axe and slashed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The axe light tore through the air, hitting that point of light squarely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Boom- </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The wind and thunder stopped abruptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Even though Ning Zhuo’s attainments in the Wind and Thunder elements were superficial, he had forcefully passed the Wind and Thunder Formation trial relying on his robust strength in the Dao of Formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="185"/>
<paragraph index="187">Five Elements Peak - Rotation Hall!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Cultivators participating in the trial needed to enter the Rotation Hall and comprehend the "Five Elements Rotation Grand Formation" within for two hours (one shichen). Afterward, they had to answer questions in the examination area beside the hall. Answering ten questions correctly would pass the trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">After the time it takes for half a cup of tea, Ning Zhuo walked out of the Five Elements Rotation Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Hmm?" The cultivators on duty paid great attention to the big-headed youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Immediately, someone went up to greet him: "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, has something urgent happened? I can make the decision to let you continue next time. However, regarding the time used, we must deduct the time you spent today."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo smiled and waved his hand: "Many thanks, Fellow Daoist, but I just feel that it’s about enough. There's no need to linger; I might as well go directly to the side hall to answer the questions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The cultivators on duty looked at each other in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Someone asked, "Are you sure?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Entering the side hall, he saw over a hundred jade steles. Each jade stele was engraved with a question. Cultivators needed to probe the jade stele with their divine sense to write down the answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo walked to the first jade stele and probed with his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He took only a glance, and the answer emerged in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He wrote the answer. Time taken: three breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The second question, the third question, the fourth question...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">For every question, he finished answering within ten breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">After completing ten questions, he turned around, preparing to leave the venue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Among the cultivators on duty, someone kindly reminded him again, telling Ning Zhuo that the question bank was vast. To avoid errors, he might as well answer a few more. The standard for passing was answering ten questions correctly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo slowly shook his head, smiling again, full of confidence: "I will absolutely not make a mistake. If I am judged wrong, it must be your fault."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">At this moment, the cultivators on duty facing him couldn't help but narrow their eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo was so confident; it was like looking directly at the sunlight - blinding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The cultivators hurriedly reviewed the questions, wanting to quickly determine the results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">However, very quickly, the reviewing cultivators frowned one by one. Some calculated rapidly on their fingers, while others sweated anxiously on their foreheads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">This was all because Ning Zhuo, on a whim, had given some unusual answers to a few of the questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo laughed aloud: "How about I explain them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">A small-scale lecture not only proved his correctness but also won over all the duty cultivators present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Moments later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The main gates of the Rotation Hall opened wide, and a large number of duty cultivators respectfully escorted Ning Zhuo out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="241"/>
<paragraph index="243">The Five Layer Door Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The Ten Thousand Swords Return to Origin Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Illusion Sea Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The Tiangang Big Dipper Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The Heaven and Earth Shift Formation...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo rested almost not at all, taking on one trial a day, sweeping through them all and passing every single one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Such an exaggerated performance made him stand out once again, causing endless discussion among the masses, who marveled that Ning Zhuo possessed such attainments in the Dao of Formations as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">It even caused the high-level officials of Heavy Formation Peak to hold a small discussion specifically revolving around Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="259"/>
<paragraph index="261">Heavy Formation Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Five high-level cultivators gathered around a massive bluestone round table; their discussion of affairs had reached its end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Sitting at the head was Yin Changgang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">His pale and chubby face wore its customary smile, his eyes narrowed into two slits. He was one of the Vice Peak Masters of Heavy Formation Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"I believe you have all noticed a newcomer recently." Yin Changgang spoke with a smile. "To be precise, we've heard of him before, but definitely not with the level of attention we have now. Let's hear everyone's views regarding that kid named Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Shan Guhong sat straight as a pine. In his early forties, his face was cold and severe, like it was carved with a knife. He wore black warrior attire with tight sleeves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">He spoke coldly: "This child breaks formations like splitting bamboo; his attainment in the Dao of Formations is profound. When I was young, I did not have his ability."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Wenren Yan leaned back in her chair. She wore a light gauze dress embroidered with layers of cloud patterns, shimmering under the lamplight. Her pupils were a pale purple, and she always looked at people with a somewhat dreamy, hazy gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">She suddenly spoke, her voice languid like a whisper in a dream: "It's not just attainments in the Dao of Formations. inside the Illusion Sea Formation, he used less than two hours (one shichen)."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Her purple eyes narrowed slightly: "My Illusion Sea Formation is most adept at confusing the mind. Nine out of ten who enter get lost in the illusions, and the remaining one would take three or four hours to find the way out. He only used two hours - this indicates his state of mind is extraordinarily stable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Worthy of a figure who can borrow the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] to emit such a scale of Noble Spirit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Ouyang Lin, dressed entirely in white, had delicate features, but his brows carried a chill: "In the Ten Thousand Li Icebound Formation, he only took third place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Everyone looked at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ouyang Lin remained expressionless: "His Ice Element attainment is too low; it dragged him back. If his Ice Element were slightly higher, first place would surely be his."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Chunyu Gui was burly, with a back like a tiger and waist like a bear. His full beard was trimmed neatly. He sighed deeply: "The most exaggerated instance was at the Rotation Hall of Five Elements Peak. It is said that after the Hall Master returned and learned of the scene of Ning Zhuo's trial, he immediately tried to recruit Ning Zhuo, not hesitating to offer the position of Vice Hall Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"Tell me, how old is he?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"How can such a junior be so outstanding?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Shan Guhong: "Dao of Formations, Five Elements, Mechanical Arts, Confucianism, Sound Techniques, Martial Combat... it is indeed excessively abnormal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Under normal circumstances, first-rate geniuses were the likes of Shen Xi, Situ Xing, and Gu Qing. They were already considered national-level talents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">It wouldn't be strange if Ning Zhuo was slightly better than them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">But now, Ning Zhuo had successively defeated Ban Ji, Gu Qing, Shen Xi, and others - and not through combat, but in the form of various minor trials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">This was outstanding in a way that defied convention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Wenren Yan speculated: "He claims to major in Mechanical Arts, but this may not be true. Based on his performance, his main cultivation direction is more likely Formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Cultivators registering their information sometimes released smoke screens to create disguises and cover-ups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Of course, in later stages, information scrutiny became strict, and cultivators often clarified proactively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Wenren Yan’s suspicion wasn't unreasonable, and Yin Changgang agreed considerably: "Indeed. Reviewing all of Ning Zhuo's performances since coming to the main sect gate, his victories over Ban Ji and Gu Qing were relatively difficult. But in the contest with Shen Xi, his advantage was obvious; it was a lead that left others in the dust."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">"But what truly concerns me is his nature."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Yin Changgang’s eyes flashed with a sharp light: "Is this the mental nature of a young man? He is stable to a terrifying degree. It makes me think of other possibilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Shan Guhong: "Soul possession, or even the reincarnation of a mighty figure?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Yin Changgang nodded, his expression grave.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
