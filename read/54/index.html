<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the end, the puppet Ning Zhuo never had to fight the mechanical ape Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">When he arrived in Room 7, he saw components belonging to the mechanical ape lying on the ground and being transported away by a ring of light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This was the Lava Immortal Palace‚Äôs cleaning method. The ring of light not only teleported the rewards but also got rid of debris.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo had discovered this phenomenon quite early and wasn‚Äôt surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Checking the surveillance component, he found that the mechanical ape had lost due to exhausting its spirit power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">‚ÄúBecause of its overly large body, even the passive spirit power consumption is very high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">‚ÄúIt only ever chose the spirit stone rewards, but that wasn‚Äôt enough for it to last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">‚ÄúOf course, this is also related to all the traps I installed in Rooms 1 to 9.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo was in a low mood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Yuan Dasheng was too strong, heavily damaging his arrangements. The destruction of these arrangements could easily lead to Ning Zhuo‚Äôs death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">‚ÄúThis is Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs first time in the palace, and it made it all the way to Room 7.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">‚ÄúIt will only get more and more familiar with this place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">‚ÄúAlthough it has a weakness in the consumption of spirit power, it will receive the ranking rewards once the week ends. At that time, it won‚Äôt have to worry about spirit stones, and will most likely pass me in a single go.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This realization put a lot of pressure on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">With a heavy heart, he passed Room 9 and returned to the transit hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Mechanical clicks sounded out, and the stone wall sank into the ground. The three doors of Buddha, Dao, and Demon were revealed once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Last time, Ning Zhuo had entered the Dao door and discovered that the subsequent level was extremely difficult. Although it wasn‚Äôt to the point of impossibility, he didn‚Äôt know how much time and effort it would take before he finally passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After thinking about it, Ning Zhuo had decided to first practice the new techniques for his other two dantians. According to his understanding of the Lava Immortal Palace and Three Schools Supreme Sage, these two techniques would surely have their uses!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">As the saying went, sharpening the axe doesn‚Äôt delay the chopping of wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This time, Ning Zhuo walked in front of the Demon door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He stretched out both hands, pressed his palms against the door, and silently activated the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After activating the demonic technique, he quickly absorbed blood from the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Bright red blood flowed along his arms, covering his puppet body and slowly seeping into it, eventually turning into a blood essence within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">This was the crystallized essence of blood power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">After obtaining the blood essence, Ning Zhuo could no longer absorb more blood. At the same time, he found that the Demon door could finally be pushed open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Passing through the Demon door, Ning Zhuo arrived in a room full of mechanical traps, as well as numerous kung fu puppets wandering around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo observed his surroundings for a moment and came to a preliminary conclusion. ‚ÄúThis level‚Äôs difficulty shouldn‚Äôt be much different from the Daoist one. These kung fu puppets are full of blood energy, and even seem to have blood essence?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">‚ÄúIn other words, they can also use the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo decided to start his attempt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As he activated the technique, the blood energy in his body turned into twisting sinews distributed throughout his body, with particularly many forming around his joints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Augmented by the blood sinews, Ning Zhuo‚Äôs speed when it came to running, jumping, dodging, or anything else all increased significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">And it wasn‚Äôt just his speed; his power and defense rose as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Although he triggered a number of traps in passing, they didn‚Äôt pose much of a threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The real trouble was the roaming kung fu puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs previous guess was quickly verified. These kung fu puppets really could use the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Because of this, the threat level of each kung fu puppet multiplied, making them even more difficult to deal with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">When he reached the middle of the room, Ning Zhuo found himself besieged by three kung fu puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The kung fu puppets shot streams of blood energy at Ning Zhuo‚Äôs puppet body. Soon, Ning Zhuo found himself covered in blood sinews.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Once these blood sinews appeared, they greatly hindered his every movement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo could only rely on his spells and the flying mechanical arm component to fight back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">After resisting for a while, he couldn‚Äôt hold on any longer. Blood energy covered his whole body, and he was sealed in countless blood sinews.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The three kung fu puppets struck simultaneously, and Ning Zhuo‚Äôs puppet body finally shattered, broken parts scattering across the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">‚ÄúSo the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique can actually be used this way!‚Äù Although Ning Zhuo failed, he still gained something.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Back in the underground workshop, he quickly verified his findings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The sinews condensed by blood energy could not only augment the cultivator themselves, but also infect and pollute other people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He could use his own blood energy to pollute someone else‚Äôs blood energy, creating numerous blood sinews inside and outside their bodies and ultimately sealing their movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not just sealing. To be more precise, it‚Äôs controlling!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Shocked filled Ning Zhuo‚Äôs heart. At this moment, he realized the core concept behind the three techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Three Schools Supreme Sage created these three techniques for the purpose of controlling mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">‚ÄúThe Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation gives rise to five elements magical power, which has a wide range of applications. It can produce five elements wires which can be used to control most kinds of mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">‚ÄúThe Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique can create blood sinews, improving various aspects of a mechanical construct‚Äôs power and strengthening control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">‚ÄúThe Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Incantation allows communication with spiritual objects via divine intent. This obviously pairs well with certain mechanical components!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo continued testing things out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He found that blood energy that came from the same source was easier to pollute and even convert for his own use. As for blood energy from different sources, he could only suppress and restrict it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">These gains were all well and good, but Ning Zhuo‚Äôs mood was getting heavier and heavier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">‚ÄúHow did that ape learn the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique in advance?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">‚ÄúIts Qi Refining level should be the peak of the third level, same as me. But for Essence Refining, it‚Äôs at the top of the ranking, knocking me down to second. In other words, it must be above the third level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">‚ÄúWhat is its real cultivation?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The mechanical ape reached Room 7 on its first attempt. This result was truly too terrifying!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">And what was even more terrifying was the fact that this was achieved solely with spirit power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">If it made it to the Demon door and obtained the power of blood energy, it would finally be able to use its true power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo had already felt the benefits of the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique. This demonic technique was a huge boost in strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The addition of blood energy to the mechanical ape would be like giving wings to a tiger, allowing it to soar high into the sky!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">‚ÄúOnce that happens, it will definitely surpass me and snatch first place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">‚ÄúNo matter what, I can‚Äôt let it touch the Demon door!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo opened a drawer and began searching the jade slips for information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">‚ÄúFound it!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He soon found what he was looking for.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">‚ÄúIt is indeed a Molten Flame Demonic Ape, but it‚Äôs also a cultivator‚Äôs spirit pet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">‚ÄúThat cultivator, Yuan Yi[^1], founded the Monkey Head Gang‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">‚ÄúAnd the Molten Flame Demonic Ape Yuan Dasheng is the gang‚Äôs guardian spirit beast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">‚ÄúI knew that I saw the name Yuan Dasheng somewhere. So it wasn‚Äôt the name of a person, but a spirit beast.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo had already collected information on the Monkey Head Gang when building his explosive fire monkey, which was why he had an impression of the name ‚ÄúYuan Dasheng‚Äù.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">‚ÄúThe only consolation right now is that I know its name while it doesn‚Äôt know mine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">‚ÄúThe enemy is in the open, while I am in the dark. Letting its name be listed on the rankings was a huge mistake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">‚ÄúI have to get rid of it as soon as possible!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with fierce killing intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">[^1]: Yuan Yi ‚Äì Ë¢Å‰∏Ä ‚Äì Yuan is a surname (same as Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs). Yi means ‚Äúone‚Äù.</paragraph><br/><br/>
