<paragraph index="1">"Enough, stop now, young man," Song Taosheng said after waiting a moment longer. Seeing no sign of Ning Zhuo stopping, he finally called a halt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo's thigh was a bloody mess. Startled by the reminder, he opened his eyes, blinked in confusion, and then realized he had won.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Song Taosheng spoke to Ning Zhuo with a gentle tone, asking his name while casting a healing spell. The wounds on Ning Zhuo's body began to heal rapidly before their very eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This astonishing recovery speed caused a flicker of surprise to flash in Song Taosheng's eyes. This young man's physical body is remarkably robust! he thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo bowed to Song Taosheng, first expressing his gratitude, then respectfully answering his name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Song Taosheng produced three inksticks and a jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"As the victor of this competition, you will receive these as your rewards: Bitter Ink and this cultivation method I created myself, called Song Taosheng's Qi Cultivation Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">With a surge of spiritual energy, Song Taosheng sent the rewards floating toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After thanking him again, Ning Zhuo accepted the prizes with both hands under the envious gazes of the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He examined his rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Setting aside the jade slip containing the cultivation art for the moment, he focused on the Bitter Ink, which he was seeing for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The inkstick wasn't pure black, but a deep, bitter brown, its color profound and restrained, as if it had absorbed the endless night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">It carried a faint, bitter fragrance of pine and cypress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Heavy in the hand, Ning Zhuo felt the inkstick was as solid as Profound Iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Song Taosheng sized up Ning Zhuo, making no attempt to conceal his admiration. Stroking his beard, he said, "It's a pity you've already achieved Foundation Establishment. Otherwise, with your temperament, you would have had a bright future cultivating Confucianism."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Very well, I'll grant you another opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">With a gentle wave of his sleeve, the great doors of the Confucian Temple swung open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He faced the dense pine forest outside, spread his fingers wide, and made a grasping motion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Pine Wave Qi Cultivation Art activated, drawing forth a surge of Literary Wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Song Taosheng projected the Literary Wind onto Ning Zhuo. "This is the power of the Pine Wave Qi Cultivation Art. Even non-Confucian cultivators can wield it. Study the uses of Literary Wind carefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"When your cultivation reaches a certain level, you'll be permitted to visit this mountain peak at any time to draw upon the Pine Wave Wind here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo's face lit up with joy, and he bowed his thanks once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Enough. You may all leave now," Song Taosheng said, waving his sleeve to dismiss them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The second and third-place Confucian cultivators immediately showed their disappointment. They had clung to the hope that all three top finishers would receive rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">However, the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, with its winner-takes-all system, was not uncommon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The crowd surged through the Confucian Temple's gates and spilled out into the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Some immediately dispersed, while others approached Ning Zhuo, greeting him warmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo welcomed everyone with a smile, cultivating goodwill and forging connections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After a flurry of activity, Ning Zhuo noticed Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran waiting for him. He happily joined them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Bai Jiyun, ever composed, chuckled and exclaimed, "Fellow Daoist Ning, your resolve is truly admirable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Liu Fushu, having accepted his defeat wholeheartedly, nodded in agreement, his voice tinged with envy as he reminded Ning Zhuo, "From what I've seen, you've already secured two first-place finishes in the Rising Cloud Minor Trials. One more victory, and you can head to the registration office to exchange your current identity token for the next tier."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Bai Jiyun nodded in agreement, adding, "You should do this as soon as possible. The entire Myriad Manifestations Sect is watching. If Brother Ning can obtain a Stone Tablet now, it would truly mark your breakthrough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Kong Ran chimed in, "I heard Situ Xing has already claimed three first-place finishes and obtained a Stone Tablet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Brother Ning, if you push yourself, you still have a chance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"But be mindful of the timing. The longer you wait, the more people will obtain Stone Tablets, diminishing the significance of your achievement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">According to the Myriad Manifestations Sect's rules, during the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, cultivators' identity tokens would be continuously upgraded: wooden tablets, stone tablets, bronze tablets, iron tablets, silver tablets, golden tokens, and finally, jade tokens. Each tier of token represented the sect's recognition of a cultivator's current and future potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Alright, I'll do my best!" Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He couldn't help but ask himself inwardly: Should I reveal my true abilities now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Others believed he needed to strive hard, but Ning Zhuo knew his own strength. Securing the top position wouldn't be difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The real question is, is it wise to stand out so early?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo kept a close eye on the latest developments. Several cultivators had already obtained Stone Tablets, including Situ Xing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Confucian cultivators likely want me to get a Stone Tablet too.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">But it seems Shen Xi, Lin Jinglong, and others haven't truly exerted themselves yet, allowing Situ Xing to take the lead for now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Is it wise to show my hand now? What would I gain, and what might I lose?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo pondered this question throughout his journey back to the Green Stone Cave Residence, but he couldn't reach a conclusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He understood the reason: I lack a firm grasp of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's internal dynamics. As a newcomer, I haven't fully grasped the situation yet. I haven't even encountered a single truly high-ranking member.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Big-Headed Youth had only ever mingled in Immortal Cities, making this his first time participating in the affairs of a Super Sect. The Myriad Manifestations Sect, in particular, was one of the largest among these Super Sects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">A group of Confucian cultivators was secretly supporting Ning Zhuo, but they were only mid-level members and deliberately maintained a safe distance from him, making close communication impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Qing Huangzi was a rogue cultivator at the Golden Core-level. In Ning Zhuo's estimation, his status was roughly equivalent to that of his late mother, Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Wen Ruanyu, a Confucian cultivator stationed abroad for years, was currently under house arrest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Yang Sanyan, an important member of the Demon Subjugation Hall, might have deep insights into the sect's internal affairs, but he was still in White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Mother had a friend who left a message in the Jade Slip, telling me I could seek their help, Ning Zhuo recalled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But approaching them rashly now would only invite trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The root of the problem lay in White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Following Wen Ruanyu's report, the Myriad Manifestations Sect's higher-ups must have gained a thorough understanding of the situation in White Paper Immortal City, including Meng Yaoyin's immense influence there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Now that Ning Zhuo had revealed himself as Meng Yaoyin's son, any attempt to approach others would easily arouse suspicion and caution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">This is all too coincidental!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo put himself in their shoes. If he were to encounter the son of an old friend, his first thought would be: Which high-ranking official is scheming behind the scenes, using this as an entry point to seize the immense benefits of White Paper Immortal City?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Since he couldn't grasp the full picture, Ning Zhuo decided to set it aside for now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ultimately, personal strength is what truly matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">I need to improve my cultivation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">If I reach the Golden Core stage - no, even late-stage Foundation Establishment - I'll be able to handle things with far greater ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo's cultivation was currently bottlenecked by the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Having obtained the "Head-Hanging and Thigh-Pricking" technique and the Bitter Ink, he had rushed back to his Cave Abode, eager to study the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art and strive for a breakthrough!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Moments later, Ning Zhuo sat alone in the Martial Training Formation Space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">In his hand, he held a Jade Slip containing the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Divine Art: Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Boss, I need your help," Ning Zhuo contacted Sun Lingtong in the Jade Cleansing Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Sun Lingtong had been diligently studying the Water Vortex Formation, making significant progress. Naturally, he was eager to assist Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Dao Artifact Luoshu Page Enhancement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Hah..." Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, his eyes unwavering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Head suspended from the rafters, thigh pierced with an awl!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The hemp rope stretched straight upward, forming several loops in the Void where there were no rafters. Its other end tightly bound Ning Zhuo's hair, yet the suspension still took effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The wooden awl pierced his thigh, sending a sharp, clear pain surging through him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Fatigue vanished, and distracting thoughts were purged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">With his other hand, Ning Zhuo picked up the Will-Conveying Brush, dipped it in Bitter Ink, and began to copy the diagrams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The relentless bitterness, like a surging river, flooded his divine sea and Upper Dantian, pressing down on him with immense pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Under his brush, he painstakingly traced the Cultivation Art's descriptions of blood Qi circulation pathways, tendon membrane condensation points, and the complex transformations of corrosive contamination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">With the combined enhancements of Bitter Ink, the Will-Conveying Brush, head suspension, and thigh piercing, Ning Zhuo's learning capacity soared severalfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Moreover, under the influence of the Luoshu, his deductions invariably led him down the correct path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Hmm?!" As long-standing mysteries unraveled, Ning Zhuo showed no joy. Instead, a look of astonishment, doubt, and solemnity settled on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">In his previous understanding, the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art was merely a crude and direct method for condensing blood Qi to strengthen oneself and disrupt or restrain others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">But now, he suddenly realized that its inner mysteries were as profound as the Abyss!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The creation of the Blood Qi Tendon Membrane was no simple accumulation; its internal structure was remarkably intricate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Different weaving patterns of the membranes - such as spirals, layers, and spiderwebs - had vastly different effects on power transmission, explosive speed, defensive resilience, and even corrosive efficiency, varying significantly from person to person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Thanks to the influence of the Luoshu, Ning Zhuo had deduced the mathematical relationships governing these membrane weaving structures. The sheer complexity of it left him dazzled and deeply awed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">If the Blood Qi Tendon Membrane within his own body was already this complex, how much more intricate would it be in others - perhaps a hundred times more?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"This is no mere brute force technique; it's an exquisitely refined Blood Qi Talisman Array!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Luoshu helped Ning Zhuo delve even deeper, and he felt as if a vast, profound labyrinth of knowledge was slowly unfolding before his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Thud... thud...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo's arm moved mechanically, repeatedly driving the wooden awl into his leg.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Blood flowed freely, pooling into a crimson puddle on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The hemp rope tightened, its fibers creaking under the strain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo channeled his divine sense into the Jade Slip, while his other hand gripped the Will-Conveying Brush. His strokes were slow and deliberate, as if the brush tip bore the weight of a thousand mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">His face grew increasingly pale, and his body was drenched in a cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He knew he was pushing himself to his limits, yet the path of deduction and learning stretched endlessly before him, showing no sign of an end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"I still want to keep learning..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Just as Ning Zhuo's mind was about to shatter and he was about to halt his studies, a cool, gentle Qi flowed from the outside inward, nourishing both his body and soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo's expression shifted in surprise as he realized the source was the Literary Wind swirling around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Literary Wind was being consumed, transforming into strands of Literary Qi that soothed his parched and agitated Sea of Consciousness like a spiritual spring. This rapidly calmed the mental chaos, anxiety, and burning sensations caused by his excessive deductions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">After half an hour, Ning Zhuo's brush paused. The final stroke was particularly difficult, but he eventually completed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He slowly set down the brush, his face as pale as paper. His Soul felt unusually weak, and waves of physical pain washed over him. The Upper Dantian remained dim, lingering with an endless bitterness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo's eyes were vacant. He closed them briefly, forcing himself to resist the urge to sleep, and slowly opened them again, a faint glimmer of consciousness returning to his gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Staring at the floating Jade Slip before him, Ning Zhuo's expression turned grave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"The profundity of this technique far exceeds my initial expectations!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He had originally assumed that the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art was roughly as complex as the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual and the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">This groundbreaking research completely overturned his previous understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"The Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art appears simple and crude, but that's merely an illusion. This Cultivation Art is incredibly complex and intricate, encompassing the essence of blood and Qi, the vast and intricate structure of interwoven tendon membranes, the permeation of Qi and blood, and even the secrets of flesh and blood generation... It's far from something that can be mastered overnight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but sigh deeply. "No wonder my progress in Demonic Arts has been so slow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"The main reason is that this Cultivation Art is inherently far more complex than the other two."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">This discovery undoubtedly disrupted Ning Zhuo's plans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"I'll worry about that later." He hadn't felt this drained in a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Even a brief review of his progress left him feeling intensely fatigued, with waves of drowsiness washing over him. Thoughts in his divine sea and Upper Dantian grew scarce and difficult to form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">As Ning Zhuo sank into a deep slumber, Ban Ji was raging in his Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He had just learned that Ning Zhuo had once again claimed first place in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"What are you four even doing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Taking my money and doing nothing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Letting Ning Zhuo make such a spectacle of himself and win first place again?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"He's already won twice! Just one more victory and he'll claim the Stone Tablet!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ban Ji used a secret communication method to directly interrogate the four Demonic Cultivators in succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Demonic Cultivators remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">They knew they were in the wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Of course, they also respected Ban Ji's personal combat prowess and his family's influence. So, after letting Ban Ji vent his anger, someone finally responded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Rust Disaster Craftsman muttered that he was actively investigating Ning Zhuo's background, having already spent half the substantial sum Ban Ji had given him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The Reckless Monk claimed he had been provoking Ning Zhuo, but the latter refused to take the bait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Liu Qingyan reported that she had been disguised, tailing Ning Zhuo, and had personally witnessed him climb the mountain, participate in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial at the Confucian Temple, and ultimately emerge victorious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"Then, Lady Spiderweb, what do you have to say?" Ban Ji's anger began to subside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Lady Spiderweb remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ban Ji called out several times, but Lady Spiderweb still didn't respond. His fury flared anew, and he began smashing and destroying everything in his Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">This was the drawback of cultivating Demonic Arts: extreme emotional volatility that demanded constant release.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">In truth, venting his anger was a good thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Having cultivated Demonic Arts for years, Ban Ji had learned to gradually calm his mind through such outbursts. "The task of restraining Ning Zhuo still falls to the four of you," he concluded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"I mustn't let anger cloud my judgment. I must focus on my goals!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ban Ji's next target had long been set: Che Zhuzi, a Demon Cultivator renowned for his mastery of mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">In previous years, Che Zhuzi had hosted his own Rising Cloud Minor Trial, which always included challenges involving mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">His true motive, however, was to promote his Void Spider Silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">When refined, this precious material allowed the control threads of mechanical constructs to pierce the Void, extending their reach to distant locations. It was an invaluable asset for controlling mechanisms!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"With this silk, the operational range of my mechanisms will increase more than twentyfold! Moreover, by piercing the Void, the threads will be largely immune to attacks and destruction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">As Ban Ji was lost in these thoughts, Lady Spiderweb's voice finally reached him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Ban Ji, what can you expect from the others?" she said, her voice brimming with excitement and triumph. "Let me tell you, I've made significant progress!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"This time, I successfully seduced a mechanism cultivator from the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"In previous years, he always hosted a Rising Cloud Minor Trial focused on mechanisms. His control threads are extraordinary - they can even pierce the Void."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"I bet that Big-Headed Youth will take the bait. When he does, I'll use the Rising Cloud Minor Trial to make things difficult for him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ban Ji: .......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The more Ban Ji listened, the stronger his sense of foreboding grew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">His lips twitched a few times before he finally asked, clinging to a sliver of hope, "Who was the person you seduced?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Lady Spiderweb replied casually, "Oh, his name is Che Zhuzi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Ban Ji's vision went black. He staggered, nearly collapsing to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
