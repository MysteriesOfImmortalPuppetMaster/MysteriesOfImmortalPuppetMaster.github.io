<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui had just taken a sip of tea when her expression suddenly changed drastically.<br/>
<br/>
She dropped the cup in her hand, immediately kneeling to the ground, clutching her neck.<br/>
<br/>
"I...I..." Ning Xiaohui struggled to breathe, her face turning a terrifying shade of purple.<br/>
<br/>
The tea had numbed her nasal passages and tongue, the corrosive poison filling her nose and mouth, preventing her from breathing!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, Ning Xiaohui extended her hand and clawed at her throat.<br/>
<br/>
She ripped her own throat open, causing blood to gush out. But by doing so, she managed to draw in a fresh breath of air.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family guards, alerted by the commotion, rushed in and were shocked by what they saw. They hurried to report the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's face was fierce, a spell ready in her hand, aimed at anyone who tried to approach.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family guards dared not act rashly.<br/>
When Ning Xiaohui saw her grandmother appear, she finally relaxed and passed out.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's small courtyard.<br/>
Inside the small training chamber in the bedroom, Ning Zhuo sat with his eyes closed, fully focused.<br/>
<br/>
Drops of blood fell from his nose, staining his chest and reddening his clothes.<br/>
<br/>
This was a nosebleed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was exerting all his effort, using the Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique to observe, using the Heart Seal to control Yuan Dasheng, occasionally channeling Dasheng's internal spiritual power to cast spells.<br/>
<br/>
When Yuan Dasheng reached the final door, he was covered in wounds. Three fingers on his left hand were broken, and his right leg had almost been severed. Ning Zhuo had to command Yuan Dasheng to retreat to the maintenance room, perform self-repairs, and only then was he able to continue exploring.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo's puppet did not match Yuan Dasheng in overall strength, the two complemented each other perfectly, one attacking from afar, the other engaging in close combat, creating a synergistic effect.<br/>
<br/>
Relying solely on Yuan Dasheng to force his way through would have significantly increased the difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng bravely charged through the three Buddha gates, once again standing before the reward selection door.<br/>
<br/>
Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo directly chose the "Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra" this time!<br/>
<br/>
The sutra's content quickly reached Ning Zhuo's mind.<br/>
<br/>
"Just as I thought!" Ning Zhuo was initially thrilled, then stunned.<br/>
<br/>
The teachings within the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra moved him deeply!<br/>
<br/>
He suppressed his tumultuous emotions and then commanded Yuan Dasheng to push open the door and enter another hall, encountering a new set of Buddha, Dao, and Demon doors.<br/>
<br/>
These three doors required cultivation at the peak of the sixth level, beyond Yuan Dasheng's capability.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo invoked the power of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, allowing Yuan Dasheng to retreat successfully and re-enter the reward phase.<br/>
<br/>
The dragon turtle fire spirit was furious.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Ning Zhuo was only cheating himself, but now even his puppet is cheating!<br/>
<br/>
In the mystical palace, turmoil ensues as Meng Kui intervenes once more.<br/>
<br/>
The noble Nascent Soul cultivator is exhausted, constantly worried about a volcanic eruption that could cause a massive disaster, destroying life and land.<br/>
<br/>
Within the palace, tranquility reigns, and Ning Zhuo has some small expectations.<br/>
<br/>
"What should I choose this time? Hmm? Another Illusory True Lotus Seed? If my guess is correct..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and chose another Illusory True Lotus Seed.<br/>
<br/>
The second Illusory True Lotus Seed followed the Life Thread and was delivered to his Sea of Consciousness, quickly merging with the previous divine ability embryo.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, the lotus bud, which had just sprouted, doubled in height after the merger!<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit suddenly felt less angry.<br/>
<br/>
It had not expected that after Ning Zhuo suffered once, he would still gamble again, thus choosing the second Illusory True Lotus Seed.<br/>
<br/>
All the Illusory True Lotus Seeds rewarded in the Lava Immortal Palace contain a portion of the essence of the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
The quantity is limited, and it's first-come, first-served.<br/>
<br/>
However, comprehending the divine ability is extremely difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's choice made the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gloat!<br/>
<br/>
Thus, under the puzzled gaze of the city lord, the previously turbulent Lava Immortal Palace suddenly calmed down.<br/>
<br/>
"What on earth is going on with this palace spirit?" Meng Kui furrowed his brows, utterly baffled.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng pushed the door open and then retreated again to receive another reward.<br/>
<br/>
For the third time, Ning Zhuo still chose the Illusory True Lotus Seed!<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit laughed so hard it rolled around, its mocking laughter echoing in the main hall.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth time, also the last time.<br/>
<br/>
Unable to continue, Ning Zhuo still chose the Illusory True Lotus Seed.<br/>
<br/>
After merging three Lotus Seeds, the lotus embryo had grown into a small lotus root arm.<br/>
<br/>
Accompanying this was a flood of insights, like a river constantly washing over Ning Zhuo's mind.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly focused on his comprehension, and in the midst of this process, he suddenly opened his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
He was in the small training chamber, surrounded by clouds obscuring his vision.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo turned his head and stared in a certain direction, his brows furrowed, and his eyes gleaming darkly.<br/>
<br/>
At the courtyard gate, Ning family Qi Refining cultivators were patrolling.<br/>
<br/>
Clip-clop, clip-clop!<br/>
<br/>
A series of urgent hoofbeats approached.<br/>
<br/>
A horse-drawn carriage seemed to have lost control, hurtling towards the small courtyard. The Ning family cultivators first shouted to stop it, then cast spells to try to halt it. However, the spells couldn't stop the carriage, which violently crashed through the courtyard gate and rushed into the yard.<br/>
<br/>
After a slight adjustment in direction, it charged straight towards the bedroom where Ning Zhuo was. <br/>
<br/>
"Enemy attack!"<br/>
<br/>
A Foundation Establishment cultivator descended like a falling star, blocking the carriage just in time, but his expression changed dramatically. <br/>
<br/>
"Bomb!"<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the carriage exploded, sending intense heat and flames soaring into the sky, with the blast wave surging in all directions. The explosion turned everything white-hot. The roof of Ning Zhuo's house was first blown off, followed by the walls collapsing. Everything inside, including furniture and arrangements, was obliterated in the explosion. <br/>
<br/>
The intense blast nearly flattened the surrounding area. Amidst the smoke and dust, the Ning family guards regrouped. Only two Foundation Establishment cultivators remained, as the other two Qi Refining cultivators had perished in the explosion.<br/>
<br/>
One of the surviving Foundation Establishment cultivators, who had intercepted the carriage, was severely injured. Despite his injuries, he frantically searched for Ning Zhuo. Protecting him was their primary mission! But the house was gone, and the newly built training chamber was reduced to a small section of ruined walls.<br/>
<br/>
"It's over, it's over. Ning Zhuo is dead!" <br/>
<br/>
"No, we still have hope." <br/>
<br/>
"Yes, yes, the basement, there's a basement here." <br/>
<br/>
They quickly performed hand seals and frantically dug into the ground. Soon, they uncovered a passage leading to the basement. Inside, they found that most of the basement's structure had collapsed. However, to their immense relief, Ning Zhuo was indeed there. <br/>
<br/>
"You're alive!" <br/>
<br/>
"Thank heavens!"<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family Foundation Establishment cultivators were nearly in tears of joy. Ning Zhuo, though breathing weakly and seemingly injured, said, "Brothers, there's no time for talk. Quickly set up protection around me. Also, send a message to the family and ask them to send reinforcements."<br/>
<br/>
The two Foundation Establishment cultivators snapped to action, one nodding frantically. "Yes, yes, we must do that!" <br/>
<br/>
A temporary formation was set up, with Ning Zhuo at its center. Outside the formation, the two Foundation Establishment cultivators stood guard, on high alert. At the slightest disturbance, they were ready to unleash their spells without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after, a large contingent of Ning family cultivators arrived to provide support. Ning Xiaoren led the way, greeting Ning Zhuo as he emerged from the protective formation. "Nephew, nephew, when I heard you were attacked, I was so worried. I've been anxious the entire way here! Luckily, you have the favor of the heavens and survived this deadly ordeal."<br/>
<br/>
"So dangerous!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo first saluted, then asked, "Uncle Ning, the assailant was incredibly vicious, blowing up my residence. This place was left to me by my mother, and now it's nothing but ruins. When will we catch the scum who attacked me? I can't rest easy until we do!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren looked troubled, carefully choosing his words to calm Ning Zhuo. "For now, let's escort you back to the family estate. You should stay at my residence; it will be much safer."<br/>
<br/>
This time, Ning Zhuo didn't have much room to refuse. However, he still said, "Uncle Ning, I don't want to trouble you constantly. When I was in school, I stayed at my elder uncle's house. How about I stay there this time? After all, they live within the inner perimeter of the estate."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren thought for a moment, then nodded in agreement. "Very well. If you are uncomfortable at my place, I won't force you. I'll send more guards to protect you day and night. You may not know, but the geniuses in the Qi Refining stage from the four major forces of the Lava Immortal City have all been attacked, each sustaining injuries. Ning Xiaohui is already unconscious. Your situation is relatively better."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo showed a look of shock and fear, gasping in a low voice. Ning Xiaoren sighed, his brow furrowed in deep worry.<br/>
