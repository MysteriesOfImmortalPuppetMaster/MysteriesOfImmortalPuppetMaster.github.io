<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Han Zhou couldn't help but glance sideways, his puzzled gaze seemingly saying, "Ning Zhuo, didn't you just say you wanted to form a good relationship with Hua Guzi? Why are you acting so cold and distant?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sensed Han Zhou's confusion but didn't explain. Instead, he passed by Hua Guzi altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou: ?!<br/>
<br/>
He quietly gasped, feeling deeply perplexed.<br/>
<br/>
In his view, it was obvious Hua Guzi was trying to make peace and improve relations, yet Ning Zhuo turned into the one showing a bad attitude.<br/>
<br/>
"Given Hua Guzi's temperament, for her to approach so humbly and even offer dumplings, she's already breaking her usual norms."<br/>
<br/>
"And yet Ning Zhuo treats her like this? It's like he's rubbing her face in the dirt."<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo is being somewhat unwise."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh... What a mess."<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou felt this situation could have been handled better, but Ning Zhuo's behavior was quite strange.<br/>
<br/>
He instinctively stepped a bit further away from Hua Guzi, fearing she might explode in anger and attack.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi remained in her bowing posture, her upper arms, torso, and face parallel to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Her face was flushed red, a mix of anger, embarrassment, and awkwardness.<br/>
<br/>
"I've been rejected! Even after all that, he still rejected me!"<br/>
<br/>
"I was rejected! I can't believe it!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ahhh!"<br/>
<br/>
"This is so humiliating, too humiliating."<br/>
<br/>
"Not only was I rejected, but someone else saw it happen! I want to die!"<br/>
<br/>
"Is there a crack in the ground I can crawl into?!"<br/>
<br/>
"Hehehe, hahahaha, gu gu gu..."<br/>
<br/>
"Why? Why would Young Master Ning Zhuo reject me? How could he be so heartless to refuse someone as adorable and beautiful as me?"<br/>
<br/>
"Why? Why do I also feel kind of happy about it?"<br/>
<br/>
"Even though I was rejected by Young Master Ning Zhuo, I still feel so happy."<br/>
<br/>
"Why is this happening?"<br/>
<br/>
"That brat, he rubbed my pride into the mud. He deserves death!"<br/>
<br/>
"But, but... why can't I hate him?"<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi was confused by her own feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was even more so.<br/>
<br/>
"This woman is crazy!!" Ning Zhuo felt an overwhelming sense of joy radiating from Hua Guzi and shivered even more, quickening his pace.<br/>
<br/>
"This half-demon's personality is severely twisted, not normal at all!"<br/>
<br/>
"Better stay far away from her, it's safer."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo warned himself internally.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou remained extremely cautious along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Only after putting a significant distance between them did he glance back, and seeing Hua Guzi still floating like a statue, his heart pounded even harder.<br/>
<br/>
He felt as though Hua Guzi was a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at any moment!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo returned to his cave dwelling, temporarily pushing Hua Guzi out of his mind, and began his daily cultivation routine.<br/>
<br/>
Three Sect Supreme techniques: Mirror Platform Communication, Five Elements Qi, and Demonic Blood Vein Technique!<br/>
<br/>
He alternated between the three cultivation methods, steadily advancing his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the cave, the rich spiritual energy was so dense it had formed into mist. He grabbed handfuls of spiritual food and chewed, quickly converting it into energy and spiritual power.<br/>
<br/>
The incense of tranquility quietly burned, and the meditation cushion he sat on, a reward from the three major families of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, still retained its effectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
After finishing his session, Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes and sent a telepathic message to Sun Lingtong, sighing, "Boss, is there any way to speed up my cultivation? Even now, I'm still at the early stage of Foundation Establishment. It's too slow!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, who had been sipping water, almost spat it out upon hearing this: "Little Zhuo, how can you say it's slow?"<br/>
<br/>
"You have talent, the Five Elements Spirit, all sorts of resources, and your progress is visible every day. This speed is top-tier, far surpassing mine back in the day. And you still think it's slow?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed, "It feels like I'm still far from reaching the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes and looked at the ceiling, replying telepathically, "That's just how it is during the Foundation Establishment stage."<br/>
<br/>
"As you climb higher in cultivation realms, your progress slows down several times over, or even more. That's because after a breakthrough, each new realm requires a much greater accumulation of foundation, often dozens or hundreds of times more."<br/>
<br/>
"The better the cultivation method, the deeper the foundation needed. That's why cultivators practicing superior methods have power that far exceeds others at the same level."<br/>
<br/>
"Think about it, the three techniques you're practicing are top-tier, the best of the best."<br/>
<br/>
"So stop expecting the easy gains of the Qi Refining period and tough it out. Cultivation is a long, persistent journey."<br/>
<br/>
"To reach the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, it'll take you several years at least."<br/>
<br/>
"Don't be too hasty; your mindset needs adjusting!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed again, "Sigh, boss, I know you're right, but I can't help feeling restless and impatient."<br/>
<br/>
"Maybe it's because I really want to improve my cultivation, so I can have the strength to save my mother."<br/>
<br/>
"Boss, I often think, if I had Nascent Soul-level power, I could just talk things over with Lin Bufan directly. Why would I need to compete at Little Contention Peak?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes again: "You're daydreaming!"<br/>
<br/>
"I could say, if I had Nascent Soul power, no, even just Golden Core-level, I'd be confident enough to steal all of Lin Bufan's treasures."<br/>
<br/>
"Look at our age. With the level of cultivation you already have, you're far ahead of 99% of your peers. Don't be too hard on yourself, Little Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed once more: "Boss, I know it's unrealistic. If I push for progress too quickly, I'll only be short-sighted and impatient. Cultivation requires a solid foundation and steady progress."<br/>
<br/>
"A tall building must rise from a stable foundation. If the base isn't firm, no matter how high the building goes, it'll be at risk of collapsing."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm just venting my frustrations."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong paused, then comforted him: "I've seen your progress recently, rapidly improving every day. If that's still causing you frustration, it doesn't make sense. There are countless geniuses who would be embarrassed by your progress."<br/>
<br/>
"This Little Contention Peak is a treasure trove for you. You should make the most of it."<br/>
<br/>
After a brief pause, Sun Lingtong added, "However, if you really want Nascent Soul-level power, it's not entirely impossible."<br/>
<br/>
"You're so skilled in crafting mechanisms. If you could create one with Nascent Soul-level strength, wouldn't that solve the problem?"<br/>
<br/>
At the mention of mechanisms, Ning Zhuo's tone brightened, his expression also becoming more relaxed and joyful.<br/>
<br/>
He said, "Boss, my verification of martial mechanisms using Hua Guzi as a test subject has yielded great results."<br/>
<br/>
"This has given me valuable insights for designing a mechanism body for Meng Yehu!"<br/>
<br/>
"I can start by selecting a cultivation method for it, and then design its mechanism body around that method."<br/>
<br/>
"The Blood-Swallowing Demon Method it practiced in life won’t work, though, as it doesn't align well with mechanism materials."<br/>
<br/>
"Actually, the Suffering Sutra would work."<br/>
<br/>
"My combat mechanism limbs this time were mainly made from Bitter Water Wood and Lone Sapling Wood. The former was thanks to Han Zhou's support, and the latter came from the market at Little Strife Peak."<br/>
<br/>
"These materials make the mechanism limbs somewhat similar to Han Zhou's physique, and can even support the martial art known as the Suffering Body."<br/>
<br/>
"The Suffering Sutra might not perfectly suit Meng Yehu's original talent, but if the Suffering Sutra can work, then other methods should be adaptable too."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong rubbed his chubby little chin thoughtfully and said, "Little Zhuo, considering your current relationship with the Myriad Medicine Sect, it might be difficult to obtain a suitable method from them."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo replied, "I've thought about it. We can visit one of the immortal cities, where there are surely libraries of techniques. We could choose one from there for Meng Yehu."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong responded, "Meng Yehu was at the Golden Core level in life, so the method you select will likely need to be at least that level. The price for such a technique won’t be cheap."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s expression shifted.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong added, "I should also remind you that we spent a significant sum on the spirit plant chamber."<br/>
<br/>
"To construct Meng Yehu’s mechanism body, a Golden Core-level technique, even a basic one, will cost a fortune."<br/>
<br/>
"We also need to nurture the Spirit Concealing Willow, and the spirit soil and spirit liquid in the chamber are nearly depleted."<br/>
<br/>
"Plus, our daily cultivation expenses are far beyond what most rogue cultivators could dream of, on par with the direct disciples of prestigious sects. After three months, the cost will already be enormous."<br/>
<br/>
"Not to mention the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon. We're running low on Fire Essence and need a massive resupply."<br/>
<br/>
"I stole Li Jingqing's stash, but compared to what we need, it's just a drop in the ocean."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face changed again and again.<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul-level Wandering Dragon was truly convenient, but the cost of using it was sky-high.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s accumulation from his time in Fire Persimmon Immortal City was already barely enough to sustain it.<br/>
<br/>
In order to advance his cultivation, Ning Zhuo’s daily consumption of spiritual energy, spiritual food, and other resources was astronomical.<br/>
<br/>
And then there was the Spirit Concealing Willow.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s face turned pale.<br/>
<br/>
That tree was a massive drain on resources, and to cultivate it properly required a significant investment!<br/>
<br/>
"Such heirloom treasures are usually supported by an entire sect or family. Relying on ourselves alone is truly challenging."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed deeply.<br/>
<br/>
He had worked hard, scheming and maneuvering to amass a lot of cultivation resources.<br/>
<br/>
But compared to what was needed, his accumulation was far from sufficient!<br/>
<br/>
For now, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo could still manage.<br/>
<br/>
But not for long.<br/>
<br/>
A lack of foresight would soon bring immediate trouble, and this issue had to be addressed now. Otherwise, when it became urgent, it would be too late to solve.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo furrowed his brow deeply.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, he had been immersed in his special training, reveling in the rapid, visible progress he was making, and had neglected these looming problems.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Sun Lingtong’s reminder, he immediately realized that as time passed, this issue was becoming more and more pressing.<br/>
<br/>
If he waited until the problem exploded, it would be too late!<br/>
