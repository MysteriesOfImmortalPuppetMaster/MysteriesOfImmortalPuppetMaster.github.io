<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Han Zhou couldn't help but glance sideways, his puzzled gaze seemingly saying, "Ning Zhuo, didn't you just say you wanted to form a good relationship with Hua Guzi? Why are you acting so cold and distant?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo sensed Han Zhou's confusion but didn't explain. Instead, he passed by Hua Guzi altogether.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Han Zhou: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He quietly gasped, feeling deeply perplexed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">In his view, it was obvious Hua Guzi was trying to make peace and improve relations, yet Ning Zhuo turned into the one showing a bad attitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Given Hua Guzi's temperament, for her to approach so humbly and even offer dumplings, she's already breaking her usual norms."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"And yet Ning Zhuo treats her like this? It's like he's rubbing her face in the dirt."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Young Master Ning Zhuo is being somewhat unwise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Sigh... What a mess."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Han Zhou felt this situation could have been handled better, but Ning Zhuo's behavior was quite strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He instinctively stepped a bit further away from Hua Guzi, fearing she might explode in anger and attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Hua Guzi remained in her bowing posture, her upper arms, torso, and face parallel to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Her face was flushed red, a mix of anger, embarrassment, and awkwardness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"I've been rejected! Even after all that, he still rejected me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"I was rejected! I can't believe it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Ahhh!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"This is so humiliating, too humiliating."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Not only was I rejected, but someone else saw it happen! I want to die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Is there a crack in the ground I can crawl into?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Hehehe, hahahaha, gu gu gu..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Why? Why would Young Master Ning Zhuo reject me? How could he be so heartless to refuse someone as adorable and beautiful as me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Why? Why do I also feel kind of happy about it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Even though I was rejected by Young Master Ning Zhuo, I still feel so happy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Why is this happening?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"That brat, he rubbed my pride into the mud. He deserves death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"But, but... why can't I hate him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Hua Guzi was confused by her own feelings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo was even more so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"This woman is crazy!!" Ning Zhuo felt an overwhelming sense of joy radiating from Hua Guzi and shivered even more, quickening his pace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"This half-demon's personality is severely twisted, not normal at all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Better stay far away from her, it's safer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo warned himself internally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Han Zhou remained extremely cautious along the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Only after putting a significant distance between them did he glance back, and seeing Hua Guzi still floating like a statue, his heart pounded even harder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He felt as though Hua Guzi was a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at any moment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo returned to his cave dwelling, temporarily pushing Hua Guzi out of his mind, and began his daily cultivation routine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Three Sect Supreme techniques: Mirror Platform Communication, Five Elements Qi, and Demonic Blood Vein Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He alternated between the three cultivation methods, steadily advancing his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Inside the cave, the rich spiritual energy was so dense it had formed into mist. He grabbed handfuls of spiritual food and chewed, quickly converting it into energy and spiritual power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The incense of tranquility quietly burned, and the meditation cushion he sat on, a reward from the three major families of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, still retained its effectiveness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">After finishing his session, Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes and sent a telepathic message to Sun Lingtong, sighing, "Boss, is there any way to speed up my cultivation? Even now, I'm still at the early stage of Foundation Establishment. It's too slow!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong, who had been sipping water, almost spat it out upon hearing this: "Little Zhuo, how can you say it's slow?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"You have talent, the Five Elements Spirit, all sorts of resources, and your progress is visible every day. This speed is top-tier, far surpassing mine back in the day. And you still think it's slow?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo sighed, "It feels like I'm still far from reaching the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes and looked at the ceiling, replying telepathically, "That's just how it is during the Foundation Establishment stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"As you climb higher in cultivation realms, your progress slows down several times over, or even more. That's because after a breakthrough, each new realm requires a much greater accumulation of foundation, often dozens or hundreds of times more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"The better the cultivation method, the deeper the foundation needed. That's why cultivators practicing superior methods have power that far exceeds others at the same level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Think about it, the three techniques you're practicing are top-tier, the best of the best."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"So stop expecting the easy gains of the Qi Refining period and tough it out. Cultivation is a long, persistent journey."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"To reach the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, it'll take you several years at least."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Don't be too hasty; your mindset needs adjusting!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo sighed again, "Sigh, boss, I know you're right, but I can't help feeling restless and impatient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Maybe it's because I really want to improve my cultivation, so I can have the strength to save my mother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Boss, I often think, if I had Nascent Soul-level power, I could just talk things over with Lin Bufan directly. Why would I need to compete at Little Contention Peak?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes again: "You're daydreaming!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"I could say, if I had Nascent Soul power, no, even just Golden Core-level, I'd be confident enough to steal all of Lin Bufan's treasures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Look at our age. With the level of cultivation you already have, you're far ahead of 99% of your peers. Don't be too hard on yourself, Little Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo sighed once more: "Boss, I know it's unrealistic. If I push for progress too quickly, I'll only be short-sighted and impatient. Cultivation requires a solid foundation and steady progress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"A tall building must rise from a stable foundation. If the base isn't firm, no matter how high the building goes, it'll be at risk of collapsing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"I'm just venting my frustrations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sun Lingtong paused, then comforted him: "I've seen your progress recently, rapidly improving every day. If that's still causing you frustration, it doesn't make sense. There are countless geniuses who would be embarrassed by your progress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"This Little Contention Peak is a treasure trove for you. You should make the most of it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After a brief pause, Sun Lingtong added, "However, if you really want Nascent Soul-level power, it's not entirely impossible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"You're so skilled in crafting mechanisms. If you could create one with Nascent Soul-level strength, wouldn't that solve the problem?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">At the mention of mechanisms, Ning Zhuo's tone brightened, his expression also becoming more relaxed and joyful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He said, "Boss, my verification of martial mechanisms using Hua Guzi as a test subject has yielded great results."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"This has given me valuable insights for designing a mechanism body for Meng Yehu!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I can start by selecting a cultivation method for it, and then design its mechanism body around that method."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"The Blood-Swallowing Demon Method it practiced in life won’t work, though, as it doesn't align well with mechanism materials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Actually, the Suffering Sutra would work."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"My combat mechanism limbs this time were mainly made from Bitter Water Wood and Lone Sapling Wood. The former was thanks to Han Zhou's support, and the latter came from the market at Little Strife Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"These materials make the mechanism limbs somewhat similar to Han Zhou's physique, and can even support the martial art known as the Suffering Body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"The Suffering Sutra might not perfectly suit Meng Yehu's original talent, but if the Suffering Sutra can work, then other methods should be adaptable too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Sun Lingtong rubbed his chubby little chin thoughtfully and said, "Little Zhuo, considering your current relationship with the Myriad Medicine Sect, it might be difficult to obtain a suitable method from them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo replied, "I've thought about it. We can visit one of the immortal cities, where there are surely libraries of techniques. We could choose one from there for Meng Yehu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong responded, "Meng Yehu was at the Golden Core level in life, so the method you select will likely need to be at least that level. The price for such a technique won’t be cheap."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo’s expression shifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun Lingtong added, "I should also remind you that we spent a significant sum on the spirit plant chamber."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"To construct Meng Yehu’s mechanism body, a Golden Core-level technique, even a basic one, will cost a fortune."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"We also need to nurture the Spirit Concealing Willow, and the spirit soil and spirit liquid in the chamber are nearly depleted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Plus, our daily cultivation expenses are far beyond what most rogue cultivators could dream of, on par with the direct disciples of prestigious sects. After three months, the cost will already be enormous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Not to mention the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon. We're running low on Fire Essence and need a massive resupply."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"I stole Li Jingqing's stash, but compared to what we need, it's just a drop in the ocean."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo's face changed again and again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The Nascent Soul-level Wandering Dragon was truly convenient, but the cost of using it was sky-high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo’s accumulation from his time in Fire Persimmon Immortal City was already barely enough to sustain it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">In order to advance his cultivation, Ning Zhuo’s daily consumption of spiritual energy, spiritual food, and other resources was astronomical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">And then there was the Spirit Concealing Willow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo’s face turned pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">That tree was a massive drain on resources, and to cultivate it properly required a significant investment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Such heirloom treasures are usually supported by an entire sect or family. Relying on ourselves alone is truly challenging."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He had worked hard, scheming and maneuvering to amass a lot of cultivation resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">But compared to what was needed, his accumulation was far from sufficient!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">For now, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo could still manage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">But not for long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">A lack of foresight would soon bring immediate trouble, and this issue had to be addressed now. Otherwise, when it became urgent, it would be too late to solve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo furrowed his brow deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Recently, he had been immersed in his special training, reveling in the rapid, visible progress he was making, and had neglected these looming problems.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Thanks to Sun Lingtong’s reminder, he immediately realized that as time passed, this issue was becoming more and more pressing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">If he waited until the problem exploded, it would be too late!</paragraph><br/><br/>
