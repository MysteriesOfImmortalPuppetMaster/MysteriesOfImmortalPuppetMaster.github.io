<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 206: Four Uses of One Fish</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo had experience in adding spirituality to other items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Yuan Dasheng, Cheng Bai, and Ning Xieâ€™s spirituality were all enhanced through the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">By consuming these individuals' relics from their lifetimes, Ning Zhuo could enhance their spirituality through the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The effect was obvious, convenient, and quick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"But the spirituality used for these two talismans comes from the natural world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Unlike Yuan Dasheng and the others, who were humans in their lifetimes and had frequently used items as fuel for the fire burial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"If I were to approach it from this angle, I would need to find where this spirituality once existed. Burn mountains and rivers there?" As Ning Zhuo calculated this, he felt something was off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He had no confidence in this approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He knew the reason: "I only know how to use the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"I know how it works, but not why it works."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">From Ning Zhuo's perspective as a tool user, the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra was akin to a tool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">It exchanged corresponding spirituality by consuming mana and related relics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">For example, this technique was like a crossbow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo could use the crossbow, knowing that pulling the trigger would shoot an object.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">But he didn't understand the principles behind the crossbow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Only when he understood the principles could he modify itâ€”turning the crossbow into a ballista or altering the arrows to fly farther and more accurately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"I need to understand the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"This might be a long process and a vast project. Iâ€™ll have to wait until I have time in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In his current situation, Ning Zhuo definitely couldn't implement this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He had to seize every moment for cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Previously, he practiced the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique until he reached a proficient and instinctive stage, then decisively paused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Because the results of the next stage of training were unpredictable and uncontrollable in terms of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The pressure from the outside world on Ning Zhuo was immense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">His current situation was like an egg caught between boulders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The outcome of an egg hitting a rock was predictable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo struggled to survive in the cracks between the four major forces, hoping to break through the encirclement and reach the final victoryâ€”the throne of the Lava Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo knew: he needed to carefully consider where to spend every minute and second to ensure the most correct, safest, and highest expected outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A wrong choice could lead to his defeat and even death in the near future!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"If in the future, I fully understand the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Even if this technique can't enhance natural spirituality, I can still improve it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"I can create a new technique based on it to help the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman and the Profound Ice and Snow Talisman increase their spirituality."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Soon, Ning Zhuo left the Ning family territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He didn't return to his residence but immediately took a carriage to the All-Book Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">There, he decisively sold the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique he had just obtained to the All-Book Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He received a considerable amount of pavilion gold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Since there were no books he wanted to exchange for at the moment, Ning Zhuo didn't spend this reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">After leaving the All-Book Pavilion, he invited Zhou Zeshen and Zheng Jian to a banquet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In the private room of the restaurant, he directly handed two jade slips to the two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The jade slips recorded the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, though only the beginning parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhou Zeshen and Zheng Jian both showed astonished expressions after scanning the jade slips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zheng Jian incredulously said, "Could this be the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and admitted frankly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He told the two that he had led the Ning family reformation team to explore the Lava Immortal Palace and achieved great success!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Not only did they luckily repel the mechanical apes, but they also reached the second Dao Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"As long as you touch the Dao Gate, you will obtain the subsequent techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Now, I want to sell these techniques to you two."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Zhou Zeshen and Zheng Jian exchanged glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Zhou Zeshen was the first to react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Of course!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Ning brother, you could have secretly cultivated and established the Ning family's advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"But you didn't do that. Instead, you immediately sold these subsequent techniques to us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"I, Zhou Zeshen, will remember this favor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo laughed, "I also have my selfish motives."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"You both know that my cultivation of this technique is progressing rapidly, as if my talent and physique are highly compatible with it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Next, I will definitely go into seclusion and practice diligently, striving to reach the sixth layer of Hidden Peak as soon as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Only then can I push open the second Dao Gate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Recently, the news leaked from the City Lord's Mansion is known to everyoneâ€”Meng Chong and others are also practicing hard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Now that we have obtained the subsequent techniques, if we seize the time, we might catch up with them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"To be honest, I am very curious about the rewards on the ranking list."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Perhaps this time, someone from our three families can make it onto the Lava Immortal Palace's ranking list."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo's words greatly aroused Zhou Zeshen and Zheng Jian's competitive spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Their desire to purchase the subsequent techniques surged dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zheng Jian directly said, "Ning brother, you are so righteous, selling us the crucial subsequent techniques. This is not something Ning Xiaohui can compare to!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"What do you want to trade for?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Is it still related to refining the Golden Core Stage mechanical apes?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He clarified again, "Regarding the mechanical apes, I increasingly feel that I made a mistake, taking too big a step!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Now it has caused a very bad impact."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"In fact, I just wanted to borrow the strength of the three families to forge the mechanical apes' shells and skeletons. There is still a long way to go before they can be truly activated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"What I want now are resources useful for my own cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Especially things that can purify mana!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Zheng Jian and Zhou Zeshen both showed thoughtful expressions upon hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Zheng Jian clapped his hands, "This is easy. My family has a magical artifact specifically for purifying mana, which can be sold to Ning brother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Zhou Zeshen, however, thought a lot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"According to Ning Zhuo's description, when he reached the second Dao Gate, he wasn't alone; there were other members of the Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"I don't need to buy the subsequent techniques from Ning Zhuo; perhaps I can get them from other members."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Forget it, there's no need to do that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Zhou Zeshen quickly realized: Ning Zhuo and he were similar, both full of strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Ning Zhuo must have instructed the reformation team members to strictly keep the subsequent techniques confidential."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Doing so might not succeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Even if it does, it would sour my relationship with Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Clearly, maintaining a good relationship with Ning Zhuo is more important."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Zhou Zeshen's thoughts raced, and he quickly said, "My family can send several formation masters to set up formations at Ning brother's residence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Ning brother can use the formations to purify mana efficiently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo had long planned how to utilize the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Within a day, he sold this technique to four parties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Four uses of one fish maximized Ning Zhuo's own benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Meng Chong keeps breaking through, and the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique is destined to be kept secret."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"This is unlike the Demonic Blood Vein Technique or the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, which Ning Zhuo concealed with stone walls, keeping everyone in the dark."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"If Ning Zhuo doesn't sell it, the City Lord's Mansion will leak it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Now is the time when the techniques from the fourth to the sixth layer of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique are most valuable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to sell it and indeed got a good price!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He traded for the cultivation resources he needed most to purify mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo was a branch member of the Ning family, not favored by the main branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He had no background or support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">To cultivate better and faster, he could only rely on his own hands to seize and plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Not long after Ning Zhuo returned to his residence, a family messenger brought him the Profound Ice and Snow Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This talisman was pure white, like high-quality silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">When Ning Zhuo held it, he felt a slight chill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The talismanâ€™s runes were smooth and sharp, reflecting the unique style of the talisman master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo vaguely felt that the talisman master who made this talisman had deep attainments in talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">But he couldn't tell the exact level at a glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo placed the talisman in his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">After a while, a thin layer of light enveloped the talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">In this light, the air temperature dropped, quickly condensing into tiny snowflakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Each snowflake was extremely delicate, like mosquito wings, crystal clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"It indeed has spirituality!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo, who had created many spiritual mechanical constructs using the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra, was very familiar with this feeling of spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo began his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He used the Profound Ice and Snow Talisman to freeze himself in ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">When the ice melted, Ning Zhuo couldn't hide his joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The Profound Ice and Snow Talismanâ€™s effect was astonishing, far exceeding Ning Zhuo's highest expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact couldn't compare to it at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Using it to purify my three dantians, supplemented by other methods, I can completely purify myself in about seven days, eliminating all foreign qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"The only drawback is its limited spirituality. Each use consumes spirituality!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"And I only have fifteen uses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Although Ning Zhuo had temporary usage rights, the Ning family patriarch had also imposed strict regulations to prevent Ning Zhuo from overusing and depleting the talismanâ€™s spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo thought of the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Using the Profound Ice and Snow Talisman, he could infer the effectiveness of the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"No wonder Ning Xiaohui could quickly reach the third layer of Qi Refining."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"I must urge for it tomorrow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"The Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman shouldn't remain in Ning Xiaohui's hands!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Even though Ning Zhuo might not use it himself, he had to show urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Moreover, taking the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman from Ning Xiaohui would also significantly weaken his competitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Once, Ning Zhuo was just a marginal figure in the branch family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">When he asked Ning Xiaoren for the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, Ning Xiaoren ridiculed him as delusional!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Now, Ning Zhuo, through his own strategy and means, leveraging the competition among the four major forces, had risen to a high position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Even Ning Xiaohui from the main branch had to yield treasures to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">And his reputation was discussed even among the Golden Core Stage elders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Others sought the Lava Immortal Palace and the inheritance of the three sects' masters, but Ning Zhuo used the Lava Immortal Palace to compete with the major forces, extracting countless cultivation resources from them for himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Without the resources from other forces, how could Ning Zhuo have cultivated to this level so quickly?</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
