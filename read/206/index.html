<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 206: Four Uses of One Fish</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo had experience in adding spirituality to other items.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng, Cheng Bai, and Ning Xie‚Äôs spirituality were all enhanced through the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra.<br/>
<br/>
By consuming these individuals' relics from their lifetimes, Ning Zhuo could enhance their spirituality through the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra.<br/>
<br/>
The effect was obvious, convenient, and quick.<br/>
<br/>
"But the spirituality used for these two talismans comes from the natural world."<br/>
<br/>
"Unlike Yuan Dasheng and the others, who were humans in their lifetimes and had frequently used items as fuel for the fire burial."<br/>
<br/>
"If I were to approach it from this angle, I would need to find where this spirituality once existed. Burn mountains and rivers there?" As Ning Zhuo calculated this, he felt something was off.<br/>
<br/>
He had no confidence in this approach.<br/>
<br/>
He knew the reason: "I only know how to use the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra."<br/>
<br/>
"I know how it works, but not why it works."<br/>
<br/>
From Ning Zhuo's perspective as a tool user, the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra was akin to a tool.<br/>
<br/>
It exchanged corresponding spirituality by consuming mana and related relics.<br/>
<br/>
For example, this technique was like a crossbow.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could use the crossbow, knowing that pulling the trigger would shoot an object.<br/>
<br/>
But he didn't understand the principles behind the crossbow.<br/>
<br/>
Only when he understood the principles could he modify it‚Äîturning the crossbow into a ballista or altering the arrows to fly farther and more accurately.<br/>
<br/>
"I need to understand the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra."<br/>
<br/>
"This might be a long process and a vast project. I‚Äôll have to wait until I have time in the future."<br/>
<br/>
In his current situation, Ning Zhuo definitely couldn't implement this.<br/>
<br/>
He had to seize every moment for cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, he practiced the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique until he reached a proficient and instinctive stage, then decisively paused.<br/>
<br/>
Because the results of the next stage of training were unpredictable and uncontrollable in terms of time.<br/>
<br/>
The pressure from the outside world on Ning Zhuo was immense!<br/>
<br/>
His current situation was like an egg caught between boulders.<br/>
<br/>
The outcome of an egg hitting a rock was predictable.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo struggled to survive in the cracks between the four major forces, hoping to break through the encirclement and reach the final victory‚Äîthe throne of the Lava Immortal Palace!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo knew: he needed to carefully consider where to spend every minute and second to ensure the most correct, safest, and highest expected outcome.<br/>
<br/>
A wrong choice could lead to his defeat and even death in the near future!<br/>
<br/>
"If in the future, I fully understand the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if this technique can't enhance natural spirituality, I can still improve it."<br/>
<br/>
"I can create a new technique based on it to help the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman and the Profound Ice and Snow Talisman increase their spirituality."<br/>
<br/>
Soon, Ning Zhuo left the Ning family territory.<br/>
<br/>
He didn't return to his residence but immediately took a carriage to the All-Book Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
There, he decisively sold the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique he had just obtained to the All-Book Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
He received a considerable amount of pavilion gold.<br/>
<br/>
Since there were no books he wanted to exchange for at the moment, Ning Zhuo didn't spend this reward.<br/>
<br/>
After leaving the All-Book Pavilion, he invited Zhou Zeshen and Zheng Jian to a banquet.<br/>
<br/>
In the private room of the restaurant, he directly handed two jade slips to the two.<br/>
<br/>
The jade slips recorded the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, though only the beginning parts.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen and Zheng Jian both showed astonished expressions after scanning the jade slips.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian incredulously said, "Could this be the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and admitted frankly.<br/>
<br/>
He told the two that he had led the Ning family reformation team to explore the Lava Immortal Palace and achieved great success!<br/>
<br/>
Not only did they luckily repel the mechanical apes, but they also reached the second Dao Gate.<br/>
<br/>
"As long as you touch the Dao Gate, you will obtain the subsequent techniques."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, I want to sell these techniques to you two."<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen and Zheng Jian exchanged glances.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen was the first to react.<br/>
<br/>
"Of course!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ning brother, you could have secretly cultivated and established the Ning family's advantage."<br/>
<br/>
"But you didn't do that. Instead, you immediately sold these subsequent techniques to us."<br/>
<br/>
"I, Zhou Zeshen, will remember this favor."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed, "I also have my selfish motives."<br/>
<br/>
"You both know that my cultivation of this technique is progressing rapidly, as if my talent and physique are highly compatible with it."<br/>
<br/>
"Next, I will definitely go into seclusion and practice diligently, striving to reach the sixth layer of Hidden Peak as soon as possible."<br/>
<br/>
"Only then can I push open the second Dao Gate."<br/>
<br/>
"Recently, the news leaked from the City Lord's Mansion is known to everyone‚ÄîMeng Chong and others are also practicing hard."<br/>
<br/>
"Now that we have obtained the subsequent techniques, if we seize the time, we might catch up with them."<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest, I am very curious about the rewards on the ranking list."<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps this time, someone from our three families can make it onto the Lava Immortal Palace's ranking list."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's words greatly aroused Zhou Zeshen and Zheng Jian's competitive spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Their desire to purchase the subsequent techniques surged dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian directly said, "Ning brother, you are so righteous, selling us the crucial subsequent techniques. This is not something Ning Xiaohui can compare to!"<br/>
<br/>
"What do you want to trade for?"<br/>
<br/>
"Is it still related to refining the Golden Core Stage mechanical apes?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly.<br/>
<br/>
He clarified again, "Regarding the mechanical apes, I increasingly feel that I made a mistake, taking too big a step!"<br/>
<br/>
"Now it has caused a very bad impact."<br/>
<br/>
"In fact, I just wanted to borrow the strength of the three families to forge the mechanical apes' shells and skeletons. There is still a long way to go before they can be truly activated."<br/>
<br/>
"What I want now are resources useful for my own cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
"Especially things that can purify mana!"<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian and Zhou Zeshen both showed thoughtful expressions upon hearing this.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian clapped his hands, "This is easy. My family has a magical artifact specifically for purifying mana, which can be sold to Ning brother."<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen, however, thought a lot.<br/>
<br/>
"According to Ning Zhuo's description, when he reached the second Dao Gate, he wasn't alone; there were other members of the Ning family."<br/>
<br/>
"I don't need to buy the subsequent techniques from Ning Zhuo; perhaps I can get them from other members."<br/>
<br/>
"Forget it, there's no need to do that."<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen quickly realized: Ning Zhuo and he were similar, both full of strategy.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo must have instructed the reformation team members to strictly keep the subsequent techniques confidential."<br/>
<br/>
"Doing so might not succeed."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if it does, it would sour my relationship with Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"Clearly, maintaining a good relationship with Ning Zhuo is more important."<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen's thoughts raced, and he quickly said, "My family can send several formation masters to set up formations at Ning brother's residence."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning brother can use the formations to purify mana efficiently."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had long planned how to utilize the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Within a day, he sold this technique to four parties.<br/>
<br/>
Four uses of one fish maximized Ning Zhuo's own benefits.<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Chong keeps breaking through, and the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique is destined to be kept secret."<br/>
<br/>
"This is unlike the Demonic Blood Vein Technique or the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, which Ning Zhuo concealed with stone walls, keeping everyone in the dark."<br/>
<br/>
"If Ning Zhuo doesn't sell it, the City Lord's Mansion will leak it."<br/>
<br/>
"Now is the time when the techniques from the fourth to the sixth layer of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique are most valuable."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to sell it and indeed got a good price!<br/>
<br/>
He traded for the cultivation resources he needed most to purify mana.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was a branch member of the Ning family, not favored by the main branch.<br/>
<br/>
He had no background or support.<br/>
<br/>
To cultivate better and faster, he could only rely on his own hands to seize and plan.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after Ning Zhuo returned to his residence, a family messenger brought him the Profound Ice and Snow Talisman.<br/>
<br/>
This talisman was pure white, like high-quality silk.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo held it, he felt a slight chill.<br/>
<br/>
The talisman‚Äôs runes were smooth and sharp, reflecting the unique style of the talisman master.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo vaguely felt that the talisman master who made this talisman had deep attainments in talismans.<br/>
<br/>
But he couldn't tell the exact level at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo placed the talisman in his palm.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, a thin layer of light enveloped the talisman.<br/>
<br/>
In this light, the air temperature dropped, quickly condensing into tiny snowflakes.<br/>
<br/>
Each snowflake was extremely delicate, like mosquito wings, crystal clear.<br/>
<br/>
"It indeed has spirituality!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, who had created many spiritual mechanical constructs using the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra, was very familiar with this feeling of spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo began his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
He used the Profound Ice and Snow Talisman to freeze himself in ice.<br/>
<br/>
When the ice melted, Ning Zhuo couldn't hide his joy.<br/>
<br/>
The Profound Ice and Snow Talisman‚Äôs effect was astonishing, far exceeding Ning Zhuo's highest expectations.<br/>
<br/>
The Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact couldn't compare to it at all.<br/>
<br/>
"Using it to purify my three dantians, supplemented by other methods, I can completely purify myself in about seven days, eliminating all foreign qi."<br/>
<br/>
"The only drawback is its limited spirituality. Each use consumes spirituality!"<br/>
<br/>
"And I only have fifteen uses."<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo had temporary usage rights, the Ning family patriarch had also imposed strict regulations to prevent Ning Zhuo from overusing and depleting the talisman‚Äôs spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought of the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman.<br/>
<br/>
Using the Profound Ice and Snow Talisman, he could infer the effectiveness of the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman.<br/>
<br/>
"No wonder Ning Xiaohui could quickly reach the third layer of Qi Refining."<br/>
<br/>
"I must urge for it tomorrow."<br/>
<br/>
"The Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman shouldn't remain in Ning Xiaohui's hands!"<br/>
<br/>
Even though Ning Zhuo might not use it himself, he had to show urgency.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, taking the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman from Ning Xiaohui would also significantly weaken his competitor.<br/>
<br/>
Once, Ning Zhuo was just a marginal figure in the branch family.<br/>
<br/>
When he asked Ning Xiaoren for the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, Ning Xiaoren ridiculed him as delusional!<br/>
<br/>
Now, Ning Zhuo, through his own strategy and means, leveraging the competition among the four major forces, had risen to a high position.<br/>
<br/>
Even Ning Xiaohui from the main branch had to yield treasures to him.<br/>
<br/>
And his reputation was discussed even among the Golden Core Stage elders.<br/>
<br/>
Others sought the Lava Immortal Palace and the inheritance of the three sects' masters, but Ning Zhuo used the Lava Immortal Palace to compete with the major forces, extracting countless cultivation resources from them for himself.<br/>
<br/>
Without the resources from other forces, how could Ning Zhuo have cultivated to this level so quickly?</div>
