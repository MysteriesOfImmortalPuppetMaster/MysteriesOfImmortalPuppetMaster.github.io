<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Sun Lingtong controlled the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, tracking these suspicious black-robed cultivators wearing hoods.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Li Dragon shrank to its smallest size and turned invisible, moving through the mountain forest without making a sound.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong gradually made his way deeper into this giant pillar-like tree.<br/>
<br/>
The surface of the giant tree was covered in thick mountain rocks, with countless plants growing on it, creating dense vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
The whistling wind kept coming, sounding like wailing ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
Under the shadows of intertwining plants, there seemed to be flickering ghostly shadows, or perhaps ambushing beasts hiding, making Sun Lingtong stay extremely alert.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the tracking, none of the hooded black-robed cultivators discovered the Ten Thousand Li Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
This was not surprising to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Because these people's cultivation levels were relatively low - the leading figures had Foundation Establishment level cultivation, while most others were merely Qi Refining cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
"Another cave... there must be fifty or sixty of them by now?"<br/>
<br/>
"The number of caves in this giant tree mountain is unusually high."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had just descended from high altitude and now, delving deeper into one of the pillar-like trees, discovered more details.<br/>
<br/>
This tree mountain was covered with caves of various sizes, like dark mouths silently watching passersby.<br/>
<br/>
Strangely, at regular intervals, large amounts of yin wind would blow out from the caves, making different sounds. Some were deep moaning sounds that made one's hair stand on end, while others were like rushing tides, growing so loud that people had to cover their ears.<br/>
<br/>
The hooded black robes moved swiftly and lightly, like ghosts in the night, constantly retreating silently.<br/>
<br/>
When they reached the mountainside, they stopped for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Several leaders took out maps or tokens, compared them with each other, and jointly chose a nearby cave.<br/>
<br/>
The robed figures entered in single file.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong followed closely behind.<br/>
<br/>
The cave entrance was pitch black, with only strong light from the white-robed people's magical tools barely illuminating the path ahead.<br/>
<br/>
At first, there were thick moss patches on the cave walls, emanating a musty and rotting smell, with a suffocating sense of oppression permeating the air.<br/>
<br/>
But as they went deeper, the rocky walls became rough, with nothing on them.<br/>
<br/>
A deep silence enveloped the entire mountain path.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, one of the white-robed people at the back stepped on scattered rocks, making a slight noise.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, all the white-robed cultivators stopped in their tracks, standing motionless like statues.<br/>
<br/>
They all glared at the cultivator who made the noise, with some even directly showing killing intent.<br/>
<br/>
The white-robed cultivator who made the mistake trembled slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this scene, Sun Lingtong became increasingly curious: "What exactly are these people trying to do? They seem very afraid, as if they're afraid of waking someone up."<br/>
<br/>
The structure of the mountain path was relatively simple, with numerous intersections, like a huge maze. Sun Lingtong concentrated, silently memorizing the scene at each fork.<br/>
<br/>
A detailed route map was imprinted in his mind. His ability to judge and remember paths and directions had been cultivated since childhood and was quite outstanding.<br/>
<br/>
A strange feeling arose in Sun Lingtong's heart; the simple terrain reminded him of his days in Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
"Compared to the tunnels in Fire Persimmon Mountain, these are obviously ten times simpler, those were much more winding."<br/>
<br/>
"However, although these mountain paths interweave, the terrain doesn't undergo huge changes. Unlike Fire Persimmon Mountain's tunnels, which would change course or path with just an eruption or ground movement."<br/>
<br/>
"With that kind of terrain, even after walking through it several times, there's still a chance to thoroughly investigate and understand it."<br/>
<br/>
As they went deeper, the mountain path became increasingly narrow, with no stalactites, stalagmites, or other such formations.<br/>
<br/>
These abnormal geological features also made Sun Lingtong stay vigilant.<br/>
<br/>
After about an hour, the hooded white-robed people arrived at a huge cave hall.<br/>
<br/>
The ceiling was low, with rough stone walls all around.<br/>
<br/>
Only the leaders at the front held magical tools that continued to emit strong light, barely allowing people to see. This was clearly intentional.<br/>
<br/>
At the other end of the cave hall was a huge cave opening unlike any seen before.<br/>
<br/>
The opening was pitch black like ink, seeming like an ancient beast opening its huge mouth, waiting for prey to willingly enter, giving a sense of hidden great danger.<br/>
<br/>
The white-robed cultivators finished setting up their formation.<br/>
<br/>
A huge circular formation was carved into the ground, and everyone stood at different points within the large formation.<br/>
<br/>
The white-robed people chanted spells loudly, with spiritual power fluctuations growing stronger, making the entire cave hall tremble slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong wanted to identify the formation but wasn't successful.<br/>
<br/>
He found that the formation's structure was quite different from mainstream formations, filled with many divine texts, twisting and turning, making it impossible to recognize anything.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong waited patiently.<br/>
<br/>
The formation was activated to its extreme, emitting a ghostly light.<br/>
<br/>
The light spread like smoke, entering the huge cave opening behind them.<br/>
<br/>
But as time passed, there was no movement or change.<br/>
<br/>
Some Qi Refining cultivators standing at the formation points showed signs of being unable to sustain it, growing weak.<br/>
<br/>
They dared not speak aloud, but used the formation to communicate through divine sense, expressing that they couldn't hold on and needed to pause and rest.<br/>
<br/>
However, the Foundation Establishment level leaders ignored them.<br/>
<br/>
The Qi Refining cultivators found no response and tried to break free, but despite struggling desperately, they were bound by the formation's eye.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Sun Lingtong immediately realized that the formation possessed sacrificial abilities at most.<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, a moment later, the Qi Refining cultivators collapsed, their flesh and internal organs falling to the ground as all their bones were extracted, becoming sacrificial materials.<br/>
<br/>
But there was still no movement from the cave opening.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining Foundation Establishment cultivators exchanged glances before taking out daggers and stabbing themselves fiercely.<br/>
<br/>
They committed suicide simultaneously, their cultivation and bones becoming offerings, pushing the formation's power to its highest level.<br/>
<br/>
However, it still had no effect!<br/>
<br/>
The remaining seven cultivators gradually stopped the formation, communicating with each other through divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong couldn't eavesdrop and grew increasingly anxious.<br/>
<br/>
He speculated in his heart: "These demonic cultivators probably came here to communicate with some powerful being."<br/>
<br/>
But what exactly was this being?<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes gleamed, and while his heart still hesitated, his hands had already begun to act.<br/>
<br/>
He controlled the Ten Thousand Li Dragon to quietly slip into the huge cave opening.<br/>
<br/>
This mountain path was quite broad, much shorter than Sun Lingtong had imagined.<br/>
<br/>
And the journey was peaceful, with no danger, at most just being a bit dark and gloomy.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the mountain path was a stone block, about the size of a house.<br/>
<br/>
The stone was round like a ball, with a very smooth surface, and still had some remaining vitality, leaking a trace of aura higher than the Nascent Soul level.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's heart raced: "Higher than Nascent Soul level, could this be a Soul Formation level expert?"<br/>
<br/>
He found it exciting.<br/>
<br/>
If it were Ning Zhuo, he would never risk entering the cave to investigate. But Sun Lingtong had a nature that loved adventure and seeking thrills.<br/>
<br/>
But this thrill was too intense.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong broke out in cold sweat, carefully controlling the Ten Thousand Li Dragon to slowly retreat.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Li Dragon was only at the Nascent Soul level, and under the eyes of a Soul Formation level expert, the possibility of being discovered was very high.<br/>
<br/>
However, when Sun Lingtong had retreated halfway, he voluntarily stopped.<br/>
<br/>
"Wait a minute, it seems... it appears... it looks like..."<br/>
<br/>
"Is this Soul Formation expert already dead?"<br/>
<br/>
He carefully observed again, using the Ten Thousand Li Dragon's detection methods to investigate.<br/>
<br/>
A moment later, Sun Lingtong's face showed a complex and strange expression.<br/>
<br/>
He confirmed that the Soul Formation expert was indeed dead!</div>
