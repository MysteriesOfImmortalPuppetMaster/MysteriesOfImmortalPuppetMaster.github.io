Zhu Xuanji nodded at the shop assistant and then looked at Ning Zhuo, "You, young lad, always eager to advance. At such a young age, you've already become the master of the black market. You're so adept at maneuvering, this kind of Azure Cloud seems to suit you well." Zhu Xuanji teased Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo felt heavy-hearted.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't figure out if Zhu Xuanji had followed him here.<br/>
<br/>
Since the last time Zhu Xuanji inspected his three Dantians, Ning Zhuo felt that Zhu Xuanji's attention towards him had not decreased but rather increased!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo forced a bitter smile and explained, "Lord Zhu, you surely know my situation, why mock me? If circumstances allowed, I wouldn't want to be involved with the black market." As he spoke, he removed his mask, revealing his true face.<br/>
<br/>
With Zhu Xuanji present, Ning Zhuo wasn't worried about any assassination attempts.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the previous assassination was merely an illusion, or perhaps just a trend.<br/>
<br/>
The shop assistant recognized Ning Zhuo's true face and immediately greeted him, "So it's the talented cultivator from the Ning family, Young Master Ning Zhuo! It's truly an honor for our shop to have your presence."<br/>
<br/>
The Cloud Merchant was indeed skilled in business.<br/>
<br/>
Even an ordinary shop assistant could speak eloquently, offering flattery without repetition.<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, you may leave now." At this moment, another figure gradually emerged.<br/>
<br/>
This Golden Core cultivator had broad nostrils, giving off a very steady impression.<br/>
<br/>
He was the leader of the Cloud Merchant, the master of the Cloud Whale—Song Fuli.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli first greeted Zhu Xuanji and then smiled at Ning Zhuo, "Young friend Ning Zhuo, is it appropriate for me to address you this way?" Ning Zhuo shrugged, indicating that Lord Song could address him as he pleased.<br/>
<br/>
With the leader of the Cloud Merchant personally attending to them, the shop assistant immediately bowed and quietly withdrew.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli inquired what Zhu Xuanji wanted to purchase, offering to accompany him throughout and provide some suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's original purpose wasn't to buy any treasures.<br/>
<br/>
He merely wanted to have a few words with Ning Zhuo and let Zhu Zhen, who was hidden nearby, confirm the target of his investigation this time.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said, "I'm just here to take a look. The one who truly wants to buy something isn't me, but him." Ning Zhuo replied, "I'm just looking around, not necessarily buying anything."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji chuckled, "You seem to lack this kind of flying tool. The Flowing Cloud from the Flying Cloud Kingdom is one of the most classic flying artifacts, very useful. It's quite fitting to acquire one during this good opportunity. Don't tell me you don't have money; the black market you manage now is practically a gold mine!" Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly again.<br/>
<br/>
Just as he was about to retort, Song Fuli interjected, "What a fortunate encounter to see both of you here. As the leader of the merchant caravan, I'll make the decision privately. Today, whatever kind of Flowing Cloud you purchase, I'll give you a 20% discount."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately looked at him, somewhat dissatisfied, "Wait, our esteemed Lord Zhu, a divine constable of the Divine Constable Division, a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, and his face only warrants a 20% discount? Lord Song, isn't that a bit disrespectful?"<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli was taken aback.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji laughed and scolded, pointing at Ning Zhuo, "You brat, my face isn't for you to use for bargaining." Song Fuli laughed heartily and immediately said, "40% off, everything is 40% off." This time, even Zhu Xuanji was tempted.<br/>
<br/>
A 40% discount was quite low.<br/>
<br/>
These Flowing Cloud artifacts were not lacking buyers.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli's way of selling was entirely to curry favor with Zhu Xuanji and Ning Zhuo, not to make a profit.<br/>
<br/>
Next, Song Fuli led the two to the top floor to introduce various Flowing Cloud artifacts.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli explained, "To choose a good Flowing Cloud, you must consider both quality and grade. In terms of grade, of course, the Foundation Establishment level is weaker than the Golden Core level, and so on."<br/>
<br/>
"In terms of quality, it mainly depends on what kind of spells were used to refine the flying artifact and what type of cloud qi was used as the main material. In short, the grade is just a reflection of the present, but good quality represents potential and the future growth limit. The artifacts and magical artifacts on the top floor are all of excellent quality, the best among the best."<br/>
<br/>
"Because they use excellent cloud materials, they can at least be upgraded by one grade in the future, for example, from Foundation Establishment level to Golden Core level." Ning Zhuo was not in a hurry, carefully browsing the Flowing Clouds on the top floor.<br/>
<br/>
He was only at the Qi Refining Stage, and even if he advanced, he would only reach the Foundation Establishment Stage.<br/>
<br/>
The most suitable for him was an artifact-level Flowing Cloud.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo was considering whether he should equip Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai each with a Flowing Cloud.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng was not at the Golden Core level in life, but the new mechanical body Ning Zhuo prepared for him was made with Golden Core level materials.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, Yuan Dasheng's new body was at the Golden Core level.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai was a Golden Core in life, and although the materials for Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai were ordinary, they contained his Golden Core from life, ensuring Golden Core combat power when fully activated!<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli carefully introduced Ning Zhuo and Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
On the top floor, besides the previously mentioned Somersault Cloud, Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud, and Azure Cloud, there were also Thunder Cloud, Cold Snow Cloud, Black Iron Cloud, Hail Cloud, and more.<br/>
<br/>
After some consideration, Ning Zhuo and Zhu Xuanji each made their choices, with Ning Zhuo purchasing five Flowing Clouds.<br/>
<br/>
A magical artifact-level Black Iron Cloud for Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
This cloud had a large carrying capacity, was the thickest, and had the strongest defense.<br/>
<br/>
An artifact-level Cold Snow Cloud to pair with the Weather Sphere Ice Crystal Snow.<br/>
<br/>
This mechanical sphere's spirituality was second only to Yuan Dasheng's in Ning Zhuo's possession, reaching a stage of self-sufficiency.<br/>
<br/>
In this regard, even Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai couldn't compare.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo originally wanted to equip Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai with a magical artifact-level Ghost Cloud.<br/>
<br/>
However, there wasn't one available here.<br/>
<br/>
He also wanted to choose a Blood Cloud, but there wasn't one here either.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also bought two artifact-level Somersault Clouds and a magical artifact-level Five-Colored Auspicious Cloud.<br/>
<br/>
Such a large-scale purchase made Song Fuli stare at Ning Zhuo for quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
"Is the black market really this profitable?" Zhu Xuanji was also surprised.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo chuckled softly, changing the topic, "I didn't expect you, Lord Zhu, to recommend Azure Cloud to me, yet you ended up choosing this Flowing Cloud yourself." Zhu Xuanji laughed heartily, "After much deliberation, this cloud suits me best."<br/>
<br/>
"Honored guests, please accept this invitation." Song Fuli took out two platinum-colored invitations from his storage bracelet and handed them to Ning Zhuo and Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji unfolded it and said, "An auction?" Song Fuli nodded with a smile, "Indeed."<br/>
<br/>
"Our Cloud City hosts the highest-end trading event, which is the auction."<br/>
<br/>
"If you two can attend, it will surely add luster to the auction."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo curiously asked, "Lord Song, could you tell us in advance what items will be auctioned?" Song Fuli replied, "Mainly some specialties from our Flying Cloud Kingdom."<br/>
<br/>
"For example, special-grade cloud tea, picked from the ancient tea trees deep within the Myriad Clouds Sea. It's the top spiritual food in the world, and long-term consumption may provide some insight into the Dao of Clouds. To develop innate talent into a divine ability, one must grasp some principle. This is a good choice for Golden Core cultivators aspiring to master divine abilities. Another example is the Myriad Cloud Seed. Cultivators can hatch and nurture it, potentially raising powerful cloud beasts like Cloud Whales or Cloud Dragons, becoming a major opportunity in their cultivation journey. And then there's Virtuous Water."<br/>
<br/>
"The full name is Supreme Virtuous Water, one of the seven true waters, a treasure of water element merit. Although there are only three drops, it can still transform numerous anomalies and solve countless rare and difficult problems. For instance, if someone is cursed, using this water can convert the curse's power into virtuous water, allowing it to flow away."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's heart was immediately stirred, thinking: If I could obtain virtuous water, it would not only greatly aid my Foundation Establishment but also provide an opportunity to eliminate the various monitoring methods left on me by Golden Core cultivators!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was also tempted.<br/>
<br/>
"Supreme Virtuous Water," he murmured softly.<br/>
<br/>
This true water was indeed very practical, useful in many aspects of cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
This made Ning Zhuo feel immense pressure.<br/>
<br/>
"If it really goes to auction, how can my financial resources compete with Golden Core cultivators?" He had just spent most of his capital on purchasing Flowing Clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Facing the auction in a few days, he felt even less confident.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's thoughts turned, and he asked, "Lord Song, does the auction only accept spirit stones?"<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli immediately understood Ning Zhuo's implication and smiled, "Of course, it's not just spirit stones! The treasures brought out by cultivators for offsetting the price will undergo rigorous appraisal by us. Some treasures, due to our own needs, will be appraised at several times, even ten times their normal value." Zhu Xuanji curiously asked, "What are the treasures with excess valuation?"<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli smiled, "For example, Spirit Stone Mine Mother, Night Rain Demon Weapon, Heavenly Gang Earth Fiends, Yin-Yang Self-Rotation Technique, Cloud Concealment Bud... Oh, here's the list." With that, Song Fuli handed each of them a jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took the jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
As he was not yet a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he could only place the jade slip against his forehead to view it.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, possessing divine sense, found it more convenient.<br/>
<br/>
He only needed to hold it in his hand and infuse his divine sense into the jade slip to see the contents at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
"They're all heavenly treasures," Zhu Xuanji sighed.<br/>
<br/>
"The Spirit Stone Mine Mother, planted deep underground, can transform ordinary stones into spirit stones, creating a spirit stone vein out of thin air. The Night Rain Demon Weapon is extremely sharp, often sought after by powerful beings attempting to uncover the secrets of the Night Rain Dynasty. The Heavenly Gang Earth Fiends, regardless of which type, are rare resources, essential for cultivation after reaching the Nascent Soul stage."<br/>
<br/>
"The Yin-Yang Self-Rotation Technique is renowned. It's said that cultivating this technique can generate a continuous flow of yin and yang energy within the body, sometimes merging yin and yang, allowing for dual cultivation and rapid growth in power and cultivation. What is this Cloud Concealment Bud?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's question made Ning Zhuo's heart skip a beat.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli glanced at Ning Zhuo with the corner of his eye and smiled, "Not long ago, a list was compiled by the master of the Myriad Flower Garden, Fairy Die Meng, ranking the world's rare flowers and grasses. Among them, the Cloud Concealment Bud ranked sixth. As for its specific use..."<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli spread his hands, "I don't know either."</div>
