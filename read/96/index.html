<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Room 1.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Puppet components jerked to life, assembling together to form several humanoid shapes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Very quickly, puppet Zhou Zhu, puppet Zheng Jian, puppet Ning Xiaohui, and puppet Ning Zhuo all gathered in one place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The group looked each other over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zhou Zhu was tall and broad. Zheng Jian was surrounded by several wooden hooks. Ning Xiaohui’s hands were built with delicate precision, markedly different from the rest of her body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">As for Ning Zhuo…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Wow, your head is huge!” Zhou Zhu exclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zheng Jian nodded slightly. “It looks like you definitely have some sort of hidden innate talent.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Over the course of their continuous deaths, Zhou Zhu and Zheng Jian gradually came to understand many things, including the secret connection between the puppet bodies and their innate talents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Zhou Zhu asked, “What kind of innate talent could cause a big head?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Xiaohui replied, “There are many. For example, Clear Spirit Platform, Exceptional Endowment, Deep Rooted Wisdom, Soaring Divine Thoughts, Heaven-Bestowed Wisdom…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Her voice was calm, but she was shocked internally. She hadn’t expected that Ning Zhuo really did have an innate talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Moreover, it was an innate talent that was very well-suited for mechanical arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo’s divine intent was unusually abundant. Upon reaching Foundation Establishment, divine intent would evolve into divine sense, which could be used to easily do things like control beasts, manipulate gu, command souls, mobilize dao soldiers and corpse puppets, etc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Naturally, it helped with all kinds of mechanical constructs as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“For real? …Yeah, my head is definitely a size bigger than all of yours.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo looked around at the group, touched his own large head, and spoke in a surprised tone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ever since the reveal of Ning Zhuo’s divine intent advantage at the banquet, the others had been highly curious about him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo had a shocking amount of divine intent, and it was very likely that he possessed a related innate talent. However, testing innate talents was no easy matter. There were many rare and strange innate talents that were difficult to detect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Thus, Zhou Zeshen came up with an idea: “Let’s enter the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“According to our knowledge of the immortal palace, our puppet bodies will manifest our innate talents as unique features.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“If Brother Ning truly has an innate talent, it will definitely show up in his puppet body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“The Lava Immortal Palace was once the residence of Three Schools Supreme Sage. Screening talents shouldn’t be an issue!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Everyone agreed enthusiastically to this proposal. After setting up a meeting time to enter the immortal palace with their souls, they dispersed and each returned home.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">And now, they were all gathered in the immortal palace, crowding around Ning Zhuo and inspecting his oversized head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo had no choice but to expose the existence of his innate talent like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">There was no way around it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Once he entered the immortal palace, his large head would undoubtedly draw attention anyway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">It was just too distinctive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">And as more and more people entered the immortal palace in the future, the unusual puppets of innate talent holders would stand out even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Thus, Ning Zhuo decided that he might as well actively expose himself sooner rather than later, and try to influence what conclusions the others would come to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Fortunately, there were many innate talents that might manifest as a large head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Some innate talents required strict testing and massive resource consumption to detect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Forcing Ning Zhuo to reveal his Early Wisdom wouldn’t be easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“This means the Ning Clan now has two innate talent holders, just like our Zhou Clan,” Zhou Zhu thought inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zheng Jian felt even more burdened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He was the sole prodigy of the Zheng Clan, while the other clans had two each. At this rate, the Zheng Clan would be doomed to the bottom of the totem pole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Thinking of this, Zheng Jian quickly spoke up. “Now that the three clans are allying together, Brother Ning having an innate talent is a great thing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“After all, our enemy is Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“He has an immortal talent. Even if we add Zhou Zeshen, it will be difficult to deal with him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zheng Jian emphasized their opponent’s power in order to reinforce the three clans’ unity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhou Zhu deeply agreed. “We’ve seen it ourselves. The moment Meng Chong pushed open the door, his whole body was like a bolt of lightning, instantly flickering through Room 2 and entering Room 3.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“With that kind of power, he must already be deep in the immortal palace. He’s way ahead of us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly. Unwilling to keep praising an outsider, she said, “Didn’t Meng Chong pass out recently? It’s obvious that the trials of the immortal palace become harder the further you go. Even Meng Chong couldn’t handle it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo nodded. “An immortal talent really is formidable. Come on, let’s choose our rewards and open the door.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Sounds good,” Zhou Zhu agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The four of them each touched the door and chose their rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zheng Jian was just about to teach Ning Zhuo how to use the hanging ring when he saw the latter tilt his head, think for a moment, and suddenly exclaim, “Ah, so that’s how it is. I get it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">As he spoke, Ning Zhuo fired a colored gem that firmly embedded itself in the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zheng Jian was shaken. Ning Zhuo’s comprehension far surpassed his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Did he know in advance from the compiled intel?” Zheng Jian wondered internally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Here, let me show you how to use it.” Seeing Ning Xiaohui still figuring things out, Ning Zhuo moved to help her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Xiaohui snorted. “No need!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">As she said that, she too successfully launched a colored gem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Still, Ning Xiaohui was not pleased. She thought, “I figured it out so quickly because of my access to the intel that the Zhou and Zheng Clans shared with us. But Ning Zhuo didn’t see any of that at all…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhou Zhu only dared to push the door open a tiny crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“If you open it any wider, spears will shoot through the gap,” he said with the tone of an experienced veteran. “This is the furthest you can open it safely. I’m sure of it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Zheng Jian sighed lightly. “When we first started exploring, that kind of trap didn’t even exist. But the more you explore, the more difficult the immortal palace’s trials become.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo nodded. “So that’s how it is.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Zhou Zhu continued, “Once you push open the door, your feet will be bound, and a heavy hammer will fall on your body and destroy it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“If you try to rush through quickly, you’ll be caught in a net, dragged back, and then smashed to death anyway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“If you stick too close to the edge, sharp spears will shoot out from the walls and pierce you. Even if you withstand those, you’ll be pushed into the center and smashed to death by the hammer.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After hearing all this, Ning Xiaohui grew even more silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">But then Ning Zhuo suddenly said, “I have an idea we could try.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Before that, I want to ask, can we use the other mechanical component in the room?” he asked despite knowing the answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zheng Jian shook his head. “We can’t.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Oh, in that case, the only things we can use are all of you. Everyone, please dismantle yourselves for me,” Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Huh?” Zhou Zhu was dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“You really have a way?” Zheng Jian asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Of course I do, but I can’t guarantee success,” Ning Zhuo replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Zheng Jian smiled. “No matter what kind of method it is, we have to give it a try. What exactly is this plan of yours?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo then revealed his idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu immediately had strange expressions appear on their faces. Meanwhile, Ning Xiaohui took three steps backward and shook her head repeatedly in refusal. “No way! I’m not doing that!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Moments later, a monstrous puppet with four heads, eight arms, and eight legs shoved open the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Its massive body stood firm in the center of the corridor. After triggering the trap, it immediately used one of its limbs as a shield to block the incoming spears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Then, it raised its eight arms high to resist the heavy hammer descending from above.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The hammer hadn’t fallen far enough to gather its full momentum and was thus deflected by the arms, falling awkwardly down to the side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">But in order to accomplish this, three of the monstrous puppet’s arms shattered into pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“We did it, it worked!” Zhou Zhu’s head cheered joyfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zheng Jian’s head looked to be in deep thought. “Clearly, Three Schools Supreme Sage did indeed intend for us to cooperate. This perfectly suits his style of doing things.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“What are you all dawdling for? Hurry up and dismantle us! Get me out of this thing!” Ning Xiaohui’s head couldn’t take it any longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Her head had been placed under an arm, as if in the armpit. Whenever the arm moved, it squeezed her forehead unpleasantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Oh, hold on a moment. I’ll have us dismantled in just a sec,” Ning Zhuo said quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Just thinking about having to pass the first door like this every time makes me feel sick,” Ning Xiaohui complained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Zheng Jian said, “As long as it works. Practicality is all that matters.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Zhou Zhu added, “Right, right. Miss Ning, your head was just under an arm. My head was under the crotch. Did you hear me saying anything?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Sorry, sorry. Next time, I’ll put Brother Zheng underneath instead,” Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Zheng Jian coughed. “Ahem, let’s think this over a little…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Xiaohui screamed, “In any case, I’m never passing with this method in front of anyone else!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Moments later, everyone had returned to their original puppet forms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Xiaohui’s arms were both broken, and Zhou Zhu’s body was full of holes from the spears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">As for Zheng Jian and Ning Zhuo, their puppet bodies were more or less intact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Brother Ning, well done! You’ve really impressed me.” Zheng Jian’s voice was full of excitement as he patted Ning Zhuo’s shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Zhou Zhu looked around emotionally. How many deaths had it been? At least, he was standing safe and sound on the other side of the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">It hadn’t been easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“And it’s all thanks to him.” Zhou Zhu’s internal evaluation of Ning Zhuo rose again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Xiaohui was silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo suggested, “Let’s continue on to the next level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“Good! I want to see what mysteries the second challenge holds.” Zheng Jian laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zhou Zhu added, “Brother Ning, you take up the rear. We’ll scout ahead.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Xiaohui did not object.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Even though they hadn’t spent much time together, Ning Zhuo’s performance had already begun to win the others over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Soon afterward, Zheng Jian and the others fell into pit traps. Their five senses were cut off, trapping them in boundless darkness where all cries for help would remain unanswered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">These traps had been set up by Ning Zhuo himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He had predicted this exact scenario.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">No one could observe him now, so he activated a spell and used the hanging ring to easily pass Room 2.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">After all, most of the traps in this room had been arranged by none other than himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo entered Room 3, immediately awakening a horde of kung fu puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He then summoned Yuan Dasheng to escort and protect him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">This time, he didn’t even use any spells. He walked straight through of Room 3 and arrived at the maintenance room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">As he passed by the ranking lists, he looked up and sighed internally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">There was a problem here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Now that Yuan Dasheng was off the rankings, Ning Zhuo’s alias was at the top of each one. But because of this, if he entered the maintenance room along with the others, the rankings wouldn’t show the name Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">This would obviously seem strange to anyone who saw it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“Fortunately, there’s Yuan Dasheng to guard Room 3. Whether or not Meng Chong can pass this obstacle is still uncertain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“And the three clans’ joint exploration team doesn’t have Meng Chong’s lightning speed. It’ll be very difficult.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
