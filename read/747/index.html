<paragraph index="1">Ban Ji's expression darkened. "Yes. It started when I learned from Pi Fujie that Ning Zhuo possessed a Mechanical Puppet with Golden Core-level technology. I immediately sought to seize it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"I first investigated his background, then sent him a challenge letter, proposing a friendly exchange of skills."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Who could have predicted that this mid-Foundation Establishment youth would be so similar to Situ Xing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Such a coincidence is one in a million."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ban Jie rolled her eyes. "So, you're saying you're just unlucky?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ban Ji: "Precisely. That's why he's my Human Tribulation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ban Jie shook her head. "He now holds your challenge letter, giving him the initiative. He can avoid the fight, but if he presents the letter, you'll be forced to accept!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ban Ji gritted his teeth, silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo was a foreigner, his backing shrouded in mystery, and he had no reputation in the Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This was Ning Zhuo's weakness, but also his strength. At least, pressuring him into a fight through his reputation or connections was virtually impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ban Ji, on the other hand, was in a similar position to Situ Xing and Zhu Fenxiang. If someone targeted the Ban Clan, he would have no choice but to accept the challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">In this respect, he differed from Pi Fujie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Pi Fujie had flatly refused Ning Zhuo's challenge, a perfectly natural reaction. After all, the Pi Clan had originally been Demonic Cultivators who later converted to the Righteous Path; their true nature remained deeply ingrained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ban Ji, however, was different. The Ban Clan had been a Righteous Path family since its founding, making Ban Ji's cultivation of demonic techniques an anomaly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In short, the Ban Clan valued its reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Without face, how could they maintain their standing in the Righteous Path?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">A ruthless glint flashed in Ban Ji's eyes. "To be honest, it wouldn't be bad if Ning Zhuo challenged me first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"If he's foolish enough to seek his own destruction, I'll gladly grant him the opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Of course, if the clan could provide me with more Golden Core-level mechanical constructs, my chances of success would be even greater."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ban Jie shook her head firmly. "Don't be reckless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Having been appointed to support Ban Ji, she had been privy to the clan's most guarded secrets before her departure. Ban Jie knew not only of Ban Ji's Royal Mandate but also of the near-collapse of the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Ning Zhuo isn't as simple as you think," Ban Jie said gravely. "The waters behind him run deep."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ban Ji snorted coldly. "If we weren't at the Myriad Manifestations Sect, I would have already mobilized my forces and crushed him outright."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Even if I fought alone, with eight or more Golden Core-level mechanical constructs, my Innate Talent and demonic techniques would give me combat power comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"A mere Ning Zhuo? I'll crush him like crushing a Python Ant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ban Jie sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The secret of Ban Ji's Royal Mandate was something she herself didn't know, and she couldn't reveal it directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Ban Ji's Royal Mandate hasn't fully awakened yet; it's still very weak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"But according to the clan's plan, each Rising Cloud Minor Trial will gradually stimulate his Royal Mandate, officially launching him on the path of kingship."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Ning Zhuo is a first-rate genius with unfathomable backing, and he represents Ban Ji's Human Tribulation. Currently, his Qi Luck surpasses Ban Ji's. The overall situation clearly shows Ning Zhuo holding the initiative!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Forcing Ban Ji to confront Ning Zhuo head-on now would be extremely risky! Ban Ji is currently lagging behind and needs to catch up in momentum by continuously stimulating his Royal Mandate and rapidly increasing his strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The clan has poured vast resources and painstaking efforts into divining the optimal path for him. Each Rising Cloud Minor Trial will trigger a profound qualitative transformation in his power!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"If we're given enough time, Ban Ji's personal combat strength and Qi Luck will skyrocket."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Once Ban Ji's power far surpasses Ning Zhuo's, leaving him in the dust, this Human Tribulation will resolve itself without a fight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"This is the King's Way! This is the advantage of the Royal Mandate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ban Jie already had a plan in mind. Of course, this plan wasn't her own creation but rather the collective wisdom of the entire Ban Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Ban Ji's fate is intertwined with the Ban Clan's - their fortunes rise and fall together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Now is the time for the clan to shield him from the storm, buying him precious time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"The future belongs to us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ban Jie's public gift-giving earlier had also been a ploy to stall for time. However, Ning Zhuo's fiercely defiant reaction, from the Ban Clan's perspective, showed the young man's excessive arrogance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Yet the clan's elders understood this arrogance all too well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"He's blinded by Qi Luck!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Even a top-tier genius is but a mortal compared to the Royal Mandate. Used by the Heavenly Dao as a Calamity against the Royal Mandate, he's naturally blinded by Qi Luck, a mere pawn in the trials of the Royal Mandate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Now that the challenge letter was in Ning Zhuo's hands, Ban Jie feared he might use it to force Ban Ji into an immediate duel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"His youth, his brazen arrogance, his open defiance of the Ban Clan - all this proves he has a trump card!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"If Ban Ji has his hidden strengths, Ning Zhuo undoubtedly has his own."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Even activating the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain failed to fully calculate his Qi Luck, and part of the clan's protective mechanisms collapsed. That alone speaks volumes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Even without these signs, the fact that Heaven chose him as Ban Ji's Human Tribulation speaks volumes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"How can we prevent him from using the letter to force Ban Ji into a direct confrontation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ban Jie frowned deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">She glanced at Ban Ji but remained silent, resolving inwardly, "If Ning Zhuo tries to force a battle, I'll knock Ban Ji unconscious to prevent it. The timing is too unfavorable for us. Even if the Ban Clan's reputation suffers, that's a price worth paying to protect the Royal Mandate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Ning Zhuo has the backing of Confucian cultivators and the Demon Subduing Hall, but spreading rumors remains a viable strategy. This won't deal him a fatal blow, but it will serve as a harassing jab."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"To protect Ban Ji and prevent another incident like the Qing Huangzi affair, we need to create massive distractions. These could be traps, or even genuine opportunities. Anything that diverts Ning Zhuo's attention will be a victory."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Ah, who would have thought the mighty Ban Clan would ever find itself in such a weak and passive position?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Rumors erupted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Various rumors and opinions targeting Ning Zhuo spread like wildfire throughout the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">These rumors focused cultivators' attention on Ning Zhuo's outsider status, emphasizing his arrogance, haughty demeanor, disdain for native Flying Cloud Kingdom cultivators, and lack of proper decorum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">At the same time, the rumors pointed out that Ning Zhuo's mid-Foundation Establishment cultivation was the weakest among all top-tier geniuses. Yet he carried himself with an air of arrogance, treating others as if he were the center of the universe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">These rumors only slightly damaged Ning Zhuo's reputation and goodwill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Without offending the Confucian cultivator community or the Demon Subduing Hall, Ban Jie had done all she could.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">What truly enraged her were the rumors targeting the Ban Clan, which dredged up Ban Ji's past sins during his cultivation years and dragged his old misdeeds into the public eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Particularly disgusting to Ban Jie was another strand of rumors. This one, posing as a well-wisher of the Ban Clan, urged them to purge their ranks and eliminate Ban Jie, the "rotten apple" within their ranks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"The Clan Fortune is already bound to the Royal Mandate! 'Purging the ranks' would be tantamount to the Ban Clan committing suicide!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"This rumor is truly malicious! It attempts to separate Ban Ji from the Ban Clan, sowing discord while simultaneously pressuring the family. If they continue to tolerate Ban Ji, they'll inevitably face widespread suspicion and irreparable damage to their reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Ning Zhuo... he's truly formidable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"The chances that Zhu Fenxiang was behind the incense-burning incident are now at least seventy percent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Although Ban Jie had anticipated a disadvantageous situation, the severity of the crisis far exceeded her expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A true expert reveals their skill with a single move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In clashes between masters, a mere glance can reveal the approximate level of each opponent's strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This round of confrontation should have been Ban Jie's forte, yet Ning Zhuo had utterly crushed her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The gap in skill was glaringly obvious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Our disadvantage is overwhelming, and my hands are tied. How can I possibly compete with Ning Zhuo? Damn him! How infuriating!" Ban Jie bit her lip so hard it bled, yet she didn't even notice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">She felt suffocated, a burning rage simmering within her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Myriad Manifestations Sect's Flying Cloud Assembly was the focus of universal attention, drawing countless gazes from across the Flying Cloud Kingdom. Beyond the nation's borders, cultivators from distant lands would travel tens of thousands of li for the chance to join and prove themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">On this grand stage, every action would be magnified a thousandfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo had already showcased the brilliance of a first-rate genius. His influence wasn't confined to the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main gate; news of his exploits had already leaked out and begun spreading throughout the Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">If his exceptional performance continued until the end of the Flying Cloud Assembly, his reputation would undoubtedly spread to neighboring Cultivation nations!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">This was the true significance of the Flying Cloud Assembly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">It was precisely for this reason that Situ Xing, Lin Jinglong, Shen Xi, Ban Ji, Pi Fujie, and others had waited years for this very opportunity to seize the spotlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">This was truly the ultimate stage for achieving worldwide fame!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Now, the rumors Ning Zhuo had unleashed were dealing a devastating blow to Ban Ji and the Ban Clan's reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ban Jie understood all too well that the Ban Clan's reputation was rapidly crumbling, and Ban Ji had become the target of universal scorn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"The Clan Destiny Pivot Chain must already be showing a significant reaction. The Clan Fortune is undoubtedly plummeting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Alas, there's no other way. Compared to the Royal Mandate, this is a necessary sacrifice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In the past, Ban Jie had never understood why the clan indulged Ban Ji, always believing it stemmed from the elders' doting affection and leniency toward a prodigy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Now, she knew the truth: the Ban Clan had no choice. Ban Ji's Royal Mandate destined him for the Strange Path and the Demonic Sect. Even if they forced him to cultivate the Righteous Path, fate would conspire to make him defect and become a Demonic Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">By then, the entire Ban Clan would have no choice but to confront Ban Jie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">On the contrary, by aligning with the Royal Mandate's trajectory, actively guiding him to cultivate Demonic Path techniques, and linking it to the Clan Fortune and Royal Mandate, they could fundamentally prevent any future betrayal or animosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Ban Clan's protection of Ban Ji had come at a heavy price. But in the future, when the Royal Mandate erupted, securing a foothold and establishing a small cultivation nation, the entire Ban Clan would rise to prominence, becoming royal relatives and national dignitaries!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Green Stone Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Various intelligence reports converged in Ning Zhuo's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Ban Jie hasn't spread rumors about me cheating in the trials? She's got some tricks up her sleeve."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This was the main mountain gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. For outsiders like Ning Zhuo and Ban Jie to spread rumors, it would be easily traced back to the source by the sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">If Ban Jie had truly spread rumors about Ning Zhuo cheating, it would have been a foolish move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"She's merely fabricated stories about my arrogant and overbearing personality - harmless nonsense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"The real problem is that Ban Ji has already secured first place in the Blind Foolish Old Man's trial and obtained the stone tablet. How will he participate in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Will he choose the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor of the ancient Pivot Sect, or the Celestial Mechanism Star Calculator from the Heavenly Relic?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Is it the Immortal Avian Feather Clan fulfilling their promise to seek a destined owner for the Great Peng Wings, or the Gui Cang Locksmith's recruitment trial?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Intelligence gathered had already confirmed that Ban Ji possessed Golden Core-level mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">With two of his major combat forces - Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu - unavailable, Ning Zhuo wouldn't directly confront Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Firstly, both Snow Pivot Guard - Xie and Snow Radiance Maiden - Hui were hastily crafted by Ning Zhuo himself, newly acquired Golden Core-level puppets from the Empty Valley Syllable Azure Mechanism Cylinder inheritance. Specializing in defense, Ning Zhuo couldn't fully unleash their offensive capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Secondly, the Myriad Manifestations Sect's martial arts arena permitted life-and-death battles, a risk Ning Zhuo deemed unnecessary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Thirdly, his goal was to establish his authority over Ban Ji, not to kill him. Given Ban Ji's backing from the Ban Clan, Ning Zhuo had no desire to completely antagonize the entire clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Time is my greatest advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"I have numerous learning methods at my disposal. The Spirit Hidden Willow is also on its way. These Rising Cloud Minor Trials are all resources for my rapid growth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"All I need to do is suppress Ban Ji and establish a certain level of prestige."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"I'm new here, yet my reputation has already soared. I need to establish my authority to secure my position!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo remained unaware of the secret behind Ban Ji's Royal Mandate, nor did he realize that the Ban Clan's Qi Luck was intertwined with Ban Ji's - their fortunes rising and falling together, making them staunch allies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Even more crucially, he didn't know that Ban Ji and the Ban Clan viewed him as Ban Ji's Human Tribulation, requiring their utmost caution and effort to overcome!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo's plan was simple: find the Rising Cloud Minor Trial Ban Ji intended to participate in, and enter it himself. By clashing with Ban Ji in this arena, he could establish his dominance. If he could repeatedly suppress Ban Ji, his reputation would be solidified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ordinary cultivators would think twice before provoking Ning Zhuo. After all, he was the ruthless figure who dared to challenge the Ban Clan and even suppress Ban Ji himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The outcome Ning Zhuo sought was clear: to instill fear in those who considered crossing him, making them understand the dire consequences they would face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"The previous Rising Cloud Minor Trials had few events related to mechanisms."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"But with Ban Jie's arrival, the scale of the mechanism trials has more than tripled."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"And these Rising Cloud Minor Trials are actively inviting me to participate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"This must be a trap set by the Ban Clan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"I must choose carefully."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">If I fall into their trap, Ning Zhuo will inevitably lose under the Ban Clan's influence, perhaps even to Ban Ji himself. That would be a disastrous outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"I need more information to make the best possible decision."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Beyond the background of these Mechanism Minor Trials, I need to know Ban Ji's precise movements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Until then, I'll have to rely on guesswork."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"This Rising Cloud Minor Trial revolves around the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor of the ancient Pivot Sect. It has appeared in every Flying Cloud Assembly, and Ban Ji has even sent subordinates to investigate it. In my opinion, this is the most likely option."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">------</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">Ban Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Ancestral Shrine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">Surrounding the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain, the Supreme Clan Elders gasped for breath, their bodies and minds utterly exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">The structure of the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain had shifted again. Within the glazed vertical tube, the water level was slowly rising.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">This represented Ban Ji's Qi Luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">"Obtaining the stone tablet wasn't the key. The real breakthrough was mastering the Blind Fool Divine Art and officially activating the Royal Mandate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">"What's next?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">"The Ninefold Profound Armament Armor."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
