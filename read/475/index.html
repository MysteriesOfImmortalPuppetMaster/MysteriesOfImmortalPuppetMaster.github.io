<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 475: Enlisting Ma Liangcai (Two-in-One)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">By the imperial decree of the monarch who bears the mandate of the land, it is said:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Mu Lan, you are loyal, brave, and value martial prowess, your illustrious name renowned. From the moment you donned armor and entered the battlefield, you repeatedly rendered outstanding achievements. During the ambush battle in the Thousand Peaks Forest, you were heroic and fearless, providing timely reinforcements and rendering meritorious service.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Recalling the past: when the front line was in dire peril, old General Mu took the initiative to request command. He passed the test of verifying generals, gathered the remaining troops, regrouped, and fought bravely to kill the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Afterwards, as the force gradually expanded, its military might spread far and wide. Eventually, he was able to lead a force independently, known as the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Later, General Mu personally handled matters, repeatedly achieving distinguished military successes that terrified enemy troops and assured the people’s peace. Truly, he was a pillar of the nation and an exemplary model for the populace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Upon hearing that General Mu Lan is grievously injured, I, the solitary ruler, feel deep sorrow. You have dedicated your heart to the nation, fulfilling both loyalty and filial piety. Indeed, you are a pillar of my Two Note Kingdom, which greatly gratifies me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">National affairs are difficult; the situation in the Thousand Peaks Forest battlefield especially demands attention. Now that your wounds have not yet healed, you cannot personally command the Red Flower Camp. To ease your mind, and also to leave a successor for the Grand Marshal’s mansion, I hereby appoint General Ma Liangcai as a staff officer of the Red Flower Camp, to preside over the major affairs of the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">You must rest and recover. Once healed, you shall return to your position and assist. The affairs of the Red Flower Camp are entrusted to General Ma, so you may rest assured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Thus decreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After the messenger finished reading the imperial edict, he looked around and frowned: “Where is General Mu Lan? Why does she not accept the decree?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Zhang Zhongyi hurriedly said, “General Mu Lan is still unconscious and not in her right mind.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The messenger nodded: “If that is so, General Ma Liangcai, please quickly gain control of the Red Flower Camp and go forth to serve the nation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ma Liangcai nodded, opened his mouth, and gave a light shout. His voice swiftly spread throughout the entire Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The soldiers of the Red Flower Camp swiftly assembled, yet they did not heed Ma Liangcai’s command. Instead, they gathered around Mu Lan’s main commander’s tent. They were united, hostile toward Ma Liangcai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">This scene shocked Ning Zhuo and Liu Er!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Without their main general, Ma Liangcai was of Nascent Soul level and carried the King’s mandate, yet the Red Flower Camp’s soldiers still behaved thus. This showed where their hearts and loyalty lay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ma Liangcai’s face was as calm as still water. The messenger also berated them: “What is the meaning of this? The imperial decree is here! Do you intend to defy orders and commit treason?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Some soldiers were expressionless, while others sneered. All wore resolute expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“A mere imperial decree, and you want to remove our general? That will not do!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Changing generals on the eve of battle is a great taboo. When a general is in the field, he may not always obey the ruler’s commands —this is common sense. Please, Messenger, do not blame us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“We of the Red Flower Camp were established single-handedly by old General Mu, and General Mu Lan is his only daughter. Ma Liangcai, though you are Nascent Soul-level, you are merely one of the three generals under the royal court. How can you compare with the dignified Grand Marshal’s mansion?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Red Flower Camp’s soldiers spoke one after another, openly defying the decree, enraging the messenger greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ma Liangcai’s expression was icy, his gaze under a pair of white eyebrows deep and piercing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">As he looked at these soldiers who were united in purpose, he could not help recalling the scene when the monarch issued the order—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">In the splendid royal hall, draperies gently swayed, and a rich fragrance filled the place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Two Note monarch reclined on the throne, holding the Hu Concubine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Hu Concubine was enchanting and charming, dressed in magnificent palace attire, like a blossoming flower, incomparably beautiful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Your Majesty, have a taste of these grapes,” the Hu Concubine said with a lovely laugh, using her slender jade-like fingers to hold a peeled grape and bring it to the monarch’s lips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The monarch opened his mouth, taking both the grape and the Hu Concubine’s finger inside, savoring them carefully, showing an expression of enjoyment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“This subject, Ma Liangcai, pays respects to Your Majesty.” Ma Liangcai half-knelt on the ground, his head lowered, seeing his reflection on the mirror-like jade floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The monarch gave a small “hm,” still holding the Hu Concubine, glancing sideways at Ma Liangcai: “Rise and speak.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“This subject thanks Your Majesty for your grace.” Ma Liangcai stood up, still with head lowered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The monarch said: “I summoned you here because of the Red Flower Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“The current main general of the Red Flower Camp, Mu Lan, is severely injured and unconscious, unable to continue leading that army. You shall go and take it over.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ma Liangcai’s heart jolted; he could not help looking up: “Your Majesty, what virtue or ability do I have to take over and lead the Red Flower Camp? It is…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The monarch impatiently interrupted: “They are the Grand Marshal’s personal troops.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“How long has old Mu been bedridden? The position of Grand Marshal consumes much of the nation’s resources each year! It should be passed on to someone younger.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Taking over this army will certainly be difficult. That is exactly why I summoned you to handle it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Remember, the Red Flower Camp is this nation’s army. Even though you are a Nascent Soul cultivator, you must not slaughter them arbitrarily.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The monarch lightly tapped the armrest of the throne, and a beam of radiant light shot out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ma Liangcai hurriedly reached out with both hands and caught the light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“You should know of the Red Flower Camp’s old affairs. This treasure will help you succeed. Use it well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“If you take over the Red Flower Camp, bring it back. If you fail, then go submit to the Grand General, obey his commands, and earn merits to redeem yourself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ma Liangcai cupped his hands: “This subordinate obeys the command!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The monarch waved impatiently, and Ma Liangcai swiftly withdrew from the great hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The monarch looked at the Hu Concubine in his arms: “My beloved concubine, this time I am following your plan. Now you should know how deeply I cherish you, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Hu Concubine smiled charmingly, pressing her soft, flower-like cheek to the Two Note monarch’s chest: “My king cherishes this concubine most dearly, I know that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Hahaha.” The Two Note monarch laughed, holding the Hu Concubine tightly. “It is good that my beloved understands my intentions!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Back at the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ma Liangcai’s eyes flashed as he withdrew from his memories, reassessing the situation at hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He gave a cold smile. Unlike the messenger, he did not become angry. Instead, he spoke slowly and deliberately: “Worthy of the Red Flower Camp. Even though it’s a defeated army, it still has a proud and fierce spirit. Very good, very good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Do you know that by behaving this way, you place your general in an unjust position?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“If you refuse to heed a formal transfer, outsiders will believe that the Grand Marshal’s mansion harbors ulterior motives. You should know well that the Grand Marshal’s mansion has no shortage of enemies at court, correct?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“If these people exploit this matter, causing the monarch to misunderstand and become enraged, removing the Grand Marshal from office, then all of you would be sinners!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Upon hearing these words, the soldiers grew restless, uneasy, and uncertain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ma Liangcai continued: “Your Grand Marshal’s mansion has declined to this point. You should strive to rebuild its reputation through merits and achievements!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“General Mu Lan has fallen due to long-term hardship. As her subordinates, do you not know her aspirations?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Without a main general, will you all go into battle on your own? If you suffer another defeat, would that not bring disgrace to the Grand Marshal’s mansion?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Only under my leadership, by achieving military feats, can you stabilize the situation, waiting for General Mu Lan to awaken in the future. Wouldn’t your accomplishments at that time bring her comfort?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Red Flower Camp’s soldiers became even more shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Shuang Jing descended from the skies: “What General Ma says is very reasonable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“I also agree,” Sun Gan said as he descended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“However,” Sun Gan suddenly changed his tone, “compared to General Ma, I, Sun Gan, have spent more time with General Mu Lan and know the Red Flower Camp better. I am more suitable to lead this army!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Shuang Jing said: “Before this, General Mu Lan had instructed me that should anything go amiss, I would take charge of the Red Flower Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Everyone was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo suddenly elbowed Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Liu Er jolted and, struck with inspiration, shouted: “How strange, General Mu Lan also said the same thing to me before!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Everyone was stunned again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ma Liangcai’s expression grew darker. He looked at Shuang Jing and Sun Gan, then glanced at Liu Er, his gaze lingering on Liu Er’s demonic-blood traits, showing undisguised loathing and disdain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ma Liangcai looked to the messenger, transmitting thoughts telepathically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The messenger shouted: “What are you three up to? General Ma Liangcai was personally appointed by the monarch to receive the Red Flower Camp! Do you have the Royal’s decree?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Liu Er gnashed his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Sun Gan immediately said: “The imperial decree states that Ma Liangcai is appointed as a staff officer to join the Red Flower Camp, nothing more. How does that mean taking it over?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Shuang Jing also said: “Although the Red Flower Camp is a regular army of our nation, it was created single-handedly by old General Mu and belongs to the Grand Marshal’s mansion. You, Ma Liangcai, are merely an outsider. How can you take it over?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo transmitted his thoughts telepathically, guiding Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Liu Er gritted his teeth: “You may not know, but General Mu Lan and I have mutual affection, almost to the point of discussing marriage. In terms of closeness, I can be considered half a member of the Grand Marshal’s mansion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“The monarch is wise and cares for loyal officials. If he knew the details, he certainly would not have sent you here, Lord Ma.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">When these words emerged, everyone glared at Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Countless gazes burned with shock and fury, as if spitting fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo quietly moved a few steps away, distancing himself from Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Liu Er’s breathing paused slightly. He felt an incomparably heavy pressure in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Whether Ma Liangcai, the royal messenger, Shuang Jing, Sun Gan, Zhang Zhongyi, or the Red Flower Camp soldiers, all wanted to grind this outspoken Liu Er to dust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">What sort of creature are you?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A mere human-demon hybrid dares to sully General Mu Lan’s purity?! Dares to meddle in this political struggle? Dares to attempt to claim the Grand Marshal’s seal?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This is simply outrageous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Who gave you such confidence?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">In the tense atmosphere, Sun Gan suddenly raised his head and let out a hearty laugh: “General Liu Er has keen insight. I understand now. To be frank, General Mu Lan has admired me since childhood, wanting to marry me to ensure I would join the Grand Marshal’s mansion and restore its glory.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Shuang Jing was not to be outdone: “You speak only of recent events. In fact, I have long exchanged letters with Mu Lan. Initially, she sought my advice on cultivation matters. Gradually, we exchanged our deepest feelings. The closeness of our relationship is difficult for the outside world to comprehend.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Now that Mu Lan is unconscious, I, as the one dearest to her heart and half a member of the Grand Marshal’s mansion, should take charge of the Red Flower Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Ma Liangcai, you came by the monarch’s order. I won’t make it hard for you; just obediently serve as a staff officer.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">As the situation evolved to this point, only now did the Red Flower Camp’s soldiers and Zhang Zhongyi realize what was happening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ma Liangcai held the monarch’s order to take over the Red Flower Camp, which gave him the advantage in principle. The monarch’s reasons stated in the decree—winning the war, serving the greater good —were perfectly just.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Anyone who defied this order would be on weak ground and punished severely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In the righteous path, one must follow the rules.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">But if Liu Er, Sun Gan, Shuang Jing, and the others had private relationships with Mu Lan, making them effectively half-members of the Grand Marshal’s mansion…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">According to the order —family first, then country, then the world —Ma Liangcai would rank behind those three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The Red Flower Camp’s soldiers understood this and began to believe that these three generals wanted to help them, forced to fabricate secret relationships with Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">They now viewed the three generals without hostility, unaware that these three each had their own designs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">They indeed intended to gain control of the Grand Marshal’s mansion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">While Ning Zhuo surveyed the entire scene, he thought: “The Two Note monarch gave the order to take over the Red Flower Camp so ‘promptly.’ Mu Lan was only recently ambushed and fell into a coma, and Ma Liangcai immediately came.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“In that case, it is not Shuang Jing and Sun Gan who acted against Mu Lan, but the upper echelons of Two Note Kingdom.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“What is the Two Note monarch’s true intention? Is he the leader of this plot, or just a collaborator?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo pondered secretly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He tried to see it from the Two Note monarch’s perspective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Taking over the Red Flower Camp and abolishing the Grand Marshal’s mansion would serve the monarch’s interests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The monarch had strong motives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo observed Sun Gan and Shuang Jing again: “They must have gotten wind of this, known some inside information, and acted early to pressure Mu Lan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“They wanted to snatch the Red Flower Camp and the Grand Marshal’s mansion before the monarch made his move.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“That’s why, when Ma Liangcai came, they stepped forward to block him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">While Ning Zhuo calculated the situation, Sun Gan and Shuang Jing secretly felt relieved and looked at Liu Er with newfound respect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">They were fortunate that Liu Er reacted quickly and thought of this idea!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Liu Er, in turn, looked at Ning Zhuo, praising him in his heart: “Having a strategist by my side is truly wonderful. I have gained so much! Now that Mu Lan is unconscious, we three can claim whatever connections, standing in front of Ma Liangcai.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“The brilliance lies in that if Ma Liangcai wants to expose us, he must awaken Mu Lan, forcing her to personally deny the secret relationships.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“However, once Mu Lan awakens, it will be extremely difficult for Ma Liangcai to take over the Red Flower Camp. He would remain only a staff officer, with Mu Lan above him, leaving him not a shred of real power!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">As for why the Two Note monarch did not simply appoint Ma Liangcai as the main general of the Red Flower Camp in the decree?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Obviously, that would violate righteous customs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">If the Two Note monarch did so, it would certainly raise alarm among many families and cause severe disappointment, triggering countless pleas and remonstrations from old retainers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">And if he truly did that, he certainly would not succeed. One could confirm this by the Red Flower Camp’s reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The scene was at a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ma Liangcai stared fixedly at Liu Er. Faced with this human-demon hybrid of Golden Core level, his hatred soared by several times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Liu Er, seeing how far things had gone, simply met Ma Liangcai’s gaze without fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Shuang Jing and Sun Gan, seeing this, esteemed Liu Er more highly, feeling that this hybrid indeed had the courage of a bold warrior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">They both stared at Ma Liangcai, secretly exerting pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Neither side backed down, and just when a deadlock was about to form, the tent’s curtain was suddenly lifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Mu Lan stepped out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Both sides stared again. This time, even Ning Zhuo’s expression changed, feeling intense surprise. In an instant, he understood: “So Mu Lan was pretending to be unconscious!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Mu Lan smiled slightly at the crowd, whose expressions had drastically changed: “Everyone, please enter the tent to talk.”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
