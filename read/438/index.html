<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 438: Unworthy!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"There's a gap! There are gaps in these vines!"<br/>
<br/>
"Charge quickly!"<br/>
<br/>
"This is our last chance at survival. If we don't charge together, we'll stay here and wait for death!!"<br/>
<br/>
They unleashed all their magical artifacts and talismans without hesitation. If they didn't fight desperately now, what use would these items be? Save them for the enemy to collect as spoils when they cleaed the battlefield?<br/>
<br/>
Bi Tengyi intentionally left an opening. The cultivators of the Barbarian Demon Camp rushed out of the vine hell, gaining new life, and were overjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
"Where do you think you're going?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha, all of you, die!"<br/>
<br/>
Several Golden Core cultivators from Thousand Peaks Forest pursued them at this moment. There were humans, barbarians, and even demon cultivators among them.<br/>
<br/>
The two leading them were Golden Core barbarians accompanying the High Priest of Poisonous Abdomen.<br/>
<br/>
One was named Diao Ye, and the other was called Wulan.<br/>
<br/>
Diao Ye's skin was dark red, his face like an evil ghost. From time to time, he would make a targeted cultivator explode. In an instant, countless corrosive poisons splattered, eroding those around and eliciting a series of painful cries.<br/>
<br/>
Wulan wielded a poisonous spear, blowing out streams of colorful poisonous smoke, continuously killing the soldiers of the Barbarian Demon Camp.<br/>
<br/>
"Run, run faster! Hahaha." He let out mocking and cruel laughter.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of cultivators from the Barbarian Demon Camp fled in panic, devoid of fighting spirit, being chased all the way by several Golden Core cultivators toward the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the command tent, the atmosphere was heavy and tense.<br/>
<br/>
From time to time, messengers reported on the surrounding enemy situation.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing, born into a noble family, had very little battlefield experience.<br/>
<br/>
He was a Qi Refiner, not a body cultivator, and had mastered even fewer military tactics. This time, he could serve as the commander of a camp mainly due to his family's operations.<br/>
<br/>
He himself also wanted to build up his resume, improve his official position, and facilitate his use of national power to aid his own cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
When the Barbarian Demon Camp was attacked, Shuang Jing's side first received a request for aid from Xu Dali.<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general then advised: "Lord Shuang Jing, this is the rear of our main army. If the enemy can ambush here, their scale must not be large; it's likely a small team of Golden Core or Nascent Soul cultivators."<br/>
<br/>
"The Barbarian Demon Camp is under attack, but we don't see a large number of cultivators, only wolf packs, further supporting this guess."<br/>
<br/>
"We can immediately assemble the army and go to support them. Even if we cannot harm powerful individual enemies, we can gain merit by rescuing our allies."<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing then asked, "If the enemy is too strong, wouldn't we be going to our deaths?"<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general replied, "My lord, this is the rear of our main army. The enemy must not be an army; their numbers are few, and without the support of national power, even if they are Nascent Soul Cultivators, they are mere stragglers and cannot last long."<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general lowered his voice and spoke more quickly: "Using a group of Foundation Establishment or even Golden Core cultivators to cause a Nascent Soul-level cultivator to suffer suppression from our nation's power, reducing their combat strength, is a huge gain! It will certainly benefit our country's overall plan to conquer Thousand Peaks Forest."<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing understood: "So, there is still great risk. If the enemy's Nascent Soul cultivator disregards the backlash from our nation's power and forcibly attacks, our army still faces the danger of being overturned."<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general was momentarily stunned: "My lord, if that's the case, staying here won't make much difference; we would still be attacked by the Nascent Soul Cultivator. Moreover, you are a Nascent Soul cultivator yourself. If things go awry, it would be hard for anyone to stop you from retreating."<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing nodded, then shook his head.<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general was not wrong. Shuang Jing had chosen to participate in the battle and lead an army with full preparation.<br/>
<br/>
He had prepared at least five escape methods.<br/>
<br/>
"But I need the army to remain intact. To organize and maintain this army, my family and I have invested too much."<br/>
<br/>
"If it is easily lost, how can I establish great merit in the future, seize spoils of war, and have autonomy?"<br/>
<br/>
If the army is defeated and reorganized, it will be incorporated into other armies.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing and the family forces behind him intended to seek not just small achievements, but something bigger and more significant!<br/>
<br/>
Thus, Shuang Jing ordered the army to immediately station and prepare in place, forming a battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
On the Thousand Peaks Forest side, they also arranged three Golden Core cultivators to pin them down here.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, no matter how these three Golden Core cultivators cast spells to attack from afar, they were all neutralized by the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The three Golden Core cultivators did not dare to show themselves and could only helplessly watch as the White Jade Camp formed a battle formation —the Jade Wall Heavenly Barrier Formation!<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers of the Barbarian Demon Camp were chased and killed all the way, wailing and howling as they ran into the sight of the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Behind them, several Golden Core cultivators were either riding clouds or mounts, flaunting their power, fierce and arrogant.<br/>
<br/>
"Allied forces! It's the White Jade Camp!"<br/>
<br/>
"We're saved, we're saved!"<br/>
<br/>
"Quick, save us!"<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators of the Barbarian Demon Camp were overjoyed and cried for help.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, the Golden Core cultivators of Thousand Peaks Forest once again slowed down their attacks, focusing more on intimidation and actively reducing the killing.<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general became anxious: "This is not good, Lord Shuang Jing; this is the enemy's poisonous scheme!"<br/>
<br/>
"If we proceed to rescue and let these people in, it will inevitably disturb the battle formation, creating countless flaws, making it easy for the enemy to exploit."<br/>
<br/>
"If we don't rescue them and allow our allies to be brutally killed by the enemy, morale will inevitably drop, and even the army's heart will waver! This will still affect our military strength!!"<br/>
<br/>
"It's not good to save them, but also not good not to save them."<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing remained expressionless and snorted coldly.<br/>
<br/>
He took out the command seal, infused it with Qi, and activated the military tactics within the command seal to condense the army's morale one by one!<br/>
<br/>
Because the White Jade Camp had already formed a formation and was on full alert, it was easy to succeed in rallying the troops. Everyone's attention was focused on the command seal in Shuang Jing's hand.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing held the command seal in one hand and cast spells with the other, letting his voice spread throughout the army.<br/>
<br/>
"When I was born, my family bathed me with heavenly dew and wrapped me in colorful silk. Since I was young, I have been worry-free, admired by all, a man above men!"<br/>
<br/>
"Gentlemen, in the capital, we enjoy delicacies served on jade plates, wear jewelry of gold and silver, and live in grand mansions with numerous wives and concubines."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, we joined the war for the glory of our noble families. Our families are waiting for our triumphant return. We will achieve victory after victory, gain one merit after another, and then return to the capital with our heads held high to enjoy more glory and a better life!"<br/>
<br/>
"Now, the enemy wants us to fall into their trap!"<br/>
<br/>
"They are driving our allies, trying to force us to lend a hand and create flaws among us."<br/>
<br/>
"But what are these things before us? A group of barbarians and demon cultivators —hmph, they are just cannon fodder attracted by military pay. They clearly know this is the enemy's conspiracy and still want us to rescue them, cooperating with the enemy to disrupt our battle formation!"<br/>
<br/>
"Do such allies deserve us to take action to save them?"<br/>
<br/>
The whole army responded: "Unworthy! Unworthy!"<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing laughed heartily: "The Barbarian Demon Camp is just a cannon fodder camp. As cannon fodder, they must have the awareness of cannon fodder!"<br/>
<br/>
"Let them use their lives to consume the enemy's spirit energy."<br/>
<br/>
"As long as we remain unmoved, the enemy is so few; what can they do to us?"</div>
