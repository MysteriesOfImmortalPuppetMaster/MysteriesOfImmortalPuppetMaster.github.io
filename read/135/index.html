<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity, swiftly retreating to create distance from the One-Horned Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"A Ghost General at the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, that ghost-headed broadsword is no ordinary weapon!" Ning Zhuo's face showed a grave expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He glanced at the silver shield Magical Treasure on his left arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">With just one strike, a crack had appeared on the treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The One-Horned Ghost General vanished from its original position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo's heart pounded with fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He frantically urged his Blue Iron Armor, but couldn't detect any trace of the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">At the critical moment, Sun Lingtong warned, "Jump backward!" Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo leaped back with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In the next instant, a ghostly figure flashed and quickly solidified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Ghost General, wielding a battle axe, struck empty air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">A second Ghost General!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo's heart sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Jump again, to the southeast!" Sun Lingtong shouted once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">His spirit eyes shone brightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo successfully dodged again, discovering a Ghost General wielding a spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Three Ghost Generals, all at the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, their elusive attacks forced Ning Zhuo into a desperate retreat, leaving him no chance to counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong lay on Chui Xu Ke's shoulder, fully utilizing his innate talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">If not for his ability to barely perceive the nearby Ghost Generals, Ning Zhuo's situation would have been even worse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Little Zhuo, Cheng Bai's fighting style is very similar to yours. You control Mechanical Constructs, while he commands Ghost Generals," Sun Lingtong urgently transmitted his voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Don't get entangled with these Ghost Generals. Since you can't escape, go straight for the heart, strike him directly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sun Lingtong, being a disciple of the Void Sect, was decisive in killing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">At this critical juncture, he no longer advised Ning Zhuo to flee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Facing the enemy together was the best strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo patted his storage belt, releasing hundreds of Mechanical Constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Though they were common goods, their sheer number far exceeded the usual standard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Even Cheng Bai, at the Golden Core Stage, showed a grim expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Chui Xu Ke is only at the Foundation Establishment stage, yet he can control so many Mechanical Beasts simultaneously?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He didn't know that Ning Zhuo was truly only at the mid-stage of Qi Refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The ability to control these Mechanical Constructs was superficially due to the staves on them, but the real key was my Buddha Heart Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">These constructs had all been imprinted with heart seals, making the burden on Ning Zhuo minimal and their responsiveness extremely high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Mechanical Constructs surged forward, charging at Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Cheng Bai raised his hands, summoning a large gust of ghostly wind, blowing away thirty percent of the constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He shouted, releasing an umbrella-shaped Magical Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The treasure flew high into the sky, opening up and casting a large shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The constructs covered by the shadow seemed to be trapped in a quagmire, their movements slowing to a crawl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This move neutralized another fifty percent of the constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Only twenty percent of the constructs remained, charging towards him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Cheng Bai had no choice but to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">This retreat immediately alerted Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo simultaneously exclaimed, "Gloomy Ghost Realm!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This spell, once cast, could create a unique battlefield where ghostly spirits would see their combat power soar, appearing and disappearing unpredictably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo frowned deeply, "When ordinary people cast this spell, ghostly qi pervades, and the heavens and earth change color. But when Cheng Bai uses it, it is extremely restrained, almost undetectable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lingtong added, "He possesses the Innate Talent Nether Death Eye, which gives him a natural affinity and extraordinary comprehension of ghostly techniques and the Dao. It's quite normal for him to reach a level with this spell that ordinary people find hard to achieve."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The spellâ€”Ghost Flame Scorching World!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">As Cheng Bai retreated, he simultaneously cast the spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The ghastly green Ghost Fire burned silently, causing the last two Mechanical Constructs to cease their actions, quickly severing their connection with Ning Zhuo, and then disintegrating on their own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Too powerful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Cheng Bai's strength was undoubtedly top-tier among Golden Core Stage cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo and the others found it extremely difficult to deal with even the weakest Golden Core Stage cultivators, let alone face Cheng Bai directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong immediately fell into a bitter struggle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Cheng Bai's Gloomy Ghost Realm spell was cast again, silently and without any visible signs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">With the spell's enhancement, the three ghost generals at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage once again became silent and invisible, relying solely on Sun Lingtong to warn them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Seeing the unfavorable situation, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong wanted to escape this battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">But at every critical moment, Cheng Bai would intervene, personally casting spells to block Ning and Sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">To maintain the situation, Ning Zhuo continuously utilized Mechanical Constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Mechanical Constructs he had painstakingly accumulated over more than ten years were being consumed rapidly, only allowing him to barely survive on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">A Fire Melting Demon Ape had just appeared and broke through the third line of defense of the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Golden Core Stage combat power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Demon Ape led the charge, destroying every Mechanical War Puppet in its path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Under the terrifying strength of the Demon Ape, the Mechanical War Puppets, regardless of the materials used, were like paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Immortal Palace trembled as the Demon Ape smashed through the walls, officially breaking into a side hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared angrily, quickly dispatching Mechanical War Puppets into the side hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Thereâ€™s a turning point!" The Ning Family Patriarch also received the message, instructing him to assist in the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Ning Family Patriarch hesitated for a moment before choosing to refuse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He continued to stay on the front line, resisting the onslaught of the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Demon Ape rampaged through the side hall, causing Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji to frown deeply, both thinking: Has the Lava Immortal Palace become so weak?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In the next moment, a unique Mechanical Puppet gracefully descended onto the scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">It exuded the aura of the Golden Core Stage, performing the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">With a wave of its feather fan, the five qi phases of creation and destruction manifested, various spells striking the demonic ape, causing it to howl in pain repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Meng Kui's eyes were filled with astonishment as he carefully observed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Dao Master!" Zhu Xuanji whispered in his heart, revealing the name of the Golden Core Stage mechanical construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">According to the royal family's intelligence, the Lava Immortal Palace had three major mechanical war generals: the Demon General, the Dao Master, and the Buddha Healer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">As soon as the Dao Master entered the fray, it immediately suppressed the Fire Melting Demon Ape's offensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The Dao Master mechanical puppet, taking advantage of the terrain, quickly drove the Fire Melting Demon Ape out of the side hall, forcing it to retreat step by step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Opportunity!" Seizing this delicate situation, the Ning Family Patriarch abandoned the front line and turned towards the side hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He had just received permission from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Now, with flames still burning in the side hall, even if he went to extinguish the fire, it would count as a contribution to the battlefield, and he wouldn't be deemed a deserter by the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Though the contribution for extinguishing the fire was minimal, the Ning Family Patriarch valued the opportunity to explore the side hall more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Meng Kui took in the entire scene, sighed lightly, and threw out a Peach Fate Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The peach core instantly disappeared, descending from the sky, aiming straight for the Ning Family Patriarch's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">A verdant spring thunder burst forth, piercing through layers of clouds and smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Ning Family Patriarch tried his best to resist, but all his defenses were shattered by the spring thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The peach core, unstoppable, broke through multiple layers of protective measures, striking the Ning Family Patriarch's skull directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">With a cry of pain, a pit was left in his skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The power of thunder coursed through his body, nearly paralyzing him entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He hurriedly cast spells with all his might, freezing his five organs and six bowels to protect his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Without looking back, he dashed out of the Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Chui Xu Ke's Hanging Death Whip!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo's long whip danced wildly, dispersing the approaching ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">However, he was surrounded, with countless malevolent spirits closing in on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Cheng Bai's methods were endless, and the ghosts under his command seemed inexhaustible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Since the battle began, he had only retreated once voluntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">For the rest of the time, he firmly held the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong were in a perilous situation, their lives hanging by a thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">In desperation, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to reveal one of his trump cards prematurely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Explosions erupted in multiple places within and outside the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Cheng Bai sneered, "What are you blowing up? I'm right here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo replied, "I'm blowing up the Immortal City Grand Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Cheng Bai's expression changed drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">In the next moment, a massive array of patterns emerged, crisscrossing and covering the entire battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The might of the Immortal Formation was vast and grand, unstoppable and unmatched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Everyone and everything on the battlefield were uniformly targeted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo's Mechanical Constructs had only a few left, and their loss didn't bother him at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">However, Cheng Bai's Ghost Soul Army, which was numerous and formidable, was completely wiped out in an instant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Even Cheng Bai himself was firmly bound in mid-air, suffering the grinding force of the Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning and Sun did not seize the opportunity to attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Because they were also enveloped by the formation patterns, but due to their status as city residents, they merely lost their freedom and couldn't move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Cheng Bai was furious!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">These Ghost Soul Army were the fruits of his years of accumulation, now vanished into thin air, utterly annihilated, causing him immense heartache.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">What pained him even more was his three Ghost Generals, each meticulously nurtured by him, possessing the combat power of the peak Foundation Establishment stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">All gone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The terrifying might of the Immortal City Grand Formation, when fully activated, could protect the entire Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">And this was one of the strongest nodes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Therefore, the three Foundation Establishment level Ghost Generals had no power to resist and were crushed, leaving only three soul fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Break for me!" Cheng Bai roared, his face twisted in rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">He had to resist with all his might, or he would be ground into dust by the Magic Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Spellâ€”Nether Fire Inferno!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Spellâ€”Ghostly Scarlet Forest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Spellâ€”Nether Ghost Weep!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The Ghost Fire turned from a ghastly green to a yellow-green, burning fiercely, with flames reaching six zhang high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ghostly shadows rose, resembling giants, with hands supporting the sky, attempting to break the binding formation patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The piercing sound of ghostly wails seemed to tear through eardrums, drilling into hearts, and reverberating across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Cheng Bai cast three spells in succession, simultaneously activating his Innate Talent Nether Death Eye, causing the power of the three spells to surge several times over!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">For a moment, the formation patterns wavered and rapidly dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The bindings on Ning Zhuo's body quickly loosened, gradually freeing him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"So strong!" Sun Lingtong clicked his tongue, his face full of shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">This was the Immortal City Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Cheng Bai, relying on his own strength, could actually shake it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">This was Cheng Bai's full-force attack; in previous battles, he had never been truly forced to use his full strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The disparity in combat power was too great.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo was not shaken in the slightest; this disparity in combat power was one of the scenarios he had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">He looked up at the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain, his eyes filled with anticipation, and murmured softly, "Come, come, hurry up and come!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Mountain peak, clouds in the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Meng Kui slightly turned his head, furrowing his brows as he gazed at Cheng Bai's battlefield from afar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Meanwhile, countless disputes erupted simultaneously throughout the Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Many battles were sparked by mere misunderstandings or minor frictions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Sitting Mountain Observation Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Fate energy is boiling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"This battle has reached its climax and is nearing its end," Shuang Gui spoke with a sense of understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">In his pupils, Cheng Bai's imposing stance was reflected clearly: "Attempting to shake the Immortal City Grand Formation, even if you are a true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect, you shouldn't be so reckless." "Go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Meng Kui threw another peach pit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The peach pit descended from the sky, bringing with it a spring thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The spring thunder exploded, striking Cheng Bai directly, causing his eyes to roll back and his head to bleed profusely!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"Ah!" He screamed loudly, unable to maintain his spell, and suffered a backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">The fiercer his spell, the stronger the backlash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">In an instant, Cheng Bai was severely injured!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"This is the moment!" Ning Zhuo, who had been meticulously planning and calculating the opportunity, finally saw his chance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">He didn't use explosives just to blow up the Immortal City Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">He triggered the Grand Formation more to provoke Meng Kui into action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">"Every time I want to take action, to investigate Sun Laoda's situation or to rescue him, it triggers my Buddha Heart Demon Seal's warning." "This is extraordinary!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">"The most likely scenario is that Meng Kui is using his divine ability, Sitting Mountain Observation Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Ning Zhuo's intelligence network was far inferior to Zhu Xuanji's, but he still had some understanding of Meng Kui's supreme techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">"When Meng Kui uses the Sitting Mountain Observation Technique, during its duration, he can only use those peach pits as an external attack." "This is a Nascent Soul level offensive method. Cheng Bai, at his strongest, is only at the Golden Core Stage!" Meng Kui's actions, Ning Zhuo's scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">"Meng Kui, you sit high above, on the mountain peak." "But when a powerful figure tries to destroy the Immortal City Grand Formation, will you intervene?" "If you can handle Cheng Bai, I bet you'll at least throw a peach pit!" To save Sun Laoda, Ning Zhuo, knowing the strange fate energy, still chose to step in personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">But he never considered himself just a pawn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Even a Nascent Soul cultivator might not be impossible to use for his own ends!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
