<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity, swiftly retreating to create distance from the One-Horned Ghost General.<br/>
<br/>
"A Ghost General at the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, that ghost-headed broadsword is no ordinary weapon!" Ning Zhuo's face showed a grave expression.<br/>
<br/>
He glanced at the silver shield Magical Treasure on his left arm.<br/>
<br/>
With just one strike, a crack had appeared on the treasure.<br/>
<br/>
The One-Horned Ghost General vanished from its original position.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's heart pounded with fear.<br/>
<br/>
He frantically urged his Blue Iron Armor, but couldn't detect any trace of the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
At the critical moment, Sun Lingtong warned, "Jump backward!" Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo leaped back with all his might.<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, a ghostly figure flashed and quickly solidified.<br/>
<br/>
The Ghost General, wielding a battle axe, struck empty air.<br/>
<br/>
A second Ghost General!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's heart sank.<br/>
<br/>
"Jump again, to the southeast!" Sun Lingtong shouted once more.<br/>
<br/>
His spirit eyes shone brightly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo successfully dodged again, discovering a Ghost General wielding a spear.<br/>
<br/>
Three Ghost Generals, all at the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, their elusive attacks forced Ning Zhuo into a desperate retreat, leaving him no chance to counterattack.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong lay on Chui Xu Ke's shoulder, fully utilizing his innate talent.<br/>
<br/>
If not for his ability to barely perceive the nearby Ghost Generals, Ning Zhuo's situation would have been even worse.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, Cheng Bai's fighting style is very similar to yours. You control Mechanical Constructs, while he commands Ghost Generals," Sun Lingtong urgently transmitted his voice.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't get entangled with these Ghost Generals. Since you can't escape, go straight for the heart, strike him directly!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, being a disciple of the Void Sect, was decisive in killing.<br/>
<br/>
At this critical juncture, he no longer advised Ning Zhuo to flee.<br/>
<br/>
Facing the enemy together was the best strategy.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo patted his storage belt, releasing hundreds of Mechanical Constructs.<br/>
<br/>
Though they were common goods, their sheer number far exceeded the usual standard.<br/>
<br/>
Even Cheng Bai, at the Golden Core Stage, showed a grim expression.<br/>
<br/>
"Chui Xu Ke is only at the Foundation Establishment stage, yet he can control so many Mechanical Beasts simultaneously?!"<br/>
<br/>
He didn't know that Ning Zhuo was truly only at the mid-stage of Qi Refining.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to control these Mechanical Constructs was superficially due to the staves on them, but the real key was my Buddha Heart Demon Seal!<br/>
<br/>
These constructs had all been imprinted with heart seals, making the burden on Ning Zhuo minimal and their responsiveness extremely high.<br/>
<br/>
The Mechanical Constructs surged forward, charging at Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai raised his hands, summoning a large gust of ghostly wind, blowing away thirty percent of the constructs.<br/>
<br/>
He shouted, releasing an umbrella-shaped Magical Treasure.<br/>
<br/>
The treasure flew high into the sky, opening up and casting a large shadow.<br/>
<br/>
The constructs covered by the shadow seemed to be trapped in a quagmire, their movements slowing to a crawl.<br/>
<br/>
This move neutralized another fifty percent of the constructs.<br/>
<br/>
Only twenty percent of the constructs remained, charging towards him.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai had no choice but to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
This retreat immediately alerted Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo simultaneously exclaimed, "Gloomy Ghost Realm!"<br/>
<br/>
This spell, once cast, could create a unique battlefield where ghostly spirits would see their combat power soar, appearing and disappearing unpredictably.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned deeply, "When ordinary people cast this spell, ghostly qi pervades, and the heavens and earth change color. But when Cheng Bai uses it, it is extremely restrained, almost undetectable."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong added, "He possesses the Innate Talent Nether Death Eye, which gives him a natural affinity and extraordinary comprehension of ghostly techniques and the Dao. It's quite normal for him to reach a level with this spell that ordinary people find hard to achieve."<br/>
<br/>
The spell—Ghost Flame Scorching World!<br/>
<br/>
As Cheng Bai retreated, he simultaneously cast the spell.<br/>
<br/>
The ghastly green Ghost Fire burned silently, causing the last two Mechanical Constructs to cease their actions, quickly severing their connection with Ning Zhuo, and then disintegrating on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Too powerful!<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's strength was undoubtedly top-tier among Golden Core Stage cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and the others found it extremely difficult to deal with even the weakest Golden Core Stage cultivators, let alone face Cheng Bai directly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong immediately fell into a bitter struggle.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's Gloomy Ghost Realm spell was cast again, silently and without any visible signs.<br/>
<br/>
With the spell's enhancement, the three ghost generals at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage once again became silent and invisible, relying solely on Sun Lingtong to warn them.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the unfavorable situation, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong wanted to escape this battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
But at every critical moment, Cheng Bai would intervene, personally casting spells to block Ning and Sun.<br/>
<br/>
To maintain the situation, Ning Zhuo continuously utilized Mechanical Constructs.<br/>
<br/>
The Mechanical Constructs he had painstakingly accumulated over more than ten years were being consumed rapidly, only allowing him to barely survive on the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
A Fire Melting Demon Ape had just appeared and broke through the third line of defense of the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Golden Core Stage combat power!<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
The Demon Ape led the charge, destroying every Mechanical War Puppet in its path.<br/>
<br/>
Under the terrifying strength of the Demon Ape, the Mechanical War Puppets, regardless of the materials used, were like paper.<br/>
<br/>
The Immortal Palace trembled as the Demon Ape smashed through the walls, officially breaking into a side hall.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared angrily, quickly dispatching Mechanical War Puppets into the side hall.<br/>
<br/>
"There’s a turning point!" The Ning Family Patriarch also received the message, instructing him to assist in the battle.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning Family Patriarch hesitated for a moment before choosing to refuse.<br/>
<br/>
He continued to stay on the front line, resisting the onslaught of the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.<br/>
<br/>
The Demon Ape rampaged through the side hall, causing Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji to frown deeply, both thinking: Has the Lava Immortal Palace become so weak?<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, a unique Mechanical Puppet gracefully descended onto the scene.<br/>
<br/>
It exuded the aura of the Golden Core Stage, performing the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
With a wave of its feather fan, the five qi phases of creation and destruction manifested, various spells striking the demonic ape, causing it to howl in pain repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui's eyes were filled with astonishment as he carefully observed.<br/>
<br/>
"Dao Master!" Zhu Xuanji whispered in his heart, revealing the name of the Golden Core Stage mechanical construct.<br/>
<br/>
According to the royal family's intelligence, the Lava Immortal Palace had three major mechanical war generals: the Demon General, the Dao Master, and the Buddha Healer.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the Dao Master entered the fray, it immediately suppressed the Fire Melting Demon Ape's offensive.<br/>
<br/>
The Dao Master mechanical puppet, taking advantage of the terrain, quickly drove the Fire Melting Demon Ape out of the side hall, forcing it to retreat step by step.<br/>
<br/>
"Opportunity!" Seizing this delicate situation, the Ning Family Patriarch abandoned the front line and turned towards the side hall.<br/>
<br/>
He had just received permission from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Now, with flames still burning in the side hall, even if he went to extinguish the fire, it would count as a contribution to the battlefield, and he wouldn't be deemed a deserter by the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Though the contribution for extinguishing the fire was minimal, the Ning Family Patriarch valued the opportunity to explore the side hall more.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui took in the entire scene, sighed lightly, and threw out a Peach Fate Core.<br/>
<br/>
The peach core instantly disappeared, descending from the sky, aiming straight for the Ning Family Patriarch's head.<br/>
<br/>
A verdant spring thunder burst forth, piercing through layers of clouds and smoke.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning Family Patriarch tried his best to resist, but all his defenses were shattered by the spring thunder.<br/>
<br/>
The peach core, unstoppable, broke through multiple layers of protective measures, striking the Ning Family Patriarch's skull directly.<br/>
<br/>
With a cry of pain, a pit was left in his skull.<br/>
<br/>
The power of thunder coursed through his body, nearly paralyzing him entirely.<br/>
<br/>
He hurriedly cast spells with all his might, freezing his five viscera and six bowels to protect his life.<br/>
<br/>
Without looking back, he dashed out of the Immortal Palace!<br/>
<br/>
Chui Xu Ke's Hanging Death Whip!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's long whip danced wildly, dispersing the approaching ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
However, he was surrounded, with countless malevolent spirits closing in on him.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's methods were endless, and the ghosts under his command seemed inexhaustible.<br/>
<br/>
Since the battle began, he had only retreated once voluntarily.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of the time, he firmly held the upper hand.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong were in a perilous situation, their lives hanging by a thread.<br/>
<br/>
In desperation, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to reveal one of his trump cards prematurely.<br/>
<br/>
Boom! Boom! Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Explosions erupted in multiple places within and outside the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai sneered, "What are you blowing up? I'm right here."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo replied, "I'm blowing up the Immortal City Grand Formation."<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's expression changed drastically.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, a massive array of patterns emerged, crisscrossing and covering the entire battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The might of the Immortal Formation was vast and grand, unstoppable and unmatched.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone and everything on the battlefield were uniformly targeted!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's Mechanical Constructs had only a few left, and their loss didn't bother him at all.<br/>
<br/>
However, Cheng Bai's Ghost Soul Army, which was numerous and formidable, was completely wiped out in an instant!<br/>
<br/>
Even Cheng Bai himself was firmly bound in mid-air, suffering the grinding force of the Grand Formation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning and Sun did not seize the opportunity to attack.<br/>
<br/>
Because they were also enveloped by the formation patterns, but due to their status as city residents, they merely lost their freedom and couldn't move.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai was furious!<br/>
<br/>
These Ghost Soul Army were the fruits of his years of accumulation, now vanished into thin air, utterly annihilated, causing him immense heartache.<br/>
<br/>
What pained him even more was his three Ghost Generals, each meticulously nurtured by him, possessing the combat power of the peak Foundation Establishment stage!<br/>
<br/>
All gone!<br/>
<br/>
The terrifying might of the Immortal City Grand Formation, when fully activated, could protect the entire Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
And this was one of the strongest nodes.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the three Foundation Establishment level Ghost Generals had no power to resist and were crushed, leaving only three soul fragments.<br/>
<br/>
"Break for me!" Cheng Bai roared, his face twisted in rage.<br/>
<br/>
He had to resist with all his might, or he would be ground into dust by the Magic Formation.<br/>
<br/>
Spell—Nether Fire Inferno!<br/>
<br/>
Spell—Ghostly Scarlet Forest!<br/>
<br/>
Spell—Nether Ghost Weep!<br/>
<br/>
The Ghost Fire turned from a ghastly green to a yellow-green, burning fiercely, with flames reaching six zhang high.<br/>
<br/>
Ghostly shadows rose, resembling giants, with hands supporting the sky, attempting to break the binding formation patterns.<br/>
<br/>
The piercing sound of ghostly wails seemed to tear through eardrums, drilling into hearts, and reverberating across the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai cast three spells in succession, simultaneously activating his Innate Talent Nether Death Eye, causing the power of the three spells to surge several times over!<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the formation patterns wavered and rapidly dissipated.<br/>
<br/>
The bindings on Ning Zhuo's body quickly loosened, gradually freeing him.<br/>
<br/>
"So strong!" Sun Lingtong clicked his tongue, his face full of shock.<br/>
<br/>
This was the Immortal City Grand Formation.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai, relying on his own strength, could actually shake it!<br/>
<br/>
This was Cheng Bai's full-force attack; in previous battles, he had never been truly forced to use his full strength.<br/>
<br/>
The disparity in combat power was too great.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was not shaken in the slightest; this disparity in combat power was one of the scenarios he had anticipated.<br/>
<br/>
He looked up at the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain, his eyes filled with anticipation, and murmured softly, "Come, come, hurry up and come!"<br/>
<br/>
Mountain peak, clouds in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui slightly turned his head, furrowing his brows as he gazed at Cheng Bai's battlefield from afar.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, countless disputes erupted simultaneously throughout the Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Many battles were sparked by mere misunderstandings or minor frictions.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting Mountain Observation Technique!<br/>
<br/>
"Fate energy is boiling."<br/>
<br/>
"This battle has reached its climax and is nearing its end," Shuang Gui spoke with a sense of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
In his pupils, Cheng Bai's imposing stance was reflected clearly: "Attempting to shake the Immortal City Grand Formation, even if you are a true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect, you shouldn't be so reckless." "Go."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui threw another peach pit.<br/>
<br/>
The peach pit descended from the sky, bringing with it a spring thunder.<br/>
<br/>
The spring thunder exploded, striking Cheng Bai directly, causing his eyes to roll back and his head to bleed profusely!<br/>
<br/>
"Ah!" He screamed loudly, unable to maintain his spell, and suffered a backlash.<br/>
<br/>
The fiercer his spell, the stronger the backlash!<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Cheng Bai was severely injured!!<br/>
<br/>
"This is the moment!" Ning Zhuo, who had been meticulously planning and calculating the opportunity, finally saw his chance.<br/>
<br/>
He didn't use explosives just to blow up the Immortal City Grand Formation.<br/>
<br/>
He triggered the Grand Formation more to provoke Meng Kui into action.<br/>
<br/>
"Every time I want to take action, to investigate Sun Laoda's situation or to rescue him, it triggers my Buddha Heart Demon Seal's warning." "This is extraordinary!"<br/>
<br/>
"The most likely scenario is that Meng Kui is using his divine ability, Sitting Mountain Observation Technique."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's intelligence network was far inferior to Zhu Xuanji's, but he still had some understanding of Meng Kui's supreme techniques.<br/>
<br/>
"When Meng Kui uses the Sitting Mountain Observation Technique, during its duration, he can only use those peach pits as an external attack." "This is a Nascent Soul level offensive method. Cheng Bai, at his strongest, is only at the Golden Core Stage!" Meng Kui's actions, Ning Zhuo's scheme.<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Kui, you sit high above, on the mountain peak." "But when a powerful figure tries to destroy the Immortal City Grand Formation, will you intervene?" "If you can handle Cheng Bai, I bet you'll at least throw a peach pit!" To save Sun Laoda, Ning Zhuo, knowing the strange fate energy, still chose to step in personally.<br/>
<br/>
But he never considered himself just a pawn.<br/>
<br/>
Even a Nascent Soul cultivator might not be impossible to use for his own ends!</div>
