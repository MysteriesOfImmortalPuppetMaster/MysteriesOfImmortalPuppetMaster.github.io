<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 383: Mouth to Mouth Impression</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">This method of cultivation is of great significance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Take Hua Guzi for example. If she wanted to establish a family and expand her lineage in the future, these cultivation methods will be an important part of her family business!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"The old ancestor should arrive in the coming days."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"At that time, I will extract the relevant content about the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum and let him take it back for the family to use."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo made arrangements in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">While waiting for the old ancestor Ning Jiufan, he continued his own cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">By now, he had experienced important battles with Han Zhou, Chang Yan, and Hua Guzi, firmly establishing his foothold on Little Contention Peak and gaining recognition from the wider community of cultivators. Additionally, with Lin Shanshan and her senior brothers no longer plotting against him, Ning Zhuo's days became very peaceful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Every day, he would go to the arena to spar with Han Zhou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Oh, and Hua Guzi too.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This half-demon, half-human female cultivator, on the second day after giving her gift, once again blocked Ning Zhuo's path to publicly give him presents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo had no choice. Just as he felt he couldn't make significant improvements from Han Zhou anymore, he invited Hua Guzi to participate in the daily sparring activities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Hua Guzi was overjoyed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">That night when she went to bed, she couldn't sleep. She tightly hugged her pillow, her face full of infatuation and fantasies, tossing and turning, indulging in her thoughts all night long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Although she was weak in close combat, she was strong in magical battles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">When sparring, Ning Zhuo mainly engaged in magical battles with her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In wood-based magic, Ning Zhuo was still overwhelmed by Hua Guzi. But unlike his peers, he wasn't arrogant. The difficult experiences in Fire Persimmon Immortal City had long taught him what was truly important.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo immersed himself in sparring, and countless new insights came to him again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After each sparring session, he would carefully ponder during rest periods, reviewing his gains and losses. After returning to his cave dwelling, he would also replay the magical battles of the day, summarizing experiences and constantly improving himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">His progress was once again visible to the naked eye, with noticeable improvements every day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"As expected of you, Young Master Ning Zhuo!" Hua Guzi witnessed Ning Zhuo's rapid progress firsthand and repeatedly praised him, her tone enthusiastic, almost flattering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">As she spoke, she took a few steps forward, trying to get closer to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Not at all, I still have a long way to go," Ning Zhuo subtly stepped back, always mindful of maintaining distance from Hua Guzi, while not forgetting to humbly seek guidance, "I noticed when you cast wood-based spells, several of them are extremely swift, almost without any signs of preparation. Why is that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Oh, that's the heart impression," Hua Guzi explained casually, her eyes burning as she stared at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Heart impression!" A glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Hua Guzi took advantage of his contemplation to step forward again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo's face turned cold: "Stop right there and explain it to me from where you are."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Hua Guzi shuddered, her heart crying out: "I've been scolded, I've been scolded by Young Master Ning Zhuo!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Feelings of joy spread through her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo, who sensed her inner thoughts through the Human Life Hanging by a Thread and My Buddha Heart Demon Impression, couldn't help but darken his face slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Fortunately, Hua Guzi was obedient enough and dutifully explained to Ning Zhuo: "Young Master Ning Zhuo must surely know about mouth impressions, divine impressions, and heart impressions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Hua Guzi explained comprehensively: "These three are all techniques for cultivators to control, and are essentially the same, all being ways to guide and use magical power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Mouth impressions are controlled through specific incantations or syllables. For example, the 'chi' sound, or the two breaths of 'heng' and 'ha'."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Body impressions are usually hand gestures or finger seals, but can also involve twisting the body to achieve this purpose. For instance, the most famous Celestial Demon Dance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Heart impressions use thoughts and will to guide magical power, achieving the effect of instantly releasing spells."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"The reason why I can cast certain spells so swiftly is because I use heart impressions!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo was very interested in this, because his Buddha Heart Demon Impression could emit heart impressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Hua Guzi continued: "The prerequisites for using heart impressions are, first, highly concentrated mental focus, which requires training. Second, having spell symbol seeds in the Foundation Establishment dantian."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo nodded: "I'm aware of this. Cultivators in the Foundation Establishment stage will choose some spells as their life spells."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"If cultivation reaches a certain level of refinement, understanding the spells from the surface to the core, comprehending the inner principles, one can form spell symbol seeds. In the future, when forging the Golden Core, these spell symbols will be engraved on the surface of the Golden Core, fully upgrading to become life spells."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"These life spells, when cast, not only have greater power but are also released more quickly. They can also be combined with others to produce more complex and varied effects based on their foundation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"But how does one comprehend these spells and realize the spell symbol seeds? And how should I choose them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Hua Guzi answered: "Firstly, our choice of spells is actually limited. Depending on the different cultivation methods we practice, many methods will naturally produce some spell symbol seeds when cultivated to a certain stage. These spells are often closely related to the cultivation method and are already part of it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"As for how to comprehend spell symbols, I used them many times and then contemplated, finally forming them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo then asked exactly how many times she had used them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">As a result, Hua Guzi told him she couldn't count. She formed the symbol seeds in her Foundation Building dantian during the middle stage of Foundation Establishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">For Ning Zhuo to want symbol seeds in the early stage of Foundation Establishment, there were many difficulties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"On one hand, it's a matter of comprehending the inner core principles of the spells, on the other hand, constructing symbol seeds requires the dantian to generate radiance. Only with this radiance can one construct spell symbol seeds."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This greatly disappointed Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Because the stage of dantian generating radiance is not something achievable in the early stage of Foundation Establishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">It's only when the dantian's foundation reaches the point of overflowing that it can produce a brilliant glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">While heart impressions were not feasible, body and mouth impressions could be cultivated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo discussed this matter with Hua Guzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Although Hua Guzi was an unaffiliated cultivator, she had a good lineage and knew these matters well. She was particularly forthcoming with Ning Zhuo, holding nothing back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Excluding her burning gaze, her little actions trying every way to get close to Ning Zhuo, her occasional infatuated laughter, and drooling, she was indeed a good teacher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo chose to cultivate mouth impressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Under Hua Guzi's guidance, Ning Zhuo made rapid progress, quickly compressing his mouth impressions to his current ability limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Earth veins deep, mystic roots obscure, cocoon vines entwine, all things within. Rise!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Wood-based - Root Fern Entanglement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Pine wind howls, jade waves surge, forest sea churns, overturning the earth. Sweep!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Wood-based - Pine Waves Jade Surges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Ancient wood glows, tree realm vast, heaven and earth change color, spirit root descends. Descend!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Wood-based - Tree Realm Descent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Considering that his ten fingers needed to manipulate puppet strings, finger seals were not feasible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Heart impressions were temporarily out of reach, so he could only use mouth impressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">His current use of mouth impressions, with slightly longer incantations, actually took about the same time to cast spells as before, or even a bit slower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">But when used in actual combat, Ning Zhuo's battle prowess showed a clear increase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This was because previously, when Ning Zhuo cast spells, he had to be fully concentrated, mentally controlling magical power with utmost care.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Now, he only needed to speak the mouth impression to cast spells, allowing him to focus his attention on controlling mechanisms, achieving multitasking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Not seeing you for a day, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo has made such progress again, congratulations!" Han Zhou entered the arena and, seeing Ning Zhuo practicing, couldn't help but exclaim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Sun Lingtong in the mechanical dragon also agreed very much, nodding repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He knew various reasons - this was actually the result of accumulated effort!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Little Zhuo's various basic skills are very much in place. It's just that for fourteen years, he lacked direct confrontation and practice in Fire Persimmon Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Mainly to conceal his edge, he engaged in hiding, so even if there were any practices or sparring in the school, Little Zhuo only exerted one or two tenths of his strength, naturally not gaining any benefits."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Although he had multiple real combat experiences during his control of the black market, battles involving life and death are very dangerous and require full effort. This again lacked the benefits of sparring, discovering one's own flaws through direct competition, and improving one's abilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Fellow Daoist Han Zhou," Ning Zhuo sent a voice transmission greeting while sparring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Just as Han Zhou was about to respond, Hua Guzi's voice transmission followed closely: "How did you, a beggar, get in here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"This is the world of me, your grandaunt, and Young Master Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Han Zhou coldly laughed and responded via voice transmission: "Fellow Daoist Hua is unaware, this arena has always been where Ning Zhuo and I frequently spar. Compared to us, you are the last to join."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">As a result, Hua Guzi unreasonably insisted that Han Zhou leave, wanting to be alone with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo, with his Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability, immediately sensed this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">At once, he coldly said to Hua Guzi: "Fellow Daoist Hua, Fellow Daoist Han Zhou is here at my invitation. As the saying goes, 'Among three people walking, there must be my teacher.' Having one more person to spar with is beneficial for all of us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He didn't use voice transmission for this, speaking directly, which moved Han Zhou deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Hua Guzi's face changed, revealing a fawning smile: "Young Master Ning Zhuo is right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A moment of distraction while speaking, and she was hit in the abdomen by the mechanism source controlled by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Hua Guzi flew back like a lobster, rolling on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Han Zhou was startled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo coldly said: "Fellow Daoist Hua, when sparring with me, please focus fully."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Hua Guzi's heart cried out: "He hit me, he hit me again! He hit my abdomen, it hurts... hurts so good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Hua Guzi gritted her teeth and twisted her expression to prevent her joy from showing, unaware that Ning Zhuo sensed it all clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"This female cultivator..." Ning Zhuo's face grew even colder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Han Zhou was worried for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">But the next moment, Hua Guzi floated up again, lowering her eyes submissively and saying: "Young Master Ning Zhuo, your lesson is well-received!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">After saying this, she shot a fierce glare at Han Zhou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In subsequent interactions, Han Zhou often received fierce glares from Hua Guzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"I'm afraid I'm superfluous here!" Han Zhou thought bitterly, feeling ostracized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">However, Ning Zhuo paid even more attention to him, not neglecting him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo needed to rely on Han Zhou as a third party to curb Hua Guzi's infatuation. After all, with an outsider present, Hua Guzi was much more restrained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">When that day's sparring ended, the three left the arena and walked together for a short distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo walked in the middle, with Han Zhou on the left and Hua Guzi on the right, already forming a small entourage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Jiufan, hidden in the crowd, observed Ning Zhuo and nodded to himself: "This boy hasn't been here long, yet he already has two Foundation Establishment cultivators following him. Moreover, their cultivation levels are higher than Ning Zhuo's."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Truly worthy of being a descendant of our Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo parted ways with Han Zhou, coldly rejected Hua Guzi, thwarting her attempt to return to his cave dwelling together, and entered his dwelling alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Soon after, Ning Jiufan paid a visit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo led him into the cave dwelling and bowed deeply to Ning Jiufan: "Old Ancestor, you've finally arrived. This junior has been eagerly awaiting you for days!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Jiufan immediately felt a strong sense of vigilance; it wasn't the first time he had been schemed against by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"What scheme are you plotting now, boy? Wait, it's not about that Feng something, is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
