<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
This method of cultivation is of great significance.<br/>
<br/>
Take Hua Guzi for example. If she wanted to establish a family and expand her lineage in the future, these cultivation methods will be an important part of her family business!<br/>
<br/>
"The old ancestor should arrive in the coming days."<br/>
<br/>
"At that time, I will extract the relevant content about the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum and let him take it back for the family to use."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo made arrangements in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
While waiting for the old ancestor Ning Jiufan, he continued his own cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
By now, he had experienced important battles with Han Zhou, Chang Yan, and Hua Guzi, firmly establishing his foothold on Little Contention Peak and gaining recognition from the wider community of cultivators. Additionally, with Lin Shanshan and her senior brothers no longer plotting against him, Ning Zhuo's days became very peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
Every day, he would go to the arena to spar with Han Zhou.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Hua Guzi too.<br/>
<br/>
This half-demon, half-human female cultivator, on the second day after giving her gift, once again blocked Ning Zhuo's path to publicly give him presents.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had no choice. Just as he felt he couldn't make significant improvements from Han Zhou anymore, he invited Hua Guzi to participate in the daily sparring activities.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi was overjoyed!<br/>
<br/>
That night when she went to bed, she couldn't sleep. She tightly hugged her pillow, her face full of infatuation and fantasies, tossing and turning, indulging in her thoughts all night long.<br/>
<br/>
Although she was weak in close combat, she was strong in magical battles.<br/>
<br/>
When sparring, Ning Zhuo mainly engaged in magical battles with her.<br/>
<br/>
In wood-based magic, Ning Zhuo was still overwhelmed by Hua Guzi. But unlike his peers, he wasn't arrogant. The difficult experiences in Fire Persimmon Immortal City had long taught him what was truly important.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immersed himself in sparring, and countless new insights came to him again.<br/>
<br/>
After each sparring session, he would carefully ponder during rest periods, reviewing his gains and losses. After returning to his cave dwelling, he would also replay the magical battles of the day, summarizing experiences and constantly improving himself.<br/>
<br/>
His progress was once again visible to the naked eye, with noticeable improvements every day.<br/>
<br/>
"As expected of you, Young Master Ning Zhuo!" Hua Guzi witnessed Ning Zhuo's rapid progress firsthand and repeatedly praised him, her tone enthusiastic, almost flattering.<br/>
<br/>
As she spoke, she took a few steps forward, trying to get closer to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Not at all, I still have a long way to go," Ning Zhuo subtly stepped back, always mindful of maintaining distance from Hua Guzi, while not forgetting to humbly seek guidance, "I noticed when you cast wood-based spells, several of them are extremely swift, almost without any signs of preparation. Why is that?"<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, that's the heart impression," Hua Guzi explained casually, her eyes burning as she stared at Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Heart impression!" A glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi took advantage of his contemplation to step forward again.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face turned cold: "Stop right there and explain it to me from where you are."<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi shuddered, her heart crying out: "I've been scolded, I've been scolded by Young Master Ning Zhuo!!"<br/>
<br/>
Feelings of joy spread through her heart.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, who sensed her inner thoughts through the Human Life Hanging by a Thread and My Buddha Heart Demon Impression, couldn't help but darken his face slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Hua Guzi was obedient enough and dutifully explained to Ning Zhuo: "Young Master Ning Zhuo must surely know about mouth impressions, divine impressions, and heart impressions."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi explained comprehensively: "These three are all techniques for cultivators to control, and are essentially the same, all being ways to guide and use magical power."<br/>
<br/>
"Mouth impressions are controlled through specific incantations or syllables. For example, the 'chi' sound, or the two breaths of 'heng' and 'ha'."<br/>
<br/>
"Body impressions are usually hand gestures or finger seals, but can also involve twisting the body to achieve this purpose. For instance, the most famous Celestial Demon Dance."<br/>
<br/>
"Heart impressions use thoughts and will to guide magical power, achieving the effect of instantly releasing spells."<br/>
<br/>
"The reason why I can cast certain spells so swiftly is because I use heart impressions!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was very interested in this, because his Buddha Heart Demon Impression could emit heart impressions.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi continued: "The prerequisites for using heart impressions are, first, highly concentrated mental focus, which requires training. Second, having spell symbol seeds in the Foundation Establishment dantian."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "I'm aware of this. Cultivators in the Foundation Establishment stage will choose some spells as their life spells."<br/>
<br/>
"If cultivation reaches a certain level of refinement, understanding the spells from the surface to the core, comprehending the inner principles, one can form spell symbol seeds. In the future, when forging the Golden Core, these spell symbols will be engraved on the surface of the Golden Core, fully upgrading to become life spells."<br/>
<br/>
"These life spells, when cast, not only have greater power but are also released more quickly. They can also be combined with others to produce more complex and varied effects based on their foundation."<br/>
<br/>
"But how does one comprehend these spells and realize the spell symbol seeds? And how should I choose them?"<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi answered: "Firstly, our choice of spells is actually limited. Depending on the different cultivation methods we practice, many methods will naturally produce some spell symbol seeds when cultivated to a certain stage. These spells are often closely related to the cultivation method and are already part of it."<br/>
<br/>
"As for how to comprehend spell symbols, I used them many times and then contemplated, finally forming them."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then asked exactly how many times she had used them.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, Hua Guzi told him she couldn't count. She formed the symbol seeds in her Foundation Building dantian during the middle stage of Foundation Establishment.<br/>
<br/>
For Ning Zhuo to want symbol seeds in the early stage of Foundation Establishment, there were many difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
"On one hand, it's a matter of comprehending the inner core principles of the spells, on the other hand, constructing symbol seeds requires the dantian to generate radiance. Only with this radiance can one construct spell symbol seeds."<br/>
<br/>
This greatly disappointed Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Because the stage of dantian generating radiance is not something achievable in the early stage of Foundation Establishment.<br/>
<br/>
It's only when the dantian's foundation reaches the point of overflowing that it can produce a brilliant glow.<br/>
<br/>
While heart impressions were not feasible, body and mouth impressions could be cultivated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo discussed this matter with Hua Guzi.<br/>
<br/>
Although Hua Guzi was an unaffiliated cultivator, she had a good lineage and knew these matters well. She was particularly forthcoming with Ning Zhuo, holding nothing back.<br/>
<br/>
Excluding her burning gaze, her little actions trying every way to get close to Ning Zhuo, her occasional infatuated laughter, and drooling, she was indeed a good teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo chose to cultivate mouth impressions.<br/>
<br/>
Under Hua Guzi's guidance, Ning Zhuo made rapid progress, quickly compressing his mouth impressions to his current ability limit.<br/>
<br/>
"Earth veins deep, mystic roots obscure, cocoon vines entwine, all things within. Rise!"<br/>
<br/>
Wood-based - Root Fern Entanglement.<br/>
<br/>
"Pine wind howls, jade waves surge, forest sea churns, overturning the earth. Sweep!"<br/>
<br/>
Wood-based - Pine Waves Jade Surges.<br/>
<br/>
"Ancient wood glows, tree realm vast, heaven and earth change color, spirit root descends. Descend!"<br/>
<br/>
Wood-based - Tree Realm Descent.<br/>
<br/>
Considering that his ten fingers needed to manipulate puppet strings, finger seals were not feasible.<br/>
<br/>
Heart impressions were temporarily out of reach, so he could only use mouth impressions.<br/>
<br/>
His current use of mouth impressions, with slightly longer incantations, actually took about the same time to cast spells as before, or even a bit slower.<br/>
<br/>
But when used in actual combat, Ning Zhuo's battle prowess showed a clear increase.<br/>
<br/>
This was because previously, when Ning Zhuo cast spells, he had to be fully concentrated, mentally controlling magical power with utmost care.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he only needed to speak the mouth impression to cast spells, allowing him to focus his attention on controlling mechanisms, achieving multitasking.<br/>
<br/>
"Not seeing you for a day, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo has made such progress again, congratulations!" Han Zhou entered the arena and, seeing Ning Zhuo practicing, couldn't help but exclaim.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong in the mechanical dragon also agreed very much, nodding repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
He knew various reasons - this was actually the result of accumulated effort!<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo's various basic skills are very much in place. It's just that for fourteen years, he lacked direct confrontation and practice in Fire Persimmon Immortal City."<br/>
<br/>
"Mainly to conceal his edge, he engaged in hiding, so even if there were any practices or sparring in the school, Little Zhuo only exerted one or two tenths of his strength, naturally not gaining any benefits."<br/>
<br/>
"Although he had multiple real combat experiences during his control of the black market, battles involving life and death are very dangerous and require full effort. This again lacked the benefits of sparring, discovering one's own flaws through direct competition, and improving one's abilities."<br/>
<br/>
"Fellow Daoist Han Zhou," Ning Zhuo sent a voice transmission greeting while sparring.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Han Zhou was about to respond, Hua Guzi's voice transmission followed closely: "How did you, a beggar, get in here?"<br/>
<br/>
"This is the world of me, your grandaunt, and Young Master Ning Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou coldly laughed and responded via voice transmission: "Fellow Daoist Hua is unaware, this arena has always been where Ning Zhuo and I frequently spar. Compared to us, you are the last to join."<br/>
<br/>
As a result, Hua Guzi unreasonably insisted that Han Zhou leave, wanting to be alone with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, with his Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability, immediately sensed this.<br/>
<br/>
At once, he coldly said to Hua Guzi: "Fellow Daoist Hua, Fellow Daoist Han Zhou is here at my invitation. As the saying goes, 'Among three people walking, there must be my teacher.' Having one more person to spar with is beneficial for all of us!"<br/>
<br/>
He didn't use voice transmission for this, speaking directly, which moved Han Zhou deeply.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi's face changed, revealing a fawning smile: "Young Master Ning Zhuo is right."<br/>
<br/>
A moment of distraction while speaking, and she was hit in the abdomen by the mechanism source controlled by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi flew back like a lobster, rolling on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou was startled.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo coldly said: "Fellow Daoist Hua, when sparring with me, please focus fully."<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi's heart cried out: "He hit me, he hit me again! He hit my abdomen, it hurts... hurts so good!"<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi gritted her teeth and twisted her expression to prevent her joy from showing, unaware that Ning Zhuo sensed it all clearly.<br/>
<br/>
"This female cultivator..." Ning Zhuo's face grew even colder.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou was worried for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
But the next moment, Hua Guzi floated up again, lowering her eyes submissively and saying: "Young Master Ning Zhuo, your lesson is well-received!"<br/>
<br/>
After saying this, she shot a fierce glare at Han Zhou.<br/>
<br/>
In subsequent interactions, Han Zhou often received fierce glares from Hua Guzi.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm afraid I'm superfluous here!" Han Zhou thought bitterly, feeling ostracized.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo paid even more attention to him, not neglecting him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo needed to rely on Han Zhou as a third party to curb Hua Guzi's infatuation. After all, with an outsider present, Hua Guzi was much more restrained.<br/>
<br/>
When that day's sparring ended, the three left the arena and walked together for a short distance.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo walked in the middle, with Han Zhou on the left and Hua Guzi on the right, already forming a small entourage.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan, hidden in the crowd, observed Ning Zhuo and nodded to himself: "This boy hasn't been here long, yet he already has two Foundation Establishment cultivators following him. Moreover, their cultivation levels are higher than Ning Zhuo's."<br/>
<br/>
"Truly worthy of being a descendant of our Ning family."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo parted ways with Han Zhou, coldly rejected Hua Guzi, thwarting her attempt to return to his cave dwelling together, and entered his dwelling alone.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, Ning Jiufan paid a visit.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo led him into the cave dwelling and bowed deeply to Ning Jiufan: "Old Ancestor, you've finally arrived. This junior has been eagerly awaiting you for days!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan immediately felt a strong sense of vigilance; it wasn't the first time he had been schemed against by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"What scheme are you plotting now, boy? Wait, it's not about that Feng something, is it?"<br/>
