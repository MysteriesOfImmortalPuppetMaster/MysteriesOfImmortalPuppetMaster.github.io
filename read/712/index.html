<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In a way, the Mad Monk's slanderous rumors against Ning Zhuo had inadvertently enhanced his reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"But we can't underestimate this hostile force."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"We can ignore them for now, but that won't always be the case."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Because soon, I'll truly need to shine. Appearing under the shadow of cowardice is unacceptable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The White Paper Immortal City incident was both a hurdle and an opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">If Ning Zhuo had already been somewhat renowned before the incident, it would have served as a protective shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Now, Wen Ruanyu had taken the initiative to enlist support from fellow cultivators to mentor Ning Zhuo. Chu Xuangui's Rising Cloud Minor Trial had yielded remarkable results, signaling the beginning of a tacit collaboration between Ning Zhuo and the Confucian cultivators of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In this context, allowing the Mad Monk to continue his slanderous campaign and spread rumors undermining Ning Zhuo would be unwise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">With the Confucian cultivators offering their full support, any missteps on Ning Zhuo's part - such as failing to address the Mad Monk's nuisance - would inevitably damage his standing among the Confucian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Moreover, how would the higher-ups of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, who would eventually learn the truth, view Ning Zhuo's current conduct?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo belonged to the Righteous Path, not the Demonic Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">These were all matters Ning Zhuo needed to ponder deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Myriad Manifestations Sect was Meng Yaoyin's sect, and Ning Zhuo held it in high regard. He planned to join and develop his career there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Every action I take here, even if unnoticed now, will eventually be scrutinized."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"This is my chance to establish a lasting impression, one that will profoundly impact my future prospects within the sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">After a moment of contemplation, Ning Zhuo began writing letters to Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong. He intended to leverage their influence to launch a public relations counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Upon receiving the letter, Shen Xi immediately grasped the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Ning Zhuo incurred Pi Fujie's wrath because of me. Pi Fujie's invitation to Ban Ji clearly shows he's forming alliances to regain face after being humiliated by our faction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"I've already figured out Ban Ji's motive for targeting Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"It seems Ban Ji covets the Golden Core-level Mechanical Puppet in Ning Zhuo's possession."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Su Lingkou nodded in agreement. "Cousin, I think you're right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"But Ning Zhuo already commands considerable influence and has recruited Gongsun Yan. He's hardly lacking manpower. Why would he need your help?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Shen Xi smiled. "He didn't just ask me; he also requested Lin Jinglong's assistance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"The brilliance of his strategy lies in two key aspects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Firstly, he's a newcomer here. Neither he nor any backing he might have carries much weight at the Myriad Manifestations Sect. I'm different. My support would immediately stir public opinion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Secondly, he didn't just ask me for help. His letter explicitly mentions he also wrote to Lin Jinglong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"So, if I refuse to help him and Lin Jinglong agrees, what then?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Ning Zhuo isn't just anyone..." Shen Xi sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ever since the incident involving Lin Jinglong and Gongsun Yan, Shen Xi had immediately reassessed his view of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Previously, he had seen Ning Zhuo as a subordinate, someone he could use as a hired hand to deal with Gongsun Yan. But Ning Zhuo had shattered that framework by directly confronting Gongsun Yan and turning him to their side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This brilliant move had completely altered Lin Jinglong and Shen Xi's perceptions, reshaping the internal dynamics of their small group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Now, Shen Xi regarded Ning Zhuo as an equal - an ally he needed to win over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Therefore, Shen Xi had to help Ning Zhuo, and he had to do it wholeheartedly. At the very least, he needed to outdo Lin Jinglong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Su Lingkou listened to Shen Xi's analysis, finally understanding the complexities involved. She covered her mouth in surprise, realizing there were so many hidden layers to this situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong's replies arrived swiftly in Ning Zhuo's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Shen Xi's response was exactly as Ning Zhuo had anticipated. He explicitly pledged to assist with public opinion, leveraging the Shen Clan's prestige in Nine Palaces Immortal City to publicly support Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Lin Jinglong's reply differed from Shen Xi's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In his letter, Lin Jinglong insisted on coordinating their narrative regarding the Gongsun Yan incident. He offered to personally intervene and support Ning Zhuo, provided it wouldn't damage the reputations of the Lin Clan or himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">At the letter's conclusion, Lin Jinglong bluntly stated, "The Mad Monk is no weakling, but given Fellow Daoist Ning's strength, what is there to fear? Just crush him directly! All this verbal sparring is such a nuisance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly as he read this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Lin Jinglong is uncertain of my true strength, so he's using this opportunity to probe my capabilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">In a direct confrontation, Ning Zhuo would naturally dismiss the Mad Monk as insignificant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"But a moment's impatience can ruin grand plans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Even if I eliminated the Mad Monk, Ban Ji and Pi Fujie would simply find another blade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Moreover, their attacks against me will inevitably escalate. This smear campaign is relatively mild. Once I counter it, I can't predict what schemes they'll devise next."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"If they devise an even more insidious scheme, and I'm caught off guard, it could lead to unnecessary complications."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"The most pressing matter right now is still the Rising Cloud Minor Trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji shared the same view.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">If Ban Ji knew what Ning Zhuo was thinking at that moment, his expression would be priceless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"The Rising Cloud Minor Trial is a series of selections. Individuals or Sect factions use it to scout talent and establish connections between the old and new generations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"If these connections are strong and newcomers gain recognition, they'll receive support from veteran members of the Myriad Manifestations Sect during the upcoming Flying Cloud Assembly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo genuinely wanted to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect and thrive within it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This was a Super Sect, and Ning Zhuo had the foundation to succeed here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The reputation left by Meng Yaoyin, Wen Ruanyu, Yang Sanyan, and others were all resources he could leverage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">These were his entry points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">By infiltrating the Myriad Manifestations Sect through different avenues, Ning Zhuo's future cultivation path would take on distinct forms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Currently, Ning Zhuo was in the observation and selection phase, carefully choosing his entry points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"The Confucian cultivator faction only represents the middle tier of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. This entry point isn't ideal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Qing Huangzi is just a solitary rogue cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"The Eight Peaks and Sixteen Halls are the best points of entry."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"But now, with the Eight Peaks divided into four old and four new factions, dangerous undercurrents are brewing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Normal cultivators might avoid Flowing Cloud Peak. It remains perpetually vacant, temporarily led by the victor of each Flying Cloud Assembly. In the past century, it has seen seven peak masters come and go, making it notoriously unstable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"In reality, Violet Thunder Peak is an even deeper pit than Flowing Cloud Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Conversely, Flowing Cloud Peak offers immense opportunities for cultivators with genuine strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ban Ji had hired four elite Demonic Cultivators at great expense to restrain and entangle Ning Zhuo. Yet Ning Zhuo remained unaffected, his insight into the situation as clear as day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Every Rising Cloud Minor Trial is a chance to learn."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"During this phase, nearly all members of the Myriad Manifestations Sect treat newcomers equally, welcoming them to learn and providing ample opportunities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Such a rare opportunity comes only once in a lifetime."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Once I formally join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, I'll inevitably have to align with a faction and engage in internal conflicts. It will become impossible to learn from opposing factions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"How many Rising Cloud Minor Trials does the Myriad Manifestations Sect host? Countless! Each one is a chance to learn."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"What's even more terrifying is that these learning opportunities come at virtually no cost."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">What had Ning Zhuo sacrificed to participate in Chu Xuangui and Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Minor Trials?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He had only spent his time, essentially obtaining the Intentional Brush and Vowel Reed Book for free.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"My mother's message in the Jade Slip, urging me to come early, clearly held deeper meaning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"The more Rising Cloud Minor Trials I participate in, the more entry points I'll have, and the greater my gains will be."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"And if I can conveniently strike blows against Ban Ji and Pi Fujie along the way, all the better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">With this thought, Ning Zhuo's expression turned solemn. "Therefore, my current priority is actually enhancing my learning capabilities!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Chu Xuangui's Rising Cloud Minor Trial was unique and could be disregarded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo only needed to consider Qing Huangzi's trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">In Qing Huangzi's first Minor Trial, the Vowel Reed Book was freely given to the victors. While Ning Zhuo had mastered the entire text, others struggled with comprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"This situation could easily happen to me in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"After all, my foundation in music theory is merely solid. As for mechanisms, my mother only left me a single classic text."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"There's still so much I need to learn - so, so much!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">After careful consideration, Ning Zhuo ordered Old Chef to publicly announce: "We are offering a substantial reward for any method of rapid learning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The high price and public fanfare immediately ignited a new wave of heated debate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Who knew Ning Zhuo was so wealthy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"How could someone challenged by the Mad Monk be anything less than extraordinary?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Even Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong have publicly supported him, denouncing the Mad Monk as a dog and accusing him of trying to distract Ning Zhuo. If Ning Zhuo engages the Mad Monk in a duel, wouldn't he be falling into the enemy's trap?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Public sentiment clearly shifted in Ning Zhuo's favor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Meanwhile, the pillars of the Confucian cultivator community gathered to discuss Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">One of them remarked, "This young man recommended by Wen Ruanyu seems promising. His willingness to pay handsomely for rapid learning methods shows a deep understanding of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Chu Xuangui, recalling Ning Zhuo's demeanor before him, nodded slightly. "He understands the principles of reason."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Another added, "Since Ning Zhuo has already handled the Mad Monk so effectively, I don't think we need to offer further assistance in that regard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">A third voice chimed in, "We shouldn't become too involved in this matter anyway. Let's focus on the real issue: how do we support this young man's rise?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Old Confucian Scholar Song Taosheng spoke up, "Since this young man seeks a rapid learning method and has made such a grand spectacle of it, and given that the Confucian school excels in such methods, could this be Ning Zhuo signaling us?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The other three cultivators nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Song Taosheng continued, "If that's the case, perhaps this old man should take the lead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The three cultivators nodded in unison again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">One of them voiced a hint of concern, "Please be mindful, Mr. Songtao. If Ning Zhuo withdraws due to the pain, it would be most unfortunate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Song Taosheng waved his hand dismissively. "I know my limits."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Jade Pine Peak resembled an inverted jade hairpin piercing the sky, perpetually shrouded in mist and clouds. The Path to Sainthood, an almost vertical staircase carved from countless weathered bluestone steps, wound around the mountain's flank, leading directly to the summit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">At the peak stood not a palace of jade and gold, but a simple, solemn Temple of Literature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The temple was modest in size, with green-tiled roofs and red walls, its flying eaves and bracket sets bearing the marks of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Instead of an ornate archway, an ancient, gnarled pine tree stood before the temple, its twisted branches reaching skyward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Early morning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Dozens of cultivators had gathered upon hearing the news. Finding the temple gates closed, they patiently waited beneath the pine tree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Fellow Daoist Ning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Brother Kong, Brother Bai, Brother Liu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo greeted Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Kong Ran's expression was somewhat awkward. He had written to his father, requesting permission to trade with Ning Zhuo, only to receive a stern rebuke in return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Though Kong Ran was a child prodigy, his youth and limited experience, combined with his lingering fascination with the Intentional Brush, prevented him from reporting his findings to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">As he carefully considered his words, preparing to explain to Ning Zhuo, the doors of the Temple of Literature suddenly swung open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">A group of cultivators entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The temple's interior was strikingly simple: a wordless stone tablet, polished to a mirror-like sheen, stood at the center, flanked by rows of plain meditation cushions on either side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">A mountain wind swept through, rustling the pines outside like the whispers of sages or the turning of ancient pages, cleansing the heart. The crisp air carried the scent of pine needles and the chill of mountain rocks into the temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Old Confucian Scholar Song Taosheng sat withered within the temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">His hair and beard were snow-white, yet his complexion remained ruddy, his frame lean and upright. He wore a faded but impeccably starched blue Confucian robe. His eyes, when they opened and closed, radiated a restrained inner light, lacking any oppressive aura but exuding a profound and righteous Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He surveyed the group, his calm voice resonating through the temple: "Seek truth through hardship, and benevolence through seeking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"The Confucian Path is neither a smooth road nor a treacherous path. Its power arises from the heart, manifests in resolve, and is perfected through action. To grasp its essence, one must understand the meaning of 'hardship.' Not the self-inflicted suffering of demons, but the tempering of mind and body through diligent effort - the unwavering resolve to 'hear the Way in the morning and die content in the evening.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">With a gentle flick of his sleeve, two treasures appeared before the assembled cultivators: a coil of hemp rope and a large number of wooden awls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Today, I will impart two Confucian Methods: Hanging by the Hair and Thigh-Pricking Awl!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Each of you, step forward in turn and select a hemp rope and a wooden awl."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The cultivators exchanged uneasy glances, some visibly frowning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo noticed Kong Ran's face had paled slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The cultivators lined up and chose their hemp ropes and wooden awls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo examined the items in his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The hemp rope was gray and coarse, yet sturdy, with a faint grassy scent. It bore no runes or spiritual light, but had been meticulously dyed with cinnabar, giving it a dark red hue and an aura of solemnity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The wooden awl was about a foot long. Judging by its texture, it appeared to be carved from the hard yellow boxwood found in mountain regions, its tip sharpened to a keen point. The awl's shaft was densely inscribed with inspirational Confucian maxims in tiny, fly-head-sized characters, such as: "Learning is like rowing upstream; not to advance is to fall back," "Perseverance can carve through stone and metal," and "Heaven's way is vigorous; the gentleman strives tirelessly for self-improvement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Mr. Songtao's gaze swept over the assembly, filled with scrutiny and expectation. "The methods of Hanging by the Hair and Thigh-Pricking Awl are ancient, yet their meaning endures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"These are not acts of self-harm, but rather tools to awaken the mind, ignite ambition, temper the Divine Soul, and spur one to strive for greatness, drawing strength from adversity."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
