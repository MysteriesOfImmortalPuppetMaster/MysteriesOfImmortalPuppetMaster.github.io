<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div><paragraph index="0">Lin Shanshan checked Ning Zhuo's pulse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="2">After a moment, she withdrew her delicate fingers and softly said, "Young Master Ning, the cold energy in your body is quite insignificant, but it will still take more than a month to completely expel it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">"During this time, any food you eat will have a naturally bitter taste."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="6">"Be sure to avoid cold environments, as this will exacerbate the cold energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">"Also, keep a calm heart and avoid any gloomy thoughts. Otherwise, the cold energy may deepen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">Lin Shanshan carefully reminded Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">Somewhat reluctantly, Ning Zhuo asked, "Miss Lin, your sect is renowned for its healing abilities. Is there really no way to deal with this cold energy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">Lin Shanshan smiled. "There is, but the cost would be too high."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">"To completely clear the cold energy instantly, you'd need at least a pill of the Golden Core level. From what I see, the cold energy in your body isn't much, so it won’t affect your cultivation or combat abilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">"Just endure it for a while, and you'll recover without medicine. Why not take this route?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. "I must thank you for your timely advice. Han Zhou certainly lives up to his name; the cold energy he unleashed is truly troublesome. It seems only Golden Core-level methods can resolve it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">Lin Shanshan continued, "The difficulty in dispelling cold energy isn't due to its physical harm to the body, but rather its mental impact."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">"Our sect believes the cold energy contains a hidden intent that infiltrates the divine sea and upper dantian, making recovery nearly impossible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">"That's why I think the 'Cold Sutra' might be a Buddhist technique. As you know, the frightening aspect of Buddhist techniques lies in their ability to 'convert' people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">Many Buddhist techniques have the power to convert others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">The reason is that Buddhist magical energy carries intent, which can seep into the upper dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">As a result, when cultivators are frequently struck by Buddhist techniques, they gradually come to accept Buddhist teachings, eventually converting and becoming disciples of Buddhism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">There's a famous Buddhist technique known as the "Five Finger Mountain," which is cultivated from conversion-based Buddhist techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">When this technique is deployed, the magical energy forms into a mountain, suppressing a powerful enemy. The longer the suppression lasts, the deeper the enemy is influenced and transformed by the Buddhist intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">Ning Zhuo asked, "So, the real intention of the Han Zhou isn't just to train on the Little Contention Peak but to convert people?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">Lin Shanshan shook her head slightly. "That's just speculation. Han Zhou has never admitted to such intentions, so it's never been confirmed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">Ning Zhuo chuckled, "How could he admit it? Conversion is taboo. Once converted, am I still truly myself? I don't think it's a personal change but rather an external force reshaping me. That's terrifying!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">Lin Shanshan sighed lightly. "Little Contention Peak is filled with dragons and snakes, with each outsider having their own plans and purposes. It's hard to fully investigate. Young Master Ning, you mentioned earlier that you came here seeking advice. What advice were you seeking?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">Before Ning Zhuo could respond, Lin Shanshan continued, "At first, I thought your chances against Han Zhou were slim."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">"But since you possess Golden Core-level talismans and have profound mastery over the five-element techniques, you are already a force to be reckoned with on Little Contention Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">"I underestimated you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">"With or without my help, the outcome of this battle wouldn't have changed. Even without me, you would surely succeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">Although there were no life-threatening situations or demonic marks, Ning Zhuo's lifelong skill in reading people, honed in the Immortal City of the Fire Persimmon Clan, allowed him to sense Lin Shanshan's subtle unease and suspicion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Ning Zhuo smiled broadly, showing a slightly teasing grin, and gazed sincerely at Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">He slowly stood up, bowed deeply, and began to explain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">"Miss Lin, I didn’t intentionally deceive you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">"Look, this is the 'Oily Glide Talisman,' a gift from the Golden Core ancestor of my clan back home."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Lin Shanshan averted her eyes immediately. "Young Master Ning, this is your trump card; how could you reveal it so easily to others?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">Ning Zhuo chuckled and stepped forward, grabbing Lin Shanshan's hand and placing the talisman in her palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">"Revealing it to you, Miss Lin, how could that be considered revealing it too easily?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">Lin Shanshan, startled by Ning Zhuo's sudden action, felt flustered and unsure of how to react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">"Men and women should not casually touch; how can you act like this?!" she thought, feeling a mix of embarrassment and anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">But that feeling of embarrassment quickly overwhelmed her anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">With a sincere and urgent expression, Ning Zhuo continued, "I didn't mean to deceive you, Miss Lin. It's just that such talismans are meant for self-preservation. Revealing them would make others look down on me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">"I am Ning Zhuo, from the Ning family of Immortal City of Fire Persimmon. My name and identity will not change! If people look down on me, I don’t mind. But if my actions cause others to look down on my family, that’s absolutely unacceptable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">These words, full of pride in his heritage, struck a chord with Lin Shanshan, the young mistress of the Myriad Medicine Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Ning Zhuo continued, "My name, Ning Zhuo, was given to me to remind me to remain humble. It’s a blessing and a reminder from my parents. So being arrogant and aggressive is not in my nature."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">"I often remind myself that these trump cards are just external tools and not my own strength. True power comes from within."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">"So, I act as if these trump cards don’t even exist!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">"For example, this time…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">"If I had relied on the Oily Glide Talisman, I wouldn’t have sought advice from you. Without your guidance, how could I have improved so much in close combat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">"You saw how I managed to hold my own for a while against Han Zhou in close combat. I couldn't have done that before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">"That's all thanks to you, Miss Lin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">Lin Shanshan quickly waved her hand. "Not at all, not at all. Young Master Ning has exceptional talent and is quick to learn. You trained hard and put your whole heart into it. I’m not some famous teacher; your progress is due to your own excellence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">Her words were completely sincere, without exaggeration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">She had personally witnessed Ning Zhuo’s diligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Ning Zhuo sighed emotionally, "Your help has been more than that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">"The Fasting Pill helped me overcome hunger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">"The Heartwarming Charm shielded me from the cold."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">"After the battle with Han Zhou, I truly realized how invaluable these were!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">At the mention of the Heartwarming Charm, Lin Shanshan suddenly remembered her reason for coming to see Ning Zhuo: to ask for the charm back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">She had only lent it to him, not given it. The Fasting Pill was one thing, but the Heartwarming Charm, though a small item, was still her personal belonging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">She had acted impulsively and out of concern before. But over the past few days, rumors had spread through the sect, making her realize it was inappropriate to leave it with him. If the rumors were confirmed, they would be undeniable proof. It was better to ask for it back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Just as she was about to speak, Ning Zhuo said, "Miss Lin, look, this is a talisman from my clan. The Ning family excels at creating talismans. This talisman is imbued with its own spirit, so it activates automatically in times of crisis."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Lin Shanshan’s attention shifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">Though she was a Foundation Establishment cultivator with Nascent Soul-level protections, she had little experience with Golden Core-level talismans, especially reusable ones like the Oily Glide Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Her sect specialized in medicine, not talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">She had seen many Golden Core-level pills, but not talismans with such self-activating properties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Lin Shanshan glanced at the talisman and then handed it back to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">She suppressed her curiosity, reminding herself that it was his trump card, and she shouldn’t look too closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">But Ning Zhuo didn’t take it back. Instead, he said, "I learned long ago how to deal with people. How others treat me is how I respond to them. Miss Lin, though we’ve only known each other a short time, you’ve helped me so much, with such genuine sincerity. I must treat you with equal sincerity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">"To be honest, while the Ning family’s ancestor is only at the Golden Core stage, our family also has Nascent Soul-level strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">"I am fortunate to have the trust of my ancestor. I carry many trump cards like this one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">"If it weren't for the fact that this talisman was personally given to me by the ancestor, what harm would there be in giving it to you now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">Hearing "personally given," Lin Shanshan’s heart skipped a beat, and her fingers instinctively tightened around the talisman, as if feeling Ning Zhuo’s warmth through it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Lin Shanshan, with a serious expression, stood up. "Young Master Ning, you must be joking! A Golden Core-level talisman is such a precious item; how could it be casually given away?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Ning Zhuo responded with equal seriousness, "Miss Lin, you're mistaken!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">"While talismans are good, they are still just external tools."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">"Such 'good things' are only valuable because our cultivation is still weak. Once we reach the Golden Core stage ourselves, won't our perception of these talismans change?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">"True strength comes from within! As cultivators, we must use external tools to strengthen ourselves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">"So, while I value these talismans, I don’t place undue importance on them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">"I, Ning Zhuo, value people most and prioritize relationships."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">"Miss Lin, you have been so kind-hearted, offering me the Heartwarming Charm and Fasting Pill, and helping me train. How could I not repay you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">Ning Zhuo sighed softly, a look of regret on his face. "Unfortunately, I cannot give you this Oily Glide Talisman, as it was a personal gift from my ancestor. When I return to my family, I will need to ask for permission and hope to secure another talisman for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">"But I promise, Miss Lin, in the future I will give you a talisman in return as a token of my gratitude."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">Lin Shanshan opened her mouth but couldn’t find the words to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">She was completely at a loss for words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">Looking at Ning Zhuo’s sincere and grateful face, how could she possibly bring up the topic of asking for the jade pendant back?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">"Sigh, if there’s anyone to blame, it’s myself for not being clear from the beginning, leading to a misunderstanding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">"In fact, at the time, I did have the intention of giving it as a gift, but the recent rumors have made me realize the implications of my actions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
