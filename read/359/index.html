<div id="chapterContent">Lin Shanshan checked Ning Zhuo's pulse.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment, she withdrew her delicate fingers and softly said, "Young Master Ning, the cold energy in your body is quite insignificant, but it will still take more than a month to completely expel it."<br/>
<br/>
"During this time, any food you eat will have a naturally bitter taste."<br/>
<br/>
"Be sure to avoid cold environments, as this will exacerbate the cold energy."<br/>
<br/>
"Also, keep a calm heart and avoid any gloomy thoughts. Otherwise, the cold energy may deepen."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan carefully reminded Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhat reluctantly, Ning Zhuo asked, "Miss Lin, your sect is renowned for its healing abilities. Is there really no way to deal with this cold energy?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled. "There is, but the cost would be too high."<br/>
<br/>
"To completely clear the cold energy instantly, you'd need at least a pill of the Golden Core level. From what I see, the cold energy in your body isn't much, so it won‚Äôt affect your cultivation or combat abilities."<br/>
<br/>
"Just endure it for a while, and you'll recover without medicine. Why not take this route?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. "I must thank you for your timely advice. Han Zhou certainly lives up to his name; the cold energy he unleashed is truly troublesome. It seems only Golden Core-level methods can resolve it."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan continued, "The difficulty in dispelling cold energy isn't due to its physical harm to the body, but rather its mental impact."<br/>
<br/>
"Our sect believes the cold energy contains a hidden intent that infiltrates the divine sea and upper dantian, making recovery nearly impossible."<br/>
<br/>
"That's why I think the 'Cold Sutra' might be a Buddhist technique. As you know, the frightening aspect of Buddhist techniques lies in their ability to 'convert' people."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded.<br/>
<br/>
Many Buddhist techniques have the power to convert others.<br/>
<br/>
The reason is that Buddhist magical energy carries intent, which can seep into the upper dantian.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, when cultivators are frequently struck by Buddhist techniques, they gradually come to accept Buddhist teachings, eventually converting and becoming disciples of Buddhism.<br/>
<br/>
There's a famous Buddhist technique known as the "Five Finger Mountain," which is cultivated from conversion-based Buddhist techniques.<br/>
<br/>
When this technique is deployed, the magical energy forms into a mountain, suppressing a powerful enemy. The longer the suppression lasts, the deeper the enemy is influenced and transformed by the Buddhist intent.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo asked, "So, the real intention of the Han Zhou isn't just to train on the Little Contention Peak but to convert people?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan shook her head slightly. "That's just speculation. Han Zhou has never admitted to such intentions, so it's never been confirmed."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo chuckled, "How could he admit it? Conversion is taboo. Once converted, am I still truly myself? I don't think it's a personal change but rather an external force reshaping me. That's terrifying!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan sighed lightly. "Little Contention Peak is filled with dragons and snakes, with each outsider having their own plans and purposes. It's hard to fully investigate. Young Master Ning, you mentioned earlier that you came here seeking advice. What advice were you seeking?"<br/>
<br/>
Before Ning Zhuo could respond, Lin Shanshan continued, "At first, I thought your chances against Han Zhou were slim."<br/>
<br/>
"But since you possess Golden Core-level talismans and have profound mastery over the five-element techniques, you are already a force to be reckoned with on Little Contention Peak."<br/>
<br/>
"I underestimated you!"<br/>
<br/>
"With or without my help, the outcome of this battle wouldn't have changed. Even without me, you would surely succeed."<br/>
<br/>
Although there were no life-threatening situations or demonic marks, Ning Zhuo's lifelong skill in reading people, honed in the Immortal City of the Fire Persimmon Clan, allowed him to sense Lin Shanshan's subtle unease and suspicion.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled broadly, showing a slightly teasing grin, and gazed sincerely at Lin Shanshan.<br/>
<br/>
He slowly stood up, bowed deeply, and began to explain.<br/>
<br/>
"Miss Lin, I didn‚Äôt intentionally deceive you."<br/>
<br/>
"Look, this is the 'Oily Glide Talisman,' a gift from the Golden Core ancestor of my clan back home."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan averted her eyes immediately. "Young Master Ning, this is your trump card; how could you reveal it so easily to others?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo chuckled and stepped forward, grabbing Lin Shanshan's hand and placing the talisman in her palm.<br/>
<br/>
"Revealing it to you, Miss Lin, how could that be considered revealing it too easily?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan, startled by Ning Zhuo's sudden action, felt flustered and unsure of how to react.<br/>
<br/>
"Men and women should not casually touch; how can you act like this?!" she thought, feeling a mix of embarrassment and anger.<br/>
<br/>
But that feeling of embarrassment quickly overwhelmed her anger.<br/>
<br/>
With a sincere and urgent expression, Ning Zhuo continued, "I didn't mean to deceive you, Miss Lin. It's just that such talismans are meant for self-preservation. Revealing them would make others look down on me."<br/>
<br/>
"I am Ning Zhuo, from the Ning family of Immortal City of Fire Persimmon. My name and identity will not change! If people look down on me, I don‚Äôt mind. But if my actions cause others to look down on my family, that‚Äôs absolutely unacceptable!"<br/>
<br/>
These words, full of pride in his heritage, struck a chord with Lin Shanshan, the young mistress of the Myriad Medicine Sect.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued, "My name, Ning Zhuo, was given to me to remind me to remain humble. It‚Äôs a blessing and a reminder from my parents. So being arrogant and aggressive is not in my nature."<br/>
<br/>
"I often remind myself that these trump cards are just external tools and not my own strength. True power comes from within."<br/>
<br/>
"So, I act as if these trump cards don‚Äôt even exist!"<br/>
<br/>
"For example, this time‚Ä¶"<br/>
<br/>
"If I had relied on the Oily Glide Talisman, I wouldn‚Äôt have sought advice from you. Without your guidance, how could I have improved so much in close combat?"<br/>
<br/>
"You saw how I managed to hold my own for a while against Han Zhou in close combat. I couldn't have done that before."<br/>
<br/>
"That's all thanks to you, Miss Lin."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan quickly waved her hand. "Not at all, not at all. Young Master Ning has exceptional talent and is quick to learn. You trained hard and put your whole heart into it. I‚Äôm not some famous teacher; your progress is due to your own excellence."<br/>
<br/>
Her words were completely sincere, without exaggeration.<br/>
<br/>
She had personally witnessed Ning Zhuo‚Äôs diligence.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed emotionally, "Your help has been more than that."<br/>
<br/>
"The Fasting Pill helped me overcome hunger."<br/>
<br/>
"The Heartwarming Charm shielded me from the cold."<br/>
<br/>
"After the battle with Han Zhou, I truly realized how invaluable these were!"<br/>
<br/>
At the mention of the Heartwarming Charm, Lin Shanshan suddenly remembered her reason for coming to see Ning Zhuo: to ask for the charm back.<br/>
<br/>
She had only lent it to him, not given it. The Fasting Pill was one thing, but the Heartwarming Charm, though a small item, was still her personal belonging.<br/>
<br/>
She had acted impulsively and out of concern before. But over the past few days, rumors had spread through the sect, making her realize it was inappropriate to leave it with him. If the rumors were confirmed, they would be undeniable proof. It was better to ask for it back.<br/>
<br/>
Just as she was about to speak, Ning Zhuo said, "Miss Lin, look, this is a talisman from my clan. The Ning family excels at creating talismans. This talisman is imbued with its own spirit, so it activates automatically in times of crisis."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan‚Äôs attention shifted.<br/>
<br/>
Though she was a Foundation Establishment cultivator with Nascent Soul-level protections, she had little experience with Golden Core-level talismans, especially reusable ones like the Oily Glide Talisman.<br/>
<br/>
Her sect specialized in medicine, not talismans.<br/>
<br/>
She had seen many Golden Core-level pills, but not talismans with such self-activating properties.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan glanced at the talisman and then handed it back to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
She suppressed her curiosity, reminding herself that it was his trump card, and she shouldn‚Äôt look too closely.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo didn‚Äôt take it back. Instead, he said, "I learned long ago how to deal with people. How others treat me is how I respond to them. Miss Lin, though we‚Äôve only known each other a short time, you‚Äôve helped me so much, with such genuine sincerity. I must treat you with equal sincerity!"<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest, while the Ning family‚Äôs ancestor is only at the Golden Core stage, our family also has Nascent Soul-level strength."<br/>
<br/>
"I am fortunate to have the trust of my ancestor. I carry many trump cards like this one."<br/>
<br/>
"If it weren't for the fact that this talisman was personally given to me by the ancestor, what harm would there be in giving it to you now?"<br/>
<br/>
Hearing "personally given," Lin Shanshan‚Äôs heart skipped a beat, and her fingers instinctively tightened around the talisman, as if feeling Ning Zhuo‚Äôs warmth through it.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan, with a serious expression, stood up. "Young Master Ning, you must be joking! A Golden Core-level talisman is such a precious item; how could it be casually given away?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo responded with equal seriousness, "Miss Lin, you're mistaken!"<br/>
<br/>
"While talismans are good, they are still just external tools."<br/>
<br/>
"Such 'good things' are only valuable because our cultivation is still weak. Once we reach the Golden Core stage ourselves, won't our perception of these talismans change?"<br/>
<br/>
"True strength comes from within! As cultivators, we must use external tools to strengthen ourselves."<br/>
<br/>
"So, while I value these talismans, I don‚Äôt place undue importance on them."<br/>
<br/>
"I, Ning Zhuo, value people most and prioritize relationships."<br/>
<br/>
"Miss Lin, you have been so kind-hearted, offering me the Heartwarming Charm and Fasting Pill, and helping me train. How could I not repay you?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed softly, a look of regret on his face. "Unfortunately, I cannot give you this Oily Glide Talisman, as it was a personal gift from my ancestor. When I return to my family, I will need to ask for permission and hope to secure another talisman for you."<br/>
<br/>
"But I promise, Miss Lin, in the future I will give you a talisman in return as a token of my gratitude."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan opened her mouth but couldn‚Äôt find the words to speak.<br/>
<br/>
She was completely at a loss for words.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at Ning Zhuo‚Äôs sincere and grateful face, how could she possibly bring up the topic of asking for the jade pendant back?<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, if there‚Äôs anyone to blame, it‚Äôs myself for not being clear from the beginning, leading to a misunderstanding."<br/>
<br/>
"In fact, at the time, I did have the intention of giving it as a gift, but the recent rumors have made me realize the implications of my actions."<br/>
