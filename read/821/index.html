<paragraph index="1">In the great hall, every move Ning Zhuo made drew the attention of the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Every time the Hall Master holds a meeting, he races against time. But with Ning Zhuo, he shows absolute patience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"This lad took first place again, living up to Hall Master Zhong's high hopes. Receiving such treatment isn't out of line, is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"A young hero indeed! At his age, I was still walking dogs and teasing birds. Thinking back, I am truly ashamed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"But Hall Master Zhong publicly promised that as long as Ning Zhuo achieves three Class-A major merits in the future, he can win the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone]. Isn't that a bit excessive?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The cultivators communicated secretly via divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo's ears still rang with Zhong Dao's recent words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"As long as I save this reward for taking first place in the second trial and accumulate more in the future, I can obtain the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone]?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The big-headed youth couldn't help but recall the glorious scene where he had once used the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] to unleash a vast amount of awe-inspiring righteousness qi that shook the mountain gates...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"No, that is not the best choice." Ning Zhuo maintained an icy calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He had decided to use this reward immediately!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"I specialize in mechanical arts; my entire Dao path lies therein. Even if I rely on the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] to emit oceans of righteous qi, it would only be icing on the cake - like adding wings to a tiger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"It is not a qualitative change!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Taking first place in this second trial was within everyone's expectations. But this situation is actually disadvantageous to me. Right now, I should maintain some distance from the Demon Subjugation Hall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It was practically a foregone conclusion that Ning Zhuo would use the opportunity of the Flying Cloud Assembly to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But he needed to find the most suitable entry point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Was the Demon Subjugation Hall the most suitable?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"On one hand, the Demon Subjugation Hall is one of the Eight Peaks and Twelve Halls of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. It is a solid institution with real power and immense strength. The current Hall Master, Zhong Dao, even surpasses some of the Peak Masters of the Eight Peaks in terms of aptitude, combat power, and prestige."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"But on the other hand, the Demon Subjugation Hall is the sharpest blade of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. It has too many hostile cultivators, and its strained relationships are as numerous as the stars."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Everything had two sides; the option of joining the Demon Subjugation Hall had both pros and cons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo had managed his reputation in the Righteous Path very well, and he was highly valued by Zhong Dao. But Zhong Dao himself was quite domineering. While being the object of his special expectations, Ning Zhuo would inevitably lose a lot of freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">At the same time, joining the Demon Subjugation Hall meant inheriting the strained interpersonal relationships of the Hall, and even Zhong Dao himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This gave Ning Zhuo considerable hidden worries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">" Although currently, the Demon Subjugation Hall is the best choice for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"But... that is only currently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"This is just the Minor Cloud Trial; the main body of the Flying Cloud Assembly hasn't even taken place yet. Why must I make a decision now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">It was not yet time for Ning Zhuo to truly decide!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The big-headed youth preferred to reserve more possibilities, which meant he would hold the initiative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Zhong Dao's thoughts on this matter mirrored Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Therefore, Zhong Dao deliberately offered the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] as a reward. Upon closer inspection, it was full of intent to lure Ning Zhuo in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">If Ning Zhuo agreed to this and temporarily gave up the reward for the second trial's first place, he would be seeking the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone]. And according to Zhong Dao's conditions, Ning Zhuo would have to establish three Class-A major merits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">How did one establish merit?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Only by joining the Demon Subjugation Hall would the merits count.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Therefore, as long as I do not resist the temptation of the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] and give up this first-place reward, it will undoubtedly be a public announcement - that I have decided to join the Demon Subjugation Hall!" Ning Zhuo was well-versed in the methods of the Righteous Path, and his mind was clear as snow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">And once he did that, his losses would be immeasurable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">If nothing else, the doors to the many upcoming Minor Cloud Tests would immediately close to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Why would I sponsor a cultivator who is confirmed to be joining another faction within the sect?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">From Zhong Dao down, the cultivators of the entire Demon Subjugation Hall were aggressive in their actions, which inevitably caused tension. Thus, beneath the glory of the Demon Subjugation Hall, there were absolutely no small number of cultivators who secretly feared it, set traps for it, or harbored hidden hostility and schemes against it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Taking a side too early was problematic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Waiting for the highest bid is my optimal choice!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In just a few breaths, Ning Zhuo completely eliminated the temptation of the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone]. His divine sense swept through the jade slip list in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The inventory list of the Demon Subjugation Hall was filled with a dazzling array of rare treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo saw five or six types of fire seeds that were rare on the outside just in his first sweep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Suddenly, his heart shook, and his divine sense froze on a specific spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">A demon cultivator whose true form was a ten-thousand-year-old jujube tree. It swallowed and spat the essence of the sun and moon, bearing a tree full of Fire Jujubes like red jade. However, it ultimately failed to cross that threshold. When the lightning tribulation fell, its thousand-year Dao fruit turned into a pile of tribulation ash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Within the tribulation ash, only a single Fire Jujube remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The jujube pit contained a wisp of vitality. As long as it was planted and cultivated, the Fire Jade Jujube Tree could be reborn and begin its cultivation anew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But the cultivator who obtained the Fire Jujube did not do this. Instead, using unique methods and the remaining Fire Jujube as the main material, they exhausted it to extract the vitality as fuel, causing a qualitative change. It transformed into a special case that was rare even among fire seeds-</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Post-Calamity Survival Fire!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">This fire seed contained the two forces of "Calamity" and "Life," coexisting in incomparable harmony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Using this fire for artifact refining would make the magic treasure adept at resisting tribulation, naturally increasing the cultivator's success rate in transcending tribulation. This point alone was of immense value!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Using this fire to refine medicinal pills was specifically targeted at those with heavy injuries near death, virtually hopeless cases, helping them hang onto their lives and radiate new vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">It should be known that the fire seed Ning Zhuo had obtained previously had already been exhausted during the battle against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. His recent artifact refining had been done using fire seeds rented from the Artifact Refining Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"This Post-Calamity Survival Fire seed is a hundred times more precious and rare than the fire seed I lost!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"What other good things are further down?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">His divine sense continued to browse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After just a few breaths, he paused again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Buzhou Mountain Stone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">This was only a piece the size of a thumb, yet it weighed three jin and seven liang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"According to the classics, Mount Buzhou was the pillar of the heavens in the immemorial era. This mountain stood between heaven and earth, containing the momentum to support the sky. Even shattered, it does not fall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Although Mount Buzhou collapsed, every piece of its stone will never weather or wear down. The larger the fragment of the mountain stone, the closer it is to the original, and the stronger the gravity it possesses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Therefore, Buzhou Mountain Stone was the best suppression artifact. Used in a formation, it would produce a completely different qualitative change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Moving Thought Wind!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This was a wisp of strange wind sealed in a purple crystal bottle, looking like a transparent silk ribbon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">It seemed insignificant, but in reality, as long as a cultivator filled it with thoughts, it could continuously derive more, becoming truly inexhaustible!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">If blown out, all living things would have thoughts arise in their minds. If there were no means to suppress it, the thoughts would become extremely complex, overwhelming the divine sea and reducing the victim to madness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Three Lights Fleeting Water!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Powerful cultivators had spent a hundred years setting up grand formations at three polar regions to collect the fading light of the sun, moon, and stars. That is: the light when the sun is about to set but hasn't set, the moon is about to rise but hasn't risen, and the stars are about to appear but haven't appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The Three Lights Fleeting Water contained the secrets of time. Used in alchemy, it could greatly increase the preservation limit. Used in painting, it could capture the spirit, strength, and even the thoughts possessed during life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Supreme Emotionless Path - Fragment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The signature cultivation method of the ancient Emotionless Sect. Cultivated to great success, one severs the seven emotions and six desires, viewing heaven and earth as white paper and all living things as straw dogs. The cultivatable portion in the fragment: stops at the "Forgetting Objects" stage. One who forgets objects has no excess possessions outside the body and no hindrances in the heart. When achieved, one holds weapons without greed, encounters danger without fear, and sees treasure without joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Nine Nether Soul-Tempering Paste!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Gathered from a place where the Nine Yins converge, taking thousands of yin souls, ice-refined for twelve years, and cold-tempered for thirty-six years, finally obtaining the essence condensed into a paste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Small Reincarnation Formation Plate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">A formation plate of the immemorial Reincarnation Sect, about seven inches in diameter. The face is engraved with the outline of the Six Paths, with blurred reincarnation patterns. Used once, the patterns on the plate fade a bit. When the patterns are gone, the plate is useless. Used seventy-three times; remaining patterns allow for about twenty-seven uses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">According to records, past cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall used this to lay formations, overcoming strong enemies across multiple major realms. There was once a Nascent Soul-level Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator who used this formation plate to inflict light injuries on a Void Refinement-level mighty figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Rebirth Resurrection Scroll - Incomplete.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">This is a Soul Formation-level calligraphy scroll. By writing the deceased's name, birth date, date of death, and other information on this scroll, one can call the departed soul back from the underworld to briefly resurrect them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Demon Subjugation Hall cultivators used this to call back sect seniors to slay strong enemies. They even summoned certain deities!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo's horizons were greatly broadened!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"This is just the Demon Subjugation Hall - no, just one part of the Demon Subjugation Hall's treasury."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Treasures like the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] couldn't possibly be on this list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Just how profound is the foundation of the Myriad Manifestations Sect?" Ning Zhuo exclaimed repeatedly in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Wait, what is this?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">When he saw the final section of the list, his body suddenly shook, and his pupils constricted slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He saw an item that immediately seized his attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I didn't expect the Demon Subjugation Hall's treasury to actually contain a cultivation method from that mighty figure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Choose it, I must choose it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo barely suppressed this intense impulse, his divine sense sweeping through the remainder of the list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Soon after, he slowly opened his eyes and looked up at Zhong Dao: "Lord Hall Master, I have selected an item from the list."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">As soon as these words came out, the cultivators in the hall were surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">In the view of most people, if it were up to them, they definitely wouldn't be tempted by immediate benefits and would choose the long-term goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"How can Ning Zhuo be so short-sighted?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"If I had his talent and flair, what would three Class-A major merits be? Give me enough time, and I could definitely complete them!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Ning Zhuo made a mistake. That is the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone]. This was a promise made by the Hall Master in a moment of excitement; if he doesn't seize this opportunity, it will be gone! The [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] is not for sale; wanting to make it one's private possession in the future will be too difficult!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">There were also a few who seemed lost in thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zhong Dao stared at Ning Zhuo, a sharp light flashing in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">However, Ning Zhuo's gaze did not dodge in the slightest; he looked straight at Zhong Dao, calm and confident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This attitude made Zhong Dao let out a laugh: "What did you choose?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo responded immediately, but used divine sense transmission: "This junior specializes in mechanism arts, and paper effigy arts share many similarities with mechanism arts. Today, I saw the legacy work of the mighty figure, the Grand Primordial Scholar. This junior could not bear the thirst for learning and had to brazenly ask for it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Grand Primordial Scholar, paper effigy arts..." Zhong Dao's eyes flickered, and a subtle feeling rose in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Some time ago, during the Eight Peaks meeting, he was summoned into the formation for a detailed discussion involving the White Paper Immortal City, which was precisely the handiwork of the Grand Primordial Scholar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Currently, the sect's progress on this matter remains slow, with difficulties in negotiation between parties."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"One of the key figures, Wen Ruanyu, is a pillar of the Confucian cultivator community. Ning Zhuo has a good relationship with the Confucian cultivators; did he understand their hints and take an interest in the Grand Primordial Scholar?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Zhong Dao was not clear about the relationship between Ning Zhuo, Meng Yaoyin, and the White Paper Immortal City, so he could only temporarily think to this level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He had no reason to stop him, so he agreed on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo's reward for taking first place in the Demon Subjugation Hall's second trial was a classic recording a cultivation art, titled Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">This classic was war booty obtained by cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall after successfully hunting down a powerful demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Just the title of the book made Ning Zhuo immediately think of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">This precious ruler had given Ning Zhuo tremendous help in the battle against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. It could be said that without the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, Ning Zhuo could not have made it to the end, nor would he have had any chance to defeat the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">But Ning Zhuo's control over the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale relied solely on his identity as Vice City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"The names Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture and Great Primordial Dispersal Scale are very similar."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"The two come from the same source."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Perhaps I can find a way to refine the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale by comprehending the Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Even if I can't succeed, relying on the Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture, I should be able to gain a lot of understanding regarding the White Paper Immortal City!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Ghostly Black Marshlands and the White Paper Immortal City held immense weight in Ning Zhuo's heart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Because the various opportunities he had accumulated already made him quite certain: the White Paper Immortal City was his place of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The big-headed youth and Sun Lingtong had long reached a consensus - in the future, they would focus their operations there! And if Ning Zhuo could control the White Paper Immortal City, that would be even better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo left the Demon Subjugation Hall with the Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture, and news of him taking first place in the Demon Subjugation Hall's second trial spread rapidly within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Ning Zhuo took first place?" The public was not surprised at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"He had absolutely no competitive pressure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Even Golden Core cultivators like Gu Huaijiu and Lu Xu'an aren't Ning Zhuo's match?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Even if the specifications of the Demon Subjugation Hall's second trial were raised, the purpose wouldn't change. Therefore, cultivation level is not the key."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Zhong Dao personally distributed the reward to Ning Zhuo; this has never happened in previous sessions. Ning Zhuo joining the Demon Subjugation Hall is practically set in stone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"I'm so envious of Ning Zhuo! With him joining the Demon Subjugation Hall, his future is bright and splendid!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"This is a win-win. A hundred years from now, when Ning Zhuo has grown, he will inevitably be a capable general of the Demon Subjugation Hall. Having such a rising star of the Righteous Path join, the entire Demon Subjugation Hall should be very pleased."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Chen San collected these public opinions and reported them to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Inside the azure stone cave dwelling, Ning Zhuo held this intelligence report and sighed in his heart: "Sure enough, everyone has started to see me this way. This is not good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">His thoughts turned, and he immediately issued new orders to Chen San. He didn't propagate falsehoods, but simply had Ning Zhuo's experience in the great hall circulated truthfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo did not temporarily give up the second trial's top prize, disregarding the possibility of obtaining the [White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone] in the future, all for short-term gain... He believed that once the public received this intelligence, there would certainly be more reactions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo looked forward to these reactions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Of course, he looked forward to the Grand Primordial Form-Cutting Scripture even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">So, after giving instructions to Chen San, he couldn't wait to open the classic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Hmm? It is indeed boring..."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
