<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 630: Colossus Ning Zhuo</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"I feel completely empowered!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed, his heart racing with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This marked his first official attempt at controlling the Paper Giant. After reaching an agreement with the White Paper Immortal City Lord, the colossal figure had become his property. Following the transaction, the White Paper City Lord had instructed him in the methods of its operation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In the days since, Ning Zhuo had secretly practiced a few times, though his attempts had been cautious and brief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">When crisis erupted at the South City Gate, Ning Zhuo rushed to the scene. Instead of joining the battle immediately, he dove into the Paper Giant and activated it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">As the mechanism engaged, Ning Zhuo felt as if he were inflating a balloon. Within moments, he had grown to colossal proportions, his body now encased in a layer of paper armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">At first, he could still perceive the difference between his flesh and the paper construct. But soon, this distinction vanished entirely, merging his consciousness completely with the Paper Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo's spirit soared to unprecedented heights. His soul and physical body receded from awareness, leaving only the sensation of being the Paper Giant itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">From the outside, the Paper Giant appeared to have transformed rapidly after kicking away the Golden Core Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Its face turned green with fangs, taking on a ghostly appearance. Yin Qi, dark as ink, surged from its white paper body. The malevolent energy solidified into a layer of black iron armor, fully arming the Paper Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo's kick had sent the Golden Core Ghost General flying like a man would send a mouse scurrying. Seizing the momentum, he took a giant step forward and brought his foot down with devastating force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Thud!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The power of his kick carved a deep footprint into the White Paper Immortal City's paving stones. The resulting shockwave swept the Scarlet Ghost General away like a gust of wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Scarlet Ghost General shuddered, staring at the cratered footprint. "If that had hit me, I'd be critically injured and near death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Yang Sanyan's divine sense reached out to Ning Zhuo. "Ning Zhuo! Don't recklessly pursue them. Leave the Golden Core Ghost Generals to me! You should focus on the main threat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Understood," Ning Zhuo replied without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">His previous flying kick had indeed struck the Long Axe Ghost General, but it had been a lucky strike catching the enemy off guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">When truly attacking, the Paper Giant's power was astonishing, but its speed was slow, making each move easily predictable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Thus, the Scarlet Ghost General effortlessly evaded the subsequent stomping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Dealing with these small fry is indeed quite inconvenient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Unfortunately, the Paper Giant truly lacks such capabilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Having experienced the war against the Two Note Kingdom, Ning Zhuo naturally possessed sufficient combat expertise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He knew Yang Sanyan's words were entirely correct. Without hesitation, he abandoned the pursuit of the Ghost Generals and charged toward the Dead Bone Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Colossus Ning Zhuo ran, each footstep carving deep pits into the ground tiles and sending tremors through the earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">With another deafening crash, Ning Zhuo slammed into the Dead Bone Giant, knocking it to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The buildings beneath the two colossal figures were instantly crushed and flattened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Tie Guzheng's eyelids twitched violently as he urgently transmitted through divine sense: "Don't fight here! Move away from the city gate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Colossus Ning Zhuo rose first, followed closely by the Dead Bone Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The latter swung its massive arm in a sweeping arc, aiming a punch from left to right at Ning Zhuo's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Colossus Ning Zhuo ducked to avoid the counterattack, then seized the Dead Bone Giant and executed a perfect shoulder throw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Thud!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Dead Bone Giant crashed to the ground with a deafening impact, sending up a cloud of dust. A dozen more buildings collapsed, their paper walls disintegrating into a flurry of debris.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo was about to press his advantage when a sudden shout of warning rang out: "Look out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">A blast of wind struck from behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Instinctively, Ning Zhuo crouched and rolled, narrowly avoiding the heavy strike aimed at his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">It was a second Dead Bone Giant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The creature's fist, as massive as a siege hammer, swept through the air and smashed into a three-story paper building that hadn't yet fully collapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The paper structure exploded like a detonated barrel of gunpowder. It violently deformed, expanded, then collapsed in a thunderous explosion, disintegrating into countless fragments of paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">These debris hurtled outward like a meteor shower, smashing into distant low-lying houses and causing secondary destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo rolled across the ground for some distance before crouching down, turning to look back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Seeing the two Dead Bone Giants standing together, he felt his heart sink. "How am I supposed to fight these?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His gaze instinctively shifted to another direction, focusing on the Ghost Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">It was Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was still maintaining her Return to Silence Path Candle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The candle was burning fiercely, already reduced by twenty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"We must eliminate her!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Otherwise, more Dead Bone Giants will keep appearing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo's gaze swept across the battlefield. Yang Sanyan and the Bone Tomb Daoist were locked in intense combat with Golden Core Ghost Generals, unable to break through for the moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo resolved to take action himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">But as he rose, two Dead Bone Giants immediately surrounded him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Three colossal figures clashed in brutal close combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Even with their increased size, they're still cumbersome!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Lacking practical combat experience, Ning Zhuo found himself initially overwhelmed by the two Dead Bone Giants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Turn, punch, retreat, dodge, counter-force... Though outnumbered, Ning Zhuo swiftly gained control and took the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Though the Dead Bone Giants possessed formidable strength and deep defenses, their intelligence was limited - they lacked even basic martial skills. This deficiency gave Ning Zhuo numerous advantages in close combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The good times didn't last. The third Dead Bone Giant's arrival completely changed the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Colossus Ning Zhuo began retreating under pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He withdrew into a cluster of buildings, each step crushing a civilian dwelling beneath his feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Time to activate martial arts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Paper Giant contained hidden capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Martial Art - Long-Arm Python Constriction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Colossus Ning Zhuo's arms suddenly elongated, attacking in unison like two living, pale serpents!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The serpent-like arms directly ensnared the Dead Bone Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Crunch... Crunch...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Dead Bone Giant's body was forcibly torn apart, the cracking sounds merging into a continuous cacophony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">To Ning Zhuo, it felt like he was snapping dry wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Under the Colossus Ning Zhuo's strength, the Dead Bone Giant's bones truly shattered like decaying branches!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The upper body of one Dead Bone Giant was reduced to nothing but its spine and head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Just as it was about to be completely destroyed, the remaining two Dead Bone Giants reacted. Their bodies erupted with bone spurs, completely enveloping the Colossus Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Many sharp, thick bone spurs pierced through the armor, deeply stabbing into the Colossus Ning Zhuo's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Intense pain immediately shot through him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo let out a muffled groan but stubbornly maintained the Long-Arm Python Constriction Martial Art. After finally severing one Dead Bone Giant, he pushed with both palms, coordinating his legs to kick backward, creating distance between himself and the two remaining Dead Bone Giants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The Colossus Ning Zhuo's armor and body were now riddled with numerous holes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Two Golden Core Ghost Generals seized the opportunity, slipping through the large openings to enter the Paper Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo detected this, feeling both shock and anger. "What's happening? What is Yang Sanyan doing? He failed to block these Ghost Generals?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo had always recognized and looked forward to Yang Sanyan's combat prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Yet at this critical moment, he'd dropped the ball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">When Ning Zhuo's gaze swept across the battlefield and landed on Yang Sanyan, his heart sank. He immediately understood the man's predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Blood trickled from the corner of Yang Sanyan's mouth, his chest caved in where a deep rod imprint marred his flesh. His eyes locked onto the enemy who'd ambushed him. "What do you Soul Devouring Sect want?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The attacker was none other than Bone Tomb Daoist, a Golden Core True Disciple from the Soul Devouring Sect. He caressed his bone staff with deliberate calm. "The Soul Devouring Sect wants more, of course."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Yet the White Paper City Lord values her independence above all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Even if we offered better terms, she'd still refuse to abandon the Myriad Manifestations Sect and elevate us as the foremost power here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Given that, our alliance with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord becomes both reasonable and necessary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The City Lord's plea for aid had inadvertently invited wolves into the fold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Yang Sanyan's voice cut through the chaos. "The Myriad Manifestations Sect has poured our blood and sweat into this White Paper Immortal City. Our position as the foremost sect is rightfully earned!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Bone Tomb Daoist, you'll pay for this mistake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Yang Sanyan and Bone Tomb Daoist clashed in a deadly dance, their battle becoming an unbreakable stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">This left Ning Zhuo in a precarious position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">His energy was barely enough to control the Paper Giant and fend off the two Dead Bone Giants outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">As a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, it was already remarkable that he could activate and manipulate a Nascent Soul-level Paper Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">At that moment, Ning Zhuo had no strength left to deal with enemies who had infiltrated the giant's body, let alone interfere with Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">So long as Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer remained, she would continue to teleport more Dead Bone Giants!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Time was on the Underworld Army's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo rolled on the ground, narrowly avoiding the Dead Bone Giants' pincer attack. At the same time, he used this movement to shake off the other Golden Core Ghost Generals trying to burrow in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">As he rolled, all buildings in his path were flattened and exploded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Bang! Bang! Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The two Dead Bone Giants pursued relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo tried to stand up, but his knees suddenly gave way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The Long Axe Ghost General had reached his knees and destroyed most of the Formation nodes inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Bad!" Ning Zhuo's fusion with the Paper Giant was broken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He suddenly felt utterly burdened, each movement carrying the weight of a mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Meanwhile, another Ghost General advanced along his left arm toward his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">As it progressed, the armor on Ning Zhuo's left arm rapidly deteriorated, showing signs of imminent collapse and disintegration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">A tearing pain erupted from Ning Zhuo's left arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Dead Bone Giant's massive strike knocked Ning Zhuo to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The heavy impact struck at his very soul, causing intense agony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He could only curl up, focusing all his energy on defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Thud, thud, thud...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The Dead Bone Giant's relentless attacks battered Ning Zhuo's soul like a hammer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">In an instant, Ning Zhuo's ears rang with a continuous hum, his vision darkened at the edges, and crimson specks of light began dancing at the periphery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">He found himself besieged by internal and external threats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Even if he wanted to disengage now, he'd have to sever the tight connection between himself and the Paper Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Any careless separation would trigger a terrifying backlash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Great Tribulation Sacrifice Altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The Void Return Black Sphere of the Soundless Ghost Monk clashed against the Myriad Souls Torrent of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord in a desperate struggle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The Silent Nirvana Zen Sound emanating from the monk threatened to annihilate the Prefecture Lord's forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord made his decision!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">He formed hand seals and shifted his offensive strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The waters of the Forgetful River surged forth, transforming into multiple Profound Nether Water Dragons!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">These monstrous serpents roared with terrifying force, forged from thousands of tons of river water, boundless yin qi, colossal spiritual energy, and countless Wailing Souls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Carrying a miasma of Death Qi, they circled around the Void Return Black Sphere and lunged at the Soundless Ghost Monk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The Soundless Ghost Monk had been ruthlessly slaughtering the Prefecture Lord's forces. Now facing the encroaching water dragons, his murky eyes finally showed emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">A single dragon could tear apart ordinary Body cultivators, yet seven now surrounded him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The Soundless Ghost Monk unleashed his Lifebound Treasure - a Buddhist Wheel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The Buddhist Wheel ascended, radiating a terrifying aura that amplified the monk's own power to its zenith!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Spinning rapidly, the wheel's Buddhist Light carved out a battlefield, warping space to form an enormous, indistinct image of a Withered Silent Buddha that stretched from heaven to earth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The Nirvana Buddha!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The seven Profound Nether Water Dragons were halted in their charge, unable to advance a single inch against the Buddha's presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's face paled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">He knew they had reached the critical moment of their confrontation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">He couldn't retreat, nor could he afford to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">At this critical moment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord summoned the Lord of Forgetful River Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The seal was entirely pitch-black, neither metal nor jade, its ancient and solemn design exuding authority. Its seal ring bore a coiled netherworld dragon, while four sides of the seal were engraved with countless flowing netherworld runes - the supreme symbol of power ruling the Forgetful River Underworld and controlling the Forgetful River River - the Lord of Fogetful River Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">This was a national treasure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The Prefecture Lord poured his entire lifetime's cultivation into the seal and hurled it at the Buddha's phantom form!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">The national treasure struck the Buddha's phantom head-on, causing it to abruptly shrink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The national treasure hovered in mid-air, suppressing the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The seven Profound Nether Water Dragons regained their might, climbing up the Buddha's phantom and entangling it tightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The water dragons emitted dragon cries, their forces resonating in harmony. Finally, their heads and tails connected, forming a lock that sealed the Buddha's phantom layer by layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">The Lord of Forgetful River Seal was also enveloped within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Ultimately, a massive silver-gray sphere formed. Its surface bore raised carvings of seven Profound Nether Water Dragons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The Soundless Ghost Monk gazed steadily at the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. His tattered monk robes billowed without wind, his emaciated body becoming translucent and fading like a mirage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Finally, he took a step back. The space beneath his feet rippled like water, and his figure merged into the dark void, vanishing completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">"Decisive, if nothing else," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord snorted coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Though victorious and having sealed the enemy's Lifebound Buddha Wheel, his mood remained heavy. The reason lay in his own Lord's Seal, which had been forced inside alongside the enemy's artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Without this sacrifice, how could he have suppressed the enemy's Nirvana Buddha Wheel?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">"This might be a deliberate scheme to further weaken my combat strength!" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord detected the stench of conspiracy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Yet he had no choice but to adapt to each forced move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">His losses extended beyond the Lord's Seal. Three of his five Nascent Soul cultivators had fallen, and sixty percent of his thirty thousand Imperial Guards had perished in the annihilation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">"Go," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord commanded with a light shout. His palms pushed forward, channeling the Forgetful River Soul Stream to propel both the Void Return Black Sphere and Profound Nether Silver Orb away from the sacrificial altar, where they vanished into the thick layers of dark clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">"Go!" Within the Paper Giant, Ning Zhuo found himself compelled to produce his Mechanical Puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Faced with the enemy's ferocity, he prudently unleashed his most formidable forces:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Netherworld Envoy - Qi Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">The Buddha Physician materialized, scythe in hand. As soon as she appeared, her expression shifted, and she unexpectedly raised her head to survey the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">Ning Zhuo: "Mother?!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
