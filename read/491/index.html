Wooden Wheel Town.<br/>
<br/>
When Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning received the military order, they all felt shocked.<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan was at the Soul Formation level and was the commander-in-chief of Twin Rivers Country’s expedition against Qian Fenglin this time. Yet he had unexpectedly been ambushed and seriously wounded.<br/>
<br/>
The key point was that Young Master Sheng Xu was only at the Nascent Soul stage, yet he had managed to stab Du Tiechuan. If this fact were disclosed, many people would probably think it was fake news.<br/>
<br/>
The further cultivators went on their path, the more difficult it became to fight across levels. Although it looked like just a one-level difference, in reality, it could be worlds apart.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, at the Foundation Establishment stage, had once fought those at the Golden Core. Young Master Sheng Xu, at the Nascent Soul stage, fought someone at the Soul Formation level. The latter was countless times more difficult, as well as countless times rarer.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei did not understand and said, “He’s the grand commander at the Soul Formation level. What the hell was he doing? How could he be so careless?!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er sighed. “Although Young Master Sheng Xu is quite surreal by name, he’s on the Young Masters List and is known to the world for assassination. It’s not surprising he managed this.”<br/>
<br/>
The Young Masters List!<br/>
<br/>
This was a rather famous list that recorded universally recognized outstanding young male cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
It basically encompassed the entire cultivation world, covering almost all cultivation nations.<br/>
<br/>
Sheng Xu was on that list, and the title of ‘Young Master’ carried a great deal of weight!<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong nodded in agreement. “Yes, Young Master Sheng Xu has fought those at the Soul Formation level before, so it’s not his first time.”<br/>
<br/>
“Although Du Tiechuan is at the Soul Formation level, we still have to see whether that’s his real body or a separated spirit.”<br/>
<br/>
When a cultivator reached the Soul Formation stage, their Nascent Soul would develop into a Nascent Spirit. As that Nascent Spirit’s cultivation continued to accumulate, it could split off a portion into a second Nascent Spirit or even a third one.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong suspected that the Du Tiechuan who was stationed at the main camp and was wounded at the moment could be the real body or could be a separated spirit.<br/>
<br/>
That night, alarm bells rang through the long hours, and the entire army did not sleep.<br/>
<br/>
All stood on full alert until daybreak. Countless scattered scouts came back to report that there was no sign of any large enemy force.<br/>
<br/>
Only then did the troops finally relax.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the order for the entire army to be on alert was the correct one, intended to guard against Young Master Sheng Xu’s assassination, followed by a surprise attack by Qian Fenglin’s army.<br/>
<br/>
But as of now, reality suggested that Qian Fenglin’s side likely had no ability to quietly sneak into Wooden Wheel Town with a large force.<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps they only hired Young Master Sheng Xu to attempt an assassination, and from the start, they never had high expectations?<br/>
<br/>
No matter what, Young Master Sheng Xu, the Young Masters List, and so on became the most frequently discussed topics throughout the army that day.<br/>
<br/>
By afternoon, another piece of bad news arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Twin Rivers Country’s vanguard force, which was stationed at the frontmost position close to Qian Fenglin’s Tianzhu Giantwood Mountain, was suddenly surrounded by massive amounts of poisonous miasma. On the night Young Master Sheng Xu carried out the assassination, Qian Fenglin deployed powerful cultivators, set up an altar for sacrifice, and generated huge amounts of noxious fog, completely trapping the vanguard.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that pitch-black poisonous fog isolated the inside from the outside and had sealed the vanguard camp so tightly that not even water could get through.<br/>
<br/>
“The vanguard has become a lone army; perhaps they are being besieged at this moment!”<br/>
<br/>
“We must send reinforcements as soon as possible to rescue them.”<br/>
<br/>
“But the commander-in-chief is seriously injured. Right now, we should keep our forces still and focus on proper recovery.”<br/>
<br/>
The troops argued among themselves. The general opinion was split into two factions, and the debate raged on, shaking morale.<br/>
<br/>
At noon, Du Tiechuan issued a military order—<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion, the Barbarian-Demon Battalion, the Red Flower Battalion, and the Golden Halberd Army would each take a different route to launch an offensive against Qian Fenglin!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the other forces would remain stationed at Wooden Wheel Town and would not move.<br/>
<br/>
Upon receiving these orders, Liu Er then discussed them with Zhang Hei, Guan Hong, and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei felt excited about the upcoming battle.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong was filled with fighting spirit but also showed concern. “Usually, one would launch a big battle between both sides first, then split the troops to proceed with multi-pronged attacks.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cut straight to the point, saying, “Du Tiechuan wants to avoid going into battle while wounded. Both Twin Rivers Country and Qian Fenglin have cultivators at the Soul Formation level.”<br/>
<br/>
“On Qian Fenglin’s side is the Dragon King Canshu.”<br/>
<br/>
“On our side, we have Commander Du Tiechuan.”<br/>
<br/>
“If a Soul Formation-level clash ended in an easy defeat for one side, that side’s entire military might would soon collapse and fall apart.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hence, Commander Du must act very cautiously.”<br/>
<br/>
“The pressing issue now is that the vanguard is shrouded in the poisonous miasma, making the actual situation difficult to ascertain.”<br/>
<br/>
“Qian Fenglin’s sudden move to create this situation could indeed be in order to surround and kill the vanguard, but it could also be a setup. They might be laying an ambush there, luring Twin Rivers Country’s entire army in.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo analyzed up to this point and rubbed his chin. “In that sense, Young Master Sheng Xu’s assassination of the commander and the encirclement of the vanguard might be coordinated elements of a plan.”<br/>
<br/>
“This could just be a small part of their overall strategy. Perhaps even more is hidden in and around the vanguard’s poisonous miasma.”<br/>
<br/>
“Du Tiechuan doesn’t want to rashly mobilize the entire army, because that would very likely be falling into the enemy’s trap.”<br/>
<br/>
“Still, he wants to probe the truth.”<br/>
<br/>
“He must have already sent out elite scouts to investigate what’s really going on inside that poisonous miasma.”<br/>
<br/>
“At the same time, he ordered our four units to head out precisely because he wants to use this approach to test Qian Fenglin’s troop deployment.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
They all agreed with Ning Zhuo’s analysis.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion had been formed not long ago. Even though it was trained day and night, in terms of overall combat strength, it was still at the bottom tier.<br/>
<br/>
By dispatching the Three Generals Battalion, to put it more bluntly, Du Tiechuan was treating them as cannon fodder.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang had already realized this. They were independent cultivators who had pledged allegiance and built up their own forces, so it was entirely normal for them to be placed in such a situation.<br/>
<br/>
What Zhang Hei did not understand was, “Why were the Red Flower Battalion and the Golden Halberd Army also assigned to this operation?”<br/>
<br/>
Everyone could understand that the Barbarian-Demon Battalion was in a position similar to the Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered. “The Red Flower Battalion does stem from Grand Marshal Mu’s military household, and even though their previous difficulties were resolved, the power blocs in the country still haven’t let them go.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for the Golden Halberd Army, it’s simply been dragged down by Sun Gan.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan, the commander of the imperial guard, had previously tried to encroach upon Grand Marshal Mu’s territory, aiming to pick the fruit first.<br/>
<br/>
He led the imperial guard, yet he wanted to jump to someone else’s side, which made the king displeased.<br/>
<br/>
So, this time he was being squeezed out and turned into a pawn for probing the enemy’s deployment.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought a bit more and added, “Among our four forces, there will definitely be distinctions.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I were to guess, of the four marching routes, Sun Gan’s Golden Halberd Army would end up facing the hardest battles, while ours—the Three Generals Battalion—would be second-hardest. The Red Flower Battalion would rank third, and ironically, the Barbarian-Demon Battalion would have the easiest route.”<br/>
<br/>
From this, Ning Zhuo inferred the changes inside Twin Rivers Country’s royal court. “Traitors are the most detestable. Sun Gan’s disloyalty infuriated the king.”<br/>
<br/>
“We from the Three Generals Battalion earned a lot of merit from the ambush in the previous battle and got too much attention. Many people at court want to suppress us.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Red Flower Battalion is in third place, which reveals that plenty of people still haven’t given up on Grand Marshal Mu’s military household.”<br/>
<br/>
“That the Barbarian-Demon Battalion, usually the classic cannon-fodder unit, actually received the best treatment is a mockery of sorts. The king of Twin Rivers Country doesn’t really have much breadth of mind, does he?”<br/>
<br/>
The three generals had no comment, but they all wore expressions of agreement.<br/>
<br/>
The orders were delivered at noon that day.<br/>
<br/>
After a hurried midday meal, the four units broke camp and moved out.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan specifically summoned Ning Zhuo to a meeting and gave him a military command token. “If you’re in a dire situation, crush this token, and I can use my troops’ power to pull you over to my side.”<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan was increasingly attentive to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
She did not act out of personal sentiment but remained the same iron-blooded general as ever.<br/>
<br/>
The key point was that Ning Zhuo was closely intertwined with her interests; whether he lived or died would affect the fate of Grand Marshal Mu’s household.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo accepted the token and expressed his thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Before Ning Zhuo left, Mu Lan still spoke her mind. “Perhaps you could travel with me?”<br/>
<br/>
This suggestion was immediately rejected by Ning Zhuo. He clarified that he served as the adviser and ceremonial officer of the Three Generals Battalion and had been on very good terms with the Three Generals. Now, before a single battle had started, if the battalion’s own adviser immediately moved to another force, it would certainly bring trouble to the Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
“Liu, Guan, and Zhang have treated me very well. Could I, Ning Zhuo, be so petty and ungrateful?” Ning Zhuo turned it down solemnly.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan had expected this response, so she only nodded and told Ning Zhuo to be careful.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo returned to the Three Generals Battalion, and Liu Er quietly breathed a sigh of relief.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Liu Er had worried that Ning Zhuo might join the Red Flower Battalion and not remain with the Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he saw that such fears were unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei and Guan Hong had never worried in that regard; they were certain Ning Zhuo would choose to stay.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion lined up in a single-file formation and marched toward Qian Fenglin.<br/>
<br/>
They traveled normally and did not purposely slow down.<br/>
<br/>
By the evening of the third day, they arrived at the foot of a Tianzhu Giantwood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
They set up a camp, and the night passed peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
Early the next morning, they broke camp and climbed the first Tianzhu Giantwood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
They did not encounter any enemies.<br/>
<br/>
The troops found signs of many barbarians and demonic beasts, but these intelligent beings had already moved away.<br/>
<br/>
That Tianzhu Giantwood Mountain was apparently abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion pushed forward unimpeded, without encountering any resistance.<br/>
<br/>
“General, we discovered a large amount of food!” a returning scout reported excitedly.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and Ning Zhuo went personally to inspect and found that it was a huge cluster of mushrooms.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo offered a warning. “Barbarians are adept at using poisons. Since they deliberately left this food behind, it might be a trap. In my opinion, we shouldn’t touch it at all.”<br/>
<br/>
Originally, Liu Er had wanted to pick some as extra rations, but after hearing Ning Zhuo, he immediately nodded. “What the adviser says is right.”<br/>
<br/>
He immediately issued an order forbidding the troops from taking even a scrap. Then they continued on their way.<br/>
<br/>
The second Tianzhu Giantwood Mountain and the third Tianzhu Giantwood Mountain were both abandoned. The Three Generals Battalion did not encounter a single enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning all seemed calm, but in their hearts, they felt more and more serious.<br/>
<br/>
Encountering some resistance would have actually been beneficial for them—to train the troops, boost morale, and if they suffered setbacks, they would have had a reason to halt right there.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, the enemy’s proactive withdrawal and consolidation of its forces posed an even greater threat to the Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, when they reached the fourth Giantwood Mountain, they saw two military camps.<br/>
<br/>
One camp was at the foot of the mountain, and another was halfway up. The two formed a pincer situation.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion was just one force; it was impossible to split in two.<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it, the enemy has more soldiers, and our Triangular Arrow Formation requires the three Golden Core cultivators working together, so there’s no way we can split up,” Zhang Hei said in frustration.<br/>
<br/>
At this, Liu Er let out a little laugh.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong stroked his beard in silence.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Zhang Hei immediately perked up. “Big brother, if you’re smiling, then you must have a good plan. Hurry, tell us!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er looked at Ning Zhuo. “It’s not that I have a plan. It’s that our adviser does.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo knew exactly what Liu Er was hinting at and said, “General Zhang, you may not have noticed in your focus on training, but in recent days I formed another unit, made up of mechanized puppets.”<br/>
<br/>
“Because there wasn’t enough space in our Three Generals Battalion camp, we usually borrowed ground from the Red Flower Battalion for their training.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei was both surprised and delighted. “Is that so? Given your abilities, Adviser, this mechanized army must be very formidable!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gave a wry smile. “You flatter me, General Zhang. This mechanized army is newly formed and still lacks training. But if I lead it alone, I can at least buy you three some time.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er said, “If so, please handle the enemy camp on the mountainside, Adviser. We three will act together and try to eliminate the camp at the foot of the mountain as soon as possible.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, then agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei hesitated. “But from the look of it, the camp on the mountainside is much bigger —three times the size of the one at the bottom —and its banners are dense, which obviously suggests they’re stronger. You’re only at Foundation Establishment, Adviser, and you’re going alone to command the mechanized army. Can you take them?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled. “Thank you for your concern, General Zhang. My mechanized army has no morale to worry about. Even if we’re defeated and scattered, as long as we buy you enough time to wipe out the other camp, then I’ll have accomplished my mission.”<br/>
<br/>
“Even if the losses are heavy, don’t forget that according to our contract, I get thirty percent of the spoils.”<br/>
<br/>
“That means I can make a big purchase of mechanized puppets and rebuild my army.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei let out an ‘oh,’ then realized and sighed. “That’s the good thing about mechanized puppets not being living people —they’re convenient to assemble into an army.”<br/>
<br/>
The plan was settled. Ning Zhuo separated from them and took out nearly all of his mechanized puppets.<br/>
<br/>
Under the astonished gazes of the many soldiers, a mechanized army quickly took shape.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood in the midst of the mechanized forces, letting out his spiritual sense.<br/>
<br/>
Through a Mirror of Divided Spirit to project and receive his spiritual sense, he took control of about sixty percent of the puppets. The remaining portion was secretly handled by Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Together, the two triggered a battle formation:<br/>
<br/>
The Lightfoot Whirlwind Formation!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to previous training, the mechanized puppets immediately became lighter, with their limbs wreathed in swift winds, moving faster and with greater agility.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo bowed to Liu Er, then concealed his figure and vanished.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanized army moved lightly and ascended the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the Three Generals Battalion activated their Triangular Arrow Formation and charged the enemy camp at the foot of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo led his troops along, everything went smoothly, which made him feel a bit uneasy: the enemy camp did have long-range attacks, but the arrows were sparse, posing little pressure.<br/>
<br/>
“Could it be that the camp at the foot of the mountain is actually the main force?”<br/>
<br/>
Just as he was thinking this, a large number of soldiers poured out of the camp at the bottom of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Barbarians, demon cultivators, and devil cultivators came swarming out in a chaotic mass, barely forming some kind of battle formation, but they had a massive numerical advantage, like a flash flood bursting forth.<br/>
<br/>
“Hahaha, now you’re stunned, aren’t you? You fell right into our trap!” boasted a leading Jindan barbarian, each hand gripping a giant axe, laughing triumphantly.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that these barbarians, aware of their lack of training but advantage in numbers, decided to split their forces.<br/>
<br/>
They set up two camps —one strong, one weak, one real, one feigned —and used certain methods to conceal which was which.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion, lacking scouting abilities and short on manpower, took the bait.<br/>
<br/>
Caught off-guard, the Three Generals Battalion was slammed by the enemy’s overwhelming numbers, and their momentum halted.<br/>
<br/>
“This is bad. I must reinforce them quickly.” Ning Zhuo immediately directed his mechanized army back down the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, however, another band of enemy troops burst out of the camp on the mountainside. Led by a Jindan barbarian armed with a long spear, they charged while howling, “You want to provide backup? Dream on!”<br/>
<br/>
This enemy force was extremely fierce, plunging into the midst of Ning Zhuo’s puppets.<br/>
<br/>
The two sides clashed in a swirl of carnage.<br/>
<br/>
“We need a quick resolution,” Ning Zhuo sighed, revealing himself and launching Five Elements spells.<br/>
<br/>
Fiery explosions rained down, bursting one after another.<br/>
<br/>
The barbarians were blasted into confusion.<br/>
<br/>
It was because Ning Zhuo did not care about destroying his own mechanized puppets, wiping out many of them.<br/>
<br/>
The barbarian Jindan general roared, his eyes red with rage. Losing mechanized puppets was one thing, but for them, it was their own flesh and blood who were dying.<br/>
<br/>
“Despicable little scoundrel, die!” he shouted.<br/>
<br/>
That Jindan general rushed up to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sneered, extended a finger, and shot forth a Metal-based spell like light and spear, forcing the barbarian Jindan to retreat in disarray.<br/>
<br/>
The general’s face twisted with horror.<br/>
<br/>
This was because Ning Zhuo had acquired additional might from the army’s power, allowing him to ascend to the Golden Core level in combat strength!<br/>
<br/>
Military Strategy —Return of the Brave Warriors!<br/>
<br/>
All the mechanized puppets were in his ranks, and the more of them that died in vain, the stronger the reinforcement Ning Zhuo gained.<br/>
<br/>
With a sweep of his sleeve, he unleashed a fresh wave of Five Elements spells.<br/>
<br/>
More of his mechanized puppets were destroyed, but the barbarians died in even greater numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo grew even stronger!<br/>
<br/>
The barbarian Jindan general sensed this escalation and lost all will to fight. “Retreat! Retreat now!!”</div>
