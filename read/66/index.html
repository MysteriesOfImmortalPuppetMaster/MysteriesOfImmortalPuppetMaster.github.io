<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Yuan Er felt as if a massive boulder was pressing down on his heart, leaving him barely able to breathe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After observing for a while, he was deeply aware of his current situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The mechanical monkeys were shockingly efficient, far better than his gang’s monkey pets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Monkey pets would get tired and often acted overly cautiously due to fearing explosions. But mechanical monkeys never grew weary; the moment they were damaged, they could be sent back for emergency repairs and quickly return to the scene. More importantly, they had no fear at all, allowing them to act with great efficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“We’ve fallen behind across the board. The thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest is our last chance. Uncle Monkey, it’s all up to you now!” Yuan Er said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Yuan Dasheng nodded and leapt into action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">It had been conserving its energy all this time, only making an appearance at this final critical moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Two muscular arms swept out seemingly carelessly from Yuan Dasheng’s hulking frame, leaving behind faint afterimages from their speed. But when the hands attached to these arms touched the fire persimmons, not a single explosion was triggered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Molten Flame Demonic Ape’s movements were swift and fluid as it plucked every thousand-year fire persimmon from one of the trees and placed them gently on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Its shocking performance drew the gazes of countless cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“This Molten Flame Demonic Ape is incredible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Of course it is. It’s the very pillar of the Monkey Head Gang, a beast pet left behind by the former gang leader Yuan Yi.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“How terrifying! Its movements are so casual, but not a single fire persimmon has exploded. Its martial skill is enough to put who-knows-how-many martial masters to shame.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Yuan Dasheng displayed a perfect balance of strength and finesse, applying no more and no less than the exact force required every time. Thousand-year fire persimmons were even more volatile than the hundred- or ten-year ones, but in Yuan Dasheng’s hands, they were completely inert, almost as if they were fake persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The ape leapt from tree to tree, to the ground and back, its massive body moving gracefully. All who watched were captivated by the beauty of its carefree strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Halfway up the mountain, Chen Cha, Ning Zhuo, and the others also saw this scene through the projection formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Chen Cha showed a look of surprise. “No wonder the Monkey Head Gang has controlled the business of picking fire persimmons for so many years. They have genuine skill!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Yes, it’s very impressive,” Ning Zhuo said. “But unfortunately, they only have that one powerful ape.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Chen Cha shook his head. “That’s not right. Take a look at our current performance; the mechanical monkeys are too low in quality and have caused many explosions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“In the future, the City Lord Mansion will certainly rely on the mechanical monkeys for picking ordinary fire persimmons. The monkey pets are too inefficient and much more prone to error.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“But when it comes to thousand-year fire persimmons, they’ll have to rely on this Molten Flame Demonic Ape. Look at its swift movements, its calm and steady demeanor. It’s very reliable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo didn’t respond, but a faint cold light appeared in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He sneered silently in his heart. “Reliable, huh?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“I’ve been planning for this moment all along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Yuan Dasheng, it’s time for you to accept my gift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Now... die!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The moment this thought flashed through his mind, more than a dozen mechanical monkeys suddenly went out of control and charged at Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The abrupt change in the situation left many in shock, but Yuan Er reacted immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He’d been constantly on edge ever since the assassination attempt. Now that something was happening, he reacted like a startled rabbit diving into its burrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Mechanical monkeys charged him from three sides. The only open path for Yuan Er was to run straight ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In his panic, he instinctively chose what he believed to be the safest direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He ran forward without hesitation, trying to reunite with Yuan Dasheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Yuan Dasheng reacted quickly and stopped picking fire persimmons to run toward Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">They managed to safely meet up in the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest. As for the mechanical monkeys, they couldn’t follow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Fei Si took action, activating a formation that immediately obliterated the explosive fire monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This was the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">It was the core area of the entire Fire Persimmon Forest, with unimaginable value. How could Fei Si possibly allow the mechanical monkeys to run rampant here?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Is it the black shadow demonic cultivator stirring up trouble again? But why target the Monkey Head Gang?” Zhu Xuanji, Chi Dun, and some others were full of doubt. But the black shadow demonic cultivator hadn’t revealed themselves, so these Golden Core cultivators couldn’t make a move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Fei Si’s expression darkened and his gaze flickered with suspicion. Was it possible that this wasn’t the black shadow demonic cultivator’s doing, but rather a scheme of Ning Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“If it really is him, then that crazy brat Ning Zhuo must die!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Fei Si held a bit of appreciation toward Ning Zhuo, but this matter involved his own duty and future. If Ning Zhuo was indeed the culprit, Fei Si would be the first to make him pay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Fei Si immediately ordered for all the mechanical monkey fragments to be sent over to Chen Cha and Ning Zhuo, along with a personal message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The messenger quickly arrived in front of Ning Zhuo, face expressionless and eyes cold. “Sir Fei Si sends these words: whoever ignores the bigger picture is asking to die!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Chen Cha was dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo’s expression turned extremely serious. “Please report to Sir Fei Si that I would never be so foolish! These mechanical monkeys can only be controlled with at least a Foundation Establishment-stage cultivation base. How could it be me?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“This must be a probe or act of sabotage by the black shadow demonic cultivator. I implore Sir Fei Si to investigate things carefully. There aren’t many repairs needed at this point; I request permission to temporarily withdraw to Fire Persimmon Immortal City so I can clear my name.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Only now did Chen Cha understand what was happening, and he was instantly filled with indignation. He had to take a deep breath to barely suppress his anger before saying, “We would never sabotage the Monkey Head Gang for personal reasons, especially right in front of everyone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Moreover, how far away are we? Do you really think we could control those mechanical monkeys at this distance, without using any wires or divine sense?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The messenger’s expression softened slightly. After nodding, he turned and left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Chen Cha was still fuming. “What nonsense is this? The control component of those mechanical monkeys is a set of three stroll bullets. Only a Foundation Establishment cultivator can control them! But they’re suspecting you, Little Zhuo? Absurd, truly absurd!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly. “You can’t really blame Sir Fei Si. He’s under immense pressure right now; only the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest remains unharvested, and the black shadow demonic cultivator still hasn’t made a move. The real event will probably start soon!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Inside the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Yuan Er was still trembling. “Uncle Dasheng, the Flying Disk Workshop is completely insane. The whole city is watching, but they still tried to take my life!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Yuan Dasheng was also filled with anger, but it patted Yuan Er’s shoulder comfortingly to calm him down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Fear lingered on Yuan Er’s face, but he suddenly became excited. “Uncle Dasheng, it must be because the Flying Disk Workshop saw you displaying your divine might and couldn’t sit still any longer. That’s why they took such a gamble!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Uncle Dasheng, please keep it up! Continue picking fire persimmons and secure our victory!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yuan Dasheng nodded. It pointed at Yuan Er, then pointed at the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Yuan Er understood and immediately nodded. “Don’t worry, Uncle Dasheng. I’ll stay near you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yuan Dasheng turned around and resumed climbing trees to pick persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Its movements grew faster and faster, quickly returning to its earlier efficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Up on the mountainside, the light in Ning Zhuo’s eyes reached its peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Come on, come on,” he whispered silently in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Yuan Dasheng’s expression suddenly changed drastically!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Its fingers tightened, and it accidentally crushed a thousand-year fire persimmon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">It made a mistake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">At the critical moment, right before victory was secured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">It made a mistake!</paragraph><br/><br/>
