<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Fourteen years ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">As Meng Yaoyin lay dying, she gave some final advice to her two-year-old son, Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“The immortal city is in continuous decline, and the standards for selection are lowering with it. Zhuo’er, by the time you turn fourteen, the selection threshold for the city of mechanisms will drop to the Qi Refining stage. This will be your greatest opportunity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Zhuo’er, you must diligently study the arts of mechanisms. Design the constructs yourself, assemble them with your own hands, and control them personally. These will all be part of the assessment in the city."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Never advance to the Foundation Establishment stage using the Ning family’s cultivation method!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Do not let others know about your dedication to this. Don’t stand out too much. Your father and I are no longer here, and no one can be your true support. You must hide yourself well. Don’t be too exceptional, but don’t be too mediocre either. Grow quietly, accumulate in silence, and avoid drawing attention.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“I’ve seen too many geniuses die young…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"I leave you the Cang Iron Armor for protection—it carries the might of the Foundation Establishment stage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"And this treasure—the Buddha Heart Demon Seal! I was lucky enough to obtain it from the Lava Immortal Palace. You must never reveal it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After saying these things, in her final moments, Meng Yaoyin hesitated again. "I don’t know if teaching you this way is truly right.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Zhuo’er, take good care of yourself. If things get too hard, give up on the Lava Immortal Palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Life comes first. I just want you to live—live well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“If you’re alive, I’ll be happy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Two-year-old Ning Zhuo clutched his mother’s blood-soaked clothes tightly, crying, “Mother, mother, please stop. I don’t want you to die! Don’t die, please!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In her last breath, Meng Yaoyin whispered, “My precious Zhuo’er, don’t be afraid… Mother will always watch over you from the ground...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In the next moment, her heart stopped, and her hand slipped slowly from Ning Zhuo’s head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He froze in shock, whispering, “Mother… Mother, wake up… please wake up!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Then, his voice rose into a scream as he threw himself into her lifeless arms, wailing bitterly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He cried until he passed out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Meng Yaoyin’s soul let out a faint sigh as it drifted out of her body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">She reached out to touch Ning Zhuo, but her hand passed through him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">She formed a hand seal, using her puppet-controlling technique to make her own corpse stand up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">From her storage bracelet, she pulled out a prepared substitute corpse, placing it where her body had been.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Before leaving, she knelt down, gazing at Ning Zhuo’s sleeping face with deep reluctance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">After a moment, she pushed down her emotions, controlling her body to descend into a secret underground chamber and leave through a teleportation array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">She first teleported to a hidden base underground, using it as a transfer point before heading to Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Familiar with the path, she followed the tunnel and entered the Lava Immortal Palace once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Guided by the palace's glow, she found her way inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">It was her first time entering the palace after her death, and her emotions were complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Her former rank allowed her smooth passage into the Gourd Furnace Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Her soul emitted faint purple scars, and she sighed, “Even after death, this Dao wound remains. I can only hope refining my spirituality can heal it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">But the Dao wound continued to affect her, weakening her quickly as she struggled to control her corpse and climb into the golden furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Cremation of Brahma Sutra!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The flames rose, subjecting Meng Yaoyin to the agonizing pain of soul-burning and spirit-refining. Yet, she endured it in complete silence, sitting quietly in the furnace, her willpower unshakable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Zhuo’er, Zhuo’er, if I succeed, I can still watch you grow up.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“If not…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">She smiled sadly, but there was no trace of doubt in her resolve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Regardless of the outcome, her soul would dissipate. She could have gone to the underworld, where her remaining lifespan would allow her to live longer. But for her son, she took this immense risk, refining herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In the shadows, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit watched in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Too ruthless… This woman is too ruthless!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The golden furnace shattered, and the Monk Doctor descended. The refined spirituality of Meng Yaoyin entered her mechanical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit marveled, "She actually succeeded!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“She endured such excruciating pain without uttering a sound. When I went through this, I screamed… no, I roared from start to finish.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“She truly proves that only those ruthless enough can become demons!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Watching Meng Yaoyin leave the palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit smiled contentedly. "This Meng Yaoyin is truly my benefactor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Not only did she exploit the loopholes and take away the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, but even after her death, she claimed the Monk Doctor. Truly impressive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“I hope more like her appear in the future.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“With a few more like her, my escape from this place would be within reach!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Monk Doctor, Meng Yaoyin, retraced her steps and returned to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">She reached out with her mechanical hand and gently stroked his cheek.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Then, she activated the mechanisms within her body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Warm Buddha light, like the glow of sunlight or flowing water, poured out from her body and entered Ning Zhuo's upper Dantian, into his Divine Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Zhuo’er, Mother has a gift for you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“This is the full Mirror Platform Communion Sutra, one of the three top sect methods!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“I’ve hidden the entire scripture within your Divine Sea. When you cultivate this technique in the future, you will face no obstacles.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Having completed this, the Monk Doctor Meng Yaoyin quietly vanished from sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Arrangements were made for her burial: changing her shroud, setting up the hall, notifying the temple, issuing the obituary, preparing the spirit hall... the funeral rites, the condolences, the mourning vigil, and finally, the burial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Meng Yaoyin, as the Monk Doctor, watched everything unfold from the shadows, witnessing her own funeral. Her heart was heavy as she saw the puppet-like, emotionless Ning Zhuo, and the pain tore at her soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">She hesitated, torn between the urge to reunite and the fear of causing more harm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Dao wound!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">She needed to confirm she was truly free of it. Otherwise, even if they reunited, it would only lead to more heartache and separation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Monk Doctor, Meng Yaoyin, stopped her breathing exercises, her eyes flickering with a brief hint of purple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Dao wound..." Her heart filled with regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Even after refining her spirituality, she could not escape the curse of this relentless wound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"So, how much longer do I have this time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">She smiled bitterly, grateful that she hadn’t revealed herself to Ning Zhuo again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Late at night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Mother, mother, where are you? Please don’t leave me..." Two-year-old Ning Zhuo huddled in his bed, trembling from a nightmare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Meng Yaoyin revealed herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Suppressing her sorrow, she quietly walked to his bedside, kneeling down and gently taking his small hand in hers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">She sang softly:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“The clouds fly, the clouds fly, flying over white rivers and emerald peaks. The stream meanders around the great tree, sunlight covering the grassy knolls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The clouds fly, the wind chases, flying over rivers and stars. The sky so vast, the clouds roll freely, moved by the breeze.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">As the familiar lullaby echoed, Ning Zhuo’s furrowed brow relaxed, and he drifted into peaceful sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">This happened night after night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Then, one evening, before Meng Yaoyin could start the lullaby, Ning Zhuo awoke from his nightmare with a start.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He saw a puppet standing at the foot of his bed, and screamed in terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid, it’s me, your mother,” the Monk Doctor, Meng Yaoyin, hastened to reassure him gently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">But Ning Zhuo shrank back against the wall, wrapping himself in his blanket, trembling with fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Meng Yaoyin’s heart broke. She reached out instinctively to comfort him, only to see her mechanical hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Her heart trembled, and she pulled back her hand, sitting down at the bedside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Softly, she began to sing once more. “The clouds fly, the clouds fly…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The song drew Ning Zhuo in. Mustering his courage, he peeked out from a small gap in his blanket, slowly widening it until he finally poked his head out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He stared at the Monk Doctor in a daze, gradually recognizing her as his mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Tears welled in his eyes, and when the song ended, he threw off the blanket and ran straight into her arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Crying, he shouted, “Mother!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Zhuo’er, my precious Zhuo’er.” Meng Yaoyin held him close, stroking his head, her heart full of emotion, though her tears never fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">With their reunion, Meng Yaoyin no longer held back, secretly caring for and teaching Ning Zhuo every day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">She primarily taught him the arts of mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Only after losing it, did she realize how precious time with him was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo clung tightly to Meng Yaoyin, listening intently to every word she said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Mother, mother,” Ning Zhuo called softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Meng Yaoyin snapped out of her thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo curled up in her arms, looking up at her with innocent eyes, his voice soft, “You’re distracted during class, Mother. That won’t do.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Meng Yaoyin bent down, kissed his forehead gently, and whispered an apology. Yet, the shadows in her heart grew deeper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">She knew this was the work of the Dao wound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">At first, the wound was barely noticeable in her spirituality. But soon, faint traces of purple appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Now, that purple had become strands, coiling ever tighter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The past was repeating itself, and Meng Yaoyin knew her time was once again running short.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Her heart filled with sadness and uncertainty. She didn’t know how to explain the truth to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">One night, a sneaky figure appeared near the Ning family residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Meng Yaoyin acted decisively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The figure fell to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo witnessed the scene, his face turning pale, stammering, “M-Mother, did you kill him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Meng Yaoyin shook her head. “He was acting suspiciously and has cultivation. Likely a petty thief. But he’s not dead, just knocked unconscious.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo looked at the unconscious figure, his shock giving way to sympathy and concern. “He’s just a child, like me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Mother, if we leave him here, won’t he bleed to death?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Meng Yaoyin smiled. “Do you want to save him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Yes!” Ning Zhuo nodded eagerly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Meng Yaoyin, knowing her time was short, decided to use this chance to teach Ning Zhuo a profound lesson. “Then it’s up to you. But since you want to save him, you must do it yourself. Don’t rely on me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo’s face lit up with joy. “Thank you, Mother!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He quickly dragged Sun Lingtong into the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
