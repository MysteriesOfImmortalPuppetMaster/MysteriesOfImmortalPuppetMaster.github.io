<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Twilight converged from all directions as the distant mountains held onto the last glimmer of rosy sunset.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Qingyin Pavilion was built against a cliff. The bronze bells hanging from the eaves emitted ethereal sounds in the evening breeze, highlighting the surrounding silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Gu Qing stood by the window, his sky-blue wide sleeves fluttering in the wind like shifting clouds. He looked down at the crowd below that was gradually gathering and then dispersing, his eyes deep as the night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Teacher," he turned to look at Zhao Hansheng, who was sitting by the desk, "the rumors are surging. It is clear that someone is intentionally fueling the flames!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He walked back to the sandalwood desk, his fingertips brushing over the open books: "The sages once said: 'To make one perish, one must first make them mad.' These praises are excessive; it is clearly a case of 'killing with praise.' We must find the mastermind behind this and see who is plotting against us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zhao Hansheng slowly lifted his cup, gazing at the churning sea of clouds outside the cliff, a faint, mocking smile playing on his lips: "The Classic of Virtue says: 'What is to be contracted must first be expanded; what is to be weakened must first be strengthened.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He turned his gaze back to his most prized disciple: "Why bother investigating? This was already expected."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He took a slow sip of tea: "The opponent did not deny us, but instead went to great lengths to affirm us. The Classic of Changes says: 'The dragon at its height has cause for remorse; what is full cannot last long.' This is a blatant scheme! To push the waves and add to the fire with such sophisticated methods... it must be someone who has been immersed in the ways of power and intrigue for many years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zhao Hansheng set down the teacup: "We need to build a reputation, and the opponent is making our fire burn even brighter. They expect that the higher we are raised, the harder we will fall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"But they have certainly underestimated the power of Heart Study!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Heh, once I begin my public lecture tomorrow, everything will become clear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Gu Qing’s gaze sharpened: "'The strong must govern, and those who govern will be strong.' Ultimately, strength is everything. Teacher, you are right; I lost my composure slightly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"It is a shame," Zhao Hansheng sighed softly, though his eyes showed no hint of remorse, "our breaking of this deadlock did not rely on my strength, but on Wang Xinyue’s."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Gu Qing held the pot to refill his tea, the stream of water reflecting golden light under the candlelight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Teacher is too modest," he said respectfully, "the two of us came here alone, and with only limited resources, we were able to leverage the internal power structure of a titan like the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"The Military Manual says: 'A skilled warrior seeks victory from the momentum of the situation and does not demand it from his people.' To be able to borrow the 'momentum' of the situation - is that not exactly where your strength lies, Teacher?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He continued: "I have traveled the world with you, starting from Huazhang Kingdom all the way to the Flying Cloud Kingdom. I have benefited immensely." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zhao Hansheng reached out to touch the teacup, his fingertips gently rubbing the blue-and-white floral patterns on the rim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He sighed leisurely: "It is good that you understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"The Myriad Manifestations Sect is powerful in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, being the number one righteous force. If we can secure support here, it will be of great benefit to your future development in Huazhang Kingdom." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Amidst the swirling tea mist, Zhao Hansheng’s voice grew deeper: "To tell you the truth, I never intended to let go of the position of Mountain Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Once my reputation reaches its peak through the spread of Heart Study, there will be as many reasons as I need to retain this authority."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"In this process, we must subdue the entire Confucian cultivator community of the Myriad Manifestations Sect." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"When the critical moment arrives, we will arrange for capable people to drive public opinion, making it the 'will of the people' and demanding that I continue to serve as Mountain Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"At that time, I will decline repeatedly, and finally 'reluctantly' accept. This is the perfect plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"That Situ Gu," his lips curled into a cold arc, "is he not a perfect example?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"The foreign Confucian cultivators are easy to win over." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Their longing for Huazhang Kingdom comes from the heart. This grants us even more influence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Heh heh heh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zhao Hansheng let out a few cold laughs, thinking of Duanmu Zhang, and commented directly: "Duanmu Zhang is unworthy of being called a Great Scholar. Years ago, he was so obsessed with his studies that he was marginalized by his colleagues and sent to the Flying Cloud Kingdom to spread Confucianism. I didn't expect that even now, he has made no progress. He even committed the same mistake as before, naively handing over the position of Mountain Lord. Truly foolish!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="61"/>
<paragraph index="62">The next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">The morning light was faint, and the mist atop Shaoshu Peak had not yet dissipated, yet the massive bluestone square was already teeming with people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Today was the day of the first public lecture by Mr. Zhao Hansheng, the man from Huazhang Kingdom who had recently gained immense fame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">Although the surging rumors had already caused some to feel resentment, they had also created even more momentum, making the public more curious about the master and disciple, wanting to see if their reputation truly matched their reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Upon the high platform, Zhao Hansheng wore a deep black robe with wide sleeves. His hair was tied simply with a plain jade hairpin. There was not a hint of spiritual pressure leaking from him, yet he possessed a natural, captivating grace. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">He did not carry any books. He simply looked calmly at the growing crowd below, his gaze sweeping over the many experts and powerhouses in the front rows and the vast crowd behind them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">Ning Zhuo was among them, looking inconspicuous. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">He had gained entry using a stone tablet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">The cultivators able to attend were not ordinary people; they had been screened in advance by the Confucian cultivator community. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">When the time arrived, Zhao Hansheng began his lecture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">He did not engage in pleasantries. His voice was clear and resonant, like a great bronze bell, reaching everyone's ears distinctly: "Today we shall not discuss scriptures or classics. I only wish to ask you one thing: In your hearts, does Principle exist?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">A slight commotion immediately rippled through the audience. They had come because of Zhao Hansheng’s fame and curiosity about Heart Study. But if he didn't talk about scriptures or classics, could this even be considered a lecture by a Scholar? </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">Zhao Hansheng continued: "The world says we must 'investigate things to extend knowledge.' The Great Scholar Wang Xinyue investigated bamboo for seven days but found it difficult to know the 'principle' of the bamboo. However, this led him to realize another side of 'investigating things to extend knowledge' - there are no objects outside the heart, and no principles outside the heart. The principles of all things are within my heart!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">As soon as these words were spoken, the entire audience was shocked!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">Seeing that he had seized everyone's attention, Zhao Hansheng began to speak eloquently, detailing the Way of Heart Study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">Chu Xuangui frowned deeply. This was the second time he had heard these grand theories, yet they still contradicted much of what he had previously learned. Chu Xuangui had spent his life adhering strictly to the classics and acting with meticulous care; the idea of "Principle" being within the heart was truly "incompatible" with him. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Sitting beside him was Song Taosheng. This white-haired elder had his eyes half-closed as if resting, but his slightly twitching eyelids betrayed his inner turmoil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">Time passed slowly as Zhao Hansheng reached the essence of Heart Study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">His voice was low, carrying a strange power that pierced the human heart: "When you have not seen this flower, the flower and your heart are in the same state of silence. When you come to see this flower, the color of the flower suddenly becomes clear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">"It can be seen that this flower is not outside your heart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">"The Heart is Principle. Is there any matter or principle in this world that exists outside the heart?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">For a moment, the entire field was silent. Almost all the cultivators were moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">On Bai Jiyun’s face, there was not a trace of his usual laziness. He looked as if he had been hit by a freezing spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">He was also a genius known throughout the kingdom and had traveled extensively. He thought he was broad-minded and knowledgeable, but he had never imagined that "Principle" could be defined in such a way!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">Liu Fushu’s eyes were wide open, and the ink spots on the side of his neck seemed even clearer due to his excitement. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">As an expert in calligraphy, his thoughts began to wander: excellent brushwork should perfectly align with classical standards. But according to Heart Study, did that not mean the highest standard of calligraphy already existed within his own heart?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">This was too inconceivable! Yet Liu Fushu also felt a faint inkling: if he could penetrate this layer, perhaps his calligraphy would enter an entirely new realm?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Even the youngest, Kong Ran, could no longer maintain his steady, adult-like composure. His dark, bright eyes were filled with confusion and shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">It was all a mess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">The Confucian knowledge stored in his brain seemed to have been thrown into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">"This is Heart Study?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">It was different from the Confucianism he understood, yet also the same, filled with a fatal attraction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Finally, Zhao Hansheng’s lecture concluded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">He spoke his final words: "Knowledge is the beginning of action; action is the completion of knowledge. The point where knowledge is genuine and earnest is action; the point where action is clear and discerning is knowledge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">"This is - the Unity of Knowledge and Action!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">"This will be the content of my second round of lectures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Everyone present was shocked again and again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">"Unity of Knowledge and Action?!" Ning Zhuo’s heart shook violently. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">His primary cultivation was not the Confucian Dao, so he was not as profoundly impacted or affected as the Confucian cultivators. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">But at this moment, he was greatly shaken!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">It was because he thought of his own secret cultivation method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">"I absorb various types of demonic energy to eliminate evil and uphold the Dao, gaining their lifelong memories and experiences. Is that not 'Knowledge'?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">"Previously, when I used bronze weapons for combat training in the Profound Armor Grotto, I was comprehending and digesting through practice - using action to digest knowledge and truly making it a part of myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">"But according to this Confucian technique, one can directly transform 'Knowledge' into 'Action,' and 'Action' into 'Knowledge.'" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">"Unity of Knowledge and Action! Unity of Knowledge and Action!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">"If I can obtain this method and then process the memories and experiences of demonic souls, how terrifyingly efficient would that be!!!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">In an instant, Ning Zhuo felt a massive, unprecedented desire for the Confucian technique of the Unity of Knowledge and Action. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">And just then, a lean figure in the front row slowly stood up, drawing everyone's attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">His hair fell by his cheeks. Breaking his usual habit of silence, he asked directly: "Mr. Zhao’s theories are deafening. According to you, if the Heart is Principle and there is a Unity of Knowledge and Action, then can all the myriad laws of the world be reduced to the application of a single Heart?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">The entire square fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">The identity of the questioner was no small matter; he was Lu Zhanshu, the Peak Lord of Soaring Peak, one of the eight peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">Zhao Hansheng looked at Lu Zhanshu and nodded slightly: "Peak Lord Lu has asked the fundamental question. Myriad laws are born from the Heart, and the Heart can transform objects. Whether it is tempering the Physical Body or condensing Spiritual Energy, the root is driven by the mind, with Knowledge and Action progressing together. To seek the law outside the heart is to climb a tree to catch a fish." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">Hearing this, Lu Zhanshu frowned slightly and pondered for a dozen breaths before clapping his hands in praise: "Wonderful! Truly wonderful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">In an instant, a huge wave of emotion surged in everyone's hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">Lu Zhanshu was one of the top leaders of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, and his every word and action had a broad impact. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">At this moment, he publicly expressed his admiration and recognition for Zhao Hansheng! This was not just academic approval, but could extend to political recognition as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">The public support of a Peak Lord carried immense weight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Originally, because Zhao Hansheng had "suddenly and strangely" become the leader of the Confucian cultivators, he was widely questioned by the outside world. But after the public lecture just now and Lu Zhanshu’s personal endorsement, the hidden danger of the rumors had been completely dismantled, truly solidifying his strength and reputation. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Duanmu Zhang was also sitting in the front row, listening the entire time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">Hearing Lu Zhanshu’s praise, his heart was filled with mixed emotions. Heart Study was shocking and pointed directly at the heart; it indeed possessed a soul-shaking charm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">At this time, a name - one that had been a knot in his heart he could not let go of for many years - surfaced in his mind: Qin De.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">This brilliant individual had "fallen into a demonic state" through reading and created the Saintly Thief Scripture. Eventually, he was personally imprisoned in the Cloud Prison by the Confucian cultivators. He was once the junior Duanmu Zhang favored most! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">"Heart Study is so mysterious; perhaps it can completely resolve the Saintly Thief Scripture and let Qin De find his way back. Who knows?" This thought rose uncontrollably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">Duanmu Zhang had always pitied Qin De’s talent but was never able to correct his "distorted" thinking. Now, the Heart Study brought by Zhao Hansheng seemed to offer a brand-new possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">However, this was a matter of great importance. The matter of Qin De was deeply involved; it was a scar on Duanmu Zhang and even the entire Confucian community.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Duanmu Zhang could not decide alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">After the lecture, he immediately found several core Confucian cultivators, including Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng, to deliberate in secret. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">"The theory of Heart Study initially feels extreme, but its core is profound and points directly to the Great Dao," Duanmu Zhang said with a heavy tone. "Qin De has fallen into the Demonic Path, and his thoughts are distorted. Our many attempts at persuasion have all failed. Now, perhaps we can use the power of Heart Study to try and bring this boy back." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">"I want to tell Zhao Hansheng about Qin De and let him debate with him. Perhaps... there could be a turning point?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">Everyone was shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Hearing this, Chu Xuangui objected almost instantly and categorically: "No! Teacher, this matter is absolutely out of the question!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">"The matter of Qin De is our shame and a pain in our hearts! Although Heart Study is world-shaking, we do not yet know its true depths! Whether it can lead Qin De back to the Righteous Path is still unknown." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">"How can we hand over such an important person to an outsider?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Qin De was once a member of the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s Confucian community. The Saintly Thief Scripture he created was too rebellious. Years ago, after the Confucian community had tried many times and paid a heavy price but still had no way to change Qin De, they had once decided to directly eliminate him! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Qin De’s existence was a huge hidden danger for the Confucian community.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Or it could be said that he was a massive liability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">And it was precisely for this reason that after the Confucian community made that decision, some high-level members of the Myriad Manifestations Sect secretly intervened to save Qin De. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Because some high-level members discovered that Qin De was a powerful tool to "deal with or to some extent control the Confucian community"!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">This involved a power struggle among the upper echelons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Of course, this was not shown to the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">The gray-robed cultivators in the black market had thought too simply of the Qin De matter from the beginning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Even without the Eight Peaks Meeting, even if the current master of the Demon Subjugation Hall, Zhong Dao, did not value Qin De, his attempt to move against him would still have been fraught with difficulties. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Chu Xuangui’s meaning was clear: Qin De was a family scandal, while Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing were outsiders. Family scandals should not be aired in public! There was no reason to easily hand over such a liability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Duanmu Zhang remained silent and looked at the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">Song Taosheng stroked his beard and spoke slowly, his voice calm yet thoughtful: "I understand what the Teacher means. For a long time, Qin De has been our weakness, our stain - to be blunt, he is a liability."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">"The Myriad Manifestations Sect views us Confucian cultivators the same as most powers and nations: they want to use us, but also guard against us." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">"Old Teacher, you actively gave up the position of Mountain Lord because you wanted to use the power of Zhao Hansheng and Heart Study to open up a new situation for us, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Duanmu Zhang nodded slightly, looked at Song Taosheng, and then scanned everyone in the room, letting out a deep sigh: "The one who knows me best is indeed Song Taosheng."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
