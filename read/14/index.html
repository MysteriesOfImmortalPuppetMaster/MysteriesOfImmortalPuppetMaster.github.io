<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 14: Bombing the Immortal Palace!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo relied on his memory and leapt into the air, landing nimbly behind Ning Yong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Feeling wind behind him, Ning Yong subconsciously turned his head. But no matter how wide he opened his eyes, he couldn‚Äôt see the Iron Will Gray Armor right next to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo knocked Ning Yong unconscious with a light strike, then tossed him into a corner. He then knocked out Ning Chen and threw him next to Ning Yong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">After doing this, he quickly ran toward the lava lake at full speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone in front of me, five steps away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">‚ÄúTwo people on the left, one step and four steps away respectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">‚ÄúThree people standing together on the right, three steps away.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Although the black smoke obscured his vision and blocked his divine sense, Ning Zhuo had carefully memorized the position of every single Ning Clan cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">While others were like blind people, he alone seemed to have his eyes open as he accurately dodged past everyone in his way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Rushing over like a flash of lightning, Ning Zhuo quickly arrived at the lava lake. Thanks to the protection of the Iron Will Gray Armor, the burning heat had no effect on him at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">‚ÄúNow!‚Äù Ning Zhuo patted his storage bag and summoned the explosive fire monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This explosive fire monkey was half a person tall, with bright red fur and bulging muscles. Under Ning Zhuo‚Äôs precise control, the monkey dived into the lava without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Then, Ning Zhuo turned and ran!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Every second counted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The explosive fire monkey swam through the thick lava, diving ever downward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Its blood-red fur soon melted under the terrifying heat. The lifelike flesh exposed beneath the fur also quickly turned into black charcoal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">At this time, the ‚Äúblood‚Äù flowing inside the mechanical monkey evaporated in large quantities, dissipating the heat and causing steam to rise from the monkey‚Äôs body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">By the time the explosive fire monkey reached the Lava Immortal Palace, it had melted down to just its skeleton made of sky gold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">But this was a success!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Under the control of Ning Zhuo‚Äôs heart seal, the storage formation activated and released the ten thousand jin of stored fire essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">‚ÄúHere it comes.‚Äù Ning Zhuo‚Äôs heart was pounding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">BOOOOOOOM!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">A fierce shockwave blasted out in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">At the same time, a terrifying explosion thundered in Ning Zhuo‚Äôs ears. The shock wave struck him right in the back; had he not equipped the Iron Will Gray Armor, all his bones might have broken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Boosted by the shock wave, he arrived at the location in his memory and accurately picked two people up from the ground near the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Naturally, the two people were Ning Yong and Ning Chehn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo crouched down in front of the wall, arching his back to protect Ning Chen and Ning Yong from the explosion behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The next moment, flames from the explosion arrived, forcing back the heavy black smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo endured strenuously as the temperature behind him skyrocketed. His iron armor began to melt, causing him agonizing pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Gritting his teeth, he pushed the Iron Will Gray Armor‚Äôs defensive power to its limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In just a few breaths, another 20% of the Foundation Establishment Pill‚Äôs energy was consumed, leaving only 10%.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Fortunately, Zheng Shuanggou suddenly erupted with all his strength, sacrificing a magic artifact to block the red flames and surge of lava that the explosion had caused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The black shadow demonic cultivator cackled: ‚ÄúZheng Shuanggou, I‚Äôll be back!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Before leaving, the shadow threw out another black sphere that exploded into endless black smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zheng Shuanggou‚Äôs divine sense was immediately obscured. He was unable to even see three zhang[^1] in front of him, let alone lock on to his enemy. Moreover, he had to support the underground passages in order to avoid being buried alive. He was so furious that he wanted to cough up blood, but there was nothing he could do except stay where he was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Once the black smoke finally cleared, all Zheng Shuanggou could see was the sight of ravaged passage walls and layers of lava completely covering the former area of the lava lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">As for the tip of the immortal palace that had poked out earlier, it could no longer be seen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Oh, there was also a group of Ning Clan cultivators lying on the ground. Some of them were still alive, though unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zheng Shuanggou cursed in a low voice: ‚ÄúDamn it!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">His eyes flickered for a while, but he didn‚Äôt recklessly give chase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The mysterious demonic cultivator had disappeared. Worried that they were trying to lure him away, Zheng Shuanggou decided to simply stay here in case they looped back around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">With a wave of his hand, he scooped up all the Ning Clan cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Feigning unconsciousness, Ning Zhuo activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and successfully deceived Zheng Shuanggou. A while later, he slowly opened his eyes and discovered that he had returned aboveground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Ning Clan cultivators who survived the perilous journey numbered only eleven.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">‚ÄúWith the black smoke blocking everyone‚Äôs senses, no one should have noticed that I‚Äôm the one who caused the explosion! This trip went more smoothly than expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">‚ÄúBut although the explosion happened, did I really succeed?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo pondered to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive, I‚Äôm alive! Uhuhuhu‚Ä¶.‚Äù Ning Yong came to his senses and sobbed loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Chen also seemed like he‚Äôd woken up from a dream. His face was still pale with terror: ‚ÄúThe other newcomers are all dead. We‚Äôre so lucky to have made it out.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">They didn‚Äôt know that the reason they survived was thanks to Ning Zhuo‚Äôs protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The two walked over to Ning Zhuo, asking in concern: ‚ÄúAre you alright? You‚Äôre not hurt?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">After this thrilling escapade, their impression of Ning Zhuo had completely changed. Ning Zhuo‚Äôs calm and courage demeanor during the exploration had won Ning Chen and Ning Yong‚Äôs heartfelt admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Their worry for him was completely sincere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo seemed dazed for a moment, but when he snapped to his senses, he immediately showed exhaustion and the lingering fear of a man who had barely escaped disaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Seeing this expression, Ning Chen and Ning Yong didn‚Äôt think lesser of him at all; in fact, they felt a sense of closeness. After facing the terror of death just now, they too felt the same way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">It could be said that they were now bosom friends who had fought side by side and faced life and death together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo took a few deep breaths and smiled bitterly: ‚ÄúAll three of us survived, I can‚Äôt believe it‚Ä¶ Thank the heavens‚Ä¶ But, I don‚Äôt want to enter the Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern ever again.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Chen and Ning Yong hurriedly comforted him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The other Ning Clan cultivators also woke up. Some were busy healing their wounds, while others were thanking Zheng Shuaggou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zheng Shuanggou glanced at the numerous city guards jumping down to enter the cavern, then snorted coldly: ‚ÄúYou Nings were used by that demonic cultivator! He concealed himself with your aura and caught me off guard. After that, he lured over a horde of monster beasts to confuse me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">‚ÄúOnce you get back, prepare for an apology!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Ning Clan cultivators were stunned and immediately said: ‚ÄúThe enemy was a Golden Core demonic cultivator. With our strength, how could we stop him from taking advantage of us? Moreover, it is our Ning Clan that suffered the greatest losses!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zheng Shuanggou waved his hands impatiently: ‚ÄúYou can take your excuses back to your patriarch and the City Lord.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The good mood of these survivors immediately vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Before leaving, the Ning Clan cultivators once again expressed their thanks: ‚ÄúFortunately, Sir Zheng Shuanggou repelled that demonic cultivator and didn‚Äôt let him succeed.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">No matter what, it was a fact that Zheng Shuanggou had saved their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Just when the two sides were about to separate, the ground suddenly shook!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Countless beams of treasure light erupted from the holes in the rocky field, penetrating the white smoke above and shooting into the depths of the night sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Formation lines appeared beneath everyone‚Äôs feet as the volcano-sealing grand formation activated at full power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The city guards immediately shouted and sounded the alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?!‚Äù The Ning Clan cultivators swayed unsteadily, and many people cried out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Zheng Shuanggou‚Äôs expression turned extremely ugly as the final bit of hope in his heart shattered: ‚ÄúShit! The battle just now really did affect the Lava Immortal Palace!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Dazzling treasure light glimmered in the night sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The volcano shook, awakening all of Fire Persimmon Immortal City!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Suddenly, a huge cloud palm that covered the sky descended from above, trying to push all the treasure light back into the volcano.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The crimson treasure light paused against the cloud palm for a moment, but then drilled straight into the deep night like a sharp sword piercing through the hand of God!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Countless cracks appeared in the rocky field as scorching earth energy surged outward. Blazing flames spewed everywhere, dancing like wrathful dragons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">All the cultivators fled in a panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zheng Shuanggou, righteous to the end, swept up the Ning Clan cultivators in his sleeves and brought them to the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Looking down from above, the tip of a tower could be seen shooting upward with unstoppable momentum, like a spear piercing toward the heavens. Soon, the whole tower broke past all obstacles and appeared boldly before the world, standing like a pillar connecting heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Immediately afterward, the red rocks in the crater shattered as palace roofs broke through them and rose up into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The mountain roared, and the whole world trembled!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Ning Clan survivors swallowed their saliva and watched on in amazement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The rocky field continued breaking apart, and fierce flames erupted from countless cracks. Orange-gold lava splattered everywhere, bringing with it terrifying heat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"The Lava Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"The immortal palace has emerged!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Many people found themselves speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">That which had been hidden deep underground now revealed its true grandeur, shocking the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">[^1]: zhang - ‰∏à ‚Äì Ancient Chinese unit of measurement equivalent to 3.3 meters, or around ten feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
