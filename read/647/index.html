<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Light Goose struggled weakly in Luo Si's grasp. The seal's power had significantly weakened, causing the magic treasure's aura to intermittently leak out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This aura felt familiar to Ning Zhuo. He immediately recalled the magical ruler he had seen on the battlefield of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">That ruler had been clearly thrown by the City Lord of White Paper Immortal City, possessing extraordinary power that swept all before it on the battlefield!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">However, later, Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin had taken Ning Zhuo through the Curved Path directly into the Underworld, bypassing the subsequent defensive battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Therefore, he was unaware that the City Lord's Clone had taken the ruler out of the city to pursue the enemy, transforming it into a Light Goose to attack Luo Si's forces, ultimately losing this Legacy Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">So, while the Light Goose itself felt unfamiliar to Ning Zhuo, its aura was unmistakably familiar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He turned to Luo Si. "Could this be..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Before he could finish, Luo Si nodded, confirming that the Light Goose was indeed the transformed ruler. He had captured and sealed it on the battlefield, carrying it with him ever since.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up, his gaze fixed intently on the Light Goose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">His heart stirred. The goose's form inevitably reminded him of a crucial piece of information—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">that prophetic poem!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ghost tides surge, White Paper in peril,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">A lone goose carries a candle, piercing heaven’s veil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The guest star appears in the north of the literary pivot,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">Myriad Manifestations Lamp ignites, shattering calamity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">The City Lord's Paper Doll Clone had revealed this prophetic poem to Ning Zhuo from the beginning, believing him to be the savior destined to resolve White Paper Immortal City's great calamity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">Ning Zhuo had always believed this to be true.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">"This prophetic poem was divined by Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">"It was a prediction made to resolve White Paper Immortal City's calamity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">"Don't forget, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord suffered Divine Retribution from the Living Realm's Heaven. It's highly likely that the Living Realm's Destiny is secretly aiding Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">"The prophetic poem she divined was almost certainly prepared for me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">"Could this be the correct method for me to defeat the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and dismantle his century-long scheme?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">Although Ning Zhuo's literary cultivation might not match that of a Confucian cultivator like Wen Ruanyu, his foundation was still remarkably solid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">During his time in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he spent years immersed in the Library Pavilion, devouring countless books.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">Therefore, he knew: the Lone Wild Goose often refers to a solitary wild goose, a common imagery in poetry. Many poets use the Lone Wild Goose's mournful cry and solitary figure to express their own feelings of loneliness, wandering, and political disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">Could this Light Goose be the perfect embodiment of the "Lone Wild Goose" in the prophetic poem?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">After making this natural connection, Ning Zhuo instructed Luo Si, "Release the seal slightly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">Luo Si: ?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">A simple guess, so shallow, wasn't enough to warrant such a command from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">The key was that after seeing the Light Goose, a profound sense arose within him, as if he could control her!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">It was miraculous, this feeling so natural, like hands and feet belonging to the body, imbuing him with innate confidence in his ability to command her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Luo Si's expression turned solemn. After a moment's consideration, he decided to follow Ning Zhuo's instructions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">Though he didn't understand and felt it was risky, he remembered that he had only recently joined the group and needed to demonstrate greater obedience. He also thought of the Ash Bone Elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">Luo Si carefully channeled his energy, slightly loosening the seal. As the restraints lessened, the Light Goose instantly became more lively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">The Light Goose began to struggle fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">Her remaining power was rapidly being drained by the seal's resistance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Luo Si's face flushed crimson as he forcefully channeled more spiritual energy to reinforce the seal and suppress the Light Goose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">The Light Goose's struggles grew increasingly violent, causing Luo Shang to lose his grip, his entire upper body swaying violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">Every member of the Qing-Jiao Army had participated in the defense of White Paper Immortal City and had witnessed firsthand the divine might of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">Having just learned Light Goose's identity from Luo Si and Ning Zhuo's conversation, the soldiers instinctively took large steps back as they watched her struggle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">Ning Zhuo, however, was incredibly bold. He stepped forward and reached out his hand to Light Goose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">"Little Ma!" Qing Chi cried out, her voice filled with concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">Ning Zhuo knew that if he didn't stop her, Qing Chi's impulsive nature would make her run over and embrace him. He turned to her with a confident smile. "Don't worry. I'm chosen by the heavens, the savior of White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Qing Chi was captivated by Ning Zhuo's confident smile, hesitating. "But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">Qing Yan placed a hand on her shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">Ning Zhuo turned back to Light Goose, slowly extending his hand, gradually closing the distance between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">Sensing Ning Zhuo's presence, Light Goose miraculously stopped struggling. She raised her head and returned his gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">This extraordinary phenomenon caused a collective gasp from the onlookers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Luo Si's pupils widened, his expectations for Ning Zhuo growing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">As Ning Zhuo continued to reach out, Light Goose grew increasingly calm, her earlier agitation completely gone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">Yet Luo Si's expression grew more serious. Though his confidence in Ning Zhuo had grown, as the commanding general, he remained vigilant and wary of all possible dangers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">Ning Zhuo feared that Light Goose's calm was merely superficial, concealing a potential eruption. He secretly gathered his strength, preparing for any crisis that might arise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">Ning Zhuo's hand drew ever closer to Light Goose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">This was undoubtedly a risky move!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">His mouth went dry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">He had witnessed firsthand how the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale instantly disintegrated Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer. This magical scale was incredibly powerful, capable of overwhelming even Golden Core cultivators with a single strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">Ning Zhuo himself was merely at the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Yet despite his inner anxiety, Ning Zhuo maintained a composed facade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">"The Mechanism Ring remains silent," he thought. "This means I'm in no danger!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">He continued to extend his hand toward Light Goose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Light Goose lifted her head, nuzzled Ning Zhuo's palm, and let out a resonant cry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">The sound, like a wave of white light, radiated outward in concentric ripples, spreading rapidly through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">The light swept over Ning Zhuo without causing any harm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Nor were the nearby cultivators affected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Ning Zhuo's heart swelled with joy. Though he didn't understand why, the smile on his face grew increasingly confident and assured. He declared in a clear voice, "Just as I expected!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Jiao Ma's Father's lips trembled with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">He shouted inwardly, "The magic treasure has acknowledged its master! Such a powerful treasure has actually submitted to Jiao Ma. Doesn't that mean it belongs to our Jiao Clan by right? Fantastic! This is fantastic!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Qing Chi clasped her fists in excitement. "Little Ma, you're amazing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Her eyes sparkled with admiration for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Qing Yan frowned. "But what exactly is going on here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Ning Zhuo knew about the prophetic poem, but he hadn't revealed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">How would I know the reason? Ning Zhuo thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Just as he was debating whether to share the prophetic poem to gather everyone's wisdom, Luo Si had already put the pieces together. "So that's how it is."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Ning Zhuo was secretly surprised, but the smile on his lips widened. Adopting a questioning pose, he looked at Luo Si. "Explain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Luo Si seized the opportunity to show off. "The Profound Primordial Scholar created the White Paper Immortal City. The City Lord's Paper Doll Clone is his Legacy Treasure. And this magic ruler was likely left behind by him as well. Young Master, since you are the savior of the White Paper Immortal City and the chosen one of the Living Realm's Destiny, the Profound Primordial Scholar must have foreseen this calamity long ago and made preparations to resolve it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Qing Chi couldn't help but exclaim, "I know the Profound Primordial Scholar! He died so long ago—could he really predict so far into the future? And with such precision?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Luo Si glanced at Qing Chi, confirming once more that the Ghostmen girl was rather naive. Didn't she notice that no one else was asking such a question?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Luo Si's response served two purposes: first, to address Ning Zhuo's query and offer an explanation; second, to publicly speculate and create a space for hopeful imagination, thereby boosting the army's morale and spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">Therefore, even if one harbored doubts about this conjecture, they should keep them to themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Qing Yan cleared his throat and declared loudly, "Exactly! Lord Luo Si's conjecture must be the truth!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">As Qing Chi's father and a seasoned Golden Core cultivator with vast life experience, he immediately spoke up to compensate for his daughter's oversight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Jiao Ma's biological father, however, trembled violently, his entire body shaking with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">He began to daydream again: "My Jiao Ma is a great savior, making the Profound Primordial Scholar's Legacy Treasure come to him of its own accord. If that's the case, then the White Paper Immortal City must also be the Profound Primordial Scholar's legacy—a treasure left by him too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">"My Jiao Ma should rightfully control the White Paper Immortal City! At the very least, he definitely qualifies!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">"If one day Jiao Ma becomes the City Lord of the White Paper Immortal City, wouldn't our Jiao Clan then..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Jiao Ma's biological father's scalp tingled with the thrill of possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">We're rich, we're rich!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Hearing this exchange among the senior officers, the entire Qing-Jiao Army erupted in chatter, buzzing with speculation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">As Luo Si had predicted, the Qing-Jiao Army's Military Heart remained remarkably stable, their morale steadily rising, and their Military Might soaring accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered with realization.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Luo Si's answer had filled in the missing piece of information, instantly revealing the true reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">"I was once granted the position of Vice City Lord by the White Paper City Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">"Although within the White Paper Immortal City, this title was largely honorary, carrying little real authority, it was nevertheless genuine and not a falsehood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">"Now it seems that as a Legacy Treasure, the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale is also under my control due to my position as Vice City Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Ning Zhuo then recalled the City Lord's Paper Doll Clone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">"That too was likely a Legacy Treasure of the Profound Primordial Scholar, later acquired by the City Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Having grasped the situation, Ning Zhuo turned to address the assembled Qing-Jiao Army, proclaiming loudly, "Indeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">"I am the savior of the White Paper Immortal City—no, of the entire Ghostly Black Marshlands! I am the Child of Destiny of the Living Realm's Heaven, and above all, the greatest tribulation for the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">"So what if the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is the Monarch of the Underworld Prefecture?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">"He has acted against the natural order, bringing calamity upon all living beings, plotting for a century solely for his own gain!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">"Such an evil entity is destined for utter defeat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"Our army of justice is certain to triumph!" Ning Zhuo declared, seizing the moment to boost morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">The entire army erupted in cheers!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">In that instant, Ning Zhuo's prestige within the Qing-Jiao Army soared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">The soldiers were electrified, sharing a common belief: this would be a legendary battle, destined to be widely celebrated and passed down for at least a century. And they wouldn't just witness it—they would be active participants. What an honor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Luo Si exhaled a long breath, his confidence surging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Adding another seal would have required a tremendous sacrifice. Having just slain Immortal Hanyan, he was already in a weakened state. By avoiding that effort, he felt far more prepared for the critical battle to come.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">The Light Goose, now completely freed from its seal, circled and danced around Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Ning Zhuo extended his divine sense toward it and effortlessly took control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">"Go," he commanded, pointing at the churning Turbid Miasma before them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Obediently, the Light Goose flapped its wings and plunged into the Massive Turbid Qi Miasma. Wherever it went, the swirling turbid qi was separated and dispersed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Yet even after being analyzed and dispersed, the qi remained turbid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">After circling once, the Light Goose returned to Ning Zhuo's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">The turbid qi had merely been diluted slightly by its analysis, quickly thickening again into its original roiling mass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">The soldiers' soaring hopes crashed down, replaced by a chorus of disappointed sighs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Standing with his back to the Qing-Jiao Army, Ning Zhuo felt an overwhelming pressure weighing down on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">He frowned deeply, scrutinizing the Light Goose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">He observed the Light Goose's form growing significantly dimmer. Her once-solid, lifelike body had thinned and become translucent, revealing the faint outline of a treasured ruler within her core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">"According to Luo Si, the Light Goose's current form is a spell conjured by the City Lord Clone, using her spiritual energy," he thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">"No matter how much spiritual energy the City Lord Clone initially invested, it's still finite."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">"After just one flight around, the remaining energy likely only allows for one more activation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">Ning Zhuo keenly understood the situation and sighed inwardly: "My cultivation is still too weak!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">He was only at the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">By leveraging superior tools like Military Might and the Five Organs Temple Divine Technique, and drawing upon the profound reserves of his body and soul, he could unleash Nascent Soul-level combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">This was remarkably rare and exaggerated, but his cultivation still held him back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">There was truly no other way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">He could blame his youth and insufficient cultivation time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">He could also blame the Three Sects' Supreme Methods, which, while allowing simultaneous cultivation of the Three Dantian, greatly slowed his progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">Sweat beaded on Ning Zhuo's forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">This was his last chance. He had to seize it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">Fortunately, he wasn't completely clueless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">He recalled the prophetic poem once more:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">Ghost tides surge, White Paper in peril,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">A lone goose carries a candle, piercing heaven’s veil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">The guest star appears in the north of the literary pivot,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Myriad Manifestations Lamp ignites, shattering calamity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Lone Wild Goose carries candle, shatters Heavenly Veil...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Lone Wild Goose, I know, is just another name for Light Goose. This Heavenly Veil... isn't it just the Massive Turbid Qi Miasma before my eyes?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"The Lone Wild Goose must carry a candle to pierce the Heavenly Veil. But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"A candle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Where would I get a candle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"I don't have any candlelight!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Wait!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Actually, I think I do."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">With this realization, a sudden insight flashed in Ning Zhuo's divine sea, and his heart raced with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">He himself hadn't possessed one, but Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had once used the Return to Silence Path Candle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">During the previous defense of White Paper Immortal City, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had opened the South City Gate and used the Return to Silence Path Candle to pierce through space, creating a Curved Path that allowed numerous powerful forces to be teleported into the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">This had posed a grave threat to the defenders, nearly leading to the city's downfall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Tie Guzheng, Ning Zhuo, the Qing-Jiao Army, Wen Ruanyu, and others had thrown everything they had into stabilizing the situation. Ultimately, the City Lord of White Paper Immortal City had personally intervened, unleashing the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale to disperse Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer and the other invaders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The partially burned Return to Silence Path Candle, reduced to less than half its original length, had been disassembled—wax, wick, and flame all separated, the flame extinguished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">In full view of the crowd, Ning Zhuo reached into his storage pouch and pulled out the remaining half of the wickless candle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The candle's body was square, resembling a miniature Spirit Coffin. Its original length had been about nine inches, but now only four inches remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The coffin lid fit perfectly onto the coffin body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">All four sides of the candle were engraved with scenes of the "Hundred Ghosts Carrying the Coffin."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
