<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Qi Refining, peak of the third level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zheng Jian’s soul was drawn into the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">As soon as he received the entry message, his innate talent of Heart-Piercing Insight activated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Pass through Room 1 and enter Room 2?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He subconsciously began circulating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Soon after, he placed his hand on the door. When it came time to choose his reward, he held his breath and concentrated hard, trying to trigger his Heart-Piercing Insight again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Nothing happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Zheng Jian wasn’t discouraged. After analyzing things clearly, he chose the mechanical component reward and received a hanging ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Although he wasn’t particularly skilled in mechanical arts, he had deep knowledge of artifact crafting and soon figured out the way to use it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">But just as he was about to push the door open, an incomparable terror swept through his heart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“I’ll die! I’ll die! I’ll die!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The premonition given by his Heart-Piercing Insight shook him to the core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Zheng Jian gritted his teeth and forced out his courage. “So, there’s a life-and-death situation behind this door?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“How can I be sure if I don’t see it with my own eyes?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He pushed the door open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He walked through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In the underground prison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo gently loosened the chains and told Han Ming, “You’ve been working hard these days. Have a good rest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The chains he had always used to bind Han Ming forced her to constantly stand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">But Han Ming had now changed her attitude and was actively offering up her soul essence to Ning Zhuo. Thus, Ning Zhuo had gradually loosened her constraints. And today, he loosened the chains to the point that Han Ming could finally lie down on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Han Ming was already very tired. The moment she touched the ground, her eyes closed and she fell asleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo absorbed the soul essence in the Soul Capturing Shuttle. When he finished, he found that his soul power was almost fifty times greater than it was originally!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Thanks to my soul foundation, all those Golden Flake Jade Dew Cakes, and lots of medicinal pills, my soul refining has continued progressing rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Demonic techniques are usually very fast, but this Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Incantation isn’t slow either.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Right now, Ning Zhuo had cultivated both techniques to the first level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">His cultivation speed was far faster than in the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Almost every day, he saw visible progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He was completely addicted to cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Zheng Jian gathered his strength and flung open the first door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zhou Zhu gritted his teeth and pushed open the first door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zheng Jian: “Hmph, I’ll try something different. This time, I’ll use the hanging ring to block the hammer above my head. That should by me a little time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zhou Zhu: “If I do it how Ah Shen told me, I should be able to break through this time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">First place in all five rankings!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Essence Refining, second level. Spirit Refining, second level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo happily received his rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He was always in need of spirit stones, so he chose this option twice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Two hundred spirit stones immediately appeared in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">There was no way around it. Zhou Zhu and Zheng Jian had joined the race, causing Ning Zhuo’s traps to be used up faster and faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">With his remaining three choices, Ning Zhuo picked two spells and one mechanical component.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He had tested things out already. Even if he chose a spell that he already knew, it would still grant him a deeper understanding, allowing him to save a lot of time and energy. It was very cost-effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">As for the mechanical component… His previous conjecture had already been verified. The mechanical components obtained from the ranking rewards would hold over to the next exploration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">However, most of the mechanical components he obtained this way were used to set traps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Because of Ning Zhuo’s arrangements, Zhou Zhu and Zheng Jian’s feelings about the immortal palace exploration turned from surprise to shock, then pain, and finally despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Why, why is it so difficult?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“It’s been so long, and we can’t even get past the first door?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu looked at each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">They had met up a long time ago and confirmed each other’s identities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“We can’t go on like this. Zhou Zhu, our only hope of passing is if we work together.” Zheng Jian was the first to propose cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Zhou Zhu nodded. “Sure. You go in first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zheng Jian stared at him in shock. “Are you kidding me? Look at how tall you are, you’re basically a pillar. We’ll go in at the same time, and I’ll rush through while you’re blocking the hammer.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Why can’t you be the one blocking it for me?” Zhou Zhu retorted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Neither of them could convince the other, and for a while, they were stuck in a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">They weren’t willing to give away free benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Through a hidden mechanical component, Ning Zhuo later observed this scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Looks like the Zhou Clan, Zheng Clan, and City Lord Mansion will team up soon.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo knew clearly that this was inevitable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Alone, they couldn’t even pass the first door. Only by working together would there be hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In fact, the top leaders of the Zhou Clan and Zheng Clan had already reached the conclusion that sincere cooperation was a part of the test!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Zhou Clan said, “Three Schools Supreme Sage is full of compassion. He wants us to coexist peacefully and cooperate with each other.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Zheng Clan agreed. “Yes, this must be the case. The Lava Immortal Palace has already emerged, and news is spreading rapidly. We must seize this period of time, cooperate sincerely, and conquer the immortal palace before the outside world can react!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">After reaching an agreement, the Zhou Clan and Zheng Clan secretly contacted the City Lord Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Meng Chong was called over, and when he learned the reason behind the visit, he snorted in disdain. “Only the weak have to work together. The truly strong should walk alone!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Having successfully completed his special training, Meng Chong was once again brought into the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">As the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit watched in anticipation, he pushed the door to Room 2 open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Crackle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">With a slight noise, bursting electricity erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The net came to scoop him up, but it was a moment late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The heavy hammer slammed down, but caught empty air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Transparent wires stretched between the walls. Meng Chong quickly located each one, flew through the gaps, and rushed past all the obstacles!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">His head was held high as he stood in front of the second door. “Hmph, that’s all there is to this Room 2.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After choosing the spirit stone reward, he flung the door open and strode into Room 3.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">In Room 3, thirty to forty kung fu puppets raised their heads in unison. Their eyes emitted dazzling yellow light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo had frozen these puppets in later levels and painstakingly relocated them to Room 3.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Meng Chong: …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">A while later, his soul returned to his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Due to overusing his immortal talent, Meng Chong’s cheeks were sunken in, and the deep bags under his eyes had turned purplish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Room 3 is even harder!” Eyes full of ferocity, he wanted to get up and start cultivating. However, he was too tired; as soon as he moved, his vision went black and he directly fell asleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“As expected of a super-grade innate talent.” Ning Zhuo sighed sincerely after watching the recorded video of Meng Chong passing the level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Although Meng Chong is still fighting alone, his success will definitely provoke the Zhou Clan and Zheng Clan into joining forces faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Now that they have first-hand experience, the three forces will definitely do their best to have others recultivate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“Soon, I’ll be facing full teams of cultivators.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo was gradually feeling the pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">More people would cause more trouble. If Ning Zhuo was seen entering and exiting the immortal palace, it would sharply increase his chances of being exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">One day, he entered the Lava Immortal Palace again and found a shocking scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“What’s going on!?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">In Room 2, all the traps had been destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Thousand Jun Heavy Hammer Platform was shoved up against a wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The giant swinging logs were all shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Everything was a mess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo quickly picked up the hidden recorder to see what had happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The next moment, he was completely shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
