<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Realizing that mastering this technique required gradual refinement, Ning Zhuo decided there was no need to rush. He ended the cultivation session.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Qing Chi, reluctant to part, pressed him about when their next session would be. When she learned they would be held daily, her face lit up with genuine joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo reminded her to practice diligently what she had learned today and to keep the Mechanical Puppet's talisman learning strictly confidential. Qing Chi nodded emphatically and swore an oath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo naturally trusted her implicitly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Among those he trusted, Sun Lingtong held the undisputed top position, his status unshakeable. Qing Chi ranked second, followed by Gongsun Yan and then Old Chef.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Gongsun Yan's reliance on Ning Zhuo created a natural foundation of trust, surpassing that of Old Chef. Old Chef and Wen Ruanyu shared a similar level of trust; the former was driven by gratitude, while the latter held Meng Yao Yin Yue in deep reverence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo placed Snow-Colored Maiden Hui in the cultivation chamber, instructing her to continue practicing talisman creation. Each successful attempt, even without competition, filled her with pride.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo had confirmed that as long as external interference was minimal, Mechanical Puppets like Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, once they mastered a talisman, would achieve a 100% success rate in subsequent attempts!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"But the talismans she produces are all Low-Grade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"There's still immense room for improvement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Crafting talismans is similar to alchemy, with distinct grades. Cultivators with profound talisman-making skills have a far greater chance of producing High-Grade talismans compared to ordinary practitioners.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">In this regard, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui revealed a weakness inherent to Mechanical Puppets - she could only guarantee the bare minimum, the production of Low-Grade talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo remained unperturbed. "Crafting talismans is also about understanding spells and other techniques. For instance, if I focus solely on Five Elements talismans and achieve sufficient mastery, I'll likely be able to produce High-Grade ones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Of course, this is limited to Foundation Establishment-level talismans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">While Golden Core-level talismans could also be crafted, Ning Zhuo's cultivation level restricted his success rate, resulting in mostly Low-Grade products.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Naturally, this was also due to his current talisman-making skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">As his proficiency improved, both the quality and success rate of crafting talismans beyond his cultivation level would increase dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">For cultivators who had mastered Grandmaster-level techniques, crafting talismans one level above their cultivation was commonplace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">After settling Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, Ning Zhuo retrieved the Snow Pivot Imperial Art: Repose for inspection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Divine Art: Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo quickly confirmed that Snow Pivot Imperial Art: Repose had not yet reached the Spirit Resonance Stage. Based on his assessment, it still had some distance to go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He couldn't help but compare it to Yuan Dasheng, leading him to speculate further: "The progress of spiritual energy seems to be related to one's Innate Talent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Yuan Dasheng possesses Immortal-Grade Righteous Bone, Golden Resilience, which explains why his emotions were so intense during the Spirit Resonance Stage, allowing him to pass through it quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Ning Xiaohui has Superior-Grade Heavenly Gift: Ice-Jade Hands. Once she entered the Puppet Body, she swiftly reached the Spirit Resonance Stage. Her emotions weren't as intense, requiring more time to express them, but the process was more stable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Ning Xie's Innate Talent is only low-grade: Snow Soul Ice Spirit. It will likely take her even longer to reach the Spirit Resonance Stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"How can I accelerate her progress?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Should I use a Mechanism Body better suited to the Snow Soul Ice Spirit?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo's thoughts drifted further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"This brings us to another critical question: How to cultivate spiritual energy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Could I find relevant scriptures within the Myriad Manifestations Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Would directly searching for secrets related to spiritual energy be considered taboo? If noticed by someone with ulterior motives, what would be the specific risks?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo had long been aware of the immense danger hidden within his Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra. If exposed, his situation would become extremely precarious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Spiritual Discourse incident had already been a risky venture. Delving deeper would only invite powerful enemies, a disastrous outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"We need a more cautious approach."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"It's best if I stay out of this and let the boss handle it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"His disguise skills are far superior to mine!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">When Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong ventured out, they had agreed on a clear division of labor: Ning Zhuo would operate openly, while Sun Lingtong would work in the shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Given the nature of this task, Sun Lingtong was the more suitable choice. His skills were better suited for this kind of operation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo sheathed his Snow Pivot Imperial Art: Repose and used Life Hanging by a Thread to contact Sun Lingtong, informing him of the plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Sun Lingtong immediately agreed without hesitation. "Alright, I'm on board. We just need to find the relevant texts first. Perhaps it would be easier to teleport to an Immortal City and purchase them directly from the All-Book Pavilion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered. "Every Immortal City is heavily guarded, making it easy to leave traces. If we're going that route, we might as well stay in White Paper Immortal City. They have an All-Book Pavilion right here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong shook his head, disagreeing. "No! We have assets there too. The Qing-Jiao Army is under our control, and the current White Paper City Lord owes us a favor. Though it was a stroke of luck, we risked our lives to establish that foundation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Even if things don't work out in the Southern Bean Kingdom, this place will be a major fallback for us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Don't take risks in White Paper Immortal City. Even rabbits don't eat the grass near their burrows."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Lingtong, with his deeply ingrained thieving instincts, was highly sensitive to the security arrangements of safe houses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo was persuaded. "You're right. We'll look for another opportunity later. Spirit Cultivation isn't an urgent matter right now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Boss, how's your research on the Demonic Talisman from the Tiger Demon's corpse going? And what about the Academy Notes Shen Xi gave us?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Earlier, during their secret exchange, Ning Zhuo had handed over both items to Sun Lingtong for research.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo had also told Sun Lingtong the full story of his feud with Pi Fujie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sun Lingtong: "I've studied the Demonic Talisman. It matches the intelligence we have: the Pi Family uses cultivators' skin as material, employing techniques from Papercraft Art to carve talismans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Since these talismans must be inscribed on living bodies, they can't use conventional materials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"That's why they chose souls as their primary ingredient. The closer the soul's type and attributes are to the talisman's target, the better the talisman will align with its intended purpose."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The two Demonic Talismans - one for enhanced defense and the other for comprehensive speed enhancement - also align with the intelligence you provided."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"However, they all employ unconventional talisman techniques, forming seamless wholes that make it difficult to find an entry point for comprehension."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Even with the aid of the Luoshu pages, I'm struggling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Sun Lingtong paused, then shifted the topic. "On the other hand, I've been making rapid progress with Shen Xi's Academy Notes on the Nine Palaces Formation, thanks to the Luoshu pages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"I've already grasped over half of the content. Shall I teach you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">If Shen Xi were here, he would be astonished. Sun Lingtong's aptitude for array formation was truly exceptional.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "I'd rather study it myself first and absorb some of the Luoshu pages' essence. Once I have some results, I'll discuss it with you, Elder Brother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Given enough time, Ning Zhuo preferred to delve into things independently, honing his comprehension skills. Sun Lingtong had reminded him of this back on Hidden Mist Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo was an obedient and diligent student, always keeping Sun Lingtong's guidance firmly in mind and actively putting it into practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Hearing Ning Zhuo's choice, Sun Lingtong nodded approvingly in the Jade Rinse Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After ending the communication, Ning Zhuo began his daily cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He first activated the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat to temper his physical body. The oppressive force exerted by the million souls on his flesh had already been reduced by more than half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat remained his primary focus, with Old Chef's Spirit Food serving only as a supplementary aid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo then resumed contemplating the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He remained dissatisfied with his progress in comprehending this cultivation art, though each session yielded some insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Currently, he was stuck at the Lower Dantian of the Essence Sea stage of the Phenomenal Seed Talisman phase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"By nature, I am kind-hearted and a true practitioner of the Righteous Path. I possess a natural aptitude for Buddhist Dharma and have always found joy in helping others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"For the sake of the innocent citizens of White Paper Immortal City, I risked my life to fight the Soul Formation-level Forgetful River Prefecture Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"With such a disposition, this Demonic Art truly doesn't suit me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Alas, the Red Flower Seal persists. If Lin You could provide another Demonic Art, it might offer some reference points."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Perhaps I should acquire some Demonic Arts outside the Myriad Manifestations Sect. I'll have Elder Brother handle that..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo held high expectations for Lin You. Having witnessed the Lord of the Demonic Heart Cave's methods firsthand, he felt strongly that this art could prove helpful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">However, he had no particular feelings about other Demonic Arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Surely some Demonic Arts must contain principles similar to the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But here lay the problem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">On one hand, Ning Zhuo had no idea how to select these Demonic Arts. This would inevitably require a tremendous amount of time and effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He couldn't delegate this task to anyone else, as it concerned his core cultivation art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">On the other hand, the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art was a top-tier cultivation art. Any comparable cultivation art would also be of extremely high quality and correspondingly expensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Even without checking the prices, Ning Zhuo knew that acquiring these cultivation arts would cost a fortune.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">With his current low status, he certainly wouldn't qualify to purchase them from the All-Book Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">This presented another layer of difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The situation would be the same within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo estimated that he would need to become at least a Golden Core True Disciple before he might have a chance to obtain cultivation arts of this caliber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This also indirectly highlighted the immense value of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Meng Yaoyin's dying words to the two-year-old Ning Zhuo, urging him to seize this opportunity, were not without reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">After cultivating for two days, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong secretly met again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo retrieved the Tiger Demon's corpse and Shen Xi's Academy Notes Jade Slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sun Lingtong had already processed the Tiger Demon's corpse, skinning it, removing its tendons, and disassembling its organs, flesh, and bones. These could be sold or used as ingredients for future alchemy and crafting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The soul of the Material Tiger Demon, skilled in crafting artifacts, arranging formations, creating talismans, and building mechanisms, was securely sealed within a talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">This talisman, known as the Soul-Dwelling Talisman, was a talisman-making technique developed by the Soul Devouring Sect. After Ning Zhuo acquired nearly all of Tian Shuang's wealth, he discovered a vast collection of Soul Cultivator manuals among his possessions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Sun Lingtong, who typically concealed himself within the Mechanical Dragon, used his spare time to study these texts while honing his cultivation. The Soul-Dwelling Talisman was relatively simple, so he learned it with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"This talisman can only temporarily store souls," Sun Lingtong cautioned. "If kept too long, the soul may dissipate, become fragmented, and degrade in quality."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Tian Shuang's original possessions included jade bottles for storing souls, but Ning Zhuo had already used them as resources to build his army. Neither Ning Zhuo nor Sun Lingtong regretted this decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Such Magic Artifacts and magic treasures were merely auxiliary tools, and they belonged to Tian Shuang. Re-sacrificing them would have been time-consuming. The Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts were no ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Moreover, the grand plan for the Qingjiao Military Pass concerned life and death, making full commitment essential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo nodded. "The upcoming military exercises will likely yield more souls. We should prepare some soul-storing jade bottles in advance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"But as a member of the Righteous Path, it's not convenient for me to purchase them openly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sun Lingtong chuckled, eagerly chiming in, "It's just a small matter. I'll handle the purchase."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo nodded enthusiastically. "Mm-hmm!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The Tiger Demon's corpse had been properly disposed of, leaving the tiger skin as its most valuable remnant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The skin bore both the Burning Blood Surge Talisman and the Thousand-Layer Scale Skin Talisman, and remained remarkably intact. With a simple infusion of spiritual energy, it could still be activated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">This was largely thanks to Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's freezing kill, which had preserved the Tiger Demon's corpse in perfect condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"So, this counts as a Magic Artifact," Ning Zhuo mused, channeling spiritual energy into the skin. The tiger skin rapidly expanded, coalescing into a lifelike form that dropped to the ground, stood upright, and transformed into the shape of a Tiger Demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The skin was so lifelike, it seemed as if the Tiger Demon had been resurrected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Papercraft Art..." Ning Zhuo realized, sensing the profound techniques of Papercraft Art within it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">After all, he had encountered the Profound Primordial Scholar's secret army of Paper People hidden in the Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">In stark contrast to the Paper People's plain, unadorned appearance, this tiger skin radiated intense blood Qi and demonic Qi, its aura far more pronounced and its power fully unleashed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"My mother was also skilled in Papercraft Art, but she left me no related texts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"If the Paper Giant from White Paper Immortal City hadn't been burned down, I'd have a new Nascent Soul-level combatant at my disposal. What a pity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"If I ever get the chance, I'd like to learn Papercraft Art myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">In truth, Ning Zhuo wanted to learn everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">With sufficient spiritual energy, a Tiger Demon Zha Pi could wield the combat power of a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator. This served as a supplementary, albeit somewhat dispensable, addition to Ning Zhuo's combat capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo stored them all in his Storage Belt, then retrieved Shen Xi's Academy Jade Slip and began studying it intently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">According to Sun Lingtong, he had already deciphered most of the Jade Slip's contents. The Shen Family of Nine Palaces Immortal City indeed possessed considerable unique knowledge. However, the truly valuable insights remained untouched within the Jade Slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Sun Lingtong had warned Ning Zhuo, "This is likely the bait Shen Xi left for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo had already anticipated this, responding with a faint smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">As he delved into his studies, he quickly lost track of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Only when his mind grew hazy did he realize that half a day had already passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo gazed at the Jade Slip in his hand, a wry smile spreading across his face. "Even with the Academy Notes' extensive annotations and explanations, I can only grasp about thirty percent of the content."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"And that's with the aid of the Luoshu pages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Senior Brother's mastery of formation arts is far greater than I previously imagined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">First, Ning Zhuo had been humbled by Qing Chi's innate talent for talisman crafting, then he had marveled at Sun Lingtong's comprehension of formation arts, leaving him feeling inadequate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">If Shen Xi were to learn of this, he would undoubtedly feel both astonishment and shame. Even with the Luoshu pages' assistance, Ning Zhuo's demonstrated comprehension had already left him far behind.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
