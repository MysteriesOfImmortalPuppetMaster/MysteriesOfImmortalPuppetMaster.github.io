<br/>
Ning Zhuo took out a Mist Rust Orchid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Miss Lin, this is the first time I've left my hometown and traveled outside."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"After arriving at Cloud Concealment Mountain, I found a desire to climb higher.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúAfter turning a corner, the fog disappeared and I saw the clouds in the sky drifting, the sun rising, the mountains solemn, and the rivers flowing. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I saw a cliff and found several Mist Rust Orchids.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúThese Mist Rust Orchids were covered in mist, swaying gently as if a new world was beckoning to me. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I took these Mist Rust Orchids, holding them in my hand. Surprisingly, I felt something I had never felt before, a beautiful feeling.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúThe world is so vast and life is so wonderful, so close to the mountains and flowers. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Just like how I traveled the world and sought advice from everywhere. The road ahead is long and endless, but it also contains countless opportunities.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúI'm full of anticipation. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"That day, when I saw you at the back mountain of the Little Contention Peak, I felt the same as that day."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Miss Lin, you're beautiful and refined, these Mist Rust Orchids can't compare to you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's just that I feel that when I was picking flowers on the mountains that day before meeting you later on, it just seemed like a fateful encounter. It's like the heavens have been watching over me."<br/>
"Maybe, the Mist Rust Orchids only came to meet you through my hands.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Heroes appreciate each other and beauties sympathize with each other. <br/>
Lin Shanshan couldn't help but be attracted by Ning Zhuo's words.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's praise was full of romance and not vulgar at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He spoke of his "true feelings", which resonated with Lin Shanshan even more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan felt a lot of envy in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After all, in the past twenty one years, she only went out with her father occasionally to visit friends. She had never truly left the sect and traveled outside.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's description of the beautiful feeling of traveling alone deeply moved her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to step forward and hand over the Mist Rust Orchids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When Lin Shanshan reacted, she found that she was holding a Mist Rust Orchid in her hands.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She sighed in her heart and said emotionally, "I didn't know about your experience before, but now I know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then I'll take this Mist Rust Orchid. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed loudly, "Thank you, Miss Lin, for fulfilling this one's wish!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo asked Lin Shanshan to take a seat and poured tea for her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He said, "Miss Lin and I felt like old friends at first sight. Now that I think about the first time we met, I feel that it was fate and fate."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Through Li Jingqing and Han Zhou's matter, I gained a lot of inspiration."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Li Jingqing bought herbs and medicine from your sect." My Ning Family also has such a need for these items. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps through the two, we can both benefit if we work together.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Oh?" Lin Shanshan didn't expect Ning Zhuo‚Äôs sudden suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although Lin Shanshan had been cherished by her father's generation and senior brothers since she was young and did not involve herself too deeply, she was still a disciple of a large sect and had received relevant training since she was young.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She immediately got into the mood. The blush on her face faded, and she looked serious. After thinking about what to say, she gave Ning Zhuo a positive response.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
According to Ning Zhuo, his family had the combat capability of a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator. Therefore, they couldn't be underestimated and had to be treated as equals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo mentioned that he wanted to inspect the goods of the Myriad Medicine Sect and seek cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan and Ning Zhuo talked for a while. She said that she couldn't make the decision and had to report it first.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After saying goodbye to Lin Shanshan, Ning Zhuo began to cultivate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He took out a cushion and sat down. He closed his eyes and meditated, examining himself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dantian in the Divine Sea!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He saw the True Meaning of Bitter Cold. It hovered in a ball like clouds and mist. It was gloomy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The True Meaning of Bitter Cold was restrained by the Buddha Light. They didn't spread into Ning Zhuo's Divine Sea.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was the Buddha Heart Demon Seal that did this!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This Dharma treasure could turn people into demons and oneself into Buddha.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Outside, Ning Zhuo could play the role of a Heart Demon and silently influence others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Internally, he was able to guard himself and control the purity of his thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After the True Meaning of Bitter Cold entered Ning Zhuo's body, it immediately triggered the Buddha Heart Demonic Seal to protect its owner.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All the True Meanings were collected by the Buddha Light, restrained, and tightly controlled, waiting for Ning Zhuo to deal with them himself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo tried his best and barely affected some of the Buddha Heart Demonic Seal's power.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, the Buddha Light appeared in his Spirit Sea and continuously wore down the True Meanings of Bitter Cold. It turned into a pure and harmless feeling that flowed into Ning Zhuo's heart.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Bitter Cold Qi, Bitter Cold Sutra ‚Ä¶"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's understanding of the Bitter Cold Sutra increased rapidly!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Mastering the Bitter Cold Sutra allows one to greatly strengthen themselves through suffering and suffering.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As the saying goes, one can only rise above others after suffering the most hardships. When the heavens are about to give a person a great responsibility, they must first suffer hardships to strengthen their will and bones ‚Ä¶ "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"An excellent cultivation technique is one side of the principles of heaven and earth."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I've learned it, I've learned it."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo digested all the True Meanings of Bitter Cold and had a much deeper understanding of the Bitter Cold Sutra.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He was very happy and transmitted the good news to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When Sun Lingtong didn't go out, he stayed in the Thousand Mile Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo used the Mechanical Dragon as a belt and wore it on his body.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hearing the good news, Sun Lingtong was also happy for Ning Zhuo. "With my Buddha Heart Devil Seal, can't you take the wool of those bald donkeys?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"They let them use their cultivation techniques to teach you, but you took the opportunity to steal their techniques.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful, wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, "Not just me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Boss, if I lend you my Buddha Heart Devil Seal, you can use it too. "<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded. "Interesting. When there is a chance in the future, I want to try it."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said again, "Isn't there a chance now?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Boss, you can pretend to be someone else and fight with Han Zhou with my Buddha Heart Devil Seal. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said, "Can I do it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If my identity or my relationship with you is discovered, wouldn't it affect the next step of the plan? "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed. "Boss, don't I know your temperament?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I asked you to come here, but you have to stay in the Ten Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon. This is too much for you. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Boss, you've been helping me all this time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we were in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, it was fine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now that we're traveling, you have to sacrifice yourself for my purpose. I don't want to do that. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Even if we're discovered, it doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's think of another way. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suddenly understood. "I understand."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"You just talked to Lin Shanshan about the cooperation between the two sides to find another way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You want to exchange benefits for the Embryonic Breath Spirit Barge? "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"To tell you the truth, I am indeed quite down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've been itching to act since I came to the Ten Thousand Medicine Valley.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"This is an inheritance treasure. The price is not low."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said with a smile, "Let's wait and see."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong giggled. "Good, good, good. As expected of my disciple."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I'm going to go out and steal!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hahaha. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "Huh?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said again, "Don't worry, Little Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I know what I'm doing. After all, this is other people's territory. I won't be caught easily.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Second, I don't like that guy Li Jingqing very much.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dealing with him can be considered as revenge for you. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. "Boss, be careful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to get you out of the prison of the All Medicine Sect. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong couldn't wait any longer. He turned invisible, departed from the Ten Thousand Mile Swimming Dragon, and ran out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shouted, "Boss, take my Buddha Heart Devil Seal with you."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong waved her hand. "Wait. I'll find Li Jingqing first!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, he enjoyed the pleasure of stealing more than fighting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Being targeted by Boss Sun ‚Ä¶" Ning Zhuo secretly mourned for Li Jingqing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It turned out to be a mountain.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan came to the study and reported to her father about the cooperation with the Ning Family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When Lin Bufan heard that the Ning Family had Nascent Soul level power, he took it seriously.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He pondered and said, "You can further contact him and show him the strong foundation of our sect.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúTomorrow is the day when the goods are distributed. It's a very suitable opportunity to show the strength of our sect.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúDon't make promises easily. The specific content of the cooperation has to wait until the investigation results come back.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan nodded.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan glanced at his daughter and said casually, "What do you think of Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled. "He treats people with sincerity. I can feel his sincerity, just like the morning sun."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"He's also a straightforward and upright person. This can be seen from the way he treats Li Jingqing and Han Zhou."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"What's more precious is his modest and upright temperament.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even if he has a Gold Core Realm trump card, he still works hard to improve himself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's rare for someone of his background to have this kind of ambition. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"From this point of view, it's completely normal for him to have a better spell-casting foundation than me at such a young age."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"He also knows how to repay his debts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He even said that he would give me a spiritual talisman. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan couldn't help but take a breath.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he regretted arranging Lin Shanshan to receive Ning Zhuo just now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He had already said it. It was not good to take it back now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan thought for a while and said, "Distance tests a horse's strength, and time reveals a person's heart.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, I also had a good impression of Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But this is only the first impression.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We need to be careful. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled. "Dad, I understand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You've taught me these principles since I was young. I also know the information about Ning Zhuo and the Ning Family. However, what he said is all unconfirmed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was just one of the reasons. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Secondly, even if it's all true, I wouldn‚Äôt take the initiative to give up the interests of the sect just because I have a good impression of him! "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Dad, you're underestimating me by reminding me like this."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha!" Lin Bufan stroked his beard and laughed heartily. "Good, I'm too worried.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"My daughter is clear-headed!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not like Jiu 'er. He's so old, but He's still muddle-headed and greedy for the things in the cup! "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan took the opportunity to say, "Father, although Eldest Senior Brother is locked up, every time I visit him, he cares about you."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan snorted. "Old?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not old! "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Besides, does this kid have the time to do that?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Go away. Don't always try to plead when I'm in a good mood."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan waved his hand.<br/>
