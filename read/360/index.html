<paragraph index="2">Ning Zhuo took out a Mist Rust Orchid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Miss Lin, this is the first time I've left my hometown and traveled outside."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">"After arriving at Cloud Concealment Mountain, I found a desire to climb higher.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">‚ÄúAfter turning a corner, the fog disappeared and I saw the clouds in the sky drifting, the sun rising, the mountains solemn, and the rivers flowing. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">"I saw a cliff and found several Mist Rust Orchids.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">‚ÄúThese Mist Rust Orchids were covered in mist, swaying gently as if a new world was beckoning to me. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">"I took these Mist Rust Orchids, holding them in my hand. Surprisingly, I felt something I had never felt before, a beautiful feeling.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">‚ÄúThe world is so vast and life is so wonderful, so close to the mountains and flowers. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">"Just like how I traveled the world and sought advice from everywhere. The road ahead is long and endless, but it also contains countless opportunities.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">‚ÄúI'm full of anticipation. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">"That day, when I saw you at the back mountain of the Little Contention Peak, I felt the same as that day."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Miss Lin, you're beautiful and refined, these Mist Rust Orchids can't compare to you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">It's just that I feel that when I was picking flowers on the mountains that day before meeting you later on, it just seemed like a fateful encounter. It's like the heavens have been watching over me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Maybe, the Mist Rust Orchids only came to meet you through my hands.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">Heroes appreciate each other and beauties sympathize with each other. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Lin Shanshan couldn't help but be attracted by Ning Zhuo's words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">Ning Zhuo's praise was full of romance and not vulgar at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He spoke of his "true feelings", which resonated with Lin Shanshan even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">Lin Shanshan felt a lot of envy in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">After all, in the past twenty one years, she only went out with her father occasionally to visit friends. She had never truly left the sect and traveled outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Ning Zhuo's description of the beautiful feeling of traveling alone deeply moved her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to step forward and hand over the Mist Rust Orchids.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">When Lin Shanshan reacted, she found that she was holding a Mist Rust Orchid in her hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">She sighed in her heart and said emotionally, "I didn't know about your experience before, but now I know.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Then I'll take this Mist Rust Orchid. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo laughed loudly, "Thank you, Miss Lin, for fulfilling this one's wish!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">Ning Zhuo asked Lin Shanshan to take a seat and poured tea for her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He said, "Miss Lin and I felt like old friends at first sight. Now that I think about the first time we met, I feel that it was fate and fate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">"Through Li Jingqing and Han Zhou's matter, I gained a lot of inspiration."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Li Jingqing bought herbs and medicine from your sect." My Ning Family also has such a need for these items. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">"Perhaps through the two, we can both benefit if we work together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Oh?" Lin Shanshan didn't expect Ning Zhuo‚Äôs sudden suggestion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Although Lin Shanshan had been cherished by her father's generation and senior brothers since she was young and did not involve herself too deeply, she was still a disciple of a large sect and had received relevant training since she was young.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">She immediately got into the mood. The blush on her face faded, and she looked serious. After thinking about what to say, she gave Ning Zhuo a positive response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">According to Ning Zhuo, his family had the combat capability of a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator. Therefore, they couldn't be underestimated and had to be treated as equals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo mentioned that he wanted to inspect the goods of the Myriad Medicine Sect and seek cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Lin Shanshan and Ning Zhuo talked for a while. She said that she couldn't make the decision and had to report it first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">After saying goodbye to Lin Shanshan, Ning Zhuo began to cultivate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">He took out a cushion and sat down. He closed his eyes and meditated, examining himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Dantian in the Divine Sea!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">He saw the True Meaning of Bitter Cold. It hovered in a ball like clouds and mist. It was gloomy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The True Meaning of Bitter Cold was restrained by the Buddha Light. They didn't spread into Ning Zhuo's Divine Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">It was the Buddha Heart Demon Seal that did this!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This Dharma treasure could turn people into demons and oneself into Buddha.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">Outside, Ning Zhuo could play the role of a Heart Demon and silently influence others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Internally, he was able to guard himself and control the purity of his thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">After the True Meaning of Bitter Cold entered Ning Zhuo's body, it immediately triggered the Buddha Heart Demonic Seal to protect its owner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">All the True Meanings were collected by the Buddha Light, restrained, and tightly controlled, waiting for Ning Zhuo to deal with them himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Ning Zhuo tried his best and barely affected some of the Buddha Heart Demonic Seal's power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Immediately, the Buddha Light appeared in his Spirit Sea and continuously wore down the True Meanings of Bitter Cold. It turned into a pure and harmless feeling that flowed into Ning Zhuo's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">"Bitter Cold Qi, Bitter Cold Sutra ‚Ä¶"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo's understanding of the Bitter Cold Sutra increased rapidly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">"Mastering the Bitter Cold Sutra allows one to greatly strengthen themselves through suffering and suffering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">As the saying goes, one can only rise above others after suffering the most hardships. When the heavens are about to give a person a great responsibility, they must first suffer hardships to strengthen their will and bones ‚Ä¶ "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">"An excellent cultivation technique is one side of the principles of heaven and earth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"I've learned it, I've learned it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">Ning Zhuo digested all the True Meanings of Bitter Cold and had a much deeper understanding of the Bitter Cold Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He was very happy and transmitted the good news to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">When Sun Lingtong didn't go out, he stayed in the Thousand Mile Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo used the Mechanical Dragon as a belt and wore it on his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Hearing the good news, Sun Lingtong was also happy for Ning Zhuo. "With my Buddha Heart Devil Seal, can't you take the wool of those bald donkeys?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"They let them use their cultivation techniques to teach you, but you took the opportunity to steal their techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Wonderful, wonderful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo said, "Not just me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Boss, if I lend you my Buddha Heart Devil Seal, you can use it too. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Sun Lingtong nodded. "Interesting. When there is a chance in the future, I want to try it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Ning Zhuo said again, "Isn't there a chance now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Boss, you can pretend to be someone else and fight with Han Zhou with my Buddha Heart Devil Seal. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">Sun Lingtong said, "Can I do it?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">If my identity or my relationship with you is discovered, wouldn't it affect the next step of the plan? "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Ning Zhuo sighed. "Boss, don't I know your temperament?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">I asked you to come here, but you have to stay in the Ten Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon. This is too much for you. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">"Boss, you've been helping me all this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">When we were in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, it was fine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Now that we're traveling, you have to sacrifice yourself for my purpose. I don't want to do that. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Even if we're discovered, it doesn't matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Let's think of another way. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Sun Lingtong suddenly understood. "I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">"You just talked to Lin Shanshan about the cooperation between the two sides to find another way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">You want to exchange benefits for the Embryonic Breath Spirit Barge? "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">"To tell you the truth, I am indeed quite down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">I've been itching to act since I came to the Ten Thousand Medicine Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">"This is an inheritance treasure. The price is not low."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo said with a smile, "Let's wait and see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Sun Lingtong giggled. "Good, good, good. As expected of my disciple."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"I'm going to go out and steal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">Hahaha. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo: "Huh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">Sun Lingtong said again, "Don't worry, Little Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">First of all, I know what I'm doing. After all, this is other people's territory. I won't be caught easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">Second, I don't like that guy Li Jingqing very much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Dealing with him can be considered as revenge for you. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. "Boss, be careful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">I don't want to get you out of the prison of the All Medicine Sect. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">Sun Lingtong couldn't wait any longer. He turned invisible, departed from the Ten Thousand Mile Swimming Dragon, and ran out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ning Zhuo shouted, "Boss, take my Buddha Heart Devil Seal with you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">Sun Lingtong waved her hand. "Wait. I'll find Li Jingqing first!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Obviously, he enjoyed the pleasure of stealing more than fighting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="290">"Being targeted by Boss Sun ‚Ä¶" Ning Zhuo secretly mourned for Li Jingqing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">It turned out to be a mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="296">Lin Shanshan came to the study and reported to her father about the cooperation with the Ning Family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">When Lin Bufan heard that the Ning Family had Nascent Soul level power, he took it seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="302">He pondered and said, "You can further contact him and show him the strong foundation of our sect.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">‚ÄúTomorrow is the day when the goods are distributed. It's a very suitable opportunity to show the strength of our sect.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="308">‚ÄúDon't make promises easily. The specific content of the cooperation has to wait until the investigation results come back.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Lin Shanshan nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="314">Lin Bufan glanced at his daughter and said casually, "What do you think of Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Lin Shanshan smiled. "He treats people with sincerity. I can feel his sincerity, just like the morning sun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="320">"He's also a straightforward and upright person. This can be seen from the way he treats Li Jingqing and Han Zhou."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">"What's more precious is his modest and upright temperament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="326">Even if he has a Gold Core Realm trump card, he still works hard to improve himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">It's rare for someone of his background to have this kind of ambition. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="332">"From this point of view, it's completely normal for him to have a better spell-casting foundation than me at such a young age."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">"He also knows how to repay his debts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="338">He even said that he would give me a spiritual talisman. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">Lin Bufan couldn't help but take a breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="344">Suddenly, he regretted arranging Lin Shanshan to receive Ning Zhuo just now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">He had already said it. It was not good to take it back now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="350">Lin Bufan thought for a while and said, "Distance tests a horse's strength, and time reveals a person's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="353">Speaking of which, I also had a good impression of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="356">But this is only the first impression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="359">We need to be careful. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="362">Lin Shanshan smiled. "Dad, I understand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="365">You've taught me these principles since I was young. I also know the information about Ning Zhuo and the Ning Family. However, what he said is all unconfirmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="368">This was just one of the reasons. "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="371">"Secondly, even if it's all true, I wouldn‚Äôt take the initiative to give up the interests of the sect just because I have a good impression of him! "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="374">"Dad, you're underestimating me by reminding me like this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="377">"Hahaha!" Lin Bufan stroked his beard and laughed heartily. "Good, I'm too worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="380">"My daughter is clear-headed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="383">Not like Jiu 'er. He's so old, but He's still muddle-headed and greedy for the things in the cup! "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="386">Lin Shanshan took the opportunity to say, "Father, although Eldest Senior Brother is locked up, every time I visit him, he cares about you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="389">Lin Bufan snorted. "Old?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="392">I'm not old! "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="395">"Besides, does this kid have the time to do that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="398">"Go away. Don't always try to plead when I'm in a good mood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="401">Lin Bufan waved his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
