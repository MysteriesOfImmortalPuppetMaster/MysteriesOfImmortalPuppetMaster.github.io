<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 203: Royal Secret Letter</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Zhu Xuanji did not dwell too much on the faint doubts in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
His fingers caressed the panel, murmuring softly, "True Scripture..."<br/>
<br/>
The value of a True Scripture is extraordinary.<br/>
<br/>
Historically, there was once a righteous super sect called the Natural Sect.<br/>
<br/>
Its core technique was called the Natural Great Dao Scripture, reputed as the origin of all techniques, the mother scripture of heaven and earth.<br/>
<br/>
This title was not self-proclaimed by the disciples of the Natural Sect, nor was it an exaggeration, but it was recognized by the people of that time.<br/>
<br/>
It is said that the complete Natural Great Dao Scripture covered all stages of cultivation, yet it consisted of only three hundred oracle bone characters.<br/>
<br/>
The entire text was extremely profound and obscure, often requiring exceptional comprehension to grasp even a bit of the true cultivation mysteries.<br/>
<br/>
There were peerless geniuses who, after cultivating the Natural Great Dao Scripture successfully, condensed their insights into True Intent before their demise, compiling seven chapters of True Scriptures for Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Soul Formation, Void Refinement, and Integration stages.<br/>
<br/>
Later generations, regardless of their comprehension, could fully understand the essence of the True Scriptures upon contact.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, the Natural Sect flourished and became the number one sect in the world at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Its prosperity continued until the True Scriptures were stolen.<br/>
<br/>
Without the True Scriptures, the Natural Sect quickly declined and vanished within two hundred years.<br/>
<br/>
Although this example is extreme, it is enough to illustrate the value of a True Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
A single True Scripture could potentially create a powerful sect!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji did not know what the True Scripture on this Blood Path Panel was.<br/>
<br/>
But that did not stop him from speculating: "According to the royal records, the Three Sect Masters created the Three Sect Techniques in their later years, which included three techniques corresponding to the upper, middle, and lower dantian, cultivating the essence, qi, and spirit of a cultivator."<br/>
<br/>
"Could the True Scripture recorded on this Blood Path Panel be the technique for cultivating the Essence Sea in the lower dantian?"<br/>
<br/>
"Previously, the Transmission Bell widely spread the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, and the City Lord's Mansion's Meng Chong had already mastered the subsequent techniques through the trial."<br/>
<br/>
"What could the technique on the Blood Path Panel be?"<br/>
<br/>
"At the very least, it should be closely related to essence and blood."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's speculation was logical and based on evidence.<br/>
<br/>
His basis came from the Mechanical Demon General.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the Demon General's mechanism, he detected many mechanical components, one of which was specifically for refining blood and flesh (Blood Transformation Pool), and another for purifying (blood oil bottle).<br/>
<br/>
From Zhu Xuanji's perspective, he risked his life to retrieve the Mechanical Demon General and paid a great price to win over three Golden Core cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Before handing over the Demon General, he was very willing to retrieve the True Scripture to ensure his merit to the greatest extent.<br/>
<br/>
The only clue now lay before Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
"I need to find that little ape!"<br/>
<br/>
Even as a divine constable, facing different species, he was also face-blind.<br/>
<br/>
"The little ape came into contact with the Mechanical Demon General, causing the True Scripture to transfer voluntarily."<br/>
<br/>
"It must have innate talent and definitely not weak!"<br/>
<br/>
However, Zhu Xuanji recalled the recent fierce battle.<br/>
<br/>
In the lair of the Fire Fusion Demon Apes, he did not see any ape using any innate talent.<br/>
<br/>
Nor did he see any demon ape mastering any technique.<br/>
<br/>
From this point of view, they were all just demon beasts, not demon cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
They relied entirely on natural growth and species talent to possess combat power comparable to Foundation Establishment or Golden Core after reaching maturity.<br/>
<br/>
If they had also cultivated techniques, their combat power would have skyrocketed on the existing basis.<br/>
<br/>
However, all things balance, and the Heavenly Dao is impartial.<br/>
<br/>
Since the Fire Fusion Demon Apes had such good physical conditions, their comprehension in cultivation was lacking.<br/>
<br/>
Even the simplest and most basic techniques were difficult for most of them to comprehend in their lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
"Was the little ape not on the battlefield at that time?"<br/>
<br/>
"Did it leave the group, get expelled, or already die?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji kept guessing.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, beings with innate talent have vigorous fate energy and are not easily killed.<br/>
<br/>
"I don't know the exact time the little ape came into contact with the Mechanical Demon General."<br/>
<br/>
"If I had time, I could roughly calculate the little ape's current age."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if not for the merit, I must find this Fire Fusion Demon Ape!"<br/>
<br/>
The reason was simple.<br/>
<br/>
This was a True Scripture!<br/>
<br/>
Understanding a True Scripture requires very little comprehension.<br/>
<br/>
If the Fire Fusion Demon Apes comprehended the True Scripture on a large scale, they might eventually develop many demon cultivators in Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Demon cultivators are different from demon beasts.<br/>
<br/>
Due to cultivation, they often possess far superior intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
When they fight, they can cast spells and use tactics, making them far more threatening than demon beasts.<br/>
<br/>
"Did the Three Sect Masters not consider the possibility of the True Scripture being lost when they placed it in the Mechanical Demon General?"<br/>
<br/>
"If there really is a group of demon cultivators hidden in Fire Persimmon Mountain, it would be extremely terrifying!"<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, Zhu Xuanji's expression became solemn.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately wrote a letter, detailing his speculations and including a portrait of the little ape.<br/>
<br/>
He hoped the royal family could hire experts to deduce the adult appearance of the little ape and send it back to him.<br/>
<br/>
Then, using the royal family's unique secret communication method, he covered the letter, making it look like a chaotic scribble to outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
After sending the letter, he immediately began repairing the Mechanical Demon General.<br/>
<br/>
The Demon General had many parts that needed repair, both inside and out, numbering over a hundred.<br/>
<br/>
The most obvious injury was its left arm.<br/>
<br/>
Its left arm was broken, and the broken arm was something Zhu Xuanji found in the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji had considerable expertise in mechanical constructs, and he quickly immersed himself in observation, thinking of solutions.<br/>
<br/>
City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si managed and approved mundane affairs on behalf of Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
A piece of intelligence about Zhu Xuanji was delivered to Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh? Zhu Xuanji sent out a secret letter?"<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si immediately fell into thought.<br/>
<br/>
He always regarded Zhu Xuanji as his strongest competitor.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Zhu Xuanji led three Golden Core cultivators deep into Fire Persimmon Mountain, engaging with a powerful group of Fire Fusion Demon Apes.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did he and the three Golden Core cultivators return unscathed, but he also brought back a unique mechanical puppet.<br/>
<br/>
"Zhu Xuanji's recent actions have yielded great results. Sending a letter suddenly must be of great importance!"<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si's eyes flashed with a sharp light, and he called out, "Someone."<br/>
<br/>
A subordinate immediately came over to take orders.<br/>
<br/>
After giving his orders, Fei Si buried himself in his work again, waiting for the results.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, a Foundation Establishment cultivator came to report: The secret letter had been intercepted and was here.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si obtained the secret letter and browsed it, but found nothing.<br/>
<br/>
"The Southern Bean Kingdom's unique encryption method..."<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si sighed, filled with regret.<br/>
<br/>
In this way, he could only try to delay and prolong the delivery process.<br/>
<br/>
"At most, I can only delay for about seven days."<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
In the main hall, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit withdrew its gaze from Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
It anxiously paced in circles, showing obvious nervousness.<br/>
<br/>
It had painstakingly sent the Mechanical Demon General out, only for Zhu Xuanji to retrieve it again.<br/>
<br/>
For this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit really wanted to strangle Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
However, this matter was not entirely bad news for the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
At least it knew that Ning Zhuo was in trouble!<br/>
<br/>
The reason was simple.<br/>
<br/>
The little ape that initially touched the Mechanical Demon General was the young Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had always been an observer, witnessing many things.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng possessed immortal talent and a golden skeleton, attracting the True Scripture, which voluntarily embraced him.<br/>
<br/>
But Yuan Dasheng, perhaps due to obtaining the treasure, exhausted his fate energy and fell into a life-threatening crisis.<br/>
<br/>
He struggled to escape and was saved by Yuan Yi when he was on the brink of death.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, a man and an ape met, became companions, and founded the Monkey Head Gang.<br/>
<br/>
Once Zhu Xuanji received the royal reply and saw the deduced adult appearance of the ape, he would immediately think of Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, Ning Zhuo, who was heavily involved in this matter, would undoubtedly be deeply suspected by Zhu Xuanji and possibly exposed!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit eagerly anticipated this day.<br/>
<br/>
It cast its gaze again, penetrating layers of space, focusing on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had no idea that a great crisis was brewing, about to engulf him completely.<br/>
<br/>
He was fully purifying his essence, qi, and spirit.<br/>
<br/>
During this period, geniuses from the Zhou and Zheng families came to him one after another to discuss important matters.<br/>
<br/>
Some matters were related to the continued refinement of Golden Core stage mechanisms, while others were the Zhou and Zheng families' strong invitation for Ning Zhuo to join them again for a major joint action.<br/>
<br/>
Their reaction was entirely within Ning Zhuo's expectations.<br/>
<br/>
After all, the last joint action of the three families failed because Ning Xiaohui's internal strife framed Ning Zhuo, leading to a regrettable defeat.<br/>
<br/>
They had no idea that all this was almost a play orchestrated and guided by Ning Zhuo behind the scenes.<br/>
<br/>
From their perspective, they felt regret and pity, which was absolutely correct.<br/>
<br/>
It was because they saw that they were seemingly just one step away from defeating Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai that they were united in their desire for another action.<br/>
<br/>
And such a major action could not do without Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had performed exceptionally well in the previous battle, widely praised.<br/>
<br/>
"All because of that Ning Xiaohui, who doesn't understand the bigger picture!"<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Yu, let's fight side by side again this time and avenge our previous defeat."<br/>
<br/>
"I feel this time we will definitely succeed!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo himself was not stirred up.<br/>
<br/>
Because he did not want to go at all.<br/>
<br/>
The most important thing for him now was to purify his cultivation and break through to the ninth layer as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
On the foundation of ninth-layer cultivation, he could then look forward to the future of Foundation Establishment!<br/>
<br/>
"What method should I use to refuse them?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned slightly.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment of thought, he came up with an idea.<br/>
<br/>
He took out the Five Elements Ruler and divided the Five Elements Mana into five single-element mana streams.<br/>
<br/>
"Everyone, watch."<br/>
<br/>
As he spoke, he demonstrated his control over the five single-element mana streams, then showed how he could simultaneously use these five mana streams to cast five different spells!<br/>
<br/>
This display left the geniuses of the Zhou and Zheng families stunned.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued, "My strength has improved significantly, and I plan to challenge myself alone first."<br/>
<br/>
The persuaders from the two families were convinced by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
If they were in his position, they would also want to act alone to reap the greatest profit.</div>
