<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji did not dwell too much on the faint doubts in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">His fingers caressed the panel, murmuring softly, "True Scripture..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The value of a True Scripture is extraordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Historically, there was once a righteous super sect called the Natural Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Its core technique was called the Natural Great Dao Scripture, reputed as the origin of all techniques, the mother scripture of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This title was not self-proclaimed by the disciples of the Natural Sect, nor was it an exaggeration, but it was recognized by the people of that time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">It is said that the complete Natural Great Dao Scripture covered all stages of cultivation, yet it consisted of only three hundred oracle bone characters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The entire text was extremely profound and obscure, often requiring exceptional comprehension to grasp even a bit of the true cultivation mysteries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">There were peerless geniuses who, after cultivating the Natural Great Dao Scripture successfully, condensed their insights into True Intent before their demise, compiling seven chapters of True Scriptures for Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Soul Formation, Void Refinement, and Integration stages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Later generations, regardless of their comprehension, could fully understand the essence of the True Scriptures upon contact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Because of this, the Natural Sect flourished and became the number one sect in the world at that time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Its prosperity continued until the True Scriptures were stolen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Without the True Scriptures, the Natural Sect quickly declined and vanished within two hundred years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Although this example is extreme, it is enough to illustrate the value of a True Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">A single True Scripture could potentially create a powerful sect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhu Xuanji did not know what the True Scripture on this Blood Path Panel was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But that did not stop him from speculating: "According to the royal records, the Three Sect Masters created the Three Sect Techniques in their later years, which included three techniques corresponding to the upper, middle, and lower dantian, cultivating the essence, qi, and spirit of a cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Could the True Scripture recorded on this Blood Path Panel be the technique for cultivating the Essence Sea in the lower dantian?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Previously, the Transmission Bell widely spread the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, and the City Lord's Mansion's Meng Chong had already mastered the subsequent techniques through the trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"What could the technique on the Blood Path Panel be?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"At the very least, it should be closely related to essence and blood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zhu Xuanji's speculation was logical and based on evidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">His basis came from the Mechanical Demon General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Inside the Demon General's mechanism, he detected many mechanical components, one of which was specifically for refining blood and flesh (Blood Transformation Pool), and another for purifying (blood oil bottle).</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">From Zhu Xuanji's perspective, he risked his life to retrieve the Mechanical Demon General and paid a great price to win over three Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Before handing over the Demon General, he was very willing to retrieve the True Scripture to ensure his merit to the greatest extent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The only clue now lay before Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"I need to find that little ape!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Even as a divine constable, facing different species, he was also face-blind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"The little ape came into contact with the Mechanical Demon General, causing the True Scripture to transfer voluntarily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"It must have innate talent and definitely not weak!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">However, Zhu Xuanji recalled the recent fierce battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In the lair of the Fire Fusion Demon Apes, he did not see any ape using any innate talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Nor did he see any demon ape mastering any technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">From this point of view, they were all just demon beasts, not demon cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">They relied entirely on natural growth and species talent to possess combat power comparable to Foundation Establishment or Golden Core after reaching maturity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">If they had also cultivated techniques, their combat power would have skyrocketed on the existing basis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">However, all things balance, and the Heavenly Dao is impartial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Since the Fire Fusion Demon Apes had such good physical conditions, their comprehension in cultivation was lacking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Even the simplest and most basic techniques were difficult for most of them to comprehend in their lifetime.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Was the little ape not on the battlefield at that time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Did it leave the group, get expelled, or already die?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhu Xuanji kept guessing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Generally, beings with innate talent have vigorous fate energy and are not easily killed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"I don't know the exact time the little ape came into contact with the Mechanical Demon General."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"If I had time, I could roughly calculate the little ape's current age."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Even if not for the merit, I must find this Fire Fusion Demon Ape!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The reason was simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This was a True Scripture!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Understanding a True Scripture requires very little comprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">If the Fire Fusion Demon Apes comprehended the True Scripture on a large scale, they might eventually develop many demon cultivators in Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Demon cultivators are different from demon beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Due to cultivation, they often possess far superior intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">When they fight, they can cast spells and use tactics, making them far more threatening than demon beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Did the Three Sect Masters not consider the possibility of the True Scripture being lost when they placed it in the Mechanical Demon General?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"If there really is a group of demon cultivators hidden in Fire Persimmon Mountain, it would be extremely terrifying!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Thinking of this, Zhu Xuanji's expression became solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He immediately wrote a letter, detailing his speculations and including a portrait of the little ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He hoped the royal family could hire experts to deduce the adult appearance of the little ape and send it back to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Then, using the royal family's unique secret communication method, he covered the letter, making it look like a chaotic scribble to outsiders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">After sending the letter, he immediately began repairing the Mechanical Demon General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Demon General had many parts that needed repair, both inside and out, numbering over a hundred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The most obvious injury was its left arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Its left arm was broken, and the broken arm was something Zhu Xuanji found in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhu Xuanji had considerable expertise in mechanical constructs, and he quickly immersed himself in observation, thinking of solutions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Fei Si managed and approved mundane affairs on behalf of Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A piece of intelligence about Zhu Xuanji was delivered to Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Oh? Zhu Xuanji sent out a secret letter?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Fei Si immediately fell into thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He always regarded Zhu Xuanji as his strongest competitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Previously, Zhu Xuanji led three Golden Core cultivators deep into Fire Persimmon Mountain, engaging with a powerful group of Fire Fusion Demon Apes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Not only did he and the three Golden Core cultivators return unscathed, but he also brought back a unique mechanical puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Zhu Xuanji's recent actions have yielded great results. Sending a letter suddenly must be of great importance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Fei Si's eyes flashed with a sharp light, and he called out, "Someone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">A subordinate immediately came over to take orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">After giving his orders, Fei Si buried himself in his work again, waiting for the results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Moments later, a Foundation Establishment cultivator came to report: The secret letter had been intercepted and was here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Fei Si obtained the secret letter and browsed it, but found nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"The Southern Bean Kingdom's unique encryption method..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Fei Si sighed, filled with regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">In this way, he could only try to delay and prolong the delivery process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"At most, I can only delay for about seven days."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In the main hall, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit withdrew its gaze from Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">It anxiously paced in circles, showing obvious nervousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">It had painstakingly sent the Mechanical Demon General out, only for Zhu Xuanji to retrieve it again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">For this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit really wanted to strangle Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">However, this matter was not entirely bad news for the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">At least it knew that Ning Zhuo was in trouble!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The reason was simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The little ape that initially touched the Mechanical Demon General was the young Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had always been an observer, witnessing many things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Yuan Dasheng possessed immortal talent and a golden skeleton, attracting the True Scripture, which voluntarily embraced him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">But Yuan Dasheng, perhaps due to obtaining the treasure, exhausted his fate energy and fell into a life-threatening crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He struggled to escape and was saved by Yuan Yi when he was on the brink of death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thus, a man and an ape met, became companions, and founded the Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Once Zhu Xuanji received the royal reply and saw the deduced adult appearance of the ape, he would immediately think of Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">At that time, Ning Zhuo, who was heavily involved in this matter, would undoubtedly be deeply suspected by Zhu Xuanji and possibly exposed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit eagerly anticipated this day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">It cast its gaze again, penetrating layers of space, focusing on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo had no idea that a great crisis was brewing, about to engulf him completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He was fully purifying his essence, qi, and spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">During this period, geniuses from the Zhou and Zheng families came to him one after another to discuss important matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Some matters were related to the continued refinement of Golden Core stage mechanisms, while others were the Zhou and Zheng families' strong invitation for Ning Zhuo to join them again for a major joint action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Their reaction was entirely within Ning Zhuo's expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">After all, the last joint action of the three families failed because Ning Xiaohui's internal strife framed Ning Zhuo, leading to a regrettable defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">They had no idea that all this was almost a play orchestrated and guided by Ning Zhuo behind the scenes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">From their perspective, they felt regret and pity, which was absolutely correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">It was because they saw that they were seemingly just one step away from defeating Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai that they were united in their desire for another action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">And such a major action could not do without Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo had performed exceptionally well in the previous battle, widely praised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"All because of that Ning Xiaohui, who doesn't understand the bigger picture!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Brother Yu, let's fight side by side again this time and avenge our previous defeat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"I feel this time we will definitely succeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo himself was not stirred up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Because he did not want to go at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The most important thing for him now was to purify his cultivation and break through to the ninth layer as soon as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">On the foundation of ninth-layer cultivation, he could then look forward to the future of Foundation Establishment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"What method should I use to refuse them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo frowned slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">After a moment of thought, he came up with an idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">He took out the Five Elements Ruler and divided the Five Elements Mana into five single-element mana streams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Everyone, watch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">As he spoke, he demonstrated his control over the five single-element mana streams, then showed how he could simultaneously use these five mana streams to cast five different spells!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">This display left the geniuses of the Zhou and Zheng families stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo continued, "My strength has improved significantly, and I plan to challenge myself alone first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The persuaders from the two families were convinced by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">If they were in his position, they would also want to act alone to reap the greatest profit.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
