<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Yang Chanyu had been hiding in a corner of Fire Persimmon Immortal City ever since her dual cultivation with Ning Zhuo, relocating periodically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Not only did she not leave, but she also delved deeper into the Lava Immortal Palace, earning contributions frantically, becoming a strong contender right behind Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">When the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit introduced the enemy situation to Ning Zhuo, it also included Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Lingtong's proactive appearance surprised Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"You actually came to find me personally. Haha, you must urgently need my help."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sun Lingtong chuckled, "I'm here to propose a collaboration for a big fortune. Are you interested in making a huge profit?" Yang Chanyu was naturally interested and immediately inquired further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">However, Sun Lingtong couldn't reveal the entire plan, only disclosing a part of it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This made Yang Chanyu very dissatisfied and wary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Sun Lingtong, what are you up to?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"I need to know the entire plan, or I won't easily get involved. I'm not someone who can be easily deceived."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Not knowing the whole plan, are you trying to use me as a pawn?" Sun Lingtong laughed, trying to persuade her with sweet words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Yang Chanyu just sneered, unmoved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Forced into a corner, Sun Lingtong had to take a step back, "Fine, we can sign an oath. If you're not assured, we can set an agreement, can't we?" Yang Chanyu still shook her head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Our Void Sect is best at making false oaths or exploiting loopholes in oaths. The more you say this, the less sincere you seem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"You want sincerity?" Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth, his eyes firm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Then, I promise you. After the Lava Immortal Palace affair is over, I will return to the Void Sect with you!" This statement made Yang Chanyu's expression change slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yang Chanyu scrutinized Sun Lingtong seriously, "What kind of big matter and benefits are making you promise me this? Sun Lingtong, you should understand what these words mean."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong's small face was filled with stern seriousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He gritted his teeth, then relaxed, spreading his hands with a smile, "Going back to see your master together means I might die!" His eyes became more determined, "But fortune favors the bold. This time, I'm risking death to win big!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"So, I'm betting this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"You wanted sincerity, right? This is my sincerity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"We both have a marriage contract."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"My promise is tied to our marriage. This should reassure you, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Yang Chanyu was silent for a moment, then nodded, "This reassures me. Alright, tell me the specific action plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The puppet Ning Zhuo exerted force with both hands, pushing open the third Demonic Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The checkpoint after the third Demonic Gate was special.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The cultivator passing through would operate the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, and the checkpoint would reward the cultivator with a corresponding quality Blood Path Diagram based on their performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo, with his peak ninth-turn demonic cultivation, though in a puppet body, had accumulated a lot of blood energy in the previous checkpoints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">At this moment, he chose a blank, smooth Blood Path Diagram and directly injected all his blood energy into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Don't be fooled by the small size of the Blood Path Diagram; its capacity for blood energy was extremely high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">All of Ning Zhuo's blood energy was poured into the Blood Path Diagram, far from reaching its limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He operated the complete Demonic Blood Vein Technique layer by layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Each time Ning Zhuo completed a layer, the operation route of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique would be imprinted on the Blood Path Diagram, showing a layer of blood path patterns similar to formation patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">When he pushed the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to the eighth layer, his blood energy was exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Blood Path Diagram he obtained had densely packed blood path patterns on its surface, layer upon layer, like a formation set up with overlapping arrays.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"My mastery of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique still needs improvement. It's far from being as instinctive as the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique! The Blood Path Diagram I made is far from excellent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"On the other hand, the total amount of blood energy I possess is also a key factor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Obviously, if he had more abundant blood energy, even if Ning Zhuo wasn't so proficient in the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, he could still imprint the Blood Path Diagram to the ninth layer of the demonic technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"How can I get more blood energy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo quickly reviewed the various checkpoints and rooms he had passed through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Every puppet with blood energy can have its blood energy taken by me for my use. I did waste some puppets before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Besides, in the preparation room, blood energy can also be purchased with spirit stones." This part of the blood energy was previously used by Ning Zhuo as material for making mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Now, he discovered another use for blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Lastly, there's the reward from the five stone pillar rankings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo remembered that in the Refining Essence Ranking rewards, one of the options was blood energy, which was not available in the other rankings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo was not satisfied with just obtaining this Blood Path Diagram with only eight layers of the technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">After glancing at the portal ahead, he pondered for a moment and then turned around, heading back through the door he came from.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Cheating once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal to return to the third transit hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Now, Ning Zhuo had mastered the complete Life Thread Divine Ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">When he resonated and guided the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, the loss of the magical artifact during the transmission on the Life Thread had been reduced to one-tenth of what it was before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Moreover, Ning Zhuo's cultivation had greatly increased, with all three techniques at the peak of the ninth turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">This was far beyond what it was before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">All these allowed him to easily open and close the doors in the later stages of the Lava Immortal Palace trial, moving freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo returned to the preparation room and claimed a large amount of blood energy rewards from the rankings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Currently, the reformation teams of the four forces in Fire Persimmon Immortal City were all focused on diligently practicing the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique from the fourth to the sixth layer, with almost no one exploring the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">However, there were still many wooden puppets active in the trial checkpoints of the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">By now, many ordinary cultivators had reached the peak of the third layer of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique and gained the qualification to enter the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">If these people discovered that Ning Zhuo was freely retreating from the checkpoints, it would be highly inappropriate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Therefore, before retreating, Ning Zhuo always had the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng lead the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng killed all the mechanical puppets it encountered, clearing the way for Ning Zhuo and ensuring he wasn't discovered by others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Why did this mechanical monkey cause such a riot?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This completely contradicted the patterns summarized by the reformation teams of the four forces during their difficult explorations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Regarding this, Ning Zhuo couldn't care less and left it to these people to speculate and guess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The situation was extremely tense, leaving no room for him to attend to these minor details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">After receiving a large amount of blood energy rewards from the rankings, Ning Zhuo stayed in the preparation room for a while, slightly modifying his body and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Soon, he led the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng back to the special checkpoint of the Demonic Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Just as Ning Zhuo was about to use the more abundant blood energy to create the Blood Path Diagram, he suddenly had an idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Dasheng, you do it," he called out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"At your command," Yuan Dasheng stepped forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He received the abundant blood energy and, instead of Ning Zhuo, operated the demonic technique, applying it to the blank Blood Path Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">In an instant, almost all the blood energy in Yuan Dasheng's body was poured into the board.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This was vastly different from when Ning Zhuo had infused blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"It turns out that mastering the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to a certain extent allows one to instantly pour out all their cultivation!" Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up as he watched and learned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Clearly, Yuan Dasheng's mastery of this technique was far deeper than his.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Therefore, the speed of creating the Blood Path Diagram was more than ten times faster than Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Layer after layer, the blood path patterns of the technique quickly appeared, overlapping on the Blood Path Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">In just about twenty breaths, the Blood Path Diagram had reached the sixth layer of the demonic technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">When it reached the seventh layer, the creation speed noticeably slowed down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Demonic Blood Vein Technique from the seventh to the ninth layer began to emphasize the accumulation of blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">However, Yuan Dasheng's speed in creating the Blood Path Diagram was still much faster than Ning Zhuo's when he made the first six layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The seventh layer, the eighth layer, the ninth layer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">After completing the ninth layer, there was still a large amount of blood energy left in the Blood Path Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Yuan Dasheng didn't stop and continued creating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Soon, the Blood Path Diagram even recorded the blood path lines corresponding to the Foundation Establishment Stage of the technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Foundation Establishment Early Stage, Foundation Establishment Mid Stage, all the way to Foundation Establishment Late Stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">At this point, the blood energy was finally exhausted, and Yuan Dasheng had to stop operating the technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo was overjoyed and immediately took the Blood Path Diagram to examine it closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He had only obtained the Demonic Blood Vein Technique up to the Qi Refining Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He knew nothing about the details of the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">But now, Yuan Dasheng had created this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This also verified what the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had said before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The original scripture of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique had already fused with Yuan Dasheng, becoming part of his instinct!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Yuan Dasheng, can you write down all the contents of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique?" Ning Zhuo asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Yuan Dasheng was stunned for a moment, then half-knelt and said, "Master, I am incapable of fulfilling your command." Ning Zhuo inquired further and found that Yuan Dasheng only had the ability to use the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, not understand it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He had been refined by the Lava Immortal Palace, leaving no memory, only purified spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The complete contents of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique had become part of his instinct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">To delve deeply and express this instinct in words was beyond him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Even so, I can still use this special checkpoint to have Yuan Dasheng complete the full recording of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique!" Ning Zhuo immediately thought of using the Blood Path Diagram as an alternative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"But this would require a lot of blood energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo quickly calculated the total amount of blood energy he could collect in the checkpoint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He added up the blood energy consumed in his two attempts to create the Blood Path Diagram and compared the results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He regretfully found that the total amount of blood energy he could obtain was far from reaching the level needed for a Golden Core Stage technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Forget it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"When I take over the Lava Immortal Palace in the future, won't I have access to the complete contents of these three major techniques?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"For now, let's focus on clearing the Demonic Gate path!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">This matter was crucial to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">In his plan, it was related to whether he could overcome the current crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"First, let's install the Blood Path Diagram."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The puppet Ning Zhuo sat down, opened the small door on his chest, revealing the mechanical structure inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He had already modified himself in the preparation room for the installation of the Blood Path Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Holding the Blood Path Diagram, he inserted it into the middle of his spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">With a click, the Blood Path Diagram was smoothly installed into the slot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The base of the slot clamped the board firmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Without any blood energy, Ning Zhuo couldn't activate the Blood Path Diagram to verify if the installation was successful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo speculated, "The next checkpoint must reward blood energy! Otherwise, the Blood Path Diagram would be useless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"The creators of this special checkpoint must have a purpose; they wouldn't set up something useless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo gently tugged at the Blood Path Diagram, confirming that it was securely fastened and wouldn't fall out due to intense movement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He then closed the small door on his chest, patting it to ensure it was tightly shut and locked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He repeated the process, opening the chest of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and installing another Blood Path Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The mechanical structure of the Golden Blood Battle Ape was very compact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The slot Ning Zhuo hastily added couldn't be placed at the chest level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">He had to compromise and place it in the abdomen, where there was some space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Due to limited space, the slot mechanism Ning Zhuo made for Yuan Dasheng was much simpler than his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Installing the Blood Path Diagram for Yuan Dasheng required more care.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo carefully held the sides of the Blood Path Diagram, aligning it with the slot, and gently inserted it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The locking mechanism for Yuan Dasheng's slot was different from Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo had to manually lock the clasps on both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">After completing this step, he followed the slot's lines upward, checking the connections to Yuan Dasheng's chest components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Confirming that the lines and connections were intact, Ning Zhuo closed Yuan Dasheng's chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
