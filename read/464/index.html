<paragraph index="1">Time returned to one stick of incense earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">When Liu Er heard that Zhang Hei had gone to the Red Flower Camp to demand an explanation, he immediately knew the matter was not good and promptly walked out of his barracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He first used his spiritual sense to contact Guan Hong, informing him of the situation and instructing his second younger brother to carefully maintain control of the military camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">After that, Liu Er hurriedly mounted his horse and rushed out of his own camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">At the entrance of the main camp, he encountered Ning Zhuo, who was returning to camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Military Advisor, you’ve returned!” Liu Er’s face revealed surprise, but it was quickly replaced by an anxious look.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Military Advisor, the situation is dire. I must hurry to the Red Flower Camp. If I go late, our third younger brother might face harm.” Liu Er’s tone was urgent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo asked suspiciously: “What happened?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Through spiritual sense transmission, which was extremely swift, after just one or two breaths, Ning Zhuo understood the cause and effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo immediately grabbed the reins of Liu Er’s mount: “General, stay calm! If you rush off so hastily, I fear you won’t be able to help General Zhang Hei.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Could it be that General Liu wants to join forces with General Zhang to beat General Mu Lan down?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Liu Er was stunned for a moment, then lowered his head and pondered: “General Mu Lan’s archery is outstanding and can heavily wound Lord Long. Unless I join forces with my second and third younger brothers, there’s no way to oppose her.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“That’s why I’m very worried about my third younger brother this time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo continued: “General, since you don’t want to fight General Mu Lan, you must be going to reason with her.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“If you rush there empty-handed and unprepared, I fear you’ll only be humiliated.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Liu Er froze again, then hastily said: “Military Advisor, the situation is urgent, stop beating around the bush. Whatever idea you have, just speak plainly, I will follow your suggestions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo proposed: “General, why not carry along our gravely wounded soldiers. Bring them to the Red Flower Camp as well. They need not continue treatment, just keep them barely alive if possible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Liu Er suddenly understood: “I’ll do as the Military Advisor says!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He immediately issued orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The severely wounded were loaded onto carts, and Liu Er rode in the front on his mount.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“I have quite some friendship with the Red Flower Camp’s physician, Zhang Chongyi. Perhaps we can use this connection to ease relations between our army and the Red Flower Camp.” Ning Zhuo also joined in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Liu Er was burning with impatience, so Ning Zhuo advised: “According to General Zhang’s abilities, even if he cannot defeat Mu Lan, he can certainly hold out for a long while and won’t lose quickly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Even if he has already lost to Mu Lan, General Mu Lan would not be foolish enough to kill a fellow comrade on the spot.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“She’s currently in a precarious situation and can’t even protect herself!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Liu Er became curious: “Why is that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Taking the opportunity, Ning Zhuo recounted the morning’s experience—attending the banquet and having morning tea with Shuang Jing—telling Liu Er everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">When Liu Er heard that Ning Zhuo directly refused Shuang Jing, he became so excited he almost jumped off his mount to grab Ning Zhuo’s hands and shake them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Liu Er’s impression of Ning Zhuo improved greatly, and he praised: “The Military Advisor’s character is noble and loyal. That Shuang Jing disregards the monarch and secretly harms colleagues, truly a pair of national parasites!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo nodded and sighed: “After this matter, I’ve seen through Shuang Jing. I never expected that a dignified one of royal surname would resort to such sinister schemes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Alas, perhaps this is why the old ancestor at home allowed me to travel the world.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“I have witnessed you three generals pledge brotherhood and fight side by side, and I’ve also seen the vermin of the nation, those treacherous characters who attack their own comrades.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“I won’t leave then.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Staying in the Three Generals’ Camp is far more comfortable than staying in the White Jade Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">When Liu Er heard this, his heart beat faster, and he was overjoyed: “It’s my good fortune to have encountered the Military Advisor in Green Forest Immortal City!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This joy greatly eased the anxiety in Liu Er’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">When they approached the vicinity of the Red Flower Camp’s entrance, they saw that in midair, Zhang Hei and Mu Lan had already begun their duel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Alas! They’ve started fighting. What should we do?” Liu Er asked Ning Zhuo for advice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo spread his hands: “They’re already fighting, what’s done is done, so let them continue.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">After watching for a moment, they saw Mu Lan suddenly recoil, taking out her weapon treasure, the Crimson Phoenix Bow, nocking a Burning Heart Arrow, and even activating the divine ability Scarlet-Heart Swan Arrow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Liu Er cried out in alarm: “Not good! Third Younger Brother is in danger.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He wanted to intervene but it was too late. He watched as the arrow was released.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">It flew off by a wide margin, tearing through the sky and vanishing into the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Pfft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After shooting the arrow, Mu Lan spat out fresh blood. Her eyes went black, and she fainted on the spot, plummeting straight down from the high altitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Fortunately, her period of unconsciousness was very brief. In mid-fall, she regained consciousness and quickly adjusted herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">She still crashed into the ground, raising shockwaves and dust clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">When the dust settled, Mu Lan half-knelt in a deep pit, motionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Seeing that something was wrong, Zhang Chongyi hurried over. Looking at Mu Lan’s lowered face, it was flushed with gold and purple hues. The wound on her forearm had reopened, continuously bleeding!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“As expected!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zhang Chongyi’s heart sank instantly: “Mu Lan forced herself to cultivate the Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art. The backlash had been accumulating, and it finally erupted. Ah, this is a big problem!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Mu Lan could no longer stand up. She immediately transmitted her voice using spiritual sense: “Uncle Zhang, I am extremely weak, I can’t even rise to my feet. Please help me stand up, quickly!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Mu Lan urged him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zhang Chongyi promptly supported Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Seeing Mu Lan stand up straight again, her posture as upright as a spear, the Red Flower Camp soldiers —who were just worried silent moments ago —burst into cheers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“If Old General Mu were here, he would have that black thief on the ground in just a few moves!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“The General is fine. It looks like she’s not seriously injured!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“How could it be possible that the General was defeated?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The soldiers in the Red Flower Camp clamored noisily, and the morale began to waver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Hearing these voices, Mu Lan’s vision went dark again. She nearly fainted on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">At this moment, Ning Zhuo’s voice suddenly resounded throughout the entire camp: “Many thanks to Lady Mu Lan for showing mercy! In order to spare the life of our General Zhang, you deliberately shot wide, thus bearing a huge backlash.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“From start to finish in this duel, you were intentionally holding back. Such magnanimity is worthy of the heir to the Grand Marshal’s House!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Hmph, that black lout was impudent, a mere commoner compared to the grand bearing of our General!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Red Flower Camp soldiers paused, then suddenly realized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“So that’s how it was!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“I knew our General couldn’t possibly be defeated!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The army’s morale stabilized once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Ning Zhuo…” Mu Lan silently mouthed this name in her heart, her perception of Ning Zhuo becoming much more complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Hovering in midair, Zhang Hei heard this and glared, wanting to loudly refute Ning Zhuo’s words, which didn’t match the truth at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">But at this moment, he received a spiritual transmission from Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zhang Hei had a lump in his throat, unable to speak, and descended in extreme frustration, greeting Liu Er upon landing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Big Brother, why…” Zhang Hei transmitted his thoughts, utterly puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Liu Er replied: “Shut up, you reckless fool. Your impulsiveness nearly caused great disaster. Listen more to the Military Advisor, cooperate with him, and don’t talk nonsense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“Oh, oh.” Zhang Hei had no choice but to lower his head, feeling extremely depressed, but he did not disobey Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">After this, Ning Zhuo stepped forward as a mediator to help both sides communicate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Mu Lan was injured and found it hard to fight; plus, she had a decent impression of Ning Zhuo, so she did not make things difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">With Liu Er containing Zhang Hei, the latter could only glare helplessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Under the watchful eyes of many, Ning Zhuo arranged for the involved parties to confront each other. He always could effortlessly detect any falsehoods or omitted intentions in the soldiers’ words from both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">In less than half a cup of tea’s time, Ning Zhuo had clarified the entire cause and restored the true sequence of events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Liu Er found that indeed his own soldiers had provoked first, even spitting on the face of the Red Flower Camp’s soldier. He took the initiative to apologize to Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Mu Lan also apologized for going too far in her retaliation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Thus, the disturbance was quelled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Before leaving, Zhang Chongyi used spiritual sense to call out to Ning Zhuo: “Little friend Ning Zhuo, please remain. I have important matters to discuss.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo replied: “Physician Zhang, please don’t blame me, but at this moment, it’s truly inconvenient for me to stay on the spot.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“I must first return to camp with Generals Liu and Zhang.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“If you have important matters, you may come to the Three Generals’ Camp later. This junior will naturally welcome you graciously!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Liu Er, Zhang Hei, Ning Zhuo, and the others left soon afterward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Zhang Chongyi sighed and agreed: “Very well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Not long after they departed, Shuang Jing received this information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Ha ha ha ha.” He laughed triumphantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Who would have thought Mu Lan would be defeated by Zhang Hei!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Defeated well indeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“This conflict came at just the right time, truly a heavenly opportunity. I must seize it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With that thought, Shuang Jing decided to take action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">However, there was another person who moved even faster than him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">At the Red Flower Camp:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Just as Mu Lan was receiving treatment from Zhang Chongyi, she suddenly shouted sternly: “Who’s there!? Show yourself!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Sun Gan revealed himself, wearing a faint smile: “As expected, General Mu Lan, you have encountered a mishap cultivating your family’s Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art. Otherwise, with your strength, how could you possibly lose today?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Mu Lan stood straight, her face covered with icy frost: “General Sun, you entered the camp without reporting, violating military regulations! I can treat you as an enemy spy and behead you right here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sun Gan sneered, hands behind his back, strolling up to Mu Lan: “A Golden Core stage little girl, I even held you in my arms when you were born. Trying to scare me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He found a chair and casually sat down: “What you say is indeed true; the military regulations are thus.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“But with your current state, and the Red Flower Camp as it is, can you kill me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Speaking this, his expression softened: “I have come this time to help you, no need to be so tense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Mu Lan sneered: “I need no help from you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Sun Gan: “If you don’t need help, the Red Flower Camp will collapse sooner or later, and then the Grand Marshal’s House will completely decline.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Zhang Chongyi took a deep breath: “General Sun, whatever ideas you have, just say them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Mu Lan’s expression changed drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Sun Gan said: “Mu Lan lass, you need strong support, the Red Flower Camp needs assistance, and the Grand Marshal’s House must have someone to uphold it. Look at me… how about it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Zhang Chongyi stared wide-eyed: “What?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Mu Lan’s face became even gloomier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Sun Gan looked at the red-robed female general before him and said bluntly: “You and I join in dual cultivation, become husband and wife. From now on, I shall take over the Grand Marshal’s House. With my ability, I can surely restore the Grand Marshal’s House to its former glory!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
