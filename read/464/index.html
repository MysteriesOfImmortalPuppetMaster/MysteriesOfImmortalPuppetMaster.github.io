Time returned to one stick of incense earlier.<br/>
<br/>
When Liu Er heard that Zhang Hei had gone to the Red Flower Camp to demand an explanation, he immediately knew the matter was not good and promptly walked out of his barracks.<br/>
<br/>
He first used his spiritual sense to contact Guan Hong, informing him of the situation and instructing his second younger brother to carefully maintain control of the military camp.<br/>
<br/>
After that, Liu Er hurriedly mounted his horse and rushed out of his own camp.<br/>
<br/>
At the entrance of the main camp, he encountered Ning Zhuo, who was returning to camp.<br/>
<br/>
“Military Advisor, you’ve returned!” Liu Er’s face revealed surprise, but it was quickly replaced by an anxious look.<br/>
<br/>
“Military Advisor, the situation is dire. I must hurry to the Red Flower Camp. If I go late, our third younger brother might face harm.” Liu Er’s tone was urgent.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo asked suspiciously: “What happened?”<br/>
<br/>
Through spiritual sense transmission, which was extremely swift, after just one or two breaths, Ning Zhuo understood the cause and effect.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately grabbed the reins of Liu Er’s mount: “General, stay calm! If you rush off so hastily, I fear you won’t be able to help General Zhang Hei.”<br/>
<br/>
“Could it be that General Liu wants to join forces with General Zhang to beat General Mulan down?”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was stunned for a moment, then lowered his head and pondered: “General Mulan’s archery is outstanding and can heavily wound Lord Long. Unless I join forces with my second and third younger brothers, there’s no way to oppose her.”<br/>
<br/>
“That’s why I’m very worried about my third younger brother this time.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued: “General, since you don’t want to fight General Mulan, you must be going to reason with her.”<br/>
<br/>
“If you rush there empty-handed and unprepared, I fear you’ll only be humiliated.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er froze again, then hastily said: “Military Advisor, the situation is urgent, stop beating around the bush. Whatever idea you have, just speak plainly, I will follow your suggestions.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo proposed: “General, why not carry along our gravely wounded soldiers. Bring them to the Red Flower Camp as well. They need not continue treatment, just keep them barely alive if possible.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er suddenly understood: “I’ll do as the Military Advisor says!”<br/>
<br/>
He immediately issued orders.<br/>
<br/>
The severely wounded were loaded onto carts, and Liu Er rode in the front on his mount.<br/>
<br/>
“I have quite some friendship with the Red Flower Camp’s physician, Zhang Chongyi. Perhaps we can use this connection to ease relations between our army and the Red Flower Camp.” Ning Zhuo also joined in.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was burning with impatience, so Ning Zhuo advised: “According to General Zhang’s abilities, even if he cannot defeat Mulan, he can certainly hold out for a long while and won’t lose quickly.”<br/>
<br/>
“Even if he has already lost to Mulan, General Mulan would not be foolish enough to kill a fellow comrade on the spot.”<br/>
<br/>
“She’s currently in a precarious situation and can’t even protect herself!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er became curious: “Why is that?”<br/>
<br/>
Taking the opportunity, Ning Zhuo recounted the morning’s experience—attending the banquet and having morning tea with Shuang Jing—telling Liu Er everything.<br/>
<br/>
When Liu Er heard that Ning Zhuo directly refused Shuang Jing, he became so excited he almost jumped off his mount to grab Ning Zhuo’s hands and shake them.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s impression of Ning Zhuo improved greatly, and he praised: “The Military Advisor’s character is noble and loyal. That Shuang Jing disregards the monarch and secretly harms colleagues, truly a pair of national parasites!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded and sighed: “After this matter, I’ve seen through Shuang Jing. I never expected that a dignified one of royal surname would resort to such sinister schemes.”<br/>
<br/>
“Alas, perhaps this is why the old ancestor at home allowed me to travel the world.”<br/>
<br/>
“I have witnessed you three generals pledge brotherhood and fight side by side, and I’ve also seen the vermin of the nation, those treacherous characters who attack their own comrades.”<br/>
<br/>
“I won’t leave then.”<br/>
<br/>
“Staying in the Three Generals’ Camp is far more comfortable than staying in the White Jade Camp.”<br/>
<br/>
When Liu Er heard this, his heart beat faster, and he was overjoyed: “It’s my good fortune to have encountered the Military Advisor in Green Forest Immortal City!”<br/>
<br/>
This joy greatly eased the anxiety in Liu Er’s heart.<br/>
<br/>
When they approached the vicinity of the Red Flower Camp’s entrance, they saw that in midair, Zhang Hei and Mulan had already begun their duel.<br/>
<br/>
“Alas! They’ve started fighting. What should we do?” Liu Er asked Ning Zhuo for advice.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo spread his hands: “They’re already fighting, what’s done is done, so let them continue.”<br/>
<br/>
After watching for a moment, they saw Mulan suddenly recoil, taking out her weapon treasure, the Crimson Phoenix Bow, nocking a Burning Heart Arrow, and even activating the divine ability Scarlet-Heart Swan Arrow!<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er cried out in alarm: “Not good! Third Younger Brother is in danger.”<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to intervene but it was too late. He watched as the arrow was released.<br/>
<br/>
It flew off by a wide margin, tearing through the sky and vanishing into the clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Pfft.<br/>
<br/>
After shooting the arrow, Mulan spat out fresh blood. Her eyes went black, and she fainted on the spot, plummeting straight down from the high altitude.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, her period of unconsciousness was very brief. In mid-fall, she regained consciousness and quickly adjusted herself.<br/>
<br/>
Boom.<br/>
<br/>
She still crashed into the ground, raising shockwaves and dust clouds.<br/>
<br/>
When the dust settled, Mulan half-knelt in a deep pit, motionless.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that something was wrong, Zhang Chongyi hurried over. Looking at Mulan’s lowered face, it was flushed with gold and purple hues. The wound on her forearm had reopened, continuously bleeding!<br/>
<br/>
“As expected!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi’s heart sank instantly: “Mulan forced herself to cultivate the Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art. The backlash had been accumulating, and it finally erupted. Ah, this is a big problem!”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan could no longer stand up. She immediately transmitted her voice using spiritual sense: “Uncle Zhang, I am extremely weak, I can’t even rise to my feet. Please help me stand up, quickly!”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan urged him.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi promptly supported Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Mulan stand up straight again, her posture as upright as a spear, the Red Flower Camp soldiers —who were just worried silent moments ago —burst into cheers.<br/>
<br/>
“If Old General Mu were here, he would have that black thief on the ground in just a few moves!”<br/>
<br/>
“The General is fine. It looks like she’s not seriously injured!”<br/>
<br/>
“How could it be possible that the General was defeated?!”<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers in the Red Flower Camp clamored noisily, and the morale began to waver.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing these voices, Mulan’s vision went dark again. She nearly fainted on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Zhuo’s voice suddenly resounded throughout the entire camp: “Many thanks to Lady Mulan for showing mercy! In order to spare the life of our General Zhang, you deliberately shot wide, thus bearing a huge backlash.”<br/>
<br/>
“From start to finish in this duel, you were intentionally holding back. Such magnanimity is worthy of the heir to the Grand Marshal’s House!”<br/>
<br/>
“Hmph, that black lout was impudent, a mere commoner compared to the grand bearing of our General!”<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Camp soldiers paused, then suddenly realized.<br/>
<br/>
“So that’s how it was!”<br/>
<br/>
“I knew our General couldn’t possibly be defeated!”<br/>
<br/>
The army’s morale stabilized once more.<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo…” Mulan silently mouthed this name in her heart, her perception of Ning Zhuo becoming much more complicated.<br/>
<br/>
Hovering in midair, Zhang Hei heard this and glared, wanting to loudly refute Ning Zhuo’s words, which didn’t match the truth at all.<br/>
<br/>
But at this moment, he received a spiritual transmission from Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei had a lump in his throat, unable to speak, and descended in extreme frustration, greeting Liu Er upon landing.<br/>
<br/>
“Big Brother, why…” Zhang Hei transmitted his thoughts, utterly puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er replied: “Shut up, you reckless fool. Your impulsiveness nearly caused great disaster. Listen more to the Military Advisor, cooperate with him, and don’t talk nonsense.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, oh.” Zhang Hei had no choice but to lower his head, feeling extremely depressed, but he did not disobey Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
After this, Ning Zhuo stepped forward as a mediator to help both sides communicate.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was injured and found it hard to fight; plus, she had a decent impression of Ning Zhuo, so she did not make things difficult.<br/>
<br/>
With Liu Er containing Zhang Hei, the latter could only glare helplessly.<br/>
<br/>
Under the watchful eyes of many, Ning Zhuo arranged for the involved parties to confront each other. He always could effortlessly detect any falsehoods or omitted intentions in the soldiers’ words from both sides.<br/>
<br/>
In less than half a cup of tea’s time, Ning Zhuo had clarified the entire cause and restored the true sequence of events.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er found that indeed his own soldiers had provoked first, even spitting on the face of the Red Flower Camp’s soldier. He took the initiative to apologize to Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan also apologized for going too far in her retaliation.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the disturbance was quelled.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving, Zhang Chongyi used spiritual sense to call out to Ning Zhuo: “Little friend Ning Zhuo, please remain. I have important matters to discuss.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo replied: “Physician Zhang, please don’t blame me, but at this moment, it’s truly inconvenient for me to stay on the spot.”<br/>
<br/>
“I must first return to camp with Generals Liu and Zhang.”<br/>
<br/>
“If you have important matters, you may come to the Three Generals’ Camp later. This junior will naturally welcome you graciously!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, Zhang Hei, Ning Zhuo, and the others left soon afterward.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi sighed and agreed: “Very well.”<br/>
<br/>
Not long after they departed, Shuang Jing received this information.<br/>
<br/>
“Ha ha ha ha.” He laughed triumphantly.<br/>
<br/>
“Who would have thought Mulan would be defeated by Zhang Hei!”<br/>
<br/>
“Defeated well indeed.”<br/>
<br/>
“This conflict came at just the right time, truly a heavenly opportunity. I must seize it!”<br/>
<br/>
With that thought, Shuang Jing decided to take action.<br/>
<br/>
However, there was another person who moved even faster than him.<br/>
<br/>
At the Red Flower Camp:<br/>
<br/>
Just as Mulan was receiving treatment from Zhang Chongyi, she suddenly shouted sternly: “Who’s there!? Show yourself!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan revealed himself, wearing a faint smile: “As expected, General Mulan, you have encountered a mishap cultivating your family’s Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art. Otherwise, with your strength, how could you possibly lose today?”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan stood straight, her face covered with icy frost: “General Sun, you entered the camp without reporting, violating military regulations! I can treat you as an enemy spy and behead you right here.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan sneered, hands behind his back, strolling up to Mulan: “A Golden Core stage little girl, I even held you in my arms when you were born. Trying to scare me?”<br/>
<br/>
He found a chair and casually sat down: “What you say is indeed true; the military regulations are thus.”<br/>
<br/>
“But with your current state, and the Red Flower Camp as it is, can you kill me?”<br/>
<br/>
Speaking this, his expression softened: “I have come this time to help you, no need to be so tense.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan sneered: “I need no help from you.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan: “If you don’t need help, the Red Flower Camp will collapse sooner or later, and then the Grand Marshal’s House will completely decline.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi took a deep breath: “General Sun, whatever ideas you have, just say them.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan’s expression changed drastically.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan said: “Mulan lass, you need strong support, the Red Flower Camp needs assistance, and the Grand Marshal’s House must have someone to uphold it. Look at me… how about it?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi stared wide-eyed: “What?!”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan’s face became even gloomier.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan looked at the red-robed female general before him and said bluntly: “You and I join in dual cultivation, become husband and wife. From now on, I shall take over the Grand Marshal’s House. With my ability, I can surely restore the Grand Marshal’s House to its former glory!”</div>
