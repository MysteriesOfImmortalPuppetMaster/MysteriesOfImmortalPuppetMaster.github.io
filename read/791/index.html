<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo sank into deep thought: "No, it's not about having a stronger opponent to clash with. It’s about finding a... more suitable one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He realized once again that Snow Pivot Guard Xie was fundamentally different from the bronze weapons found within the Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The bronze weapons in the Profound Armor Cave were able to fight only because various martial arts principles had been inscribed upon them. They underwent specific changes based on those principles. Their adaptability in battle was merely a reflection of those principles being affected by external forces; the weapons simply reacted according to their internal programming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">In essence, this reaction was passive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">If the martial arts principles were shallow, the weapon's response would be simple and predictable. As seen in the first few battles within the Profound Armor Cave, cultivators could easily figure out the patterns, defeat the bronze weapons, and pass the trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This was the "Dao of the Pivot Mechanism." Principles served as the "Pivot" (the core), which then triggered the "Mechanism" (the change/response).</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Spirituality was different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Whether it was Snow-Colored Maiden Hui or Snow Pivot Guard Xie, their spiritualities possessed the capacity for thought and even unique personalities. For example, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui’s personality was quite proud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">A spiritual entity’s reaction to the outside world was, at its core, an active response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">An adaptation based on principles might remain stagnant, though profound principles might offer multiple modes of response. However, an adaptation born of spirituality was full of infinite possibilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The weapons of the Profound Armor Cave only had value in their refinement - as more principles were added, they became stronger. The value of spirituality, however, was concentrated in its growth. For instance, through repeated practice with Qing Chi, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui’s skills in runes and combat had improved by leaps and bounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Snow Pivot Guard Xie possessed similar potential for growth, but her opponents needed to be carefully selected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"To cultivate a specific kind of mechanical construct, one must choose the corresponding opponent," Ning Zhuo mused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">While Snow Pivot Guard Xie’s mechanical structure had been significantly optimized and her materials upgraded, her fundamental "positioning" had never shifted. This positioning wasn't something Ning Zhuo had decided arbitrarily; it was based on the nature of her spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">More accurately, it was based on the talent contained within that spirituality - Snow Soul Ice Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This talent carried a major drawback and was commonly judged to be a low-grade talent. The foundation of the soul would grow too rapidly, overwhelming the physical body. Consequently, a cultivator’s body would eventually be frozen to death, leaving only the soul behind. Anyone with the Snow Soul Ice Spirit talent was destined to become a Ghost Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In reality, the soul contained principles of the ice attribute. As it grew, principles related to frost, spirits, and ghosts would multiply and, most importantly, "overflow." This overflow caused the physical body to suffer, with negative effects accumulating until the balance was shattered, leading to dire consequences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Therefore, any method that involved externalizing or discharging energy could more fully utilize the specialties of the Snow Soul Ice Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This defined Snow Pivot Guard Xie’s role: unleashing large-scale offensives to seize control of the entire battlefield. To evolve further from this foundation, she needed to practice against combatants that complemented this role.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">It was at this moment that a flying message from Wen Ruanyu arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">After reading the letter, Ning Zhuo felt a sudden sense of clarity. "So that's how it is!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">With an insider like Wen Ruanyu, he finally gained an accurate understanding of the Qin De affair. Previously, he had only gathered information through the gray-robed cultivators and Sun Lingtong. The truth had been hidden behind a thick fog; now, that fog was swept away, revealing the full picture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Duanmu Zhang proactively gave up the position of 'Academy Head' because he had this goal in mind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Just what are the contents of this Sages' Great Thief Sutra that would make Duanmu Zhang so obsessed, and cause the expansion of the Confucian cultivator group within the Myriad Manifestations Sect to come to a complete standstill?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Inevitably, Ning Zhuo's interest in the Sages' Great Thief Sutra deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He had first heard of this technique from Sun Lingtong, who never hid his true feelings from Ning Zhuo. Upon learning that Sun Lingtong had felt a spiritual resonance with it, Ning Zhuo immediately took it seriously, deciding he had to obtain the Sages' Great Thief Sutra at any cost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">However, the gray-robed cultivator’s first attempt had been a total failure. After Sun Lingtong pressed him, a second attempt was underway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Holding Wen Ruanyu's letter, Ning Zhuo was now certain: the gray-robed cultivator's second attempt was also doomed to fail. There was no suspense about it! The Sages' Great Thief Sutra was actually the focal point of a fierce power struggle between the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s high-level leadership and the Confucian group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The gray-robed cultivator in the black market was clearly a low-to-mid-level figure. Lacking access to this level of intelligence, he had oversimplified the matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Obtaining the Sages' Great Thief Sutra will likely be fraught with difficulties. There’s even a possibility of a serious conflict with the Confucian group, turning friends into enemies!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The situation was truly volatile, capable of turning upside down at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Wen Ruanyu could never have guessed the connection between Sun Lingtong and the Sages' Great Thief Sutra, which was why he had been so open with Ning Zhuo. Before this letter, Ning Zhuo had never imagined that he might one day turn against the Confucian group. In his eyes, their proactive support and willingness to offer protection had been his most valuable foundation upon arriving at the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This was why Ning Zhuo had always sought flexibility, never directly committing to one side, and always maintaining his right to choose. He himself could not predict the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But between the Confucian group and Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo never hesitated - he firmly chose the latter. Even if the Confucian group were a hundred times larger, his choice would never change. Their shared history of life and death, a bond as deep as brothers and as guiding as a father, carried immense weight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Big Brother, Big Brother! We have a new situation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Through the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability, Ning Zhuo sent a message to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">After learning of the situation, Sun Lingtong first gave a mischievous laugh. "In that case, I’m actually looking forward to how that gray-robed guy is going to face me. Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">His expression then turned serious. "If that's the case, it’s going to be very troublesome. This is currently the only Demonic Path Confucian we can even get close to. Little Zhuo, didn't you want to seek the Confucian art of 'Unity of Knowledge and Action'? If we could get Qin De's experience and memories, it would be a huge help to your development!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Just as Ning Zhuo prioritized Sun Lingtong, Sun Lingtong immediately considered Ning Zhuo’s needs over his own. Ning Zhuo had previously attended Zhao Hansheng’s public lectures; even though he wasn't a Confucian, he had been deeply moved. In particular, he felt a strong desire for the "Unity of Knowledge and Action" technique, a matter he had discussed with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The two brothers discussed it for a while but couldn't reach a definitive conclusion. A struggle at this level was completely beyond their current capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">After some discussion, both decided to temporarily give up on Qin De's Sages' Great Thief Sutra. It was simply too unreliable; from the current perspective, hope was slim. Sun Lingtong then returned to his great task of solving the Luo River Water Formation. His understanding of formations had been growing rapidly of late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Breaking the connection, Ning Zhuo stared at the letter in his hand, his brow furrowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He agreed with Wen Ruanyu: although Duanmu Zhang had something to gain, immediately surrendering the "Academy Head" position was a premature move. On the other hand, he saw a hidden test in Wen Ruanyu’s letter - his performance in the Profound Armor Cave had made Wen Ruanyu see him in a new light. By telling him the truth, Wen Ruanyu wanted to see Ning Zhuo's choices and reactions to gauge his political savvy and overall capability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The letter intensified Ning Zhuo’s bad premonitions. "If the Confucian group shifts collectively under Academy Head Zhao Hansheng's leadership, even someone like Wen Ruanyu will be swept up in it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo smelled ambition in the actions of Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing. All these shifts stemmed from Zhao Hansheng’s proactive "concession."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Do not let titles and authority fall into the hands of others!" Even with a high cultivation level, if one didn't understand this, they were merely a tool to be easily used by others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After long deliberation, Ning Zhuo decided to contact Chen San to release the next wave of rumors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Chen San was at the bottom of the hierarchy and his cultivation was mediocre; he couldn't penetrate the high-level circles or obtain the intelligence Wen Ruanyu provided. However, his ability to spread rumors was exceptional. Rumors originating from the bottom were fast and aggressive. Even if the higher-ups wanted to investigate, they would find it difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Of course, it was only relatively difficult. Chen San’s cultivation and methods didn't exceed the Foundation Establishment Stage, so he would be exposed if a major investigation were launched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">However, this was a delicate time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"The high-level leadership of the Myriad Manifestations Sect was already wary of the Confucian group. Now, with this teacher-student pair, Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing, arriving like 'powerful dragons crossing the river,' it will inevitably trigger even more vigilance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing are new arrivals; they have no established intelligence channels. The Sect's high-level leaders are too suspicious to help them. In fact, they would be more than happy to see these rumors flourish."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo’s judgment of the political landscape was quite refined. If it weren't so, he wouldn't have emerged as the greatest winner behind the scenes during the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Seizing this subtle opportunity, he told Chen San to act decisively and boldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The new rumors were built on the previous ones, but with a key difference: they focused almost entirely on Gu Qing, virtually ignoring Zhao Hansheng. Zhao Hansheng’s public lectures on the "Study of the Heart" had shocked everyone; based on that performance alone, his reputation was unshakable. In terms of Confucianism, Ning Zhuo could only feel admiration and could not challenge him directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">If the teacher was untouchable, the student became the target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Suddenly, rumors about Gu Qing reached a fever pitch. Specifically, they focused on comparing Gu Qing to the first batch of genius cultivators emerging from the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Would Situ Xing be stronger than Gu Qing? Who was more powerful, Pi Fujie or Gu Qing?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="117"/>
<paragraph index="118">Gu Qing suddenly felt as if he were being roasted over a fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Most galling were the rumors claiming Gu Qing was only there for experience and had no intention of - nor any possibility of - joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect. This completely alienated him from the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">During the Flying Cloud Assembly, the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s main gate was swarming with cultivators desperate to join the sect. Now they saw someone who didn't want to join, yet was showing off in front of them to gain fame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Would the Myriad Manifestations Sect cultivators have any good feelings toward him? Would the outsiders hoping to join have any? Naturally not.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">With a few light rumors, Ning Zhuo had successfully isolated Gu Qing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Gu Qing, also well-versed in the games of the Righteous Path, knew something was wrong and sought his teacher's advice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">Zhao Hansheng asked him, "Can you not think of a way to break this deadlock?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Gu Qing had already prepared his answer: "The Martial Arts Arena?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Zhao Hansheng nodded slightly, testing him further: "And how should you demonstrate your martial arts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Gu Qing smiled faintly. "Naturally, by inviting all the experts and geniuses, while I fight only using my Painted Skin Clones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Zhao Hansheng stroked his beard and smiled, quite satisfied. "Very good. Go and do it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">Not long after, a flying letter inviting a duel was delivered into Ning Zhuo's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="142"/>
<paragraph index="143">TL Note:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The gender of 'Snow Pivot Guard Xie' has been changed to female.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The translation has been a bit confusing, since 'Ning Xie', the soul inside 'Snow Pivot Guard Xie' was introduced as male, but 'Snow Pivot Guard Xie' has been gendered as 'female'.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">My guess is, Gu Zhen Ren just made a mistake and confused 'Ning Xie' with someone else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Unless there are updates from Gu Zhen Ren, i will keep 'Snow Pivot Guard Xie' as female and 'Ning Xie' as male.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
