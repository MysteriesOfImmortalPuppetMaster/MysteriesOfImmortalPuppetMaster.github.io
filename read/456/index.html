Main general’s command tent.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan sat upright in the main seat, smiling faintly. He gestured for Ning Zhuo to sit on the position to his left.<br/>
<br/>
He leaned forward toward Ning Zhuo: “Military Advisor Ning truly is a young hero, with outstanding looks!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled, sat up straight, and cupped his hands slightly: “General Sun overpraises me. This time you have summoned me here, is it because you wish for me to divine whether the return to the city is safe?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan’s pupils narrowed slightly. He no longer leaned toward Ning Zhuo, but leaned back against the chair, sitting properly, wearing a noncommittal smile: “Could it be that when Military Advisor Ning came, you had already foretold that my army would return to the city?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head lightly: “I am actually not skilled at divination. Only when certain crises approach do I feel depressed and gain a sense of foreboding. In those moments, I can divine a relatively accurate result.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for our army’s return to the city, that requires no calculation at all.”<br/>
<br/>
“Our side is the rear army, meant to join up with the main force. But not long ago, on the march, our army was ambushed and suffered heavy losses.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Barbarian Demon Camp is left with only the main general and his personal guards. The White Jade Camp has only a little over a hundred men left—it's an unbearable sight.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Red Flower Camp and the Three Generals Camp both have many casualties. Only the Fire Cloud Camp and the Golden Halberd Army remained without a single casualty.”<br/>
<br/>
“In total, our forces have been more than halved. Even if we rush to link up with the main force, we have already lost our original significance.”<br/>
<br/>
“Moreover, many troops have suffered heavy losses, yet only Lord Sun’s Golden Halberd Army has not lost a single man. If word of this spreads, it will not sound good at all.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan narrowed his eyes, his expression growing somber.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s words had hit precisely upon what weighed on Sun Gan’s mind.<br/>
<br/>
If the Golden Halberd Army had also lost some men, it would have been easier to explain.<br/>
<br/>
But now, not one man from the entire army was lost, whereas the other units suffered greatly. If others learned of this, they might think Sun Gan had prioritized self-preservation and sacrificed allied troops in exchange for his own merit.<br/>
<br/>
Even though there was no evidence, such a perception would severely damage Sun Gan’s reputation and prestige.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Fire Cloud Camp, they marched in the sky and employed crucial tactics to defeat Lord Long. Others would not point fingers at them.<br/>
<br/>
Under normal circumstances, Sun Gan would not worry too much about idle gossip.<br/>
<br/>
But now there was a huge problem — The White Jade Camp suffered heavy losses, leaving only a little over a hundred survivors. Too many high-born and noble scions had died in this ambush battle.<br/>
<br/>
As the leader, Sun Gan would surely have to bear responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
He was now extremely concerned that those in the royal capital, having lost their family offspring, would vent their anger on him and cause him trouble.<br/>
<br/>
In such a situation, if discussions unfavorable to him spread throughout the army, the avengers would seize upon that point as powerful evidence to attack him.<br/>
<br/>
Should public fury surge, Sun Gan might be impeached and lose his position as the main general, replaced by someone else!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued: “As for the Thousand Peaks Forest side, it is hard to predict.”<br/>
<br/>
“At this moment, the Fire Cloud Camp’s element of surprise has been exposed, so they no longer hold any secret advantage. Moreover, Lord Long survived, and the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King is strong in matters of vitality. Treating Lord Long would be as easy as turning a hand.”<br/>
<br/>
“We have suffered heavy losses. If we continue forward and are ambushed again, what then?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan tapped the armrest of his seat with a finger, contemplating silently.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled faintly: “Actually, setting aside strong enemies like Lord Long and others…”<br/>
<br/>
“What I worry about most is the Old Monster in the Stone!”<br/>
<br/>
“This Nascent Soul stage cultivator’s earth-element techniques are truly too formidable.”<br/>
<br/>
“He can travel underground as if entering an uninhabited realm!”<br/>
<br/>
“I watched the recorded images of this battle at least three times. The Old Monster in the Stone does not match the old reports. This cultivator is deep and reserved, intelligent and resourceful, and he reaped the greatest spoils of war. He was the biggest winner of this battle.”<br/>
<br/>
“A Nascent Soul cultivator like him might be hiding right under our noses at this very moment, quietly listening to the conversation between me and you, General Sun.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan took a deep breath and spoke slowly: “What you say makes sense.”<br/>
<br/>
Observing Sun Gan’s expression grow heavier, Ning Zhuo guessed that the Golden Halberd Army likely had no powerful methods to counter earth-based techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was about to speak when suddenly the tent flap was lifted, and Shuang Jing walked straight in.<br/>
<br/>
“Military Advisor Ning is absolutely right! Our army has fought against the Old Monster in the Stone before and knows very well that, despite his honest and simple outward appearance, he is in truth incredibly cunning and treacherous. In the previous great battle, the Old Monster in the Stone contributed the least effort, yet claimed the greatest merit!”<br/>
<br/>
As the one who suffered the most, Shuang Jing had an extremely deep impression of the Old Monster in the Stone. At this moment, as he spoke, he subconsciously clenched his teeth, his face full of hatred and anger.<br/>
<br/>
“General Shuang,” Ning Zhuo greeted him with cupped hands.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan frowned and stared at Shuang Jing: “General Shuang, you barged into my command tent without reporting first. What is the meaning of this? At this time, you should be inspecting your camp and consoling your wounded and depleted troops.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing shrugged: “My army has been completely crippled. What is there to reorganize? Right now, I just want to return to Green Forest Immortal City as soon as possible and request reinforcements from the royal capital!”<br/>
<br/>
“So why are we still lingering here? Are we waiting for those bastards from Thousand Peaks Forest to turn around and attack again?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan snorted coldly: “With my Golden Halberd Army here, what is there to fear!”<br/>
<br/>
He was about to continue when the tent flap was lifted again.<br/>
<br/>
From outside came a robust Nascent Soul body cultivator —Xu Dali.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali held a jade slip in his hand, looking furious. He questioned Sun Gan, “Sun Gan! What are you scheming? Our army suffered such severe casualties, bearing the brunt of the fiercest attacks, buying you the most precious reaction time.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yet the result!” Xu Dali raised the jade slip in his hand, “You offer us so little compensation! Do you know that many of our men just gave their lives for the country not long ago, and yet you’re so stingy and cold-hearted!”<br/>
<br/>
“Silence!” Sun Gan was furious. He leapt up from his seat with a whoosh and scolded Xu Dali harshly: “General Xu, you had better figure this out. I am currently the commander of the rear army. Moreover, you performed poorly in battle and are a guilty party. What right do you have to shout before me?”<br/>
<br/>
“After we return to Green Forest Immortal City, just wait to be held accountable!”<br/>
<br/>
A flush spread over Xu Dali’s face: “Sun Gan, you despicable man! You led the troops poorly, and now you want to pin all the blame on me. I don’t believe the civil and military officials of the royal capital will let you invert right and wrong, choosing the easy way out!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan slapped the table: “Silence, you oaf!”<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali stepped forward. As he passed by Shuang Jing, he shoved Shuang Jing aside and strode right up to Sun Gan. Across the table, he glared at Sun Gan and roared: “Raise our compensation now, or you will not have a good day today!!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan and Xu Dali immediately fell into a quarrel.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing shook his head, gave Ning Zhuo a bitter smile, and then pointed to the tent flap.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took the hint, stood up, and cupped his hands to Sun Gan in farewell.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan was too entangled in a red-faced shouting match with Xu Dali to spare any attention for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Once outside the tent, Shuang Jing invited Ning Zhuo, saying that once they returned to Green Forest Immortal City, he would host a banquet and hoped Ning Zhuo would do him the honor of attending.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing was a Nascent Soul cultivator, while Ning Zhuo was only Foundation Establishment. Yet Shuang Jing’s attitude was warm and cordial.<br/>
<br/>
This would never have happened before this battle.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, Shuang Jing had come to appreciate the accuracy of the prophetic poem, and the heavy losses this time made him understand the meaning of “Soldiers are ferocious and war is perilous.” Thus, he lowered himself to befriend Ning Zhuo, hoping to utilize every factor that could lead to victory.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo agreed at once, expressing that he was flattered.<br/>
<br/>
Having dealings with Shuang Jing would bring no harm.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not have a bad impression of Shuang Jing: “Though this high-born general was arrogant, he did have breadth of mind. During the previous battle, he took the initiative to order continuous replenishment of the armory to delay the ‘Old Monster in the Stone.’ That strategy was excellent!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo returned to the Three Generals Camp. The three generals were discussing matters.<br/>
<br/>
“Military Advisor, you’re back so soon?” The three generals stood up, and Liu Er greeted him warmly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled wryly: “Sun Gan and Xu Dali got into a quarrel.”<br/>
<br/>
He gave a brief account of what had happened, also mentioning Shuang Jing’s invitation.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er felt a tightness in his heart and immediately realized that Shuang Jing might be trying to recruit Ning Zhuo. His smile became even more enthusiastic.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er grabbed Ning Zhuo’s arm and led him to sit down: “We were just discussing our future plans. Military Advisor, your strategies are outstanding, and your merits are obvious to all. Please guide us.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled lightly: “I originally thought our army would return to Green Forest Immortal City. After meeting with Sun Gan, I am basically certain of this guess.”<br/>
<br/>
“This arrangement is naturally more advantageous than disadvantageous for our army.”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t we lack training? Merely having the Single-line Long Snake Formation and the Triangular Arrow Formation is far from enough. At the very least, we need a defensive battle formation, right?”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er sighed: “What Military Advisor says is very true. We three just now also felt the same. But at present, we have a difficulty!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately understood: “General Liu refers to the matter of military funds?”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er sighed: “Exactly! We suffered many casualties and must take out a large sum to compensate them and stabilize morale.”<br/>
<br/>
“But we were already short on military funds before.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled: “Indeed. Previously, my divination formation also consumed many funds.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er hastily waved his hand: “Military Advisor, that money was well spent, extremely well spent! Had you not calculated the outcome, we would surely be in a situation even more miserable than the Barbarian Demon Camp right now.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also waved his hand, cutting off Liu Er’s further words of thanks: “I felt a bond of friendship at first sight with Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang. We are particularly congenial. Adding the old hatred I bear with the Six Caverns Sect, giving my full assistance is my original intention.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for military funds, I can also contribute some effort.”<br/>
<br/>
“Especially this time, our Three Generals Camp achieved merit by capturing Ma Feitui alive, which is a great accomplishment.”<br/>
<br/>
“Our army will surely be rewarded, and that reward can serve as military funds.”<br/>
<br/>
“Not only that, I will immediately send a message to my Ning Family, explain the newest situation, and hope that the family patriarch will lift restrictions and allow me to use more precious materials. That way, I can subsidize the Three Generals Camp.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei grinned broadly and slapped Ning Zhuo’s shoulder forcefully, causing Ning Zhuo to grimace in pain.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was deeply moved.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong looked at Ning Zhuo even more approvingly.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er immediately acted, heavily slapping Zhang Hei’s hand. With a sudden change in expression, he berated on the spot: “Third Brother, how can you be so rude to the Military Advisor!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei drew back his reddened hand, hissing in pain: “Eldest Brother, you hit harder than I did.”<br/>
<br/>
“I was just getting close with our Military Advisor!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled, saying a few words to excuse Zhang Hei.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er cupped his hands and apologized to Ning Zhuo on Zhang Hei’s behalf.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly returned the courtesy.<br/>
<br/>
The four of them were relaxed and harmonious. When they talked about the rewards to come, all four could not help but feel anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
The quarrel between Xu Dali and Sun Gan remained unresolved.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing was happy to see it unfold. Mulan was busy consoling the troops.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Xu Dali and Sun Gan flew into the clouds and fought a duel. Sun Gan, as the leader of the imperial guards, had outstanding strength and was well equipped, so he originally held the advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali, on the other hand, was injured and not in good form.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the outcome was naturally Sun Gan’s victory.<br/>
<br/>
But because of this fight, Sun Gan lost face as a commander. Xu Dali did not obey him, Shuang Jing gave him no goodwill, and Mulan, coming from the Supreme General’s estate, also ignored him.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Sun Gan no longer wished to linger and ordered the camp to be struck the next morning to return to the city.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp once again marched in a Single-line Long Snake Formation.<br/>
<br/>
This time, the other armies also formed battle arrays, no longer racing ahead as before.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo returned to his previous carriage.<br/>
<br/>
On his right was the heavy-armored blood ape, Da Sheng; on his left was the Buddhist Physician, Meng Yaoyin; still a double guard configuration.<br/>
<br/>
Within the Ten-Thousand-Mile Traveling Dragon, Sun Lingtong used his divine sense to send a message, excitedly reporting to Ning Zhuo: “Little Zhuo, this time we truly gained a lot!”<br/>
<br/>
He had just finished counting.<br/>
<br/>
“What do you mean?” Ning Zhuo asked.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong then told him the details.<br/>
<br/>
One Earth-Milk Pure Spiritual Power Pool, three Enlightened Light Towers, several hundred White Plume Light Dust horses, and many sets of Qiong Jade Armor, Startling Light Spears, Moon Phase Shields, and other military gear.<br/>
<br/>
Among them, there were over eighty Foundation Establishment-level White Plume Light Dust horses, and more than 380 at Qi Refinement-level, totaling over 460. Their market price was 11.32 million mid-grade spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
As for armories like the Qiong Jade Armor and Startling Light Spears, they had plundered seven more. A rough estimate put their total value at around 3.5 million mid-grade spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
“We’re rich! We struck it rich in one battle!” Sun Lingtong danced with joy inside the mechanical traveling dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also smiled. At this moment, he felt he had escaped poverty and suffering.<br/>
<br/>
All together, the total market value exceeded 30.54 million mid-grade spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest treasure was the “Gao Sheng Legacy Book,” its value incalculable!<br/>
<br/>
“So, all the hardship of that previous battle was worth it,” Ning Zhuo sighed.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly in agreement: “Don’t forget, Little Zhuo. The Thousand Peaks Forest side will give a huge reward, and the Two Note Country side will also give official commendations!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath: “This is truly war profiteering, and the feeling is indeed wonderful.”<br/>
<br/>
“Compared to what we gained, we only expended about thirty percent of the Western Pure Land.”<br/>
<br/>
“This price is a drop in the bucket compared to our harvest!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong giggled: “If we could have more wars like this, a dozen times more, I wouldn’t mind.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo restrained his delight: “Boss, we must remain cautious.”<br/>
<br/>
“There’s something I didn’t tell you before. During this ambush battle, I almost lost my life.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s expression changed: “What?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then recounted how he had relied on a Directional Void-Escaping Talisman to save his life.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s smugness disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
“The battlefield is indeed dangerous!” Sun Lingtong said gravely.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: “Walking by the river often, how can one not get their shoes wet? Boss, I think differently from you. Fewer such experiences would be better. More stability would be best.”<br/>
<br/>
“Could our good luck last forever? That is almost impossible.”<br/>
<br/>
“Compared to personally going into battle, I’ve thought of a safer way, one that can still make money.”<br/>
<br/>
As he said this, Ning Zhuo’s expression became somewhat peculiar.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was intrigued and pressed him to explain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not hide it: “I was reminded by Lord Long’s request for a trade before I left.”<br/>
<br/>
“We can’t use the armaments we seized, and it’s hard to send them back to the family or the Ten-Thousand Medicines Sect.”<br/>
<br/>
“So the best way to digest these spoils is to sell them to the Thousand Peaks Forest.”<br/>
<br/>
“But besides these armaments, we can sell even more things. Doesn’t the Thousand Peaks Forest desperately need such military supplies?”<br/>
<br/>
“On the other hand, doesn’t the Two Note Country also have needs?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was puzzled: “It makes sense that Thousand Peaks Forest, without a national backing, would be short of military supplies.”<br/>
<br/>
“But why would the Two Note Country’s army lack supplies? That shouldn’t be the case.”<br/>
<br/>
A slight smile tugged at Ning Zhuo’s lips, which he then forced away: “Boss, since the Old Monster in the Stone is good at earth-based techniques, wouldn’t him continuing to steal army supplies be perfectly normal?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong got the point immediately, striking his fist into his palm: “Brilliant! The Two Note Country’s army doesn’t lack equipment now, so we just have to put in some effort to create that need.”<br/>
<br/>
“And the stolen equipment can still be sold to Thousand Peaks Forest!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo coughed twice: “Boss, we are citizens of the Southern Bean Kingdom. Before leaving our country, we received a secret commission from a royal family member, Lord Zhu Xuanji.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Southern Bean Kingdom needs a weakened Two Note Country.”<br/>
<br/>
“For the sake of our nation, we must fully apply our abilities, to relieve the king’s worries and benefit the millions of our Southern Bean Kingdom’s citizens.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Thousand Peaks Forest cannot be allowed to fall, and the Two Note Country must not end this easily.”<br/>
<br/>
“The longer this war drags on, the better!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong took a deep breath, a flush of excitement on his face: “Exciting, truly exciting.”<br/>
<br/>
“So fun, really fun!”<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, it was absolutely right for us to travel the world together.”<br/>
<br/>
“This life is truly wonderful!”<br/>
<br/>
“Let’s stir this place into flames of war, turning the world upside down!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head, once again emphasizing: “No, no, no, we must endure silently for family and country.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong brushed the tip of his nose: “Hmph, say whatever you want.”<br/>
<br/>
A few days later.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan led the rear army back once more to Green Forest Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
The first to enter the city was not the Golden Halberd Army, nor the Fire Cloud Camp.<br/>
<br/>
It was a prison cart.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the prison cart was Ma Feitui in human form.<br/>
<br/>
Upon seeing this, the city’s residents all cheered.<br/>
<br/>
After that, Sun Gan entered the city riding a fine steed, waving to the crowd as if returning in triumph.<br/>
<br/>
As those who had captured Ma Feitui alive, the Three Generals—Liu, Guan, and Zhang—followed close behind Sun Gan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, who had composed the prophetic poem and won the attention of many commanders, his status soaring, also followed behind the Three Generals, seizing the chance to earn himself some prestige.<br/>
<br/>
The army paraded through the city, and most of the cultivators then went out of the city again to set up camp.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stayed in the city and went straight to Master Jin Li the Grand Artisan, purchasing many precious materials, planning to repair the Ten-Thousand-Mile Traveling Dragon by himself.<br/>
<br/>
The Two Note Country’s rewards were swift.<br/>
<br/>
On the second day after entering the city, an envoy arrived with an imperial edict.<br/>
<br/>
The special reward that Ning Zhuo requested also followed right after!</div>
