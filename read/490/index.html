Ning Zhuo’s expression was as calm as water.<br/>
<br/>
Although he and Mulan had become husband and wife, it was merely a political marriage without any real substance.<br/>
<br/>
All along, this had been kept from the general public, with only a few people at the time aware of it.<br/>
<br/>
This was a tacit understanding among the righteous path.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was not surprised that Shuang Ling knew about this matter. After all, she was from the royal family, and it was quite normal for her to know the inside story.<br/>
<br/>
However, at this very moment, in front of everyone, she had revealed this secret.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling had broken that tacit understanding of the righteous path, which was undoubtedly a serious provocation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stared at Shuang Ling.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling sneered, “Little child, is this the Ning family’s upbringing? I am a princess of the Two Note Kingdom, a Nascent Soul cultivator, and your elder. You are being far too rude.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. “I am from the Southern Bean Kingdom, responding to your kingdom’s ruler’s call to support the righteous path and fight the demonic cultivators of the Thousand Peaks Forest.”<br/>
<br/>
“I always believed the King of the Two Note Kingdom to be gracious toward worthy people, a model for the realm. Yet from the princess today, I have gotten a different impression.”<br/>
<br/>
“You are a princess of noble status, yet you come down on me, a mere junior, so forcefully. What sort of reason is that?”<br/>
<br/>
“So is this how the Two Note Kingdom treats the itinerant cultivators who have come to fight?”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling’s face changed slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Right from the start, Ning Zhuo had pinned a major accusation on her, turning her lofty status into a weakness.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that the situation looked bad, the City Lord of Green Forest Immortal City hurriedly stepped in to smooth things over.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling gave a light laugh, pointed at Ning Zhuo, and said, “Kid, you certainly have a sharp tongue. Interesting. The battlefield is perilous, so I hope that after this war, I will still see you.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling lacked skill in verbal sparring and had already been cut by Ning Zhuo’s subtle retort. Taking advantage of the way out offered by the City Lord of Green Forest Immortal City, she slowly sat down, no longer tangling with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
However, although she did not continue arguing, she repeatedly opposed Ning Zhuo during the subsequent auction.<br/>
<br/>
Anything mechanical that Ning Zhuo fancied, she would purchase at a high price, using her position to suppress him. The hostility was obvious.<br/>
<br/>
By the end of the auction, Ning Zhuo had obtained very little.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m somewhat angry now,” Ning Zhuo said to Mulan on the way back.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan pondered and said, “After all, she’s long been famous in the royal family. Known throughout the nation as the Princess of Mechanisms, she’s a flagship figure among the royal Nascent Souls.”<br/>
<br/>
“There’s no need to directly clash with her; we’d only suffer for it.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan did not want to back Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Shuang Ling had revealed her marriage to Ning Zhuo, breaking the tacit understanding of the righteous path, Mulan did not really care.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, she had been raised by Old Marshal Mu since childhood to be loyal to the Two Note Kingdom. On the other hand, she did not mind this part of her reputation. Deep inside, she even preferred for their marriage to be exposed, securing her relationship with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
If this could destroy the marriage arrangement between Ning Zhuo and the Southern Bean Kingdom’s royal family and bind him to the Mu High Marshal’s Mansion, Mulan would be quite pleased.<br/>
<br/>
The longer she spent with Ning Zhuo, the more interested Mulan became in him.<br/>
<br/>
“Uncle Zhang, older than me and with keen eyes, already knew Ning Zhuo was my ideal husband.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was young and wealthy, possessed extraordinary mastery of the five elements, and despite only being in Foundation Establishment, had Golden Core-level combat prowess.<br/>
<br/>
His resourcefulness, his social skills, and how he fulfilled his duties swiftly as the strategist and chief officiant in the Three Generals Camp—all of these Mulan had taken note of.<br/>
<br/>
“Those three boorish men in the Three Generals Camp need Ning Zhuo for bookkeeping. Don’t my Red Flower Camp soldiers need that, too?”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was calculating how to secure Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo tested her intentions, he immediately understood Mulan’s thoughts and said nothing further.<br/>
<br/>
The two of them remained silent until they exited the city gates. Once outside, Ning Zhuo parted ways and went back to the Three Generals Camp to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
In the days that followed, he primarily drilled his troops and cultivated.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever he had leisure time, Ning Zhuo returned to the Immortal City to buy mechanical pedestals, only to find that the Princess of Mechanisms had already bought them all out.<br/>
<br/>
“Son-in-law! Son-in-law of the High General’s Mansion, congratulations to you indeed!”<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Daren, my master has prepared a small banquet at the restaurant and humbly invites you to grace us with your presence.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Daren, please take the seat of honor.”<br/>
<br/>
With news of Ning Zhuo’s marriage to Mulan exposed, everything he did in the Immortal City drew massive attention.<br/>
<br/>
He had to disguise himself in hopes of making his purchases.<br/>
<br/>
Still, he failed to buy any pedestals.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling used her status to suppress all shops, completely monopolizing them.<br/>
<br/>
“This is too much. Little Zhuo, maybe it’s time for us ‘the old stone monster’ to take action!” Sun Lingtong felt extremely indignant on Ning Zhuo’s behalf.<br/>
<br/>
Yet Ning Zhuo shook his head, calmly analyzing, “Princess of Mechanisms Shuang Ling is also adept at coordinating large groups. She arrived in Green Forest Immortal City so hastily that even Shuang Jing wasn’t informed.”<br/>
<br/>
“Now that she’s here, she’s aggressively buying up every kind of material and taking over all the mechanical pedestals. Clearly, she’s making active preparations for war.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oppressing us is simply a side effect.”<br/>
<br/>
“She’s a princess of the Two Note Kingdom, so she must know more than we do. Perhaps we’re not far from marching to the front again.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s assessment was correct.<br/>
<br/>
The date for the rear army to set out came earlier than he had anticipated.<br/>
<br/>
Only three days later, an order arrived from the army, and that very night, the rear army set off again.<br/>
<br/>
They marched in cautious formations. At the slightest sign of trouble, they halted to make battle preparations, which showed just how deeply the last ambush had shaken them.<br/>
<br/>
This time, the journey passed without incident.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Halberd Army, Red Flower Camp, Barbarian Demon Camp, White Jade Camp, Three Generals Camp, and Fire Cloud Camp all successfully reached the main army’s station—Wooden Wheel Town.<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan, the Three Armies Commander of the Two Note Kingdom, summoned the various officers in batches.<br/>
<br/>
When the Three Generals Camp’s turn arrived, Du Tiechuan gave a direct order for their strategist and chief officiant, Ning Zhuo, to come as well.<br/>
<br/>
So Ning Zhuo went along with Liu, Guan, and Zhang, getting a close look at Du Tiechuan, the Soul Formation-stage cultivator and commander of the Three Armies.<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan was somewhat thin, his features sharply defined. His gaze was deep and tranquil, and his skin looked a bit pale. He wore a silver-thread hair crown, a gray-green robe, and silver armor over it, radiating a steely air.<br/>
<br/>
When Liu, Guan, and Zhang gave their report, Du Tiechuan merely made a sound of acknowledgment, then set his eyes on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
He said, “Ning Zhuo, please have a seat.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang maintained respectful expressions; only Liu Er’s brow twitched slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thanked him, then perched with half his seat on the chair, placing his hands on his thighs, sitting upright and proper.<br/>
<br/>
The identity of the strategist and chief officiant, or even that of the Ning family, was not enough for a Soul Formation cultivator and Three Armies Commander to treat him so kindly.<br/>
<br/>
Being Mulan’s husband, the son-in-law of the Mu Grand Marshal’s Mansion, was what mattered most.<br/>
<br/>
After a few words of encouragement, Du Tiechuan dismissed the four of them.<br/>
<br/>
On their way back, Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning used divine sense to exchange impressions of Du Tiechuan.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was absent-minded.<br/>
<br/>
He could not help thinking that Ning Zhuo received such courtesy only because he had become Mulan’s husband. According to the royal decree, he himself should have been Mulan’s real husband!<br/>
<br/>
The thought made Liu Er feel quite uneasy. Occasionally, he cast cold glances at Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo returned to his tent, he resumed his routine cultivation, circulating the power of his three dantians and nurturing his treasured medicine.<br/>
<br/>
In the middle of the night, the alarm bell suddenly rang, echoing through Wooden Wheel Town.<br/>
<br/>
“Enemy attack!”<br/>
<br/>
“That bell means there’s an enemy attack!”<br/>
<br/>
“And it must be a powerful enemy!!”<br/>
<br/>
Each army reacted at once, and in this moment, it was clear who was the most well-drilled.<br/>
<br/>
Without question, the Red Flower Camp took the lead, though they were not too far ahead of the Golden Halberd Army.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately stopped cultivating and rushed out of his tent to join Liu, Guan, and Zhang.<br/>
<br/>
They had reacted even faster than Ning Zhuo, each already on horseback, rallying their forces.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s mechanical army was far simpler to command than living troops, and it could be carried anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
All the same, Ning Zhuo first joined up with the Three Generals Camp’s forces, wanting to assess the real situation before making any moves.<br/>
<br/>
After a short while, the scouts returned to report that there was no trace of an enemy force in the surrounding area.<br/>
<br/>
“Could it be a false alarm?”<br/>
<br/>
Just as this thought arose, the army orders were transmitted.<br/>
<br/>
The contents were so startling that only the officers and higher-ups were informed, to avoid unsettling the soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
“What?! Commander Du Tiechuan was ambushed and is now seriously injured?!”<br/>
<br/>
“Who in the world did it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Sheng Xu the Young Master?!”<br/>
<br/>
