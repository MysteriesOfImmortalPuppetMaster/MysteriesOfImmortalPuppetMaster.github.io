<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 328: The Ancestor Favors Ning Zhuo Too Much</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Family. Meeting Hall. The Spirit Lantern emitted a bright glow, illuminating the room. The elders of the Ning family gathered here, but the main seat and the seat to its left were both empty. Both the family head and the young master had perished.<br/>
<br/>
The elders wore somber expressions, their mood grim as they began discussing the state of affairs.<br/>
<br/>
"The Red Flame Beast tide besieging the Lava Immortal Palace has receded by about sixty percent. In a few days, the beasts surrounding Fire Persimmon Immortal City will likely retreat as well. When that happens, the City Lord's Mansion should release an announcement. Instead of focusing only on disaster relief and clearing out the mountain demons, we should aim to control the border defenses," said one of the elders from the Talisman Hall, immediately receiving approval from the majority.<br/>
<br/>
It had already been four days since Ning Zhuo voluntarily handed over the position of palace master to Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, on the day Meng Kui became the palace master, Three Nascent Soul cultivators aswell as Zhu Xuanji, Book Master, and others, joined forces in a counterattack, slaughtering countless Red Flame Demon Beasts and directly crushing their rampant arrogance.<br/>
<br/>
These three Nascent Soul cultivators were, of course, Meng Kui, Meng Hu, and a cultivator from the Purple Dawn Pavilion. The Purple Dawn Pavilion had used the excuse of a disciple being mistakenly slain by the Zheng family to seek an opportunity to lay claim to the Lava Immortal Palace. However, when Meng Kui became the palace master and willingly displayed his power, the Purple Dawn Pavilion Nascent Soul cultivator quickly realized their plans had failed.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at Meng Hu and Meng Kui, the Purple Dawn Pavilion cultivator gritted his teeth in frustration. "The Meng family’s two generals are truly formidable."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Hu's attention, however, was fixed on the Purple Dawn Pavilion cultivator’s "Life Shield." After a prolonged battle, Meng Hu had yet to see any sign of breaking the shield, and he himself had been injured multiple times, with every defensive measure severely weakened.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui merely smiled, assuring the Purple Dawn Pavilion cultivator that he would leave empty-handed, as he planned to hand over the entire Zheng family.<br/>
<br/>
This puzzled the Purple Dawn Pavilion Nascent Soul cultivator, and only after detailed questioning did he learn that although two of the Zheng family’s core ancestors were still alive, their main pillars of strength, like Zheng Hua, had fallen.<br/>
<br/>
With this understanding, the Purple Dawn Pavilion cultivator’s tone softened: "You mean to take the corpses of both Zheng Shuangjun and Zheng Danlian?"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui nodded, implying deeper meaning. "Zheng Danlian’s corpse can’t give it to you, but Zheng Shuangjun has already been slain by demonic cultivators and we know where his body is."<br/>
<br/>
The Purple Dawn Pavilion cultivator sighed in frustration, as this would satisfy his sect’s demands, though the negotiations had clearly not gone in his favor.<br/>
<br/>
The Fire Flame Beast tide had suffered heavy losses, but as they were mere beasts lacking intelligence, their instincts drove them to continue fighting. However, the cultivators led a relentless charge, pushing deep into the heart of Fire Persimmon Mountain, before finally stopping.<br/>
<br/>
During this assault, yet another Nascent Soul-level Red Flame Beast was gravely wounded, marking a turning point in the battle.<br/>
<br/>
"I must purify myself for a day before returning to the palace to cleanse the bloodlust," sighed the Purple Dawn Pavilion Nascent Soul cultivator, refraining from further involvement in the fight. Meng Kui also ceased his attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Only Ning Zhuo, still brimming with fighting spirit, let out a howl that echoed across the mountain, shaking the clouds. The beast tide had been suppressed!<br/>
<br/>
The elders of the Ning family continued to discuss their internal matters—evaluating the losses, repairing defensive formations, and issuing compensation. Eventually, they reached a topic that none wanted to address.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo is the true threat! Do you really plan to stop Ning Zhuo from performing the public sacrificial rites for our fallen clan members?" asked one of the recently promoted elders, Ning Qingqiao.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Qingqiao, a genius with immense talent, had only reached the Foundation Establishment stage, which normally would not qualify him to sit among the elders. However, due to the tragic losses during the beast attack, the family had been left with no choice but to elevate him.<br/>
<br/>
The hall fell into a heavy silence.<br/>
<br/>
The elder from the Academy Hall sighed deeply, "The country faces turmoil, and so does the family."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Qingqiao immediately continued, "If Ning Zhuo is allowed to preside over the sacrificial rites, the hearts of the branch families will surely lean toward him. And when that happens, how will you face the divide between the main family and the branches?"<br/>
<br/>
The other elders frowned, all too aware of the political realities they faced. The main and branch families balanced each other like a lever—if one side was pressed down, the other would rise.<br/>
<br/>
"Not to mention, Ning Zhuo has already gained the ancestor’s approval regarding the branch family headship. There’s no turning back now. Even if Ning Zhuo presides over the rites, what can we do to stop it?" Ning Qingqiao pressed on.<br/>
<br/>
A cold silence followed. Ning Zhuo's sudden rise was truly unexpected. No one could have predicted that such a young genius would split the massive Ning family in two!<br/>
<br/>
"Without the Lava Immortal Palace, this would never have happened!" another elder murmured, frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the lack of strong opposition, Ning Qingqiao grew more agitated. "If we can’t stop him openly, we must take covert measures! If Ning Zhuo completes the sacrificial rites, it will severely undermine our influence, granting the branch families more power."<br/>
<br/>
He had just finished speaking when his face suddenly contorted in pain, and he spat blood, collapsing to the ground. The elders, startled, found themselves immobilized by a powerful pressure.<br/>
<br/>
The family head’s main seat began to glow, revealing the presence of the Ning family's ancestor, Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
"Infighting within the family? Such disloyalty—how can this family ever rise to greatness?" Ning Jiufan’s voice thundered, freezing the hall in fear.<br/>
<br/>
"Ancestor!" the elders cried, scrambling to absolve themselves, with some quickly distancing themselves from Ning Qingqiao's statements, claiming they didn’t represent the family’s view.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Qingqiao, still coughing blood, seethed in fury at their betrayal.<br/>
<br/>
After a sharp rebuke, Ning Jiufan stripped Ning Qingqiao of his elder status, sentencing him to eight years of meditation to reflect on his mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Jiufan departed, the elders were finally able to move again, drenched in cold sweat. They all looked at Ning Qingqiao with a mixture of contempt and relief, realizing that dealing with Ning Zhuo required far more than brute strength. Even a genius like Ning Qingqiao had failed miserably.<br/>
<br/>
The elders then resumed their discussion, their stance shifting.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo’s sacrificial rites are not a bad thing," one elder said.<br/>
<br/>
"Indeed, he is a talent of our family," agreed another.<br/>
<br/>
The elders, previously united against Ning Zhuo, now voiced their support. But Ning Qingqiao, realizing the ancestor’s favoritism, fainted in despair.<br/>
<br/>
The other elders, though secretly agreeing with Ning Qingqiao’s bitterness, chose not to voice their opinions.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan, who had left the hall but still kept his spiritual sense watching over them, sighed.<br/>
<br/>
He had been deeply impressed by Ning Zhuo’s strength and cunning in the face of Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui. Although he regretted not recognizing Ning Zhuo’s talent sooner, Ning Jiufan was now determined to support him.<br/>
<br/>
Reflecting on Ning Zhuo’s prowess, Ning Jiufan knew that the future of the Ning family lay in the hands of this young genius.<br/>
<br/>
If the elders of the main branch knew the truth about the Lava Immortal Palace, they would certainly have a deep understanding of Ning Jiufan.<br/>
The display of power from Ning Zhuo in front was enough to astonish Ning Jiufan!<br/>
The ability to directly control the puppet Meng Yaoyin, and confront Zheng Danlian head-on.<br/>
<br/>
The prowess of Rudie Nan, a quasi-Golden Core level puppet.<br/>
<br/>
The power of Golden Battle Blood Ape, the underworld envoy Qi Bai, and the extraordinary talents of Ice Crystal Snow.<br/>
<br/>
With such mechanical constructs in hand, who would dare to underestimate Ning Zhuo as just a mere mid-level Qi Refinement cultivator?<br/>
<br/>
Such a seemingly weak palace master has completely surpassed me, Ning Jiufan!<br/>
And Ning Zhuo, in dealing with Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui, demonstrated such skill that Ning Jiufan couldn’t help but view him in a new light, finally taking him seriously.<br/>
<br/>
He secretly regretted that he had not recognized Ning Zhuo’s excellence sooner and had been late in winning him over.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he felt a sense of relief that Ning Zhuo had voluntarily distanced himself from the main family, sparing us from his potential disruption. With his righteous methods and strategies, who could rival the main family under such a capable palace master?<br/>
<br/>
Have you not seen how the Ning clan’s patriarch and multiple clan leaders perishe?<br/>
Ning Jiufan publicly supported Ning Zhuo, all to protect the Main Branch. After all, he had promised to protect the future members of the main brain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's handling of Ning Qingqiao was also meant to help him fully recognize reality and hope that, after eight years of reflection and cultivation in isolation, he could use his natural talents to provide strength for the main branch.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, Ning Qingqiao, having suddenly gained the status of an elder, had become too arrogant. If Ning Qingqiao had acted his life would be in great danger!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui have already agreed to protect the core secrets of the Lava Immortal Palace dispute. Even though Ning Jiufan had been informed in advance, he couldn’t leak any information.<br/>
<br/>
The others, not knowing the truth, cannot understand his painstaking efforts.</div>
