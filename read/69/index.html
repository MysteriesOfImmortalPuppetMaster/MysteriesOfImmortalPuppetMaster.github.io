<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“Who dares trespass on the rear courtyard!” A servant shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo walked over and gave the servant a harsh kick. Then, he pulled out a warrant and shoved it in the servant’s face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Open your eyes and take a good look!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“I’m here to find your gang leader, Yuan Er, on Sir Fei Si’s orders. You dare stop me?” Ning Zhuo shouted loudly, glancing at the other servants with an imposing demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Is it someone from the City Lord Mansion again?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“The last messenger directly forced us to sell the monkey corpses, and the gang leader couldn’t say a word!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“What’s this messenger here for this time?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In the Monkey Head Gang, there were already many members complaining about Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Most of the gang members were beast tamers and had raised their monkey pets for many years. How could they have no emotions? They naturally wanted to bury the corpses with honor. But in the end, Yuan Er couldn’t withstand the pressure and directly sold the corpses to the Flying Disk Workshop. This move had been a heavy blow to his reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Now that Yuan Dasheng was seriously injured, the whole Monkey Head Gang was in a panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo only needed to pull out the warrant to walk straight in. It didn’t take long for him to reach the rear courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">In the rear courtyard’s master bedroom, Yuan Er sat blankly under the dim light. Looking at the deathly Yuan Dasheng on the bed in front of him, tears flowed silently from his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He had thought that he knew how important Yuan Dasheng was, to both himself and the Monkey Head Gang. But it was only now that the ape was dying that Yuan Er fully realized the weight of this importance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Although Zhu Xuanji had saved Yuan Dasheng’s life, it was only a temporary relief. At this point, even if the ape took the Late Autumn Life Preservation Pill, it would still be bedridden for life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">This tragic news was a huge blow to Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Suddenly, a sound came from outside the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yuan Er trembled. Had the elders come to force him to abdicate?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Without Yuan Dasheng, who would support him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Then, Ning Zhuo’s voice rang out. “Where is Gang Leader Yuan Er? I’ve come bearing Sir Fei Si’s orders. There’s an urgent matter that must be handled.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Yuan Er’s face was still covered with tears. As he walked out of the bedroom, he saw the arrogant-looking Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Yuan Er was a Foundation Establishment cultivator and already had divine sense. At this moment, he sent out his divine sense and confirmed that the order token was genuine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Not daring to be neglectful, he bowed to Ning Zhuo and said, “I grew up under Uncle Monkey’s gaze, and his kindness toward me is as heavy as a mountain. Now that he’s in such a miserable state, I must take care of him and won’t leave his side. Please pass my words on to Sir Fei Si. I’m truly sorry that I can no longer participate in the Fire Persimmon Festival.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Yuan Er looked depressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">An explosion occurred in the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest, and Yuan Dasheng was now dying. This was a complete defeat not only for him, but for the entire Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Without Yuan Dasheng’s protection, how could he head out carelessly?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo smiled and put away the warrant. “Gang Leader Yuan Er, I’m here to save your life. Did you know that you’re going to die soon?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Yuan Er was infuriated. “Messenger, there’s no need to try to scare me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo immediately replied, “Me, trying to scare you? Gang Leader Yuan Er, do you have the guts to dismiss the people around us and hear me out?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Yuan Er snorted coldly. His eyes flickered, and he waved his hand to the servants around him. "All of you, go back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Seeing that everyone was gone, Ning Zhuo directly swaggered into the master bedroom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">His behavior was extremely rude. Yuan Er was so angry that his face turned blue, but he forced himself to endure it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Stepping into the master bedroom, Ning Zhuo’s gaze immediately fell on the bedridden Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The ape was clearly dying, with barely any vitality left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">In that instant, Ning Zhuo had a strong impulse to kill the ape immediately!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">But he took a deep breath and held himself back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He couldn’t kill it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Oftentimes, the simplest solution would in fact cause the situation to deteriorate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">If he suddenly made a move here, Yuan Er would definitely stop him. As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the gang leader was far stronger than Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Moreover, even if he successfully killed the ape, he was already in the Monkey Head Gang’s base camp. Escaping would be difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">And most importantly, if Ning Zhuo killed Yuan Dasheng here, he would publicly offend Zhu Xuanji!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zhu Xuanji saved the ape’s life, while he rushed into its house to kill it. Wasn’t this completely disregarding Sir Zhu Xuanji?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhu Xuanji was a divine investigator and had already interrogated Ning Zhuo over the matter of the Lava Immortal Palace. Now, Ning Zhuo was going to crook his finger and provoke another investigation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Even Sir Fei Si wouldn’t dare to act so recklessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Yuan Er followed him in and spoke unhappily in a lowered voice. “Let’s not disturb my Uncle Monkey’s rest. Messenger, please come with me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He then led Ning Zhuo into a side room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">This was a small study. Ning Zhuo took the initiative to close the door and said bluntly, “Gang Leader Yuan Er, how long do you think you will remain the gang leader?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Yuan Er’s face darkened. “If you’re here to sow discord, please leave.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo laughed mockingly. “Gang Leader Yuan Er, I came to save your life. Is this how you treat your savior?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Listen up. The medicinal pill that Sir Zhu Xuanji gave you and the words he said back then were all recorded by the formation. Everyone knows about them now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Even if Yuan Dasheng survives, it’ll be crippled. Without the ape, who will obey Yuan Er?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"You know very well how your father rose to power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“The Monkey Head Gang rose up through countless bloody battles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“How many people were offended during the process? How many enemies are hiding in the dark?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Now, there is finally an opportunity to avenge their hatred. Will they just sit back and watch you live in peace, enjoying wealth and glory?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">These words struck deep, and Yuan Er’s gaze flickered. “How can you help me, messenger?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo lifted the order token again, deliberately showing off the two words “Fei Si” on the back side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“When it comes to backing, how can a mere ape compare to Sir Fei Si?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yuan Er’s eyes shone as he said in disbelief, “You mean, I can rely on Sir Fei Si?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo sneered and immediately broke his delusions. “Don’t even think about it. The Monkey Head Gang couldn’t catch the eye of Sir Fei Si even when it was at its peak, let alone now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“What I mean is, you should rely on me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Yuan Er was a little embarrassed, but he knew that Ning Zhuo was speaking the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Gangs were full of aggressive hoodlums and involved themselves in many unclean matters. An official of the Southern Bean Immortal Dynasty would obviously not want to tarnish their reputation by associating with such people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Fei Si was at the Golden Core stage. Putting it bluntly, the Monkey Head Gang was completely useless to him. Of course, this was only as long as Yuan Dasheng didn’t reveal its true strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Yuan Er looked Ning Zhuo up and down, then bowed. “May I ask the messenger’s name?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“My surname is Ning and my given name is Zhuo. I am a member of the Ning Clan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo immediately pulled out his clan name as intimidation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Yuan Er’s expression grew wary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo then shook the order token in his hand. “I am also appreciated by Sir Fei Si, and can be considered an errand boy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Yuan Er became solemn and waved his hand. “Please sit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo had spoken modestly, but Yuan Er knew that this so-called errand boy should be someone close to Fei Si, and might even be a confidant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Under Yuan Er’s invitation, Ning Zhuo slowly sat down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">A desk separated the two people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo continued, “I am also a member of Flying Disk Workshop, and personally crafted many mechanical monkeys.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Yuan Er jumped to his feet in fury. “You’re the one who sent the assassin? The one who poisoned my gang’s monkey pets?! How dare you come here?!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
