<paragraph index="1">Organizing an army......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Relying on an existing cultivation nation had saved him a lot of trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Without one, Ning Zhuo would have to start from scratch to organize an army, and the cost would be quite high. He had to solve issues such as military registration, discipline, authority, organization, and morale by himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Even if he painstakingly organized an army, the subsequent maintenance cost would be enormous.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“That is not an option for me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Therefore, the better choice was to focus on elite mechanisms, such as Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The heavily-armored Blood Ape · Dasheng had clearly fallen behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The main purpose of designing this mechanical war mechanism was actually to help Ning Zhuo cultivate the Demonic Blood Vein Skill. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The reason its defense was outstanding was that at the time, Ning Zhuo spared no expense, leveraging multiple forces and using a large amount of precious materials to make it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In terms of design, it could only be considered below average.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In the two national battlefields, the heavily-armored Blood Ape · Dasheng became a meat target, attracting so much fire that almost every time it appeared in battle, it ended up being scrapped, and could be called high-grade cannon fodder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">There was no helping it; in such large-scale battles, even the material of the heavily-armored Blood Ape · Dasheng appeared weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">As for the Shadow Blade Night Tiger · Yehu, it had repeatedly achieved military merit. After all, its design scheme was far superior to that of the heavily-armored Blood Ape · Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Its different positioning made it easier for it to achieve military success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">But its shortcoming was that its materials were not good enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“I needed to redesign the mechanical body for Yuan Dasheng; this time, I must ponder it carefully and strive to reach a top-level design.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“Meng Yehu’s design could be retained. Taking this opportunity of scrapping and overhauling, I could just replace it with better materials for reconstruction.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo quickly finalized the plans for Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Although he had preserved many battle merits without redeeming them, he still had a lot of precious materials on hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The reason for this was Tian Shuang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Under the influence of Buddha’s Thoughts, Tian Shuang voluntarily gave almost his entire estate to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">This powerful ghost cultivator had long been famous among the nations, and his estate was extremely abundant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Even though the main materials were related to the Ghost Path and Soul Cultivation, there were still plenty of conventional precious materials, reaching the Nascent Soul level, that could be used for Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">However, even after the plan was set, Ning Zhuo first directly repaired the heavily-armored Blood Ape · Dasheng and the Shadow Blade · Yehu according to their original forms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Relying on the Nascent Soul-level mechanical pedestal, even if these two mechanisms were scrapped, they could still be quickly remolded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After the Two Note Nation War, Ning Zhuo had changed enormously. Especially in the aspect of being vigilant in times of peace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He preferred to spend a little more money to quickly repair Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu to ensure his own combat strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Who knew whether an accident might occur in the next moment, and whether that accident would be fatal?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After repairing these two war mechanisms, Ning Zhuo again possessed two great Golden Core level battle forces, and he felt much more at ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">As for those ordinary mechanical mechanisms, Ning Zhuo did not make them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">His military position would soon be abolished, and the formation of a mechanical army would be canceled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In such a case, if he displayed so many mechanical mechanisms, it would be like a beast-tamer summoning a large number of demon pets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo’s military tactic of the Hero's Return would hardly be effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Therefore, even if these mechanical mechanisms served as cannon fodder, they turned out to be extremely cost-inefficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“When I faced conflicts, it was mainly with individual strong opponents. These mechanical mechanisms were too ordinary; once released, they could easily be pierced by strong opponents, implementing a decapitation tactic against me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“In addition to occupying my divine sense in controlling these mechanisms, they had almost no offensive capability.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo, pragmatic and flexible, immediately adjusted the general direction of mechanism production, shifting from scale and quantity to producing elite individuals in order to achieve a higher standard in quality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo focused his next efforts on the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">This treasure-level mechanical war armor had performed astonishingly in the grand battle—Ning Zhuo had repeatedly resisted Xiang Yue with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The upper half of the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor was already scarred and cracked, needing delicate repair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“If I relied solely on my own ability, I could not repair the upper half of the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor. Fortunately, I had the mechanical pedestal.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo’s own cultivation was too weak, only at the Foundation Establishment stage, and it was difficult for his meager spiritual power to do much for a Nascent Soul-level treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The mechanical pedestal allowed him to reach realms beyond his own ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This was the essence of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">By now, the entire cultivation world was thriving, and the exquisite techniques of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation allowed cultivators to transcend cultivation levels and sects, accomplishing things they could not do on their own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Repairing the upper half of the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor should pose no problem.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“But its lower half needed a better restoration!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The lower half of the current Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor was just a roughly made imitation by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">It was also Ning Zhuo’s luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">During the previous grand battle, this weakness had not been discovered. The vast majority of cultivators were caught up in their own skirmishes, too busy to pay attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The timing of Ning Zhuo’s participation in the battlefield was also very good, and he never attracted too much attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">After he joined forces with Mu Lan and Liu Guan Zhang, for a long time he enjoyed a local advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The mechanical Dragon weaved through the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“What was that sound?” Sun Lingtong suddenly had a jolt and quickly contacted Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo, buried in the mechanical pedestal and meticulously repairing the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor, immediately looked up after receiving the transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The attentive big-headed youth listened carefully for a moment, then looked puzzled: “I didn’t hear anything.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong exclaimed, “You didn’t hear? Strange! The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon did not detect anything either. But I indeed heard a series of hissing sounds, as if the tide was surging.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“This sound kept ringing and grew louder. Could you really not hear it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo subconsciously fumbled for the mechanical ring on his finger, but it showed no reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">However, Ning Zhuo was not complacent and frowned slightly, “Boss, our understanding of the void was only half-baked. My mechanical ring had only inherited a bit of talent.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“To be safe, we should return to the mortal realm first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“We weren’t in a hurry anyway; there was no need to stubbornly face the risk.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Sun Lingtong nodded, “You’re right, Little Zhuo, let’s slip out first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Thus, the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon departed from the void and returned to the present world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">In the present world, it was morning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">A light snowfall had just stopped not long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The uninhabited mountains were draped in an elegant white veil. In the distance, the mountain peaks were clad in silver, their outlines distinct, as if a beautiful painting had been frozen in time—quiet and profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The pine trees stood tall, with icicles hanging from their branches. Sunlight shone through the clouds, casting mottled shadows of the trees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The surroundings were serene, with occasional bird calls echoing through the vast valleys, like a clear melody, which only accentuated the stillness of winter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sun and Ning looked at this beautiful scenery, exchanged glances, and all left the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, stepping out into the open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Although the interior of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was not cramped, it was ultimately an enclosed space, and staying inside for a long time indeed made people feel stifled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The two brothers, once outside, simultaneously took a deep breath and felt their hearts refreshed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“According to our route, this should be the border of the Northern Wind Nation,” said Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo nodded, “It should be.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was produced by the Lava Immortal Palace and had no record of traveling. Although Ning Zhuo had been collecting maps during the period in Two Note Nation, the maps he held often deviated from the actual situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The more detailed the map, the higher its value, and the less circulated it was in the market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Moreover, Two Note Nation and the North Wind Nation were two different cultivation nations. Additionally, since Sun and Ning had been escaping through the void, they had very few references for the present world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Therefore, they could only roughly estimate their position based on climate and topography.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This awkwardness was mainly because they had only just begun to travel the world. Once they had visited more places and recorded them precisely in the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, they could deduce the locations of many unfamiliar places.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“North Wind Nation……” Sun Lingtong gazed into the distance at the snowy peaks and said, “Little Zhuo, didn’t the Ning family originate from this nation?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo nodded, “This was our homeland. Many of the elders in the family often reminisced about their lives in the North Wind Nation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“However, for me, having been born on the move and living in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, I could not empathize with their homesickness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Speaking of which, we had already been traveling for several months.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“But I felt as if we had only left the Fire Persimmon Immortal City yesterday,” Ning Zhuo lamented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This snowy scene, on the contrary, stirred a bit of his mild nostalgia for Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">They did not stay there long; after two shi, they set off again, boarding the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to vanish into the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“There is no sound now.” Sun Lingtong listened carefully and gradually relaxed, “Perhaps it was just my hallucination.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo frowned slightly and shook his head, “Boss, don’t forget, you were the one who absorbed the Evil void God Bone Marrow. You might be hearing sounds that I couldn’t, possibly because of that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“In any case, we must be cautious.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sun Lingtong nodded, “Mm! If any sound appears next, I won’t notify you first; I will immediately control the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to return to the present world.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Alright.” Ning Zhuo nodded, and the two reached an agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">After this incident, the division of labor between Sun and Ning changed once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Previously, they had equally divided their time, one keeping watch while the other cultivated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Now Sun Lingtong primarily stayed at the dragon head cabin, while Ning Zhuo mainly focused on his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu’s new bodies were still under consideration, and the upper half of the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor had already been properly repaired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Previously, in Two Note Nation, he mainly used the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat to increase his body foundation. Now, Ning Zhuo had shifted his focus in cultivation to the three supreme methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">With the help of the Three Palaces Treasure Merging Talisman, the rate at which precious pills grew in his three dantians was extremely fast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“At this pace, the stage of precious pill growth would quickly reach its final phase.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“After that stage, I would enter the mid-Foundation Establishment period.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo estimated the progress, his mind as calm as a still lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">There was no significant qualitative change during the early, middle, and late stages of Foundation Establishment, and Ning Zhuo himself did not have high expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">But the theme of cultivation was precisely one of gradual accumulation; without accumulating step by step, how could one eventually form a Golden Core?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Besides focusing on the progress of the three supreme methods, Ning Zhuo had not forgotten the accumulation of his body foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He mainly relied on the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">After the Two Note offensive battle, Ning Zhuo had deepened his understanding of body cultivation. A strong body foundation was very important; having a relatively high baseline greatly increased one’s chance of survival on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">And figures like Lord Long and Xiang Yue, who easily stirred up the battlefield, all possessed extremely strong body foundations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">But for Ning Zhuo, reaching the level of Lord Long and Xiang Yue was extremely, extremely difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">It required opportunity, and the use of treasures like the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat. Compared to Lord Long and Xiang Yue, it required even more sacrifice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">This was because Lord Long and Xiang Yue’s cultivation methods focused on cultivating the flesh, mainly emphasizing the lower dantian’s essence sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo’s three supreme methods were cultivated in all three seas, and the Demonic Blood Vein Skill was more about control, so the accumulation and enhancement of his body foundation could not compare to that of Lord Long and Xiang Yue’s methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“Although at present, the effect of body cultivation was still considerable, the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat could not continue indefinitely. There would come a day when its cultivation effect would decline, until it diminished to zero.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Using cultivation methods to train the flesh was, on the one hand, cheaper, and on the other hand, more stable than using precious materials, treasures, and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat had greatly helped Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In the second grand battle, one of the biggest contributors behind Ning Zhuo’s high combat power was the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">In addition to advancing his cultivation methods and body cultivation, Ning Zhuo embarked on a third aspect of cultivation, namely the cultivation of his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The battle between the Heavenly and Earthly Twin Ghosts made Ning Zhuo deeply aware that his lack of a solid soul foundation was a major weakness; thus, if he were targeted, his situation would become extremely dangerous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">It was said that Ning Zhuo had experienced a short period in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City where his soul foundation had grown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He first used the Soul Devouring Technique, and then he himself cultivated a spell called the Ghost Martial Divine Weapon Forging Method. This method could consume soul power, sever parts of the soul, and forge ghostly weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Thus, when Ning Zhuo left the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, his soul foundation was nearly two hundred times that of a normal person, and he had forged a ghost ax about the size of a door panel as his accompanying Soul Martial Weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Such a soul foundation was already remarkable among his peers, or even at the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">But at the Golden Core level, it was completely insufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">When facing the Heavenly and Earthly Twin Ghosts, it was as good as “nothing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">In Tian Shuang’s storage bag were the main cultivation methods of both him and Di Gui. The two were from the Soul Devouring Sect, one of the holy places for soul and ghost cultivators. Naturally, their methods were excellent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">In his spare time while arduously cultivating, Ning Zhuo browsed and contemplated these methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">It was impossible for him to cultivate further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The three supreme methods already covered the three major dantians; cultivating other methods would be tantamount to courting misery, or even self-harm, or suicide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Understanding the essentials and secrets of soul cultivation would greatly help him in the future when using some treasures or materials for soul cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">“Speaking of which, Black Water Mountain and White Paper City was a city of soul cultivation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">“When I went there, in addition to obtaining the divination of the Mournful Ghost Lyre, I could also trade some soul cultivation materials or treasures to make up for my soul weakness.” Ning Zhuo planned to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Tian Shuang’s estate was too high-end; Ning Zhuo, currently only at the Foundation Establishment stage, needed a lot of basic soul materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">One day later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Sun and Ning voluntarily slipped out of the void, returned to the present world, and after patrolling the nearby area for a while, they successfully found their target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Frost Howl Valley!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Like the Flame Star Pit, it was also one of the world’s wonders.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
