<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 361: Negotiations at Medicine Field Mountain</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
At Medicine Valley, on Medicine Field Mountain, Ning Zhuo and Lin Shanshan walked side by side along the mountainside.<br/>
<br/>
Looking far into the distance, they could see the warm afternoon sun, casting a golden light across the mountain. Medicine Field Mountain spread out like a painting, with layered terraces full of lush greenery. The fields were filled with a variety of thriving medicinal herbs.<br/>
<br/>
There was green spirit grass, green as jade, with slender leaves gently swaying in the breeze, shining with a soft luster. The purple flowers bloomed in clusters, their petals like clouds, exuding a fragrance that attracted bees. Snow lotus seeds were pure white like jade, scattered across the green fields like stars dotting the ground, emitting a faint glow. The fruit was bright red like fire, hanging from the branches, resembling small lanterns, adding vibrant color. There were also golden thread vines winding around, their tendrils gleaming like golden threads, exuding vigorous vitality under the sunlight.<br/>
<br/>
The fields were neatly arranged with straight paths paved with green stones. Streams had been deliberately channeled from spiritual springs to irrigate the various sized fields. A breeze mixed the scents of the herbs, refreshing the soul.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan led the way ahead, while an elder of the sect was responsible for explaining to Ning Zhuo the formations of Medicine Field Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
"The main formation is the Bagua Array, which protects against external enemies and eliminates pests. Then, there's the Green Mountain Stabilization Array, used to maintain the fertility of the soil. Lastly, there's the Spirit Spring Energy Gathering Array, which extracts spiritual spring water to nourish the fields, assisting each herb to absorb and grow to its fullest."<br/>
<br/>
As they walked, they noticed a commotion in a pavilion in the distance, where a crowd had gathered.<br/>
<br/>
"Go see what's happening," the elder of the sect frowned and immediately instructed his attendant.<br/>
<br/>
The attendant went quickly and returned just as fast. "Someone is causing trouble," he reported. "A merchant named Li Jingqing has no money but wants to buy on credit, which violates the rules. Our fellow sect members refused him. But Li Jingqing, in his distress, is making a scene, claiming that all his money was stolen, and that our sect failed in its responsibility to monitor things."<br/>
<br/>
"He says he was carrying a large sum, not just his own, and that if he returns without herbs, he won't be able to explain it, and his fate will be worse than death! He‚Äôs threatening that if he can‚Äôt buy on credit, he‚Äôll kill himself by smashing his head against the wall."<br/>
<br/>
The elder's face darkened, and he gave a cold snort. "A mere merchant, daring to pressure our Medicine Sect."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan glanced at Ning Zhuo. "It‚Äôs karma. This Li Jingqing schemed against you before, but now, he‚Äôs getting his just desserts."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly. "His evil deeds brought about his own downfall."<br/>
<br/>
"Still, since he‚Äôs already come to apologize to me, our grudge is over."<br/>
<br/>
"Letting him continue making a scene isn‚Äôt good either, is it? This is an important time for your sect, distributing herbs for sale. If Li Jingqing causes a disturbance, the impact won‚Äôt be good."<br/>
<br/>
With that, Ning Zhuo smiled slightly. "Miss Lin and Elder, because of your positions, you cannot act."<br/>
<br/>
"How about I take care of this?"<br/>
<br/>
As he spoke, he took out a bag of spirit stones and handed it to the attendant. "Tell Li Jingqing that I, Ning Zhuo, will lend him 5,000 low-grade spirit stones. Tell him to stop causing trouble and use the stones to buy some herbs to help him get by for now."<br/>
<br/>
The sect elder was moved and immediately exclaimed, "Young master, you are truly generous!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled. "Thank you. Later, we will repay you threefold for the spirit stones."<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled and said, "This is a small matter, done effortlessly. There's no need to return the spirit stones‚Äî5,000 low-grade spirit stones is a trivial amount. Let's focus on discussing our cooperation, which is far more important."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled but said nothing.<br/>
<br/>
The sect elder spoke up, "Please review the price list, Young Master Ning."<br/>
<br/>
As he spoke, he handed Ning Zhuo a jade slip. Ning Zhuo took it, and as his consciousness penetrated the slip, he quickly browsed through the contents. He frowned slightly.<br/>
<br/>
"The prices on this list differ very little from what you offer to regular merchants," Ning Zhuo commented. "Our clan plans to maintain a long-term partnership with your sect, and the scale of our purchases each year will not be small. How could there be no discounts?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan remained silent, while the sect elder shook his head and gestured toward the pavilion where the earlier commotion took place.<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning, you saw it with your own eyes. The medicinal herbs from our Medicine Valley are always in high demand, and this happens every time‚Äîour doors are flooded with buyers. If we suddenly lowered prices, it would be difficult to justify it to the public."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled, fully aware that the purpose of this visit was to showcase the sect‚Äôs strength. He had expected this, but still remained calm and composed.<br/>
<br/>
"Your sect is running a flourishing operation, one that others truly envy," he said. "But our clan is not like those merchants. Not to mention the Nascent Soul-level combat power we possess, we hail from the Northern Wind Nation, a place that values honor and integrity above all."<br/>
<br/>
"If we form an alliance, you can be certain we would never break our word."<br/>
<br/>
"In the cultivation world, strength speaks loudest. If conflicts arise in the future, can these merchants truly be strong allies for your sect?"<br/>
<br/>
At that, Lin Shanshan and the sect elder exchanged glances, both taken aback. Neither spoke.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled and walked ahead, giving them time to process his words. Lin Shanshan and the elder shared a look, feeling that Ning Zhuo‚Äôs negotiation skills were as powerful and captivating as spellcasting itself.<br/>
<br/>
The elder remained silent, but he gave Lin Shanshan a signal with his eyes. Lin Shanshan quickly stepped forward to walk beside Ning Zhuo, both of them looking out at the beautiful view of Medicine Field Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
She spoke, "Young Master Ning, your words just now struck a chord with us. But the matter of forming an alliance is no small affair. Forgive me for asking, but do you have the authority to make this decision?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled, still admiring the terraced fields. "Even if I said I did, Miss Lin, you might trust me, but your father certainly wouldn‚Äôt."<br/>
<br/>
"However, once your sect returns from Fire Persimmon Mountain in a few days, with the intelligence gathered, the truth will be clear to all."<br/>
<br/>
"Until then, I just wish to move things along more quickly."<br/>
<br/>
"Although our two factions are far apart, we complement each other well. Your sect needs the military strength we can provide, and we, having migrated from the Northern Lands to the Southern Dou Nation only a decade ago, also need strong allies to stabilize our situation."<br/>
<br/>
"If we can form an alliance in the future, it would benefit us both."<br/>
<br/>
"Miss Lin, there‚Äôs no need for us to haggle over prices in such a petty way, which would only taint the friendship between us. Frankly, I‚Äôll be direct‚Äîmy clan cannot afford the prices on that list."<br/>
<br/>
"Our clan has been recuperating and restoring our vitality since migrating from the north. We've only just begun to recover some of our strength."<br/>
<br/>
"Recently, the Lava Immortal Palace emerged from Fire Persimmon Mountain, throwing the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City into chaos. The beast tide nearly engulfed the entire city."<br/>
<br/>
"Every year, we spend a vast amount of spirit stones to purchase medicinal herbs, but my clan cannot afford that," Ning Zhuo explained. "I‚Äôve thought about it, and perhaps we could trade goods instead."<br/>
<br/>
"Look at this," he continued, presenting a fire persimmon. "This is a specialty of Fire Persimmon Mountain. It has a wide range of uses‚Äîit can be used as medicine, in crafting, as fuel, and even as an explosive material."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan took the fire persimmon, but instead of inspecting it, she simply held it in her hand. Her keen eyes focused on Ning Zhuo, and she spoke sincerely, "We are already aware of the fire persimmon. When Fire Persimmon Immortal City was built, the previous generation of elders conducted an investigation."<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest, we initially saw the fire persimmon as a competitor and were worried it might disrupt the herb market in the Southern Dou Nation."<br/>
<br/>
"However, after the investigation, the elders put most of their concerns to rest. Over the years, it has been proven that their judgment was correct. The fire persimmon has not impacted our medicinal herb business."<br/>
<br/>
"While it is versatile, the herbs in our medicinal fields, being more specialized, have always been favored by the public and are the better option."<br/>
<br/>
"If you don't believe me, Young Master Ning, you can gather information and verify the market share of the fire persimmon to see that I‚Äôm telling the truth."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled. "I believe you, Miss Lin."<br/>
<br/>
"But bartering doesn‚Äôt have to involve just the fire persimmon."<br/>
<br/>
"If your sect isn't interested in that, it‚Äôs no problem. The Red Flame Beasts from Fire Persimmon Mountain appear frequently. Your sect always needs materials from these beasts, right?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan nodded, "That‚Äôs true. Our sect specializes in cultivation, alchemy, and healing, and we regularly purchase large quantities of beast materials for alchemy."<br/>
<br/>
"If your clan can offer a price below the market rate, the chances of a successful partnership are high."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed heartily. "If your sect wants my clan to lower our price, then why can't your sect reduce the price of herbs?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan replied, "We can lower the price, but it depends on the scale of the transaction. If the scale is small, it will be hard to reduce the price to your satisfaction."<br/>
<br/>
"After all, herb trading involves the interests of many factions within our sect. While our sect leader can make unilateral decisions, it would harm the sect‚Äôs reputation to use force for such trivial matters."<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning, would you like to hear my suggestion?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled knowingly. "I see. Miss Lin wants me to follow in the footsteps of Li Jingqing?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled. "As expected, you are quick to understand, Young Master. Yes, if you can win one of the top positions in the cave estates competition, according to our sect‚Äôs rules, you'll receive a significant discount on the herb prices."<br/>
<br/>
"This would follow our existing rules, without infringing on others‚Äô interests, and it would be the most widely accepted approach."<br/>
<br/>
"While others might doubt your abilities, you have a good chance of making it into the top ten."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. "I came to your sect for guidance, and I intended to use Little Contention Peak to train my combat skills. Now that it involves a discount on herbs, I‚Äôll fight even harder."<br/>
<br/>
"Miss Lin, I look forward to your continued guidance, especially in martial skills..."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan nodded and winked at him. "Aren‚Äôt we friends? Since I‚Äôve already accepted your flower, as a friend, I won‚Äôt stand idly by."<br/>
<br/>
Miss Lin, the eldest daughter of the Medicine Valley Sect, had indeed received a refined education. The negotiation smoothly shifted from matters of sect and clan cooperation to a more personal connection, warming the previously tense atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
However, nearby, the sect elder‚Äôs ears perked up as he caught a key phrase: "Flower? Ning Zhuo gave Shanshan a flower? And Shanshan accepted it?"<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, a flash of worry crossed the elder's face. He reassessed Ning Zhuo, noting his tall, graceful stance, handsome face, and sincere demeanor. The elder couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit of admiration for him.<br/>
<br/>
But upon further thought, he grew anxious as he glanced at Lin Shanshan, seeing her smiling radiantly as she spoke with Ning Zhuo. The elder's concern deepened, and he resolved to report this matter to the sect leader.<br/>
