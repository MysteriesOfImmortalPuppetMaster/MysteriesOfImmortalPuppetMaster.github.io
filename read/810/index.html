<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Five Elements are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth; the Five Viscera are the Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, and Kidney. The Five Elements belong to the Five Viscera, each performing its own function, generating and overcoming one another in an endless cycle...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This was the content of the Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art. It could be said to gather the essence of heaven and earth, harmonizing the wonders of the Five Elements, possessing profound Dao and principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">After the Five Elements God Lord imparted it to Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo found he could not cultivate it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The big-headed youth had already cultivated the Three Sects' Supreme Methods, and all three dantians were occupied. He could only modify the Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art, turning it into a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This spell consisted of five chapters, corresponding respectively to the five elements of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. To cultivate it successfully, one had to consume the True Essence of the Five Elements, starting with materials at least ten thousand years old.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">From another perspective, this was essentially taking the principles of ten-thousand-year-grade Five Elements True Essence and amplifying them upon one's own Five Viscera.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The cost was exorbitant, but the effects were superb. During his time in the Two Note Kingdom, Ning Zhuo relied on three of these elements to repeatedly deliver stunning performances on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Now, at the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he still relied on this to perfectly control the three-colored flames right from his first attempt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Once he utilized the Spirit Gods within his Five Viscera Temple, he could control Five Elements spells to the peak of perfection. Therefore, even Five Elements spells he was trying for the first time could be cast decently, saving him a massive amount of effort in practicing spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">With such flames, Ning Zhuo successfully passed the second chapter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Zhao Hansheng read the third chapter aloud: "Its warp and weft correspond to the celestial measures above. The Weaving Girl pauses her shuttle, borrowing the ingenuity of the Heavenly Granddaughter; Lu Ban severs his hand, imitating the loom of creation. Weaving clouds and rosy mists as the weft, stitching stars and the Dipper as the warp. When first formed, it resembles the hidden River Map; upon second glance, it looks like the floating Luo Scroll..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The gathered cultivators: "??"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo listened carefully, his brows furrowed tight. He initially judged that this step of papermaking involved at least three fields: astrology, mathematical calculation, and weaving techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"'Its warp and weft correspond to the celestial measures above' - this is explaining the correspondence between astrology and weaving."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"'Luo Scroll' does not refer to the Dao Artifact Luo Shu, but should refer to mathematical deduction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"No wonder there is a mechanical loom on the stall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo cast his gaze toward the stall in front of him. As they reached the third chapter, new precious materials and tools were transported over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The main frame of the loom was made of metal with a dark silver luster, inlaid with twenty-eight gemstones arranged according to the constellations. The shuttle was even more exquisite, transparent throughout, with seven-colored flowing light swirling inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">A knowledgeable cultivator recognized it: "This is a loom made of Star Meteoric Iron. Is that Rainbow Light True Essence sealed inside the shuttle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo ran his hand over the loom, probing it with his divine sense, and quickly understood it thoroughly. He was a mechanism cultivator after all; this was exactly his area of expertise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">More cultivators cast their divine sense toward Gu Qing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Gu Qing began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He drew out fine threads from the Literary Light Pulp. After the tempering of the second chapter, these threads were as tough as silk, yet lighter and softer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The threads were arranged on the loom: eighty-one vertical warp threads and eighty-one horizontal weft threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Gu Qing's weaving speed slowed down noticeably. He knew very well that this step was critical. The quantity of fine threads was limited; if he made too many mistakes, he would have to start refining from scratch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Slow work yields fine detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Gu Qing's every stitch was incredibly precise. Accompanying this, with every intersection he wove, the runes he softly chanted would fall upon it, and the corresponding gemstone on the loom would shimmer slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Gradually, a faint Nine Palaces pattern emerged on the woven paper base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Is this the Nine Palaces Numerology? That is the most obscure and difficult of all formations." Many cultivators watching this scene felt despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Gu Qing was weaving a formation into the paper base, and Ning Zhuo was studying it as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">After mastering the loom, Ning Zhuo frowned; he had encountered trouble. "My Literary Light Pulp was not as excellent as Gu Qing's from the start. Even after the tempering in the second chapter, it is only the size of a fist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">According to Ning Zhuo's understanding of the third chapter, he discovered that the number of complete threads he could draw from his base material was likely only around one hundred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">But the third chapter required eighty-one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The room for error left for me is very small."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"It's my first attempt at papermaking, yet I can only afford to make mistakes twenty-odd times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Weaving techniques..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This was one of the hundred arts of cultivation, but Ning Zhuo was not skilled in it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"However..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo dug through his memories and quickly discovered that among the demonic cultivators he had absorbed earlier, some had dabbled in this path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He reviewed it briefly before beginning to operate the mechanical loom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At the same time, he transmitted a thought via divine sense, contacting Sun Lingtong through Life Hanging by a Thread: "Boss, help me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Coming!" Sun Lingtong had long been prepared. He immediately activated his Spirit Eyes, rubbed off the buffing effect of the Luo Shu, and passed it to Ning Zhuo through the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">With the aid of the Luo Shu, the mechanical loom, and the demonic cultivator's memories, Ning Zhuo's weaving speed was even slower than Gu Qing's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Vertical is the warp, horizontal is the weft; the warp is Heaven, the weft is Earth; only when Heaven and Earth interweave is a world formed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">What was important was not the tangible threads, but the intangible principles described in the form of a formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Weaving was listed as one of the hundred arts of cultivation not because it simply wove structures, but because it wove principles and materials together into a unified whole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">A deeper level of weaving involved the deeper restructuring and arrangement of one's own internal self.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This was not something Ning Zhuo could touch upon at present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Every cultivation art was broad and profound, filled, expanded, improved, and accumulated by countless predecessors and sages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Fortunately, the weaving technique involved in this papermaking process did not require such profound depth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Three distinct time periods (six hours) later, Ning Zhuo wiped the sweat from his forehead, looked at the finished product before him, and exhaled a breath of turbid air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">By the end of this chapter, fewer than nine hundred people remained in the venue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Zhao Hansheng chanted: "As for the Golden Crow dropping a feather, melting into flowing cinnabar; the Jade Rabbit leaves behind essence, condensing into flying white. Where Lord Han loosened his clothes in a grand manner, his spirit swallowed the Cloud Dream; when Mi Dian's sleeves were dripping wet, his spirit captured Emei. A single point of consonance penetrates the white soul, three parts of bright moon enter the ice silk..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The cultivators: ???</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The difficulty of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page papermaking method skyrocketed again. It was almost entirely composed of literary imagery, raising the threshold for comprehension once more!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Many cultivators stared at Gu Qing, sizing him up, wanting to imitate him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But this time, Gu Qing realized his situation. He gave a faint smile, stood with his hands clasped, and remained motionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The cultivators' expressions changed slightly, and they secretly became anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Some of them had indeed made it this far by fishing in troubled waters and copying Gu Qing. But Gu Qing suddenly stopping caused them to lose their direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Not to mention anything else, just eliminating the interference from the various materials and finding the correct ones was not something they could accomplish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought: "'Golden Crow dropping a feather' refers to the morning glow; 'Jade Rabbit leaves behind essence' should be the moonlight. 'Lord Han loosened his clothes' describes a mental state, or perhaps divine sense? 'Mi Dian's sleeves' must refer to the splash-ink technique in calligraphy..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo deliberated thoroughly three times. Once he finished considering, he selected the new materials that had appeared on the stall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He took out two jade bottles: one bottle was scorching hot, sealing a wisp of purple-red light inside; the other was icy cold, containing a mass of silver-white mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Then he took out two small boxes. Upon opening them, one contained black ashes, and the other contained pale gold powder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Gu Qing cast his divine sense toward Ning Zhuo, observing quietly. Seeing this scene, his heart stirred: "He chose correctly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Worthy of being my great enemy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"The difficulty here is too low for him; it's impossible to stop him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">More and more cultivators began to pay attention to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo began to mix the colors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He first mixed the four materials, adding Literary Heart Spring Water. The resulting color was not fixed; it shifted between purple-red, silver-white, and pale gold, as if it were alive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo picked up the brush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">There were multiple brushes provided on the stall. The one Ning Zhuo selected had a shaft of hundred-year purple bamboo and bristles capable of mixing white horse tail with black sable hair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He soaked the brush in the mixed color and held it suspended over the paper base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo's gaze was heavy and concentrated. He took a deep breath before starting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Right from the start, his movements were bold and sweeping, as if he weren't dyeing paper, but wildly wielding the fine brush in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Waving the brush, the force penetrated the back of the paper!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Half an incense stick of time later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">On the paper base, the greenish-gray background tumbled like a sea of clouds, golden nodes twinkled like stars, and a silver wash flowed like moonlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">It was exactly "Spirit swallowing the Cloud Dream, Spirit capturing Emei"!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Seeing this, Zhao Hansheng lowered his eyelids slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo passed this chapter as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Seeing Ning Zhuo refine a finished product, many cultivators hesitated whether to imitate him. Some took action, while others continued to watch Gu Qing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Gu Qing waited for a while longer before beginning his crafting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">His steps and movements were very similar to Ning Zhuo's, but his efficiency was extremely high, and his brushwork was far more skilled than Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He was a Confucian cultivator; he was simply too adept at using a brush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Precisely because of this, he knew it would take him little time, so he had nothing to fear and waited until the last moment to start.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">In the end, Gu Qing's paper base had magnificent colors and a majestic artistic conception, its quality higher than Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Many cultivators sighed and groaned. They saw the correct direction clearly, but there was too little time left for them. Many were eliminated because they ran out of time. Some were nervous and made mistakes in their haste, getting eliminated early.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">After being eliminated, these cultivators looked at Gu Qing with hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Those who remained, however, looked expectantly at Ning Zhuo, their eyes containing gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">With a small trick, Gu Qing caused half of the participants to be eliminated in this chapter. Only a little over four hundred people remained in the field.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Fifth Chapter:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Viewing the sinking jade of the Miluo, the Chu songs still remain; gazing at the falling tears of Mount Xian, the Yang Tablet is still warm. Gather the solitary indignation of Qu Yuan chanting by the marsh, capture the heroic talent of Jia Yi's strategies in Luoyang. Draw further upon the beauty of the crimson flowers of Ye Water, steal the brilliance of the purple clouds of Mount Zhong..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">One had to throw the paper base into a cauldron, consume Literary Qi, and refine a Literary Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Nearly two hundred people were eliminated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The Sixth Chapter:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Of old, Confucius heard the Shao music and forgot the taste of meat for three months; Zhuangzi dreamed of a butterfly, forever losing his track in ancient times. Take the mirror of the square inch of the Spirit Platform, capture the shadows of the myriad phenomena of the great universe. Cause the qi of the Kun Peng's ocean journey to dissolve into the tip of a hair; let the icy demeanor of the Gu She mountain hide within the warp and weft..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This chapter required using the magic artifact "Spirit Communication Mirror" to perform "Shadow Capture and Image Transfer," capturing a total of thirty-six types of imagery, corresponding to the number of Heavenly Tiangang stars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Then, pressing the mirror onto the paper base, one had to operate the transfer method described in the chapter. The images in the mirror had to be transferred one by one into the depths of the paper base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This step required extremely high control of divine sense and consumed the cultivator's mental energy the most.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The thirty-six transfers had to be done in one go; they could not be interrupted midway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">After completing this step, Gu Qing's face was as pale as paper, his body tottering. Conversely, Ning Zhuo remained calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual was exactly what he excelled at, but Ning Zhuo's flaw was that his divine sense wasn't strong or deep enough. After understanding this chapter, he decisively took pills to temporarily boost the strength and depth of his divine sense, thus passing this chapter smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">At this point, fewer than a hundred cultivators remained in the field.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Seventh Chapter:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"The Records of the Artificers states: Heaven has its times, Earth has its qi. Therefore, gather the morning glow in spring, collect the noon sleet in summer, pluck the evening mist in autumn, and accept the night dew in winter. Once the essence of the four seasons is prepared, erect the armillary sphere to measure the stars, and set up the gnomon to correct the shadow. Let the Xuanji rotate without being fitted, let the Jade Heng circulate before it is touched..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo's heart shook slightly; he realized this step was actually to imprint space-time into the paper base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Gu Qing immediately took action, carefully selecting the essence qi of the four seasons from over a hundred jade bottles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">They were: Beginning of Spring Green Dragon, Spring Equinox Yin-Yang, Beginning of Summer Vermilion Bird, Summer Solstice Sun Essence, Beginning of Autumn White Tiger, Autumn Equinox Moon Essence, Beginning of Winter Black Tortoise, and Winter Solstice Starlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Using a mechanical Armillary Sphere and a Gui Biao, he placed the paper base inside the Armillary Sphere and began refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">He opened the jade bottles in order. Every time one opened, a stream of essence qi surged out, guided by the Armillary Sphere to shine upon the paper base at a specific angle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The Armillary Sphere rotated slowly, allowing the paper base to receive the illumination of the seasonal essences from different angles...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">More than four hours later, Gu Qing harvested the finished product.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Near perfect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He was far ahead once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo barely finished in the final quarter of an hour.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">At this moment, gazing at the paper base, he felt as if he were looking up at the cosmic firmament, sensing a vastness and profundity he had never felt before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">After this chapter passed, only thirty-odd people remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Gu Qing's eyes flickered slightly, a feeling of disappointment surfacing from the bottom of his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He had just seen the possibility of Ning Zhuo being eliminated, but in the end, Ning Zhuo held on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Eighth Chapter:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"The Book of Changes says: Like sounds respond to each other, like qi seeks like. Thus, though Bo Ya smashed his qin, the sound did not vanish from the human world; when Xiang Xiu heard the flute, it was truly the passing of the torch. Draw the tears of weeping bamboo as glue, gather the stone of the bird carrying wood as the medium. Make severed gold connectable, make the separated able to unite..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The expressions of the thirty-odd people who had persevered changed one after another. Many furrowed their brows, revealing anxiety and unease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">These people possessed real skills; listening and comprehending as they went, they heard that they needed to refine the precious material "Kindred Spirit Glue." This material was quite critical, but the refining process was complicated, requiring over eighty types of materials like Kun Fish Swim Bladder Glue, Weeping Bamboo Morning Dew, Flying Bird Stone, and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Most critically, it required the method of Sound Refining, necessitating either a Qin or a Xiao flute, with using both simultaneously being even better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Fortunately, I previously obtained the inheritance [Empty Valley Note Joint Green Machine Tube], which allowed me to master sound techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"But there is still a sticking point I can't figure out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">At this point, the Confucian classics involved became increasingly obscure and difficult, and there were things even Ning Zhuo couldn't quite grasp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Confucian Spell - Head Suspended from a Beam!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Confucian Spell - Thigh Pricking Awl!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo's hair was suspended in the air by an invisible force, and with a wooden cone in hand, 'pu-chi' 'pu-chi', he stabbed the inner flesh of his thigh until it was a bloody mess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Layers of memory became vivid, his thoughts became more penetrating, and as he pondered, he broke through layer after layer of obstacles, advancing by leaps and bounds!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Gu Qing's breath was slightly ragged. Physical and mental exhaustion was accumulating, clearly affecting his state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">He had never had such a papermaking experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"I have successfully created the Dao-Bearing Jade Page many times before, but I have never felt it to be this difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"The pressure is too great!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">He subconsciously scanned the cultivators present with his divine sense, pausing especially on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">In the previous four rounds, Ning Zhuo had brought him immense pressure, embarrassing him several times. Gu Qing's reputation had plummeted accordingly, and he had been forced to the edge of a cliff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">He had to prove himself in this round and restore his prestige!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
