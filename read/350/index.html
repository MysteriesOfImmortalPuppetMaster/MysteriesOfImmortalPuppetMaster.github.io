<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Six Golden Core level mountain essences were hidden in a wall compartment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The four walls of the storage cabin were distributed with mechanical wall boxes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Normally, the wall box covers were lowered, keeping the compartments sealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">To the naked eye, no trace could be seen from the outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo only needed to control with his divine sense to raise the wall box covers,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">revealing the treasures inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Each wall compartment had a storage formation to care for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">For example, the mountain essences in the wall box receives nourishment from earth-attribute spiritual energy,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">allowing them to be preserved for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Some wall boxes had space formations set up, with huge internal spaces able to store large amounts of items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Treasures like mist rust orchids and mist haze stones were classified separately,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">each stored in different wall boxes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo opened the wall boxes, checking the mountain essences, mist rust orchids, and mist haze stones in turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">These were all obtained from the Fox God, and their quality was very good.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The mist rust orchids provided by the Fox God were even better in quality than those</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong had previously taken from inside the cloud whale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Worthy of being a mountain god's treasured collection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Perhaps the mist haze stones can be combined with the Ice Snow Weather Sphere?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo thought while checking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He had previously specifically purchased a Foundation Establishment level Cold Snow Cloud to pair with the Ice Snow Weather Sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">In the previous battle with the Fox God, this combination had shown good effects and achieved some results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">Although at that time, Ning Zhuo hadn't relied on them to dispel the mountain mist covering the sky, their contribution couldn't be erased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">"It's a pity the Fox God couldn't be used by me. Her Cloud and Mist Confusion innate talent are rather powerful. If it could have been combined…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">From refining the Black Wind Tiger Demon's tiger bones, Ning Zhuo had seen:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">the higher the grade and more lively the fire-refined item, the more spiritual essence obtained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Ning Zhuo still regretted not obtaining the Fox God's Cloud and Mist Confusion innate talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">At that time, he indeed had the opportunity to not plot against Jade Steel Mountain,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">but to solidify the great crime of the Fox God colluding with the Black Wind Tiger Demon, causing her to perish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">Considering his branch family, fighting in a divine being's domain, striking at the Meng family, deepening cooperation with the Zhu family, and long-term considerations for the clan's future, he gave up the Cloud and Mist Confusion innate talent and chose the path of maximizing benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">When he asked Zhu Xuanji how to deal with the Fox God, he still held some hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">However, Zhu Xuanji, being the Golden Core figurehead of the royal family,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">not only had superior combat power but also understood the big picture, steady and wise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">Now, the matter of Mist Concealment Mountain was considered concluded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">The Fox God had become the official Mountain God, her past crimes offset, still retaining her official position in the Southern Bean Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">This made it very difficult for Ning Zhuo to take action again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">"Forget it, there are so many innate talents, it's not worth dealing with a small Fox God</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">and offending Zhu Xuanji and the Southern Bean Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">Ning Zhuo continued to check the purple qi morning dew, ghost shadow bamboo, and Spirit Concealment Willow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">The purple qi morning dew, like celestial dew, was bottled and well-preserved in the wall boxes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">Most cultivators focused on absorbing purple qi to aid cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Ning Zhuo, however, was an exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">He cultivated the Three Sects Supreme Methods, unique and extraordinary, with no need for purple qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">"The ghost shadow bamboo is very suitable for making Meng Yehu's mechanical body, these bamboos themselves are its companion items."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">"Now, the time isn't ripe yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">Ning Zhuo first needed to design the blueprint for Meng Yehu's mechanical body,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">then use Foundation Establishment level materials to refine it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">The resulting mechanical body would need to be used extensively by Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Ning Zhuo would make multiple improvements to the mechanical body during use,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">based on Meng Yehu's suggestions and experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">Only when the entire mechanical body was relatively mature would he choose to use the ghost shadow bamboo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">After all, this material was very rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">Judging by market price alone, considering them as Golden Core level wouldn't be wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">The final focus was on the Spirit Concealment Willow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">The Spirit Concealment Willow's trunk was divine in color, with hidden mysteries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Its branches were tender and yellow, full of vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">The willow leaves were evergreen, like a layer of thin jade, translucent and nearly transparent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">The edges of the willow leaves were slightly curved, and under light,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">they faintly glowed with spiritual radiance, like the clear green light of a limpid lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Ning Zhuo reached out to touch the willow tree. The branches felt soft as cotton,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">and the willow leaves gave him a cool sensation, as if touching dewdrops in the early morning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">The entire Spirit Concealment Willow constantly emitted a faint, clean fragrance,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">like sandalwood or orchid. The scent wasn't strong but lingering and serene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Ning Zhuo savored it carefully, feeling refreshed and clear-minded, all worries dispersed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">His entire being was being purified. Even without meditation,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">he could feel his spiritual thoughts stirring, wisdom permeating in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">"Good tree, good tree!" Ning Zhuo had a strong feeling that this Spirit Concealment Willow would be of great use to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">"However, before that, it needs to be transplanted quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">The Spirit Concealment Willow can't always be kept in the wall box."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">"For spirit plants, it's still best to be in the soil."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">But this required Ning Zhuo to set up a spirit plant cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">The spirit plant cabin in the Myriad-Li Game Dragon was similar to the refining cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">It had formations, and they were at the Nascent Soul level, but it needed to be filled with other materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">The current refining cabin didn't even have a grain of soil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">After personally checking everything, Ning Zhuo left the storage cabin and went to the dragon head cabin to replace Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Entering the cabin, he saw Sun Lingtong eagerly trying out various functions of the mechanical dragon, enjoying herself immensely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Seeing Ning Zhuo arrive, he immediately asked about the fire burial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Ning Zhuo told him truthfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">Sun Lingtong felt very happy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">When Ning Zhuo prepared to replace him, he waved her hand:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">"Little Zhuo, you go cultivate. You've just reached the early stage of Foundation Establishment, cultivation should be your priority. Secondly, don't you need to create Meng Yehu's mechanical body?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">The spirit plant cabin for the Spirit Concealment Willow also needs you to set up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">"You have too many things to do."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">"You go busy yourself, I'll watch over the course."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">"Don't worry, when we reach Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, I'll call you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Ten Thousand Medicines Valley was hidden among steep mountains, with magnificent scenery and unparalleled beauty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">A young girl in yellow, holding a bamboo basket, was walking down from the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">The morning light was faint, thin mist like gauze, making the valley appear like a fairyland.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">By the time the girl reached the foot of the mountain, the early sun had risen in the east,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">golden light spilling over, illuminating the green mountains in brilliant splendor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">The girl, familiar with the path, entered the valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">Inside the valley, towering cypresses and pines blocked out the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Winding paths paved with stone slabs were flanked by strange flowers and exotic grasses, fragrant and lush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Bird songs echoed in the mountains, crisp and pleasing to the ear, like heavenly music.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Gradually, the sound of water grew louder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">When the yellow-clothed girl came to a clear pool, she saw a silver curtain hanging on the cliff by the pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">A small waterfall plunged straight down, thundering as it crashed into the pool, stirring up mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">The girl stepped on the water's surface, cast a spell, and walked directly towards the waterfall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Behind the waterfall was a slanting mountain path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">She followed the path, climbing diagonally upwards, with the waterfall and skylight on the outside,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">and damp stone walls on the inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">The mountain stone walls, due to the dense water vapor, were mottled with moss,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">with vines hanging down. A morning breeze blew, shaking the mist,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">making the green leaves on the vines sway, echoing the ripples in the pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">The girl took a deep breath, feeling a cool freshness penetrate her lungs, feeling delighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">She slowly stopped at the entrance of a cave and called out softly: "Senior Brother, Senior Brother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">After a few breaths, a male voice came from inside the cave: "Is that Little Junior Sister? Please, come in quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Inside the cave, the senior and junior disciples met.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">The girl put down her bamboo basket, took out the meals, and arranged them on a relatively flat stone surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">The Senior Brother glanced over and urgently asked: "Little Junior Sister, where's my wine?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">The girl snorted: "Wine, wine, wine, is that all you know?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">"Master told you to watch over the medicinal herbs, but you secretly used them to brew wine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">"Now you're being punished, guarding the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave, and still drinking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">If the Master finds out, see if he doesn't flay you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">The Senior Brother sighed and frowned: "Little Junior Sister, you know I can't be happy without wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Please, be kind and bring out the wine quickly. My alcohol addiction is acting up,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">I couldn't sleep all night yesterday."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">The girl snorted coldly: "Here, here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Her storage jade bracelet glowed faintly, and she took out a bottle of medicinal wine, handing it to Senior Brother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Senior Brother received it as if it were a precious treasure, overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">He took it, uncorked the bottle, and after drinking a few mouthfuls, sighed with satisfaction:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">"Why is there only a small bottle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">The girl: "That's all there is."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">"Senior Brother, you're guarding the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">If you get drunk and are dragged into the cave by beast demons, you'll lose your life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Senior Brother waved his hand dismissively: "This Ten Thousand Beasts Cave has been cleared out for a long time,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">it's nearly abandoned now. How could there be beast demons?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">"This is a matter of life and death, Senior Brother, you're too careless!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">The girl immediately puffed up her cheeks and angrily began to lecture him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">Senior Brother listened to Little Junior Sister's lecture while picking up chopsticks and tasting the exquisite meal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">When Little Junior Sister was tired of talking, he looked up at the little sister he had watched grow up, his gaze tender: "Lin Shanshan, do you have anything else to say?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">Lin Shanshan rolled her eyes. Seeing that Senior Brother had finished breakfast,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">she waved her hand, generating a burst of energy that collected the bowls and chopsticks into the bamboo basket:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">"Linghu Jiu, can't you behave a bit? Always making the Master angry, being punished to guard the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">Do you know how annoying it is for me to bring you meals every day?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">Linghu Jiu quickly apologized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">After scolding him for a while, Lin Shanshan left the cave and returned the way she came.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">At the poolside, she unexpectedly found a stranger wandering nearby and lightly called out: "Who are you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">Ning Zhuo turned at her words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">His features were delicate, his gaze clear as the pool water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">Now dressed all in white, standing by the pool, his figure was tall and straight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">A mountain breeze blew, making his clothes flutter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">The pool was emerald green, its rippling surface reflecting his figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">Around him, flowers were just blooming, morning dew glistening, grass and trees lush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="286">The girl's heart skipped a beat, and she unconsciously held her breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="288">Ning Zhuo revealed an apologetic smile, cupped his hands in greeting and said:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="290">"I am Ning Zhuo from Fire Persimmon Mountain. I've come to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley specifically to seek guidance and learning. I hope I'm not intruding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="292">"May I ask the young lady's name?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="294">Lin Shanshan didn't know why, but her heart began to beat faster involuntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="296">She opened her mouth to respond: "This little one is Lin Shanshan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="298">As soon as she spoke, she felt strange. Why had her voice become so small?</paragraph><br/><br/>
