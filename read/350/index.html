<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 350: Ten Thousand Medicines Valley</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Six Golden Core level mountain essences were hidden in a wall compartment.<br/>
<br/>
The four walls of the storage cabin were distributed with mechanical wall boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, the wall box covers were lowered, keeping the compartments sealed.<br/>
<br/>
To the naked eye, no trace could be seen from the outside.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo only needed to control with his divine sense to raise the wall box covers,<br/>
<br/>
revealing the treasures inside.<br/>
<br/>
Each wall compartment had a storage formation to care for it.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the mountain essences in the wall box receives nourishment from earth-attribute spiritual energy,<br/>
<br/>
allowing them to be preserved for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Some wall boxes had space formations set up, with huge internal spaces able to store large amounts of items.<br/>
<br/>
Treasures like mist rust orchids and mist haze stones were classified separately,<br/>
<br/>
each stored in different wall boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo opened the wall boxes, checking the mountain essences, mist rust orchids, and mist haze stones in turn.<br/>
<br/>
These were all obtained from the Fox God, and their quality was very good.<br/>
<br/>
The mist rust orchids provided by the Fox God were even better in quality than those<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had previously taken from inside the cloud whale.<br/>
<br/>
Worthy of being a mountain god's treasured collection.<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps the mist haze stones can be combined with the Ice Snow Weather Sphere?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought while checking.<br/>
<br/>
He had previously specifically purchased a Foundation Establishment level Cold Snow Cloud to pair with the Ice Snow Weather Sphere.<br/>
In the previous battle with the Fox God, this combination had shown good effects and achieved some results.<br/>
<br/>
Although at that time, Ning Zhuo hadn't relied on them to dispel the mountain mist covering the sky, their contribution couldn't be erased.<br/>
<br/>
"It's a pity the Fox God couldn't be used by me. Her Cloud and Mist Confusion innate talent are rather powerful. If it could have been combined‚Ä¶"<br/>
<br/>
From refining the Black Wind Tiger Demon's tiger bones, Ning Zhuo had seen:<br/>
<br/>
the higher the grade and more lively the fire-refined item, the more spiritual essence obtained.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo still regretted not obtaining the Fox God's Cloud and Mist Confusion innate talent.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, he indeed had the opportunity to not plot against Jade Steel Mountain,<br/>
<br/>
but to solidify the great crime of the Fox God colluding with the Black Wind Tiger Demon, causing her to perish.<br/>
<br/>
Considering his branch family, fighting in a divine being's domain, striking at the Meng family, deepening cooperation with the Zhu family, and long-term considerations for the clan's future, he gave up the Cloud and Mist Confusion innate talent and chose the path of maximizing benefits.<br/>
<br/>
When he asked Zhu Xuanji how to deal with the Fox God, he still held some hope.<br/>
<br/>
However, Zhu Xuanji, being the Golden Core figurehead of the royal family,<br/>
<br/>
not only had superior combat power but also understood the big picture, steady and wise.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the matter of Mist Concealment Mountain was considered concluded.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God had become the official Mountain God, her past crimes offset, still retaining her official position in the Southern Bean Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
This made it very difficult for Ning Zhuo to take action again.<br/>
<br/>
"Forget it, there are so many innate talents, it's not worth dealing with a small Fox God<br/>
<br/>
and offending Zhu Xuanji and the Southern Bean Kingdom."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued to check the purple qi morning dew, ghost shadow bamboo, and Spirit Concealment Willow.<br/>
<br/>
The purple qi morning dew, like celestial dew, was bottled and well-preserved in the wall boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Most cultivators focused on absorbing purple qi to aid cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, was an exception.<br/>
<br/>
He cultivated the Three Sects Supreme Methods, unique and extraordinary, with no need for purple qi.<br/>
<br/>
"The ghost shadow bamboo is very suitable for making Meng Yehu's mechanical body, these bamboos themselves are its companion items."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, the time isn't ripe yet."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo first needed to design the blueprint for Meng Yehu's mechanical body,<br/>
<br/>
then use Foundation Establishment level materials to refine it.<br/>
<br/>
The resulting mechanical body would need to be used extensively by Meng Yehu.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo would make multiple improvements to the mechanical body during use,<br/>
<br/>
based on Meng Yehu's suggestions and experience.<br/>
<br/>
Only when the entire mechanical body was relatively mature would he choose to use the ghost shadow bamboo.<br/>
<br/>
After all, this material was very rare.<br/>
<br/>
Judging by market price alone, considering them as Golden Core level wouldn't be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The final focus was on the Spirit Concealment Willow!<br/>
<br/>
The Spirit Concealment Willow's trunk was divine in color, with hidden mysteries.<br/>
<br/>
Its branches were tender and yellow, full of vitality.<br/>
<br/>
The willow leaves were evergreen, like a layer of thin jade, translucent and nearly transparent.<br/>
<br/>
The edges of the willow leaves were slightly curved, and under light,<br/>
<br/>
they faintly glowed with spiritual radiance, like the clear green light of a limpid lake.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo reached out to touch the willow tree. The branches felt soft as cotton,<br/>
<br/>
and the willow leaves gave him a cool sensation, as if touching dewdrops in the early morning.<br/>
<br/>
The entire Spirit Concealment Willow constantly emitted a faint, clean fragrance,<br/>
<br/>
like sandalwood or orchid. The scent wasn't strong but lingering and serene.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo savored it carefully, feeling refreshed and clear-minded, all worries dispersed.<br/>
<br/>
His entire being was being purified. Even without meditation,<br/>
<br/>
he could feel his spiritual thoughts stirring, wisdom permeating in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
"Good tree, good tree!" Ning Zhuo had a strong feeling that this Spirit Concealment Willow would be of great use to him.<br/>
<br/>
"However, before that, it needs to be transplanted quickly.<br/>
<br/>
The Spirit Concealment Willow can't always be kept in the wall box."<br/>
<br/>
"For spirit plants, it's still best to be in the soil."<br/>
<br/>
But this required Ning Zhuo to set up a spirit plant cabin.<br/>
<br/>
The spirit plant cabin in the Myriad-Li Game Dragon was similar to the refining cabin.<br/>
<br/>
It had formations, and they were at the Nascent Soul level, but it needed to be filled with other materials.<br/>
<br/>
The current refining cabin didn't even have a grain of soil.<br/>
<br/>
After personally checking everything, Ning Zhuo left the storage cabin and went to the dragon head cabin to replace Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the cabin, he saw Sun Lingtong eagerly trying out various functions of the mechanical dragon, enjoying herself immensely.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo arrive, he immediately asked about the fire burial.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo told him truthfully.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt very happy.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo prepared to replace him, he waved her hand:<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, you go cultivate. You've just reached the early stage of Foundation Establishment, cultivation should be your priority. Secondly, don't you need to create Meng Yehu's mechanical body?<br/>
<br/>
The spirit plant cabin for the Spirit Concealment Willow also needs you to set up."<br/>
<br/>
"You have too many things to do."<br/>
<br/>
"You go busy yourself, I'll watch over the course."<br/>
<br/>
"Don't worry, when we reach Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, I'll call you."<br/>
<br/>
Ten Thousand Medicines Valley was hidden among steep mountains, with magnificent scenery and unparalleled beauty.<br/>
<br/>
A young girl in yellow, holding a bamboo basket, was walking down from the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The morning light was faint, thin mist like gauze, making the valley appear like a fairyland.<br/>
<br/>
By the time the girl reached the foot of the mountain, the early sun had risen in the east,<br/>
<br/>
golden light spilling over, illuminating the green mountains in brilliant splendor.<br/>
<br/>
The girl, familiar with the path, entered the valley.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the valley, towering cypresses and pines blocked out the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Winding paths paved with stone slabs were flanked by strange flowers and exotic grasses, fragrant and lush.<br/>
<br/>
Bird songs echoed in the mountains, crisp and pleasing to the ear, like heavenly music.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually, the sound of water grew louder.<br/>
<br/>
When the yellow-clothed girl came to a clear pool, she saw a silver curtain hanging on the cliff by the pool.<br/>
<br/>
A small waterfall plunged straight down, thundering as it crashed into the pool, stirring up mist.<br/>
<br/>
The girl stepped on the water's surface, cast a spell, and walked directly towards the waterfall.<br/>
<br/>
Behind the waterfall was a slanting mountain path.<br/>
<br/>
She followed the path, climbing diagonally upwards, with the waterfall and skylight on the outside,<br/>
<br/>
and damp stone walls on the inside.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain stone walls, due to the dense water vapor, were mottled with moss,<br/>
<br/>
with vines hanging down. A morning breeze blew, shaking the mist,<br/>
<br/>
making the green leaves on the vines sway, echoing the ripples in the pool.<br/>
<br/>
The girl took a deep breath, feeling a cool freshness penetrate her lungs, feeling delighted.<br/>
<br/>
She slowly stopped at the entrance of a cave and called out softly: "Senior Brother, Senior Brother."<br/>
<br/>
After a few breaths, a male voice came from inside the cave: "Is that Little Junior Sister? Please, come in quickly!"<br/>
<br/>
Inside the cave, the senior and junior disciples met.<br/>
<br/>
The girl put down her bamboo basket, took out the meals, and arranged them on a relatively flat stone surface.<br/>
<br/>
The Senior Brother glanced over and urgently asked: "Little Junior Sister, where's my wine?"<br/>
<br/>
The girl snorted: "Wine, wine, wine, is that all you know?"<br/>
<br/>
"Master told you to watch over the medicinal herbs, but you secretly used them to brew wine."<br/>
<br/>
"Now you're being punished, guarding the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave, and still drinking.<br/>
<br/>
If the Master finds out, see if he doesn't flay you!"<br/>
<br/>
The Senior Brother sighed and frowned: "Little Junior Sister, you know I can't be happy without wine.<br/>
<br/>
Please, be kind and bring out the wine quickly. My alcohol addiction is acting up,<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't sleep all night yesterday."<br/>
<br/>
The girl snorted coldly: "Here, here."<br/>
<br/>
Her storage jade bracelet glowed faintly, and she took out a bottle of medicinal wine, handing it to Senior Brother.<br/>
<br/>
Senior Brother received it as if it were a precious treasure, overjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
He took it, uncorked the bottle, and after drinking a few mouthfuls, sighed with satisfaction:<br/>
<br/>
"Why is there only a small bottle?"<br/>
<br/>
The girl: "That's all there is."<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother, you're guarding the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave.<br/>
<br/>
If you get drunk and are dragged into the cave by beast demons, you'll lose your life!"<br/>
<br/>
Senior Brother waved his hand dismissively: "This Ten Thousand Beasts Cave has been cleared out for a long time,<br/>
<br/>
it's nearly abandoned now. How could there be beast demons?"<br/>
<br/>
"This is a matter of life and death, Senior Brother, you're too careless!"<br/>
<br/>
The girl immediately puffed up her cheeks and angrily began to lecture him.<br/>
<br/>
Senior Brother listened to Little Junior Sister's lecture while picking up chopsticks and tasting the exquisite meal.<br/>
<br/>
When Little Junior Sister was tired of talking, he looked up at the little sister he had watched grow up, his gaze tender: "Lin Shanshan, do you have anything else to say?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan rolled her eyes. Seeing that Senior Brother had finished breakfast,<br/>
<br/>
she waved her hand, generating a burst of energy that collected the bowls and chopsticks into the bamboo basket:<br/>
<br/>
"Linghu Jiu, can't you behave a bit? Always making the Master angry, being punished to guard the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know how annoying it is for me to bring you meals every day?"<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu quickly apologized.<br/>
<br/>
After scolding him for a while, Lin Shanshan left the cave and returned the way she came.<br/>
<br/>
At the poolside, she unexpectedly found a stranger wandering nearby and lightly called out: "Who are you?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo turned at her words.<br/>
<br/>
His features were delicate, his gaze clear as the pool water.<br/>
<br/>
Now dressed all in white, standing by the pool, his figure was tall and straight.<br/>
<br/>
A mountain breeze blew, making his clothes flutter.<br/>
<br/>
The pool was emerald green, its rippling surface reflecting his figure.<br/>
<br/>
Around him, flowers were just blooming, morning dew glistening, grass and trees lush.<br/>
<br/>
The girl's heart skipped a beat, and she unconsciously held her breath.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo revealed an apologetic smile, cupped his hands in greeting and said:<br/>
<br/>
"I am Ning Zhuo from Fire Persimmon Mountain. I've come to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley specifically to seek guidance and learning. I hope I'm not intruding."<br/>
<br/>
"May I ask the young lady's name?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan didn't know why, but her heart began to beat faster involuntarily.<br/>
<br/>
She opened her mouth to respond: "This little one is Lin Shanshan."<br/>
<br/>
As soon as she spoke, she felt strange. Why had her voice become so small?<br/>
