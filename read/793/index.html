<paragraph index="1">Mountain-top Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Gu Qing stood with his hands hanging by his sides. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In front of the tea table, Zhao Hansheng funneled his spiritual energy into a jade slip, manifesting a battle scene - it was precisely the earlier fight between Gu Qing’s painted avatar and Ning Zhuo’s Golden Core puppet. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Gu Qing’s lips were pressed thin and his eyes were bloodshot as he stared at the mid-air battle. These were scenes he found unbearable to recall! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"That thief Ning Zhuo is actually so despicable and shameless!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"To use such a deceptive plot to swindle me!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Hateful, utterly loathsome!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Gu Qing had suffered a massive, silent loss. He originally thought it would be a "staged fight" of tacit understanding. Now, even if he wanted to hold Ning Zhuo accountable for breaking their agreement, he didn't have a single contract in hand - there hadn't even been an exchange of words or divine sense between them. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">As Gu Qing watched the battle before him, he also reviewed the entire process. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He realized he had fallen into a trap from the very beginning. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"No, more accurately, I fell into the trap the moment I received Ning Zhuo’s reply!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"This fellow was acting the whole time, leading me to believe he would maintain the same tacit understanding as me." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Then, in the early stages of the battle, he even deliberately only used martial combat, using the guise of a spar to hint that this would be a staged fight. In the end, it was all a trap to lull me into a false sense of security!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But there was one point Gu Qing simply could not understand. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Why? </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Why did Ning Zhuo harbor such hostility toward him? Why go to such lengths to deal with him? </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">All along, Gu Qing had believed Ning Zhuo would be a potential ally. This was because, putting himself in the other's shoes, he would have been delighted to make friends with people like Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Consequently, this battle had completely revealed Ning Zhuo’s status as an enemy. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">As the images of the fight reached their conclusion, Gu Qing once again saw his painted avatar frozen within a massive block of ice. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Insidious, truly too insidious." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Gu Qing trembled slightly with rage, wishing he could turn back time. He would have treated the fight with absolute caution, given it his all, and beaten Ning Zhuo into the dirt. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">In contrast, Zhao Hansheng watched with great interest. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He even replayed the final moments of the battle over and over again. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Initially, this display - which seemed to mock Gu Qing - caused Gu Qing’s eyes to fill with even more burst capillaries, his body shaking more violently. But gradually, Gu Qing began to grasp the meaning. His expression and mood miraculously smoothed out. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Zhao Hansheng took in Gu Qing’s state, and once the timing was right, he gave a slight smile. "Qing’er, isn't this exactly the point of your travels and experience in this world?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">These words were like a bucket of ice water, completely calming Gu Qing down. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Gu Qing’s breathing returned to normal, and he lowered his head slightly. "Teacher, you are right. In the future, when I encounter such situations, I will definitely be more than cautious." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhao Hansheng pointed his finger at the final battle image. "Even if Ning Zhuo hadn't used that tactic, or if the tactic had failed, you might not have necessarily won." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Gu Qing was stunned. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He hurriedly looked closer at the combat scene in the air. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Zhao Hansheng thoughtfully began a replay. It was only a short segment, limited to the final moment of the battle. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">After three replays, Gu Qing’s expression changed again, revealing a hint of shock. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"At the final moment, Ning Zhuo’s Golden Core puppet erupted with a profound and mysterious power." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Compared to before, the scale of this power wasn't large, but it contained a qualitative change." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"That is why he won in the end, completely freezing my clone!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"He... what kind of method did he use?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhao Hansheng replied, "Judging only from this jade slip, that method has shadows of a divine ability; it's almost like the application of an innate talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Gu Qing frowned. "Is that possible? A mechanical puppet isn't a real living person. Furthermore, most living people lack innate talent." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zhao Hansheng shook his head slightly. "I can't see anything more for now. However, the current era is a golden age of cultivation; new branches of the hundred arts of cultivation are emerging constantly. Ning Zhuo’s background is clearly extraordinary, so it's normal for him to possess some unique methods." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Gu Qing showed a look of shame. "Teacher, I lost my reason. After this battle, I've been wallowing in resentment and even lost my basic judgment." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zhao Hansheng said, "It's good that you've calmed down. Next, how do you plan to respond?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Gu Qing narrowed his eyes, falling into deep thought for a time. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">As his thoughts deepened and his internal analysis progressed, his expression became increasingly unsightly. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After a long while, he said in a hoarse voice, "Teacher, my current situation is quite troublesome." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"It would be one thing if Ning Zhuo simply designed a way to defeat me." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"The key is that at the end, he used the record of this battle as a benchmark to pressure other geniuses to fight me with everything they have."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"This is an open scheme, a development the public loves to see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"I've already been placed on the roasting rack by him. It will be very hard for me to step down from this high stage and fire!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhao Hansheng did not speak, merely looking at his student calmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Gu Qing grit his teeth. "The upcoming battles cannot be taken back. It's not just that the challenge letters have been sent out; I've already told the public my intentions. If I back down now, my reputation will be utterly ruined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Therefore, I must fight with all my might, show my own style, and prove my strength to the public."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">After a pause, he continued, "Even though this is exactly what Ning Zhuo wants to see, I have no choice but to do it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The thought of having to follow the script Ning Zhuo had written made him feel incredibly disgusted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Such a situation was undoubtedly quite passive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">But Gu Qing could only do this - who told him to fall for Ning Zhuo’s trap? </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhao Hansheng asked intentionally, "Have you thought about finding a suitable opponent and reaching a tacit understanding with them to perform an intense and long-lasting battle? On one hand, it would prove your strength, and on the other, it would break the time-comparison trap Ning Zhuo set at the end?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Gu Qing nodded. "Teacher, I've thought about it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"But I found there is simply no suitable candidate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Most of the people I sent challenge letters to are from the Righteous Path. Each has their own power and background within the Flying Cloud Kingdom. They have too many concerns; with my current standing, it would be difficult for them to risk their reputations to agree to a staged fight with me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"As for specific individuals from the Demonic or Heretical Sects, I don't trust them!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Zhao Hansheng nodded, satisfied with the result of this small test. He sighed. "As teacher and student, we are newcomers here. We are unfamiliar with the people and the land, which puts us at a disadvantage in this regard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Our hands and feet are tied in everything we do."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"However, because of this, it is all the more reason for us to take control of the Confucian cultivator group here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Gu Qing pondered, "We lack reliable and effective intelligence too much. To this day, I still don't know why Ning Zhuo is opposing me. Looking at it now, there might be some hidden details regarding the two previous Rising Cloud Minor Trials held by the Confucian group."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Thinking of this, a name suddenly jumped into Gu Qing’s mind. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">His eyes lit up. Just as he was about to speak, Zhao Hansheng spoke first: "Are you thinking of getting the inside story from Situ Gu?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhao Hansheng shook his head. "I already asked. Situ Gu stated that he cannot answer me." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Gu Qing’s expression immediately turned strange. "Situ Gu yearns for the Huazhang Kingdom and was the first Confucian cultivator we won over. For him to give such an answer even to you, Teacher... that stance alone is enough to explain the problem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Gu Qing struck his palm with his fist. "So that's how it is. The top spots in the two Confucian trials were likely crafted specifically for Ning Zhuo. Therefore, because we intercepted the third Rising Cloud Minor Trial, we triggered Ning Zhuo’s hostility!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Deeply versed in the ways of the Righteous Path, the teacher and student analyzed the situation and immediately sensed the hidden truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Even without evidence, they felt this guess was extremely close to the truth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Zhao Hansheng asked the crucial question: "The upcoming battle in the Martial Arts Hall is very important. Whom do you plan to choose?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Gu Qing fell into thought once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Following Ning Zhuo being the first to reply, several others had also sent back responses. Some declined, but even more had accepted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"The geniuses of the Demonic and Heretical paths are excluded first. They aren't worthy of trust, and they want nothing more than to use me as a stepping stone; they don't follow the rules."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Among the Righteous Path... although there are rumors that Situ Xing is at odds with Ning Zhuo, they cannot be fully believed. Ning Zhuo is too insidious; what if he deliberately set this up in advance?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"In my opinion, Zhu Fenxiang is the most stable option."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"On one hand, their Zhu family is a traditional Righteous Path power. They understand the rules well and are good at maintaining the face of the Righteous Path. On the other hand, the foundation of the Zhu family lies in the Divine Summoning Art, which is different from other powers and organizations. They are better at maintaining connections with people and divine lineages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Finally, Zhu Fenxiang just had a major battle with Situ Xing and won a pyrrhic victory."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Even if Ning Zhuo is at odds with Situ Xing, it is only an internal conflict. On matters of great importance, he will surely have a clear mind. This means Zhu Fenxiang is definitely not on the same side as him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"The enemy of my enemy is a friend. I might be able to use this to reach some kind of alliance with Zhu Fenxiang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Zhao Hansheng nodded. "In that case, go ahead and do it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Based purely on analysis, Gu Qing was not wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The teacher and student still suffered from a lack of intelligence. Of course, the relationship between Ning Zhuo and Zhu Fenxiang had already leaked within the Zhu family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">It was very likely the two of them would find out after some time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="171"/>
<paragraph index="172">While the two were discussing, a female cultivator who had concealed her original appearance knocked on the door of the Blue Stone Cave Dwelling. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">"For what reason has this fellow Daoist come?" Old Chef opened the door. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">The female cultivator wore a thin veil over her face. She had a full figure and exuded an air of elegance and nobility, yet she merely handed over a visiting note without speaking. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Seeing the person's extraordinary bearing and how her movements suggested composure and mystery, Old Chef did not dare to be careless. He accepted the note and accompanied the woman as they waited, while he funneled spiritual energy to fly the visiting note into the depths of the cave dwelling. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">Ning Zhuo soon received the note. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">His eyebrows shot up. "Zhu Fenxiang’s mother, Zhu Guizhi?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">"She specifically instructed me not to notify Zhu Fenxiang. What is the purpose of this?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Ning Zhuo immediately sensed an unusual aura. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">"Is it because I learned the Zhu family’s Divine Summoning Art?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">"No matter what her purpose is, I should meet and talk with her first to ask why she has come." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">He immediately halted his work on the mechanical design of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, stood up, and walked out of the cultivation chamber to personally welcome Zhu Guizhi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">After all, she was Zhu Fenxiang’s mother; according to etiquette, he should act this way.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
