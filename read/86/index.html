<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 86: Peak of the Third Level, Advancing a Thousand Li a Day!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">After the two Zhou Clan prodigies took the stage, the rest of the Zhou Clan recultivation team stepped up to enter the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“Third level, middle stage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Third level, middle stage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Third level, early stage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">First came a series of cultivators in the third level of Qi Refining, ranging from the mid-stage to early-stage. None were at the late-stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Then came the second level cultivators, ranging from the peak to the early stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">There wasn’t a single person at the first level of Qi Refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After this round of testing, the discussions among Zheng Clan and Ning Clan cultivators grew noticeably quieter. The expressions of the Zheng Clan cultivators had turned solemn, while most of the Ning Clan cultivators looked even worse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Although the Zhou Clan’s recultivation team had few people, they were all elites.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Next in line, according to the order, was the Zheng Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Zheng Jian was the first to enter the testing formation, stepping in without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Peak of the third level,” the elder announced loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“WOO!!” The Zheng Clan cultivators raised their arms and cheered, creating a wave of excitement that was much louder than the Zhou Clan's earlier celebration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">They seemed to be competing over this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Many of the young Zhou Clan cultivators watched quietly, with most having calm expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In the reception hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Zhou Clan patriarch praised, “The Zheng Clan’s family ethos is truly admirable; united and cohesive, flourishing in every way. This is all due to your excellent leadership, Brother Zheng.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Zheng Clan patriarch laughed heartily, graciously accepting the compliment. “It’s like forging iron. Steel must endure countless hammer strikes and join tightly together before it becomes a fine weapon.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Zheng Clan cultivators were very loud, alternating between cheers and jeers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It was obvious that the Zhou Clan cultivators had tested their cultivation bases ahead of time and entered the formation in order of strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Zheng Clan had not done this, and so it was difficult to guess each cultivator’s result in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">When a cultivator had good results, the clan cheered enthusiastically. When a fellow clan member’s results were less than ideal, some people would jeer loudly, but only as fun and never with malice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">This kind of healthy competitive atmosphere made even the Ning Clan patriarch secretly envious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“My Ning Clan used to be like this too.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Unfortunately, we suffered heavy losses during the migration. After entering the city, the branch family launched a coup, so we had to adopt the strategy of strengthening the trunk and weakening the branches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Sigh, only when the main family grows in both quality and quantity can we gradually ease the suppression of the branch family and regain a firm family ethos.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Ning Clan patriarch had held a high position for many years and was not unaware of the internal concerns within the clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">But he had no choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He was from the main family. His background determined his position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He could not betray the main family to support the branch family. The branch family cultivators would never accept him, and the main family cultivators would usurp him immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Every clan has its own difficulties.” The Ning Clan patriarch silently adjusted his mindset.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He knew his own recultivation team's situation well. A large portion were still at the first level of Qi Refining, so the results of the test definitely wouldn’t look good.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Finally, the Ning Clan’s turn came.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">A cold expression on her face, Ning Xiaohui stepped into the testing formation under the worried gazes of the Ning Clan members behind her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Peak of the third level,” the elder announced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Ning Clan cultivators erupted in cheers as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zheng Jian and Zhou Zeshen looked toward the exiting Ning Xiaohui. Her expression was as cold as ever, and she exuded a prideful nature from her very being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In the reception hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Zheng Clan patriarch looked at the Ning Clan patriarch: “Your clan’s Ning Xiaohui hasn't been recultivating for very long. She's already reached the peak of the third level?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Zhou Clan patriarch also looked over in curiosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Ning Clan patriarch stroked his beard and smiled, having awaited this moment for a long time. Pretending to be flippant, he said, “Our clan was slow to react to the Lava Immortal Palace and felt that the gap was too wide. That’s why I sought help from our clan’s old ancestor. With his permission, we activated a talisman from the clan treasury, called the Drifting Clouds Flowing Water Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“When this talisman was created, the predecessors infused it with water from an icy spring deep within a glacier, and it contains a hint of the spirituality of heaven and earth. Thus, it provides significant aid in cultivation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Zhou Clan patriarch smiled and offered a few compliments to the Ning Clan, thinking to himself that the Ning Clan still had some foundation after all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Zheng Clan patriarch added, “Brother Ning, it seems our two clans should deepen our relationship. To be honest, our clan is currently forging a magic treasure and urgently require a method for extreme cold tempering. Since your Ning Clan hails from the Northern Wind Kingdom, perhaps you could lend a hand?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Ning Clan patriarch stroked his beard, saying, “It can be arranged, it can be arranged.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">But in his heart, he felt quite a bit of regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Drifting Clouds Flowing Water Talisman possessed inherent spirituality and was an incredibly effective cultivation aid, but its number of uses was limited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">If they could produce a Leaping Sail Mountain Pass Talisman imbued with spirituality, then according to the Ning Clan’s secret records, the two talismans would link up, and their spiritualities would nourish and replenish each other. As long as they strictly controlled the usage, they would be able to reuse the talismans in perpetuity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Now, though, every single use consumed spirituality that would never be restored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Fortunately, Ning Xiaohui was only in the early stages of Qi Refining after restarting her cultivation, so her consumption of the talisman’s spirituality was relatively low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The usage of this talisman was a measure born of helplessness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">First, on the night that the Technique Transmission Bell tolled, Ning Xiaohui had fallen asleep due to overexerting herself while making talismans and thus didn’t obtain a Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation adapted for herself. She was forced to use a generalized version based on the insights of others, which wasn’t very efficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Second, Ning Xiaohui’s grandmother and the academy elder had kicked up a fuss on her behalf, securing for her numerous privileges and benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Third, the Ning Clan patriarch had also taken into consideration the competitive relationship with the Zhou and Zheng Clans. If a key figure like Ning Xiaohui had a weak cultivation base, the Ning Clan would suffer greatly when it came time for the three clans to distribute the benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Because of all this, the Ning Clan had temporarily infused the Drifting Clouds Flowing Water Talisman into Ning Xiaohui’s body, helping her constantly circulate her qi and refine her magical power. That was why she had progressed so rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After Ning Xiaohui returned to the team, the test results of the remaining Ning Clan cultivators were not as encouraging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Some of the better ones had cultivation bases at the second level, but most were merely at the first level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">This wasn’t really their fault. It was because the Ning Clan had only expanded their recultivation team a short while ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">But now that the three clans were testing together, every time the Zhou Clan elder announced a result, his voice seemed to get louder and publicly humiliate the Ning Clan cultivators whose cultivation bases were only at the first level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Zheng Clan cultivators, being more hot-blooded, occasionally broke out into laughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Zhou Clan cultivators maintained their decorum, but the disdain in their eyes grew more and more obvious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Xiaohui was so angry her face turned ashen. Looking at the cultivators around her, she spat coldly, “A bunch of useless trash!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Chen and Ning Yong returned to the team one after another, both wearing frustrated expressions. Their cultivation bases were the same – the peak of the first level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Ever since we started recultivating, we’ve been practicing nonstop, pushing ourselves to the limit every single day.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“I heard the Zheng Clan and Zhou Clan provide free resources, but in our Ning Clan recultivation team, only the main family gets similar treatment!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Yeah, if we had the same resources and time, we might not be any worse than them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Chen and Ning Yong were clearly dissatisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo reached out and patted both of their shoulders, saying plainly, “Just watch me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Under the confused gazes of Ning Chen and Ning Yong, Ning Zhuo stepped out of the team and entered the testing formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The entire training ground was buzzing with noise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">By this point, the overall strength of the three clans was already clear to everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Though the Ning Clan had a large number of cultivators, many were only at the first level. With so many preceding cases, no one was expecting much from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">But the testing formation erupted with brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Zhou Clan elder paused for a moment, confirmed the result, then announced in disbelief, “Ning Zhuo, peak of the third level of Qi Refining!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The entire training ground fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Many people began asking their neighbors if they had heard correctly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">When Ning Zhuo walked out of the testing formation, countless eyes immediately turned toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The sixteen-year-old boy faced the crowd without a trace of fear. He gave a slight smile, then raised his head and walked confidently back to the Ning Clan’s group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Many gazes followed him. Even Zhou Zeshen, Zhou Zhu, and Zheng Jian were looking at him with curiosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Who is this guy? How is his cultivation base so high?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“There was nothing about him in the intel.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Does the Ning Clan really have an overlooked gem?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">These and similar thoughts swirled through the minds of the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Even the patriarchs of the three clans were no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Under normal circumstances, they wouldn’t have paid this much attention to cultivators in the Qi Refining stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Bu the Lava Immortal Palace had appeared in Fire Persimmon Mountain, and the Qi Refining cultivators of each clan were the main force to explore the immortal palace. It made sense to place greater importance on them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Zhou Clan patriarch looked toward the Ning Clan patriarch. “I didn’t expect that you were still hiding this card, Brother Ning.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Ning Clan patriarch stroked his beard and smiled calmly. “You flatter me, Brother Zhou.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He didn’t explain any further. The Zhou and Zheng Clan patriarchs exchanged a look and silently raised their inner evaluation of the Ning Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">What they didn’t know was that the Ning Clan patriarch was just as confused as them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo’s return was met with cheers from the Ning Clan cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Chen and Ning Yong rushed up to him with surprise and disbelief written all over their faces. “Ah Zhuo, how did you suddenly reach the peak of the third level?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Yeah, you’re just as strong as Ning Xiaohui now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Countless ears perked up, waiting to hear Ning Zhuo’s response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly. “Maybe I’m just well-suited for the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation. My cultivation has progressed like a raging river, advancing a thousand li every day.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The crowd fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
