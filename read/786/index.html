<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Inside the hall, Zhu Xuangui, Song Taosheng, and Li Guanyu all felt their cultivation boundaries begin to loosen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">For the longest time, they had followed the established orthodoxies - investigating things to extend knowledge, constructing their Confucian cultivation externally, and piling up classics and principles like a high tower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Now, Zhao Hansheng’s words revealed to the three of them that there were actually two paths to the top of that tower. One was on the outside, spiraling upward along the exterior walls. The other was inside the tower, rising almost vertically and offering a much easier ascent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The "inside" of the tower was the cultivator’s own heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Confucian cultivators did not only have to seek outward; they could search within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The heart itself is the source of all principles. There is no need to seek them externally; one only needs to polish the heart within!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This is precisely the Literary Heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">And that high tower is the Literary Palace of a Confucian cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">For a moment, the shock and joy felt by Zhu Xuangui, Song Taosheng, and Li Guanyu were beyond words!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Cultivating according to the traditional old ways wasn't impossible, but it was simply too difficult. Investigating things to extend knowledge was an arduous task that tested a cultivator in every aspect, restricted by their mastery of various fields.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ideally, if a cultivator mastered the "hundred arts of cultivation" and possessed profound depth in every area, the path of investigating things could be walked to its very end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But in reality, a cultivator's time and energy are far too limited. Most cultivators’ comprehension and learning abilities are also lacking; throughout their entire lives, they might only achieve significant accomplishments in one or two cultivation techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">And that is a favorable scenario.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">In truth, most people reach the end of their lives with only mediocre achievements in the various arts of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Zhao Hansheng had pointed out: We can still investigate things to extend knowledge, but seeking the heart within is a far more effective path than seeking objects without.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It was practical and effective!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zhu Xuangui, Song Taosheng, and Li Guanyu had all benefited from this realization and couldn't wait to return to seclusion to study this brand-new direction. All three knew that regardless of how much they truly understood, their Confucian cultivation would see progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Such progress was rare. They hadn't even obtained a "True Intent" yet; they had simply listened to a debate between Zhao Hansheng and Duanmu Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Duanmu Zhang sighed deeply, the worry and stubbornness on his face gradually fading. With a solemn expression, he straightened his robes and crown, then slowly stood up and gave Zhao Hansheng a deep, respectful bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Fellow Daoist Zhao’s profound discourse is like a divine empowerment, shaking my very soul and providing me with endless benefit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Previously, I strictly adhered to the old school of thought, believing that one must investigate every matter in the world to understand principle and approach the realm of the Sages. Today, I finally realize I have only been circling outside the heart, never daring to take direct responsibility. The heart and principle are one, and knowledge and action are inherently combined... truly mysterious, truly marvelous! It turns out the realm of the Sages is not unreachable; it has always been within this square inch of the heart, merely ignored by us common mortals."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Fellow Daoist Zhao’s mention of 'attaining the conscience' points directly to the source. It brings the loftiness of Heavenly Principle down to a practical level that everyone can reach and practice. This is a boon to all Confucian cultivators in the world!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Fellow Daoist Zhao's contribution will last for a thousand years. Based on this discourse alone, you will surely leave your name in the annals of history!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Duanmu Zhang changed his attitude completely, admitting defeat on the spot and acknowledging Zhao Hansheng's excellence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">However, Zhao Hansheng stepped aside, avoiding Duanmu Zhang’s formal bow. With a look of shame, he returned the salute with a sincere voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"I am ashamed! I, Zhao, am merely a messenger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"What I have just elaborated on is not my own theory. It is the 'Heart Study' created by Master Wang Xinyue!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"What virtue or ability do I have to dare claim such a monumental achievement?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Duanmu Zhang and the others were greatly surprised and pressed him to explain who Wang Xinyue was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zhao Hansheng informed them that she was a young female cultivator at the Nascent Soul stage. She had created "Heart Study" herself, subverting the old Confucian concepts and opening a new path. He had specifically sought her out as a disciple to learn from her and obtain this "conscience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Only then did Duanmu Zhang and the others understand that Wang Xinyue was a rising star of the younger generation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The Flying Cloud Kingdom is indeed a holy land for us Confucian cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"There are always such virtuous and talented people emerging..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"No, Wang Xinyue is special. She is the best among them!" Zhu Xuangui and the others discussed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zhao Hansheng added: "You haven't interacted with her, so you don't know how brilliant she is. She is simply a heaven-sent genius!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"She will surely lead the entire world of Confucianism."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"For the next several hundred years, she will be the brightest star in the Flying Cloud Kingdom - no, in the entire world!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zhao Hansheng held Wang Xinyue in extremely high regard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Li Guanyu praised: "She has stirred the torrent of the times and will bring a subversive transformation to the entire kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">After some deep thought, Duanmu Zhang nodded slowly. "The three phrases 'The heart is principle,' 'Unity of knowledge and action,' and 'Attain the conscience' are enough to establish an entire sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"It is a pity that I am old and have been ordered and invited to stay here. Otherwise, I would truly want to return and pay my respects to this female master in person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhao Hansheng smiled slightly. "This Heart Study aims to clarify the mind and see one's nature, benefiting the world and its people. It was never meant to be a secret treasure. Since I have received her guidance and endorse her philosophy, I naturally wish to spread her Confucian heart-method during my visit to the Flying Cloud Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"I am willing to open classes again to teach all of you, and many more students, all the related concepts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As soon as these words were spoken, everyone was shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Zhu Xuangui, Song Taosheng, and Li Guanyu all showed expressions of excitement and interest. Only Duanmu Zhang’s face grew heavy as he looked deeply at Zhao Hansheng. "Then..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhao Hansheng smiled without speaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Beside him, Gu Qing stood up and cupped his hands. "Seniors, my master is sincere and willing to teach everything he knows. This is a fortunate event for the Confucian lineage of our Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"However, the path of scholarship prizes mutual understanding and respect. As the saying goes: 'The Dao is not passed on lightly!' To transmit a Great Dao, one must have the appropriate status. What do you all think?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Everyone was startled and looked at each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">What kind of status would be worthy of teaching this level of scholarship?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The answer was almost obvious. Such a subversive theory was enough to serve as the foundation of a lineage. How could its teacher occupy a subordinate position?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the leader of the Confucian cultivators was called the "Mountain Master." Duanmu Zhang was the publicly recognized Mountain Master, highly respected and of great virtue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Only now did Zhu Xuangui and the others completely understand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zhao Hansheng’s visit to Duanmu Zhang was a pretense; mentioning Heart Study during the debate was merely the bait. He had displayed a priceless treasure that would tempt any Confucian cultivator. His true intention was to use this opportunity to become the Mountain Master and lead the Confucian cultivators of the Myriad Manifestations Sect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Seeing the silence in the hall, Zhao Hansheng spoke slowly, stating that he did not wish to stay permanently. Once he finished teaching Heart Study, he would leave and continue to lead his disciples in traveling the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But before then, holding the position of Mountain Master would better facilitate the spread of Heart Study and help other students.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Duanmu Zhang and the others remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zhao Hansheng made it sound easy, but the classes for Heart Study were under his control. If he continued teaching and intentionally delayed the schedule, no one would have a reason to overturn his position as Mountain Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After expressing that he was "not greedy for power," Zhao Hansheng decisively shut his mouth and spoke no more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Gu Qing smiled slightly and sat back down leisurely. The master and disciple were very confident; they weren't worried at all that the others wouldn't agree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The reason was simple - the temptation of Heart Study was just too great!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">As Confucian cultivators, this temptation was magnified a hundred or thousand times. These people would inevitably be moved to action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">And the following developments were exactly as the master and disciple had predicted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Duanmu Zhang directly stated that he was willing to step down for someone more capable and was looking forward to the Heart Study classes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhu Xuangui and the others had no objections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Thus, Zhao Hansheng achieved his true goal. He became the Mountain Master, using Heart Study to successfully seize leadership of the Confucian group at the main headquarters of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, despite being a newcomer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Upon taking office, he immediately presented a heavy gift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I have heard that Fellow Daoists Zhu Xuangui and Song Taosheng have been busy preparing for a new round of the Flying Cloud Trial, which is related to spiritual paper."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"As the new Mountain Master, I cannot simply sit by; I must contribute my strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Fellow Daoists, please look."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Everyone turned their gaze to see a sheet of paper with the texture of white jade, containing an internal, ancient glow. Within the light, golden runes flowed - mysterious beyond measure. Just looking at it caused one’s mind to naturally become tranquil and their thoughts to become exceptionally clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Even more miraculous was that around the jade page, there were faint ripples of pure light, and the air was infused with a phantom-like fragrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Zhu Xuangui and Song Taosheng exchanged a look, seeing the shock and excitement in each other's eyes. They had originally come to make Zhao Hansheng pay a price to add glory to this Flying Cloud Trial. They hadn't expected Zhao Hansheng to take the initiative to bring out this white jade paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Li Guanyu was the first to speak: "Is this the Jade Page of Dao-Bearing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Zhao Hansheng smiled calmly. "Exactly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"I brought my disciple here with no intention of joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect; I simply wanted Qing’er to travel and broaden his horizons."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Since this Flying Cloud Trial is happening, it wouldn't hurt to let the juniors test themselves more. My disciple and I are bold, but not shameless. We offer this gift to serve as a part of the competition's content. What do you think?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Zhu Xuangui stared at the Jade Page of Dao-Bearing, then looked at Zhao Hansheng, his voice a bit strained. "The Jade Page of Dao-Bearing is no small matter. It is an object that can carry True Intent and preserve it without loss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Is Senior truly certain about using this as the competition content?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Zhao Hansheng said: "I will announce the refining method, but not all of it. If a cultivator refines the first part, I will naturally open the second and third parts to them, and so on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Of course, anyone participating in this trial must sign a Divine Contract beforehand to ensure the refining method of the Jade Page of Dao-Bearing is not easily leaked. This is the sincerity my disciple and I bring. Fellow Daoists, how about it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Zhu Xuangui already understood Zhao Hansheng’s intentions and remained silent in thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Song Taosheng looked at Gu Qing, realizing that for the sake of his disciple, Zhao Hansheng was willing to give up such a heavy gift. Naturally, one could guess that the difficulty of refining the Jade Page of Dao-Bearing must be extremely high, and the related methods were likely complex or profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But Gu Qing certainly had attainments or accumulation in this area. Otherwise, Zhao Hansheng wouldn't have chosen this as the reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Then many thanks to Fellow Daoist Zhao," Duanmu Zhang suddenly said, making the decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Li Guanyu took a deep breath. "I’m starting to regret it. If I had known, I wouldn't have agreed to be an examiner; I’d rather participate in this Flying Cloud Trial myself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">This was a joke, and it immediately eased the tense atmosphere in the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Song Taosheng laughed. "Give it a rest, Li Guanyu. You’ve already joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect; how could you be eligible for the Flying Cloud Trial?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Li Guanyu threw up his hands. "Is it too late for me to quit the sect now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Everyone broke out into hearty laughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Heart Study, the Jade Page of Dao-Bearing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The master and disciple from the Flying Cloud Kingdom had a plan and acted decisively, immediately changing the entire situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Zhu Xuangui and the others followed the flow, already putting their original plans for Ning Zhuo at the back of their minds. After all, they only favored and appreciated Ning Zhuo because of Lord Wen Ruanyu's face and the potential huge profits from the White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Compared to that, the "face" of the Great Scholar Zhao Hansheng had to be respected more. Heart Study and the Jade Page of Dao-Bearing were visible, tangible, and massive benefits!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">-----</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In the Zhu Clan lands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Inside the Tranquil Heart Court, fragrance wafted through the air as a tea party for the female family members was underway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The central figure was easy to spot - Zhu Guizhi, dressed in red, still possessed much charm and was chatting and laughing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">One female cultivator said: "Sister Guizhi, I must congratulate you! That child Fenxiang did something big without a word."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Zhu Guizhi’s hand holding the teacup paused almost imperceptibly, and she showed a perfectly timed look of confusion. "Oh? Where does the joy come from? That girl Fenxiang fought Situ Xing a while ago, and though she won, she hurt her vitality. I am currently looking for some warming spirit medicines for her."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Another female cultivator laughed. "Oh, sister, are you still playing dumb with us? It’s already spread all over the Internal Affairs Hall! Fenxiang used her only special authority to pass on our Zhu family’s prized Divine Summoning Art to an outsider boy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">A third female cultivator added: "According to clan rules, this treatment is something only a future 'son-in-law' can enjoy. Fenxiang has always been picky, but now she’s finally found a good match. Isn't that a huge cause for celebration? We’re all waiting to drink that wedding wine!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The smile on Zhu Guizhi’s face stiffened slightly. "There is such a thing? As her mother, I didn't even know. If it’s true, I’ll certainly invite all you sisters to the banquet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">A short while later, the crowd dispersed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Zhu Guizhi slammed her teacup onto the table. There wasn't a trace of a smile left on her face, only a look of gloom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"I bribed everyone at the Internal Affairs Office, and yet this news still leaked out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Finding the leaker isn't the most important thing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"The real problem is handling this matter! Fenxiang, oh Fenxiang, you really know how to cause trouble for your mother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Zhu Guizhi knew very well: the people who just left might have been smiling and offering congratulations, but in reality, who knew how many were secretly waiting for Zhu Fenxiang to make a mistake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Zhu Fenxiang was the one the Zhu family had put all their efforts into cultivating, the representative for the Foundation Establishment stage. If she made a mistake and was abandoned by the family, there were plenty of people waiting to take her place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">What gave Zhu Guizhi a headache was another point: Zhu Fenxiang’s letter was sent directly to the family's Internal Affairs Office for the record! This was clearly a "strike first, talk later" move; she hadn't intended to consult her mother at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">She took a deep breath, the frustration in her chest hard to suppress. "Sigh, Fenxiang’s personality has always been stubborn and distant from me... But I absolutely cannot let this matter go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"I’ve already made arrangements for her marriage. How can I let her run wild!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
