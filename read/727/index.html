<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The main gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The inner space of the Myriad Manifestations True Form Array was vast and boundless, resembling a new world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Here, there were no ordinary mountains, rivers, or buildings, only an endless expanse of Void. Above, below, and in all directions, the space was enclosed by the Cloud Script Boundary Wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This wall was neither stone nor jade, but a translucent crystalline membrane formed from Primordial Chaos Cloud Mother, condensed through Earth Vein Spirit Studies and Heavenly Wind Carved Spheres.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Natural Cloud Dao Patterns flowed across its surface, resembling both stellar tracks and profound verses of the Great Dao, constantly emitting Innate Pure Autumn Qi and radiating ceaseless brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Within the Cloud Wall, a vast sea of clouds churned like boiling water, its colors far from uniform white. At dawn, it shimmered with golden hues woven like brocade; at dusk, it transformed into descending purple mists. At times, it was as clear as washed azure; at others, it was deep black, pregnant with thunder. Amidst the swirling Qi, nine spiritual vortices pulsed, alternately emerging and vanishing, drawing in primordial essence to nourish All Phenomena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">When a cultivator's divine sense entered the array and struck the Cloud Script Boundary Wall, a wondrous transformation occurred, forming a Cloud Body Avatar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">At this moment, eight cultivators representing the eight major peaks had already connected their divine sense to the array, creating eight Cloud Body Avatars. These avatars gathered and settled cross-legged on cloud-like cushions, with Wei Ji seated at the head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Wei Ji appeared to be a middle-aged man in his early forties. His features were unremarkable: a straight nose, even eyebrows, and no distinguishing characteristics. He was the type to instantly blend into a crowd and disappear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">His skin was a pale, sun-deprived tan, like a riverbed stone smoothed by flowing water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">His pupils were so dark they appeared almost pure black, his gaze calm and distant as he observed others, as if peering through a layer of transparent glazed glass, observing all things in the world with minimal emotional fluctuation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He scanned the surroundings and slowly spoke, "Xi Zhao has gathered the Divine Sense Formation solely to discuss the matter of White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Before Wei Ji could finish, a massive cloud body avatar to his right burst into laughter. "We should have discussed this long ago! White Paper Immortal City should have been in the Myriad Manifestations Sect's grasp by now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"That little troublemaker Wen Ruanyu - if he'd just yield, we could formally intervene in White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"He's the only obstacle now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"As a disciple of our Sect, his refusal to cooperate is infuriating!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The speaker was Tuo Kuahuang, Peak Lord of Ten Thousand Beasts Peak. Jun Wu-like in stature, he stood nearly three meters tall, his muscles bulging like gnarled tree roots, radiating explosive primal power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">His skin was a weathered bronze from years of sun and wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Thick, lion-like black hair and beard grew wildly, nearly obscuring half his face, adding to his untamed, domineering aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">His features were sharply defined, as if carved by a blade. A jagged claw scar slashed diagonally across his face, from his left temple to his right cheek, bisecting the bridge of his nose. His eyes, sharp as an eagle's, carried the natural authority and temper of a king of beasts, flashing with piercing light whenever he spoke, daring anyone to meet his gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Tuo Kuahuang's words were immediately met with opposition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Peak Lord Tuokua, with his Confucian bones as unyielding as Profound Iron forged in icy depths, cannot be broken by brute force alone. Wen Ruanyu has steadfastly defended the isolated White Paper Immortal City for decades, nurturing the desolate lands with his benevolent heart. His blood still runs warm, his Dao remains unextinguished. For him, benevolence and righteousness are the pillars of his existence, the celestial beams supporting his very being. To force him to shatter his righteous bones and bow in submission... that would be as impossible as ascending to heaven."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The speaker slowly shook his head, a few strands of ink-scented hair falling beside his cheek. His sleeves stirred without wind, as if invisible hands were gently turning the pages of a book.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">His frame was slender as bamboo, his skin pale and cold, as if he had never seen sunlight. When refuting Tuo Kuahuang, his eyes were half-lidded, neither fully awake nor asleep, his pupils dilated like mist-shrouded pools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This was Lu Zhenshu, Peak Lord of Soaring Cloud Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">For a moment, many eyes turned toward Lu Zhenshu, each gaze carrying a peculiar glint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">At such assemblies, Lu Zhenshu rarely spoke, maintaining a low profile. However, considering Wen Ruanyu was a Confucian cultivator and Lu Zhenshu had always shown a fondness for Confucian cultivators, his current rebuttal seemed perfectly reasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Hmph! Benevolence and righteousness? Righteous bones? Mere womanly sentimentality!" Tuojianhuang's snort struck like thunder on a calm day, his gaze piercing Lu Zhenshu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Wen Ruanyu is merely a Golden Core cultivator. Even as a True Inheritor, does he dare defy our orders? This is utter defiance of heaven!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This was precisely what enraged Tuojianhuang the most.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">His temperament was crude and domineering. With a single command, countless pet beasts surged forth, drowning the enemy like a tidal wave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He had always made decisions with a single word and loathed subordinates who defied his authority.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Just then, another voice interjected: "Benevolence? Integrity?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The speaker's lips curled into a cold, amused smile. Though his voice was soft, it carried an uncanny penetrating force: "All these virtues are merely prices yet to be met."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"In my view, Wen Ruanyu is no stubborn stone, but a jade... awaiting the right price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"His so-called 'resistance' is simply waiting for our sect to offer a higher bid."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Even stubborn stones can nod for enough gold. How much more so Wen Ruanyu?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The speaker chuckled softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His face was as fair as jade, his eyes crinkling with a smile, like a refined scholar. This was Meng Wuyan, the Deputy Peak Lord of Purple Thunder Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Meng Wuyan shifted his tone: "However, this jade is not our only concern. Even if Wen Ruanyu yields, what about the band of Confucian scholars who always huddle together for warmth behind him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"These men," Meng Wuyan's voice darkened slightly, "hold only mid-level positions, yet they are like centipedes, their influence deeply entrenched! If we don't eradicate them now, they will become a festering sore that will eventually threaten our entire sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">This incident has enraged Hu Fei and his followers, driving them to unite in resistance. The daily operations of the peaks are likely to be thrown into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">His violet eyes suddenly sharpened, his voice losing all trace of gentleness as he spoke with deliberate emphasis: "Especially considering Elder Duanmu Zhang's involvement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"He hails from the Hua Zhang Kingdom and is one of its most renowned Confucian scholars. Originally, he intended to join the Flying Cloud Kingdom's bureaucracy. However, the previous Sect Leader repeatedly and sincerely invited him to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, eventually persuading him to accept."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"He is not merely a Confucian scholar; he is a symbol, a vital link connecting us to the Hua Zhang Kingdom! Offending him would not only shake the Confucian foundations within our sect but could also alter the Hua Zhang Kingdom's stance toward us..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Meng Wuyan's words hung in the air, silencing the assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">They all understood the need for caution when dealing with Confucian cultivators, especially a scholar of Duanmu Zhang's stature. A single misstep could trigger catastrophic consequences, negatively impacting the Myriad Manifestations Sect's overall strategic position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In this tense atmosphere, Qianjue Sword, the current Peak Lord of Sword's Cry Peak, suddenly spoke: "While our sect's Confucian cultivators are tightly united..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"...but it's not without its weaknesses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Have you forgotten... deep within Cloud Prison lies a prisoner named Qin De?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"This man has long been nailed to the Confucian Sect's pillar of shame. Seizing control of this 'ape' means seizing control of Duanmu Zhang's - and the entire Confucian cultivator community's - most vulnerable nerve!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"By exploiting Qin De, we can manipulate the Sect's Confucian cultivators, crush their arrogance, and achieve significant gains. We might even force Duanmu Zhang to bow his head and cooperate with us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ling Juejian, appearing as a middle-aged man, was as lean and sharp as a sword. Though seated, his spine remained ramrod straight, as if poised to pierce the heavens. His prominent brow ridge shadowed deep-set eyes that burned with ambition and scrutiny like icy stars. His thin lips were pressed into a taut line, radiating cold ruthlessness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">As a Sword Cultivator, his words and actions were consistent: he approached problems with a sharp, unconventional edge, striking directly at his enemies' weaknesses with ruthless precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Meng Wuyan fell into deep thought, while Tuojianhuang roared in fury, "Enough, enough! This roundabout nonsense! You're all just babbling like old women! My head's about to explode!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">With a sweeping gesture of his massive hand, as if to dispel all their schemes, Tuo Kuahuang unleashed a torrent of oppressive Qi: "Deal with Wen Ruanyu? Crush a bunch of pedantic scholars? And then go to Cloud Prison to fish out a rotten Demonic Confucian as a bargaining chip? When have I, Tuo Kuahuang, ever been so fussy about getting things done?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"How much time will this take?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Let me be frank with you all: my clan elder's grand birthday is fast approaching! White Paper Immortal City would make the perfect celebratory gift. I, Tuo Kuahuang, will seize this Immortal City before the Flying Cloud Assembly concludes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He paused deliberately, his massive head tilting back, his fleshy face scanning the assembly: "Any objections?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Silence descended once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Patriarch Tuojian, one of the foundational pillars of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, was a Soul Formation-level powerhouse. His sheer individual combat prowess could sway the fate of an entire Cultivation Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Clap, clap, clap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">A series of crisp, resonant claps shattered the oppressive silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Peak Lord Wang Wu of Danxia Peak, his Cloud Body Avatar seated serenely atop a cloud, applauded in admiration: "Peak Lord Tuoba's decisive action and overwhelming Qi are truly awe-inspiring!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Devour Mountains and Rivers! Ancestor Tuoba is the Myriad Phenomena Heaven-Supporting Jade Pillar of our sect. His grand birthday celebration deserves a grand tribute like the White Paper Immortal City, a gift befitting our sect's formidable prestige!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Moreover, by seizing this opportunity during the globally renowned Flying Cloud Assembly, we can claim the city under our banner - killing two birds with one stone! This will spread our sect's name across the four wilds and eight wastelands! Such ambition and strategic vision deserve the full support of Danxia Peak!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">These flattering words instantly erased the anger from Tuojianhuang's face. He couldn't help but subtly raise his chin, his crimson eyes gleaming with satisfaction as he gave Wang Wu a slight nod of approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Wang Wu's smile remained unwavering, but his tone shifted, like a furnace opening to reveal a new opportunity: "However..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"The White Paper Immortal City lies in the Ghostly Black Marshlands, precisely at the border between the Soaring Cloud and Northwind Kingdoms. This serves as a tacit buffer zone, a delicate balance maintained by unspoken agreement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"If our sect openly seizes the city by force, brazenly violating this unspoken agreement... the Northwind Kingdom's formidable wolf cavalry will immediately raise the banner of 'Defending Righteousness and Restoring Justice,' and a hundred thousand Profound Armor troops will trample the marshlands! At that point, our sect would face the full might of an entire kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Even if Northwind holds back its troops, what remains of the Flying Cloud Royal Family's dignity? Zhuang Nan, sanctions, and even blockades of our sect's trade routes and spiritual veins..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Wang Wo glanced at Tuo Kuahuang, whose face had darkened to the color of iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Wang Lei's voice was gentle yet carried the weight of a thousand mountains: "The Ancestor's birthday is hardly an auspicious time for war and bloodshed, nor is it an opportune moment to make enemies of the entire world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Wang Rong truly lived up to his reputation as the Peak Lord of Danxia Peak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Just moments ago, Tuoba Huang had used his own Soul Formation Stage Ancestor to exert pressure. Now, Wang Rong's words had turned the tables, using Ancestor Tuoba against Tuoba Huang himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Tuojianhuang's throat bobbed, his body radiating fiery Qi, yet he had no retort. Only a stifled, heavy snort echoed through the clouds, the reverberations rippling through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Wang Rong's smile remained as gentle as a spring breeze as he surveyed the assembly. "Why seek to seize White Paper Immortal City by encircling its walls? It would be far simpler to strike directly at its central gate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">His voice rang clear as a mountain stream, washing through the clouds as he articulated his strategy: "The true crux of this situation lies not in Wen Ruanyu's stubbornness, but in the elimination of Hall Master Zhong Dao of Zhu Na Hall!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Zhong Dao?" The crowd murmured in confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Meng Wuyan was the first to react, his eerie purple eyes flashing with sudden insight, like a bolt of dark purple lightning illuminating the night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Wen Ruanyu's soft jade bones are bound by Duanmu Zhang's authority; Feng De's virtuous body is imprisoned in the Cloud Prison! Where these two lines intersect, the key lies within Zhu Na Hall!" Wang Rong's words quickened, falling like pearls onto a jade plate, each syllable precise and logical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"At this very moment, Yang Sanyan and Cai Dai are persuading Zhong Heng within the White Paper Immortal City. If we convince Zhong Heng, Yang Sanyan, as a key figure in Zhu Na Hall, can immediately serve as our vanguard, intervening in the city's affairs!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Feng De, the 'shame of the Confucian Sect,' can also become a sharp blade in our hands, hanging over the heads of Duanmu Zhang and the Confucian scholars. Knowing their deep-seated concerns, how could Wen Ruanyu possibly refuse to yield?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Wang Rong concluded, "With Lord Zhong's support, we now have Yang Sanyan as our blade and Wen Ruanyu as our driving force. The fate of the White Paper Immortal City is sealed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He finished speaking, offering a slight bow. His cloud robes shimmered with crimson light, his demeanor calm and composed, perfectly embodying his keen judgment of character and the profound wisdom of a peak lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Silence settled over the sea of clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Though Wang Rong built upon the foundations laid by his predecessors, his strategy truly cut through the fog like a clear wind, revealing even the most intricate details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Deep within Ling Juejian's icy, frost-like eyes, a faint flicker of approval flashed, almost imperceptible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Wei Ji sat upright at the head of the table, his body beneath the coarse hemp Daoist robes as steady as a mountain. His pure black pupils turned toward Wang Rong, his voice remaining calm and even: "Peak Master Wang's strategy is mature and prudent, moving only after careful deliberation. Peak Lords, do any of you have objections?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">His words struck the assembly like a stone dropped into a deep pool, sending ripples through the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"I second the motion," Ling Juejian declared, his voice as cold as ever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Tuoba Huang's expression shifted erratically before he finally let out a heavy, fiery snort through his nostrils: "Hmph!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Though filled with resentment, he knew Wang Rong's words had struck at the heart of the matter. With the Ancestor's birthday celebration taking precedence, he had no choice but to grudgingly concede: "Then let it be done swiftly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">His burning gaze locked onto Wang Rong, the unspoken meaning clear: If this plan succeeds, the credit will be yours; if it fails, Danxia Peak will bear the full responsibility!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Wang Rong nodded with a smile, radiating an air of unwavering confidence, seemingly oblivious to the threat in Tuoba Huang's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The assembled gazes swept across the room, deliberately avoiding Meng Wuyan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The deputy peak lord of Purple Thunder Peak, a Demon Cultivator by birth, was openly scorned by the assembled cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">All eyes turned to Lu Zhenshu, the Peak Lord of Soaring Cloud Peak. His eyelids drooped, one hand holding a Jade Slip while the other propped up his head, as if half-asleep, half-awake, his spirit wandering beyond the mortal realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Peak Lord Lu?" Wei Ji's voice carried a hint of barely concealed exasperation. "Please put down your book."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Huh?" Lu Zhenshu started awake, lifting his head in confusion. "Have you all... already reached a consensus?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">After Wei Ji explained the situation, Lu Zhenshu waved his hand, his demeanor as carefree as a cloud drifting across the sky. "Excellent, excellent. Then let's proceed with this plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">With his agreement secured, the assembly's attention shifted to another figure: Xian Zifang, the Hundred Herbs Peak Master. She had participated in the entire discussion but remained silent throughout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Her beauty was delicate and understated, her eyes lowered, her expression as pale as early cherry blossoms. Her heterochromatic eyes were striking: the left eye, deep and still like ancient leaves in a pond; the right eye, shimmering with amber-honeyed light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sensing the collective gaze, she finally raised her eyelids, her voice clear and ethereal, like mountain spring water cascading through the Void. "Hundred Herbs Peak concerns itself only with the flourishing or withering of spiritual plants, not with the affairs of Immortal Cities. Peak Lords, please proceed as you see fit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Wei Ji's gaze swept over the now unanimous assembly. He tapped his knuckles lightly against the Jade Ruler he held, producing a low, decisive tone. "In that case, we shall follow Peak Master Wang's strategy and focus on Zhong Dao. Summon Hall Master Zhu Na to the formation for deliberation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Before his words could fully settle, someone suddenly called out, "Wait!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
