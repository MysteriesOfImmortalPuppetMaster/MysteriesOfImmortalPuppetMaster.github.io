<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 273: Ning Zhuo, You Must Stand Up</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Brother Zheng Jian, wishing you a triumphant journey ahead!" "Congratulations on entering the Medical Pavilion and being promoted to the position of medical officer!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Young Master, that Ning Zhuo merely took the lead. With your talent, you will surely surpass him and become the foremost in the Medical Pavilion." Zheng Jian waved as he walked, his spirit soaring, full of vigor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, he slowly entered the Medical Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The doors of the Medical Pavilion automatically closed behind him, shutting out the bustling world outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Zheng Jian surveyed his surroundings, observing the rows of medical case tables and the many rooms upstairs, taking a deep breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He first chose to take a tour, discovering that although he could go upstairs, many rooms were inaccessible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"The position of medical officer is ultimately the lowest tier in the Medical Pavilion. I have a long way to go before I can take charge here." Zheng Jian attempted to take on tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He was pleasantly surprised to find that after obtaining the position of medical officer, his task list had expanded at least threefold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Many tasks are brand new, ones I've never encountered before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"The rewards for these new tasks are clearly a notch higher than those outside." The joy in his heart quickly dissipated, and soon, his eyes lowered, revealing a glint of determination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He thought of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Ning Zhuo became a medical officer in the Medical Pavilion before me. He has had access to these tasks much earlier than I have." "Fortunately, he has been absent for two days now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"This is my best chance to surpass him! If I miss this opportunity, there might not be another one as good." Zheng Jian regarded Ning Zhuo as his greatest rival, harboring deep animosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This was because, after urgent discussions, the Zheng family had thoroughly analyzed the mechanical structures within the Lava Immortal Palace, deliberated on all positions, and decided to prioritize the Medical Pavilion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Zheng family's decision was conveyed to the Zheng family reformation team, with Zheng Jian, being the most outstanding among them, naturally taking on the most crucial taskâ€”to surpass Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Lava Immortal Palace Outer Map.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">This was the area where battles frequently erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">A battlefield ruin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Eight Mechanical Night Sky Bats circled above, surveying the ruins from above, scanning the entire area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Two geniuses from the Zhou family stood amidst the ruins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">While controlling the Night Sky Bats, they conversed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zhou Zeshen wore a worried expression: "Since the incident at the Historical Records Pavilion and Ning Xiaohui's mishap, the scarlet flame beasts have broken through the light barrier and invaded the Immortal Palace more frequently. In my opinion, the golden light barrier is much weaker than before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zhou Zhu was unconcerned: "Isn't that better? The more the scarlet flame beasts rampage and destroy the mechanical structures, the more opportunities we have to repair them." "This is precisely our area of expertise. Repairing a mechanical structure earns us far more merit than other tasks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zhou Zeshen slowly shook his head, his worry unabated: "Under a toppled nest, no egg remains intact. If the Lava Immortal Palace continues to exist, that's fine. But if it's destroyed by the beast tide, all our plans will come to naught!" Zhou Zhu was more optimistic, immediately expressing his confidence in his family and Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Zhou Zeshen: "The full extent of the beast tide has yet to be seen. Every day, a large number of beasts die, yet the tide remains unending." "The key is that the Nascent Soul-level beasts have yet to reveal themselves." "Moreover, the Void Sect poses a greater threat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"This evil sect's influence extends across multiple nations. The key is that their sect's location has never been exposed. Some even speculate that this sect deliberately does not establish a sect location." "So, compared to them, sects like the Soul Devouring Sect, which have a clear territory, are actually easier to deal with." As they spoke, the two gradually retracted the Night Sky Bats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">They both closed their eyes, receiving the information transmitted by the Night Sky Bats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Subsequently, Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu squatted on the ground, extending their fingers to draw lines infused with mana, straight and precise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The lines sketched a simple outline of the ruins on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The two discussed the repair plan, one word at a time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The plan not only aimed to restore the former mechanical structures but also added many offensive and defensive mechanical constructs to the buildings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This wasn't their first time repairing; they already had experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">They knew that such enhanced restoration would earn them more merit afterward!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Of course, doing so required them to invest a lot of resources, including materials and manpower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Zhou family fully supported them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Like the other two families, the Zhou family was also striving to secure positions within the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Not long after, Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu stood up simultaneously and began their work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">They first released a dozen Ground Drilling Mice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Ground Drilling Mice spun their spiral drills, burrowing into the ruins, severing the building's foundation and investigating the situation beneath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Afterward, Zhou Zeshen released the White Tiger Assault Chariot, while Zhou Zhu took out the Azure Dragon Crane Arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The White Tiger Assault Chariot had previously appeared during a spar between Zhou Zeshen and Ning Zhuo. Its appearance was lifelike, with four strong and powerful legs, seemingly ready to leap at any moment. The chariot's body was a large expanse of silver-white, reflecting a cold metallic gleam. The White Tiger's eyes were made of crystal, capable of emitting light to see through the enemy's illusions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Azure Dragon Crane Arm, when taken out, was in a coiled form. Once unfolded, the bronze dragon scales were tightly knit, with the dragon's spine prominently raised, appearing very robust and powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The White Tiger Assault Chariot's tiger head retracted, withdrawing into the body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhou Zhu inserted the Azure Dragon's tail into the hollow at the White Tiger's neck, firmly securing the two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The dragon's spine stiffened, the dragon's head raised high, as if ready to soar into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Under the joint efforts of the two Zhou family geniuses, the White Tiger Assault Chariot leaped forward, directly jumping into the house ruins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Azure Dragon Crane Arm began its operation, striking everywhere, as agile as a dragon or snake. The dragon's mouth opened wide, grabbing broken wooden beams and tossing them aside. Sometimes, when encountering particularly hard objects, the dragon's mouth would chew forcefully, crushing the debris for easier cleanup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">With such targeted mechanical constructs, the ruins were quickly cleared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu then meticulously cleaned the area before starting the reconstruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Having once studied at the Mudflow Sect, they were very skilled in such construction, earning considerable merit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">While controlling various types of mechanical constructs, they still had the leisure to chat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">They talked about Ning Zhuo, knowing that he hadn't appeared publicly for two days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">They speculated that Ning Zhuo might have voluntarily defected, fearing retribution from the Void Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After all, Ning Xiaohui's death was still fresh in their minds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhou Zeshen looked toward the direction of the Medical Pavilion: "In this case, Zheng Jian has an opportunity." "The position in the Medical Pavilion is quite important. It not only repairs mechanical constructs but also heals people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"If Zheng Jian gains a foothold and the Zheng family gains control of the Medical Pavilion, then in the future, the status of the Zheng family in Fire Persimmon Immortal City will be greatly elevated." "Ning Zhuo... when will you stand up?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhou Zeshen had always had a good impression of Ning Zhuo, believing him to be a thinker like himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">From the perspective of family interests, Zhou Zeshen also hoped that Ning Zhuo could defend the interests of the Medical Pavilion and block Zheng Jian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After all, the Zheng family was only second to the Zhou family. If the Zheng family controlled the Medical Pavilion, it would undoubtedly cause a severe impact on the Zhou family's status!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">For both public and private reasons, Zhou Zeshen hoped that Ning Zhuo would step forward at this critical moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Jiufan also hoped that Ning Zhuo would step forward!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Two days had passed since the new strategic directive was issued, but he found that Ning Zhuo remained in his room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He was either cultivating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique or studying mechanical texts, or reviewing the talisman insights gifted by Ning Jiufan, showing no signs of leaving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Jiufan summoned Ning Zhuo: "A snake cannot function without a head. As the leader of the reformation team, you are highly respected. Why do you remain indoors all day?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"At this moment, both the Zhou and Zheng families are doing their utmost to secure various positions. Our Ning family's momentum is being suppressed, and we urgently need a leader to boost morale and lead the family forward." Ning Zhuo replied, "Ancestor, it's too dangerous for me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"My situation is different from Zheng Jian, Zhou Zeshen, and Zhou Zhu. I once collaborated with the Void Sect. Now that I've defected, they must hate me and will surely try to assassinate or ambush me, seeking my life." "If I'm not careful, I'll end up like Ning Xiaohui!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"So, to be safe, I'd rather stay by your side."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I am the only one in the Qi Refining Stage with talent in our Ning family. If I die, the family's loss would be too great!" Ning Jiufan was so angry that he blew his beard and glared, scolding Ning Zhuo for being cowardly and lacking the Ning family spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo lowered his head and shrugged, looking helpless: "Ancestor, scold me if it makes you feel better. You can scold me for ten days or half a month if it helps." Ning Jiufan was taken aback, having never seen such a shameless person among the Ning family juniors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">For a moment, he didn't know what to say or how to scold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">After a brief silence, Ning Jiufan looked at Ning Zhuo, who was as indifferent as a dead pig not fearing boiling water, and said helplessly, "Tell me, what do you want to be motivated and bring glory to our Ning family?" Ning Zhuo replied bitterly, "Ancestor, it's not that I don't want to contribute to the family. I'm worried about my safety. The talismans you gave me don't provide enough security."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"I once received a directional Void Traversing Talisman from the family. This talisman allows me to teleport quickly in times of crisis."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"I think if Ning Xiaohui had this talisman, she wouldn't have sacrificed herself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Jiufan shook his head slightly: "You have a good imagination, but even for us golden core cultivators, it's difficult to traverse the void within the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"There are restrictions within the Lava Immortal Palace, making void traversal techniques extremely difficult to execute."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Saying this, Ning Jiufan stroked his beard: "How about this, I'll give you a spirit talisman. It will protect you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up, and he immediately bowed deeply: "Thank you, Ancestor, for the talisman." Ning Jiufan glared, thinking, "Who said I was going to give it to you?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
