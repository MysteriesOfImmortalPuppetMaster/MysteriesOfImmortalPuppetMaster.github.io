<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 365: You Are My Ideal</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The tree-lined path was full of lush greenery. Lin Shanshan had already lifted her disguise, now dressed in a light yellow skirt. She walked with the grace of a swallow, her skirt fluttering in the breeze, revealing her joyful mood. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">At this moment, sunlight filtered through the gaps between the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground. A gentle breeze caressed her face, the air was filled with the fragrance of flowers, the freshness of soil, and the rustling of leaves, all adding a light rhythm to Lin Shanshan’s cheerful heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Ning Zhuo, you won beautifully this time!” She was genuinely happy for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">All her life, Lin Shanshan had been the eldest daughter of the Myriad Medicine Sect's leader. From birth, this identity granted her excellent treatment, surrounded by people who loved, indulged, and tolerated her. Unlike Ning Zhuo, she had never fought a real battle with anyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Lin Shanshan had trained well and even challenged her fellow sect brothers several times when she was younger, but she stopped after maturing. She understood that her identity carried significant weight, and any impulsive action could be misinterpreted, causing harm to the sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Life often requires trade-offs; enjoying the privileges of being the sect's eldest daughter meant also bearing its responsibilities. Her youth, like a little bird, was both nurtured and confined by the Myriad Medicine Sect. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Lin Shanshan always had to put the sect's interests first, mindful of her status and careful not to cross any boundaries that could cause trouble. So, when Ning Zhuo won, her joy was genuine—his actions fulfilled a deep yearning in her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">From their first meeting, she had a good impression of Ning Zhuo. His background mirrored hers, making it easy for her to relate. Perhaps, deep down, she didn’t fully understand her own feelings—she too longed to live like Ning Zhuo, adventuring far from home, experiencing the world firsthand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This was why she had been worried about him facing a formidable opponent. It was also why she admired his efforts and intelligence. She felt her support for Ning Zhuo was justified when she saw his visible growth, and his victory brought her more joy than if she had won herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After all, she knew she had played a part in his success. Lin Shanshan might never have the chance to fight with such freedom, without the compromises and indulgences that came with her position. In many ways, Ning Zhuo's appearance and actions satisfied her innermost desires.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Her bright eyes turned to Ning Zhuo, thoughtfully offering, “Among the external cultivators here, the strongest are Lai Wuying and Zhao Xingchen—they’re in the top tier.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“The second tier includes people like Chang Yan and Luo Xiao.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Ning Zhuo, with your victory over Chang Yan, you can now move into one of the top ten residences. Achieving this with only early-stage Foundation Establishment is rare.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo smiled and shook his head slightly, “I’m still far from being there. This victory came quickly only because I used the right strategy, striking early and using the advantage of wood overpowering earth.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“Strictly speaking, demon cultivators usually have much more spiritual power than human cultivators of the same level. My cultivation is much weaker than Chang Yan’s. It was only because I seized the initiative and used three powerful wood-element spells that I was able to seize the advantage and ultimately snag the victory. Without your help in acquiring those wood-element cultivation diagrams, I wouldn’t have won.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Behind the scenes you’re the true hero behind my win.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in gratitude toward Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Lin Shanshan chuckled lightly and accepted his thanks graciously, “Ning Zhuo, we share a similar background. Even without my help, you would’ve had your own means to win.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“You also missed one important reason for your success—your cultivation technique. The five-element spells can not only separate and merge freely but also interact to enhance the total amount several times over.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo smiled, “The Five Elements Qi Law is one of the top three techniques of the three sects.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Lin Shanshan's eyes lit up with admiration. “I’ve heard of the Master of the Three Sects. He was quite capable, on the Void Refining level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">As they walked together, Ning Zhuo’s tone became serious, “Though this victory was decisive, it has resulted in several hidden dangers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“If I had won after a long and difficult fight, allowing Chang Yan to fully display his strength, I would’ve gained wider recognition. Now, having gained one of the top ten residences, I’m likely to draw envy and could be challenged by others.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“After all, I publicly stated that if I use my Oil Slick Water Talisman, it would mean I was surrendering. That might give others the impression that I’m vulnerable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Hearing this, Lin Shanshan was momentarily stunned but nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">She couldn't help but study the white-robed boy before her, amazed at his maturity. Ning Zhuo was only sixteen, yet so calm and composed. At such a young age, after achieving victory, most would be tempted to revel in their success. But he was more clear-headed than even she was, with a deep understanding of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Despite being five years older, Lin Shanshan found herself overwhelmed by the joy of his victory, while Ning Zhuo remained grounded and prudent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Feeling a bit conflicted, Lin Shanshan realized that in this moment, she sensed a sense of security from Ning Zhuo—something stable and dependable, almost like her own father.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sensing the right atmosphere, Ning Zhuo gently brought up a favor he needed from her, though he knew it might be a difficult request.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Having developed a lot of goodwill toward Ning Zhuo, Lin Shanshan's eyes flashed slightly, and she hesitated only briefly before responding, “When it comes to sect matters, I have no authority, but anything else—please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo quickly reassured her, “Don’t worry, Miss Lin. I won’t ask for anything unreasonable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Seeing her listening intently, he continued, “I’ve been traveling far from home, and during my journey, I passed through Cloud Concealment Mountain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Lin Shanshan nodded slightly, “You mentioned that before. The Misty Orchid you gave me came from Cloud Concealment Mountain, didn’t it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo smiled and continued, “Yes, while there, I had a fortuitous encounter and gained the favor of the mountain god. Before I left, this god gifted me a rare spiritual plant.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“The mountain god asked that I cultivate it privately and take good care of it without letting anyone else know.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Plant cultivation is a vast field, and I have little knowledge of it. Handling a Golden Core-level spiritual plant right from the start is beyond my ability.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Now, the plant is showing signs of withering, and I’m truly at a loss.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Golden Core-level spiritual plants?!” Lin Shanshan was amazed, finding Ning Zhuo’s free-spirited travels increasingly appealing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Resisting her curiosity, she said, “So, Ning Zhuo, you came to our sect for guidance on this matter?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo nodded, “That’s one of the reasons. Your sect is renowned for cultivating countless medicinal herbs and has a thriving herbal business. If I can’t find help here, I doubt there’s anywhere else in the entire Southern Bean Nation that could assist.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Lin Shanshan smiled at his praise but after thinking for a while, her brow furrowed slightly, “This is indeed a tricky situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“If the mountain god entrusted you to cultivate it privately, there must be some deeper meaning behind it. You’ll likely have to personally endure the challenge and learn cultivation techniques for spiritual plants.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“The key lies in the fact that each spiritual plant requires different methods of cultivation. Even for the same species, there can be regional differences.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“If you recklessly apply the wrong technique, it could harm the plant rather than help it grow.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, “I’ve thought about it, and I suspect this might be the mountain god’s way of testing me. Since I swore not to reveal any details about the plant, I can’t seek direct guidance from you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He knew how precious the Lingyin Willow was. This spiritual plant could greatly assist cultivators in their training, making it a priceless treasure. For any organization or sect, a Golden Core-level spiritual plant like this was more valuable than most offensive magical artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">When Ning Zhuo first obtained the Lingyin Willow, he had realized its immense value. Apart from him only the mountain god and Sun Lingtong knew about it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
