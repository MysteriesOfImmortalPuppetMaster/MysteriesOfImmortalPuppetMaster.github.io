<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">This was truly rare!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Sun Lingtong, determined not to return empty-handed, had thoroughly studied countless texts and secretly mastered the black market. Through practical application and extensive observation, he had become familiar with most materials from both the living world and the Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Yet these treasures were entirely beyond his knowledge, completely unfamiliar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Zeng Jide noticed Sun Lingtong's puzzled and eager expression. Clasping his hands behind his back, he strolled leisurely over to the shelves. "This repository," he said, "is the very essence of Forgetful River Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"The Forgetful River is the most renowned river in the Underworld. As souls fall into its waters, they gradually shed their memories and emotions. Freed from this burden, the souls grow lighter and lighter until they float to the surface and finally wash ashore."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"The souls that reach the shore are completely memoryless, like newborn infants, bewildered yet curious about everything."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"That's why some call the Forgetful River the River of Purgation or the River of Rebirth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">After this explanation, Zeng Jide brought the conversation back to the topic at hand. "All these treasures originate from the Forgetful River and are unique to this region. You wouldn't have encountered them elsewhere."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"So, it's no surprise you don't recognize them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Take this, for example. It's called Grieving Silk Entwined Heart Lotus."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sun Lingtong glanced over and saw a pile of lotus root segments, each about half a foot long and uniformly withered, as if dead. The surface of each root was covered in countless translucent, grayish-white threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Upon closer inspection, he realized these threads were writhing and intertwining on their own, emitting a mournful aura that made his chest tighten and filled him with an urge to weep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Zeng Jide pointed to another area. "This is Wrathful Fire Glazed Crystal. It's similar to the Grieving Silk Entwined Heart Lotus, formed at the bottom of the Forgetful River by the accumulation of countless angry and resentful thoughts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sun Lingtong took a few steps forward and saw the precious material Zeng Jide was pointing at. His eyes stung as if pricked by a needle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It was a fist-sized, irregularly shaped crystal, completely crimson like blood. Within it, flames seemed to burn and leap, emitting faint crackling sounds while radiating a violent, destructive fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Next, Zeng Jide introduced the Fearful Soul Cold Crystal, Resentful Poisonous Miasma Flower, and Obsessive Iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Fearful Soul Cold Crystal was a blue prismatic crystal that emitted a chilling, panic-inducing aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Resentful Poisonous Miasma Flower had petals as dark as ink, layered upon each other, while its stamen was an eerie purple-red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Obsessive Iron appeared unremarkable, simply a series of pitch-black, heavy iron blocks. If placed before Sun Lingtong, he would have mistaken them for ordinary iron. Yet these blocks were extraordinarily dense, serving as the core material for crafting top-tier defensive magic treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zeng Jide paused before a shelf, his eyes gleaming with interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Oh?" he said in a tone of surprise. "There's actually Innocent's Tear Gold here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The gold, liquid-like, was contained in a bowl. Pure and flawless, it emitted an aura of extreme warmth, attachment, and hope, reminiscent of the first rays of dawn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"This is the purest soul's tears, shed from the most genuine heart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Normally, such souls are rare. But the River of Oblivion can thoroughly cleanse souls, rejuvenating them as if reborn, significantly increasing the chances of obtaining this substance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong's eyes widened in amazement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zeng Jide finally stopped at the deepest shelf, his gaze fixed. "Found it," he said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"This is the target of my theft—the River of Oblivion Vortex Eye."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Vortex Eye?" Sun Lingtong knew what that was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">When any flowing substance forms a persistent vortex over time, a spherical "eye" can form at its center. This is what is known as a Vortex Eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zeng Jide explained, "You know about vortex eyes, but these are different. They formed within the River of Oblivion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"You must understand that the River of Oblivion embodies the principle of forgetting, capable of erasing emotions and memories. Every drop of its water possesses this power and can be considered a precious material—this is no trivial matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The items on the previous shelves were merely accumulations of countless emotions. But these River of Oblivion Vortex Eyes were nurtured by the river itself. They exist on a completely different level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"The River of Oblivion is a great river of precious materials. Precious materials nurtured within it develop intricate principles and harmonious unity, often becoming natural magic artifacts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up involuntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He had long heard of natural magic artifacts, but they had remained mere concepts on paper or legends recounted by others. Now, he was finally seeing one in the flesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zeng Jide stood before the River of Oblivion Vortex Eyes and rapidly formed a series of finger seals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">With each touch of his fingertips, the thinnest of ripples spread across the light membrane covering the space between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Mystical talismans materialized one after another, only to fade away soundlessly, as if their locks had been pried open by the most precise tool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">After ten breaths, a gap appeared in the light membrane. The talismans at its edges twisted and flickered, yet failed to trigger any alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zeng Jide reached into the breach and effortlessly retrieved several River of Oblivion Vortex Eyes, bringing them out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He examined the vortex eyes carefully and discovered that only one was of the highest quality, naturally forming a Magic Artifact. The others fell short of reaching that standard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zeng Jide gazed at the vortex eyes on his fingertips. "With this, the purpose of my journey is fulfilled."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lingtong blinked in surprise. "Ah? Senior, you traveled thousands of miles to Forgetful River Immortal City and risked so much, just to steal this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zeng Jide nodded, then shook his head. "Whenever I commit a theft, I openly send a challenge letter, stating my intention to visit a certain place and steal a certain item. This time was no exception. My challenge letter to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord explicitly named the River of Oblivion Vortex Eye as my target."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Lingtong's pupils widened in astonishment. "Your... unique approach to theft... is truly one of a kind!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zeng Jide chuckled. "I sense you're looking at me like I'm a fool."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Sun Lingtong rested his hands behind his head, chuckling. "Heh heh, I'd never pull off something so foolish. Why work so hard for no reward? If I'm stealing, I'd do it carefully, making sure no one notices."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Hearing his actions described as foolish, Zeng Jide found Sun Lingtong even more appealing. "You cheeky brat, you're not holding back, are you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Heh, I won't hide it. I've pulled off these 'foolish' stunts plenty of times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Every successful theft dramatically improves my Theft Path Methods! Do you think I'd risk such attention without substantial rewards?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong's eyes widened again. This was his first time hearing of such a cultivation method. "Theft Path Methods are a type of spell," he said incredulously. "Apart from advancing in realm and diligent practice, are there really shortcuts to cultivation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Oh, there are, Little Ghost," Zeng Jide replied. "I've studied Buddhist scriptures and cultivated Buddhist Sect arts, mastering the Vow Art: making vows, fulfilling them, and repaying them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Every time I send a formal letter of introduction, I'm making a vow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"When the theft is successful, that's fulfilling the vow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"And finally, repaying the vow: every technique I used during the theft undergoes a rapid enhancement!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"This method of cultivation is far more efficient than my arduous practice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong's eyes widened in enlightenment. "The Buddhist path of cultivation... it has techniques like this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zeng Jide stroked his beard with a knowing smile. "The hundred arts, thousand schools, and myriad methods of cultivation are all fundamentally paths to self-cultivation. Whatever proves useful to you, you should embrace and utilize."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Who cares if it's from the Buddhist or Demonic Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"A cultivator should be like the vast ocean, accepting all rivers, adaptable and flexible, transforming everything for personal use. Absolutely not be bound by rigid dogma."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sun Lingtong nodded vigorously, taking these words to heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Having secured all the River of Oblivion Vortex Eyes and achieved his primary objective, Zeng Jide didn't immediately depart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Since you're already here, Senior, why not take a few more treasures?" Sun Lingtong suggested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Zeng Jide nodded solemnly. "Indeed, these treasures are fated to be mine. In Buddhist cultivation, we emphasize both aspiration and karmic connection."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">With swift movements, he swept up all the precious materials from the shelves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Hmm? There's a hidden chamber here!" Zeng Jide exclaimed, making an unexpected discovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He consecutively unleashed several Theft Path Methods before finally prying open the hidden chamber's door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The chamber was small, housing only three treasures: a single drop of Innocent True Dew, Seven Emotions Ember Jade, and Void Awareness Moon Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">It floated at the center of the jade bottle. The dewdrop was crystal clear, seemingly nonexistent yet undeniably present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">It radiated a pure aura, transcending all existence, an "emptiness" that seemed capable of purifying all delusions and impurities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zeng Jide, his gaze complex, explained, "In extremely rare circumstances, the Forgetful River forms the Innocent Dao Field. The Innocent True Dew is the only treasure left behind after the field's natural dissolution."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"It can purify the Heart Demon, dispel illusions, and stabilize the Dao Heart. It's a sacred relic for cultivating supreme righteous cultivation arts and overcoming the Heart Demon Tribulation. A single drop would drive the greatest cultivators of both the righteous and evil paths to frenzied competition!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">There were seven pieces of Seven Emotions Ember Jade, each a different color and shaped like glazed jade. They naturally stacked together, forming a small, multicolored mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Seven Emotions Ember Jade!" Zeng Jide took a deep breath. "Joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hatred, and desire—the seven fundamental emotions, when accumulated to their peak and condensed under special conditions, form this jade! Each piece contains the primal power of an extreme emotion! They are supreme sacred relics for cultivating the Seven Emotions Demonic Art, and core materials for top-tier illusion arrays, emotion-based offensive or defensive magic treasures. Legend has it that collecting all seven can unleash the power of the seven fundamental emotions, granting boundless might and utility!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"This is the essence of profound emotion and genuine nature, refined and precipitated from countless fallen souls in the Forgetful River after countless ages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong immediately understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Many of the previous precious materials were also products of accumulated emotions. For example, the Grieving Silk Entwined Heart Lotus, Wrathful Fire Glazed Crystal, Fearful Soul Cold Crystal, Resentful Poisonous Miasma Flower, and Obsessive Iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Seven Emotions Ember Jade must be the pinnacle of these precious materials!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Void Awareness Moon Soul resembled a crescent moon sealed within ten-thousand-year profound ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The crescent moon exhibited a peculiar translucent blue, emitting a strange wave that seemed to trace the past and illuminate past lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Buddha said, 'The Four Greats are Void.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"This is the 'Void' essence condensed from the Forgetful River, containing the true meaning of 'Void Stillness.' It is a supreme treasure for cultivating top-tier 'Supreme Emotionless Path' and 'Nirvana Heart Sutra' cultivation arts, as well as an auxiliary wonder for crafting space-themed magic treasures or comprehending spatial laws. However, direct contact with it poses a tremendous danger of losing one's self and dissolving into nothingness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Legend has it that Yundao used this very object to burn himself down and create the Void Return Raft."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"It's said that the Void Awareness Moon Soul he used at the time was as large as a small mountain, an astonishing sight. It was likely the most accumulated and largest specimen of this type of precious material in the Forgetful River!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong was deeply moved. "That's an incredible coincidence! Just as Yunxiao was trying to save his Daoist partner, he encountered the Void Awareness Moon Soul, which happened to fulfill exactly the conditions he needed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Zeng Jide nodded slightly. "Indeed, there's another layer to the story of Yundao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"It's said that the Underworld Celestial Heavens, unwilling to see the Forgetful River become a forbidden zone, devised a method to cross it, allowing the souls of the Underworld to pass."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Thus, through the evolution of Qi Luck, they orchestrated the fates of the cultivators Yunxiao and Yueyi. In the end, Yunxiao sacrificed himself, giving rise to numerous Forgetful Crossings and Void Return Rafts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"This is the principle of Qi Luck."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sun Lingtong remained silent, but inwardly he thought: My journey to the Forgetful River Immortal City, my encounter with Zeng Jide, and his assistance—these too must be the result of the evolution of Qi Luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He asked Zeng Jide, "Old Zeng, I'm deeply fascinated by Qi Luck!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Would you... could you teach me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"I have a brilliant idea: to cultivate the Fate Arts alongside the Theft Path Methods, then fuse them to create a new form of theft."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"With this new method, I could directly steal Qi Luck. Then, every step I take might lead to treasure, my enemies would destroy each other, and I'd sail smoothly through life, blessed with wealth! Life would be too perfect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Hahaha." Zeng Jide burst into laughter, amused by the young man's audacity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He pointed a finger at Sun Lingtong's forehead from a distance. "You're dreaming, kid."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"I possess no methods of divination or Fate Arts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Even the esteemed Prefecture Lord of Forgetful River Prefecture lacks them. If he wants to divine, he must seek the Ash Bone Elder's assistance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"There's a secret behind this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sun Lingtong pressed, "What secret?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zeng Jide explained, "To obtain the Fate Arts and Divination Method, force won't work. It depends on following the will of heaven and accepting one's destiny!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Heaven must intend for you to have it, or such an arrangement will never come to pass."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Otherwise, the stronger an entity or power becomes, the less likely they are to acquire these methods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"This is because mastering these arts can easily lead to overbearing arrogance, becoming a stubborn affliction in the world, difficult to eliminate and threatening the natural cycle of birth, aging, sickness, and death."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Sun Lingtong frowned. "If that's the case, looking at it another way, the stronger an entity becomes, the less likely they are to obtain the Fate Arts and Divination Method?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Zeng Jide nodded. "That's right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"The 'strong' here also refers to those with great potential, like you. Though you may be weak now, as long as you continue to grow, you will inevitably become strong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Therefore, seeking methods of Qi Luck and Divination is practically impossible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">With a sigh, Zeng Jide continued, "I've already tried. If I possessed Divination methods, I could combine them with my Vow Art. Before submitting each application, I could divine the likelihood of success and any hidden risks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"My cultivation speed would undergo a complete transformation. Becoming a Sage of Thieves, whose name echoes through history, would be just around the corner."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"However, cultivators who obtain methods of Qi Luck or Divination often have weak Qi Luck themselves, or suffer frequent Calamities, plagued by numerous flaws and shortcomings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"As far as I know, Divination cultivators also place great emphasis on maintaining their own Qi Luck within a specific upper and lower limit. It's a matter of great precision."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
