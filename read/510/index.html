The drinking session between Ning Zhuo and Liu Er did not last long.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving, Liu Er patted Ning Zhuo on the shoulder: "Although I would like to persuade you, Military Advisor, to focus on the Three Generals Camp."<br/>
<br/>
Because Liu Er was in a hurry to go train the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
"But on second thought, I really don't have the qualifications to make such a suggestion."<br/>
<br/>
"We have come this far, all thanks to the Military Advisor."<br/>
<br/>
"Since Shuang Jing has no sincerity, I accept the Military Advisor's previous proposal!"<br/>
<br/>
"I just hope that in the future, we can also smoothly break away from the Red Flower Camp."<br/>
<br/>
To join, Mulan's consent is needed.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, if the Three Generals Camp wants to break away from the Red Flower Camp and establish its own identity in the future, Mulan's consent is also required, and it must be reported to the court, going through a series of procedures before it can succeed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "I will arrange this matter, I will go discuss it with General Mulan, we can sign a contract."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er laughed heartily: "A contract is not necessary. I trust you, Military Advisor."<br/>
<br/>
After saying this, he flew away from this place.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo watched Liu Er's back until he disappeared among the mountains, then he withdrew his gaze.<br/>
<br/>
"Liu Er, what an interesting person," he sent a telepathic message to Sun Lingtong, expressing his admiration.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, lying in the Mechanical Dragon, also overheard all of this. He lay on the seat, using his hand as a pillow: "Liu Er is indeed quite something."<br/>
<br/>
"What he said is moving, but be careful, Little Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"Before verifying what he said, it's better to remain skeptical."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong added: "His reaction in Shuang Jing's tent is also worth delving into."<br/>
<br/>
"I remember you once told me that you suspect ‚ÄîLiu Er has a means of detection, he knows the situation of the Three Generals Camp very well."<br/>
<br/>
"Do you think it's possible ‚Äîthat Liu Er just detected us in the inner room when he faced Shuang Jing?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "Boss, I have thought of all these things you mentioned."<br/>
<br/>
"I was just feeling emotional."<br/>
<br/>
"I do have doubts, but deep down, I want to believe that what he said is true!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was puzzled: "Ah, why is that?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes sparkled with a hint of excitement: "From my travels in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City until now, this is the first time I've met someone like him."<br/>
<br/>
"He has his own ambitions!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: "Wanting to establish a pure land free from exclusion? That is indeed a great ambition, but it might also be a castle in the air?"<br/>
<br/>
"This goal is really too big, although he has the cultivation of a Golden Core, it is far from enough to achieve this goal."<br/>
<br/>
"Even with the help of Guan Hong and Zhang Hei, it's the same."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "So, he is really interesting."<br/>
<br/>
"His ambition is so grand, achieving it is extremely difficult!"<br/>
<br/>
"Liu Er's strength is too weak compared to his ambition."<br/>
<br/>
"But his belief is so firm! I can feel that he himself deeply understands the difficulty of realizing his ambition. But he still goes forward without hesitation."<br/>
<br/>
"This kind of forward-moving attitude, willing to put everything into this matter, is truly admirable and enviable."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt even more strange: "If you say so, Little Zhuo, aren't you the same?"<br/>
<br/>
"To resurrect your mother, you started traveling the world at just the Foundation Establishment level, so recklessly."<br/>
<br/>
"You are much younger than Liu Er, so you are even more remarkable!"<br/>
<br/>
In Sun Lingtong's heart, how could Liu Er be compared to his own little brother.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: "It's different, it's different!"<br/>
<br/>
Today's drinking session greatly changed Ning Zhuo's impression of Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
From the beginning, Ning Zhuo just wanted to use Liu Guan Zhang to facilitate his mixing into the expeditionary army of Twin Rivers Country, to get to the front lines, to facilitate his capture of his mother's mechanical carriage.<br/>
<br/>
So, although Ning Zhuo funded Liu Guan Zhang multiple times, with increasing amounts, it was all part of his scheme.<br/>
<br/>
To say that he genuinely wanted to support Liu Guan Zhang, this intention was very small.<br/>
<br/>
After all, Ning Zhuo and Liu Guan Zhang's relationship was different. The latter three were sworn brothers, Ning Zhuo just happened to be there and took advantage of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Just like Mulan schemed against Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo also schemed against Liu Guan Zhang.<br/>
<br/>
But as they fought side by side, Ning Zhuo's camaraderie with the Three Generals deepened.<br/>
<br/>
Including the fact that Liu Er once disliked Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo also somewhat felt it. Ning Zhuo certainly wouldn't mind these things.<br/>
<br/>
From the recent conversation, Ning Zhuo could feel Liu Er's sincerity.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er's tragic experiences also resonated deeply with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er's mother sacrificed herself for him, which was no different from Ning Zhuo's mother's choice.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not ask Liu Er why he didn't try to resurrect his mother.<br/>
<br/>
Because the answer to this question was quite obvious ‚Äîthe sects near the mountain village, having set up so much, obviously wouldn't let the souls of the sacrificed fall into the underworld, leaving a loophole.<br/>
<br/>
So, Liu Er's mother had already been annihilated, with no basis for resurrection at all.<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps it is precisely because of this that Liu Er developed the ambition to create a pure land."<br/>
<br/>
"This ambition itself is a substitute for his inability to save his mother, a resistance to his own fate, dissatisfaction with the world, his unyielding cry, his angry roar!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel sympathy for Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
Resonance, sympathy, admiration, interest ‚Äîthese mixed emotions made Ning Zhuo feel an impulse.<br/>
<br/>
He told Sun Lingtong about his impulse: "Boss, you might not believe it, but compared to Mulan, I want to support Liu Er more."<br/>
<br/>
"I really want to fight alongside him, to witness his struggle and hard work."<br/>
<br/>
"I don't know why, his ambition makes my blood boil!"<br/>
<br/>
"Even though I am a pure human, not a half-demon."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shook his head repeatedly: "Little Zhuo, I feel like you're being foolish."<br/>
<br/>
"We funded Liu Guan Zhang just to increase the possibility of obtaining your mother's relics."<br/>
<br/>
"Do you want to follow Liu Er in his struggle?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shrugged: "I don't mind, this matter is definitely exciting."<br/>
<br/>
"But what about your mother?"<br/>
<br/>
This simple question was like a bucket of ice water poured over Ning Zhuo's head.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was silent for a moment, then smiled bitterly: "Boss, you're right."<br/>
<br/>
"I must save my mother first!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, then turned and hurried towards the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
On the way, Sun Lingtong suddenly said: "Be careful! There's a cultivator hiding ahead."<br/>
<br/>
While Ning Zhuo was walking outside, Sun Lingtong had been controlling the Mechanical Dragon, using its mechanisms to scout.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn't think, he directly retreated, quickly increasing the distance.<br/>
<br/>
The next second, he heard a familiar voice: "Oh? My One Leaf Obscuring Technique even fooled Meng Kui. Yet you easily saw through my concealment, not bad."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo retreated even faster!<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Lin Bufan revealed himself, taking out a token: "At such a young age, with such meticulous thoughts and experienced actions, not bad."<br/>
<br/>
"Little friend Ning, if you run again, the batch of Jade Steel Heavy Armor and the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence I have will be taken back."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing this, and confirming the token was correct, Ning Zhuo stopped.<br/>
<br/>
He happily ran back, cupping his hands in salute: "Sect Leader Lin, I didn't expect to see you at this time."<br/>
<br/>
"Great!"<br/>
<br/>
"What you brought is exactly what I need most right now."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan stroked his beard: "Of course. Du Tiechuan is indeed one of the few great generals of Twin Rivers Country, acting with such integrity that both sides have to follow his arrangements."<br/>
<br/>
"With this batch of Jade Steel Heavy Armor, after fully equipping the Red Flower Camp and the Three Generals Camp, there will still be some left."<br/>
<br/>
From his words, it was clear that Lin Bufan had a deep understanding of Ning Zhuo's situation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was not at all surprised.<br/>
<br/>
From the Thousand Medicines Sect that Lin Bufan managed, it was evident that he was meticulous and thorough in his actions. This time, since he came to deliver goods, he naturally had to hide in advance, investigate clearly, confirm everything, and then show himself.<br/>
<br/>
The two immediately proceeded with the handover.<br/>
<br/>
The Jade Steel Heavy Armor had a simple design, giving a sense of solidity. The surface of the armor emitted a jade-like luster, somewhere between cyan and black.<br/>
<br/>
The top of the helmet was slightly raised, the visor part slightly tilted forward, with fine talismans carved on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
The chest armor was wide, covering a large area, shaped like a shield. The back was relatively flat, with deflection arrays on both sides to ensure attacks from behind would be deflected and dispersed.<br/>
<br/>
The shoulder armor was large and thick, round in shape, covering the shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
The arm armor was designed to be flexible, with the joints between the armor plates tight.<br/>
<br/>
The heavy armor on the legs was engraved with three arrays, with effects of reducing weight, increasing agility, and helping cultivators recover stamina faster.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence, it was sealed in a medicine bottle.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo used his divine sense to penetrate it, and saw a small humanoid-shaped Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence sitting cross-legged, like a cultivator meditating.<br/>
<br/>
He exclaimed: "This Fire Essence has such strong spirituality!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan nodded: "Too many cultivators died in the Fire Persimmon Mountain, allowing this Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence to take advantage, absorbing the spirituality of the cultivators, thus becoming extremely dangerous."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered: "Senior, collecting this item must have involved a lot of risks, very difficult."<br/>
<br/>
"The Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence itself is already hard to deal with."<br/>
<br/>
"Not to mention, there's also the City Lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Meng Kui!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan: "You're right..."<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, he briefly narrated to Ning Zhuo how he helped Ning Jiu Fan and participated in the struggle for the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo bowed, sincerely thanking Lin Bufan.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan reached out, helping him up: "Little friend Ning, what you've done is not small either."<br/>
<br/>
"I really didn't expect that after arriving in Twin Rivers Country, you would become the son-in-law of the Grand Marshal's Mansion."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly, looking somewhat embarrassed: "The details still allow me to report in detail."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan had also heard a lot, but he didn't know more about the inside story, and was indeed curious.<br/>
<br/>
After hearing Ning Zhuo's narration, he digested it for a moment, then stroked his beard and sighed: "Little friend Ning, you have extraordinary luck. Such coincidences and mishaps have instead made you the biggest beneficiary."<br/>
<br/>
"In my opinion, you might as well stay in Twin Rivers Country, in Grand Marshal Mu's Mansion, and solidify your identity for a while."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan was quite happy to hear this news.<br/>
<br/>
He knew that his daughter Lin Shanshan had a good impression of Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
But as a father, Lin Bufan preferred to match his eldest disciple Linghu Jiu with his precious daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Ning Zhuo and Mulan were married. In Lin Bufan's eyes, it was a happy event!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: "I have already agreed with General Mulan that after this war, I will leave Twin Rivers Country."<br/>
<br/>
"Although Grand Marshal Mu's Mansion is good, I am not fortunate enough to stay here."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan slightly shook his head: "That's a pity."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to persuade Lin Bufan to stay temporarily and participate in this war. Currently, Twin Rivers Country clearly had the upper hand, and if they captured a few giant wood mountains, there would surely be a lot of spoils. Among them, there would definitely be many herbs.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan chuckled, pointing at Ning Zhuo's nose: "Good kid, still the same as ever."<br/>
<br/>
"Want to trick me into helping in the war?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hehe, I won't fall for your trick."<br/>
<br/>
"My Thousand Medicines Sect belongs to Southern Bean Country, as a Nascent Soul level cultivator, sneaking near the Twin Rivers Country army is already breaking many rules."<br/>
<br/>
"To help you again, participate in the upcoming war, that would be too much."<br/>
<br/>
"Let's not talk about this, take care, I'm off."<br/>
<br/>
After saying this, Lin Bufan waved his sleeve, flew into the sky, and quietly left, quite decisively.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully put away the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence and checked the Jade Steel Heavy Armor again.<br/>
<br/>
In the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingtong was also happy for Ning Zhuo: "Little Zhuo, we originally wanted to manufacture weapons and sell them here. I didn't expect the first batch of heavy armor to be so timely!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was also happy in his heart: "This is a lucky coincidence."<br/>
<br/>
"I was more looking forward to the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence before, but I didn't expect the Jade Steel Heavy Armor to make me even happier."<br/>
<br/>
With this batch of heavy armor, he no longer needed to make a choice, he had a better support plan for both the Three Generals Camp and the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo arrived at the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Without needing to report, Mulan immediately received him.<br/>
<br/>
"I bring good news," Ning Zhuo smiled at Mulan, his attitude casual.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan also smiled: "What a coincidence, husband, I also have good news to tell you."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's expression immediately became more serious: "General Mulan, just call me Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan complied: "Okay, husband."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed helplessly, first taking out the Jade Steel Heavy Armor.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan's eyes lit up, after inspecting it, she commented: "Although the quality is mediocre, the materials are solid, enough to pass the review platform's assessment."<br/>
<br/>
This batch of Jade Steel Heavy Armor was produced by the Ning family branch. According to the current level of artifact refining of the branch, it was indeed mediocre.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan also took out a piece of heavy armor and handed it to Ning Zhuo: "I told you before, this is the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor used by Tang Jifeng."<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical heavy armor!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes immediately lit up, excitedly stepping forward, his hands touching the surface of the heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
"Great, so great!"<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo so happy, his gaze glued to the mechanical heavy armor, Mulan knew that this gift was indeed to his liking, it was the right choice!</div>
