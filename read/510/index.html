<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The drinking session between Ning Zhuo and Liu Er did not last long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Before leaving, Liu Er patted Ning Zhuo on the shoulder: "Although I would like to persuade you, Military Advisor, to focus on the Three Generals Camp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Because Liu Er was in a hurry to go train the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"But on second thought, I really don't have the qualifications to make such a suggestion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"We have come this far, all thanks to the Military Advisor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Since Shuang Jing has no sincerity, I accept the Military Advisor's previous proposal!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"I just hope that in the future, we can also smoothly break away from the Red Flower Camp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">To join, Mu Lan's consent is needed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Similarly, if the Three Generals Camp wants to break away from the Red Flower Camp and establish its own identity in the future, Mu Lan's consent is also required, and it must be reported to the court, going through a series of procedures before it can succeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo nodded: "I will arrange this matter, I will go discuss it with General Mu Lan, we can sign a contract."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Liu Er laughed heartily: "A contract is not necessary. I trust you, Military Advisor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">After saying this, he flew away from this place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo watched Liu Er's back until he disappeared among the mountains, then he withdrew his gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Liu Er, what an interesting person," he sent a telepathic message to Sun Lingtong, expressing his admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong, lying in the Mechanical Dragon, also overheard all of this. He lay on the seat, using his hand as a pillow: "Liu Er is indeed quite something."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"What he said is moving, but be careful, Little Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Before verifying what he said, it's better to remain skeptical."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong added: "His reaction in Shuang Jing's tent is also worth delving into."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"I remember you once told me that you suspect - Liu Er has a means of detection, he knows the situation of the Three Generals Camp very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Do you think it's possible - that Liu Er just detected us in the inner room when he faced Shuang Jing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo nodded: "Boss, I have thought of all these things you mentioned."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"I was just feeling emotional."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"I do have doubts, but deep down, I want to believe that what he said is true!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Sun Lingtong was puzzled: "Ah, why is that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo's eyes sparkled with a hint of excitement: "From my travels in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City until now, this is the first time I've met someone like him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"He has his own ambitions!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Sun Lingtong: "Wanting to establish a pure land free from exclusion? That is indeed a great ambition, but it might also be a castle in the air?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"This goal is really too big, although he has the cultivation of a Golden Core, it is far from enough to achieve this goal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Even with the help of Guan Hong and Zhang Hei, it's the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo nodded: "So, he is really interesting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"His ambition is so grand, achieving it is extremely difficult!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Liu Er's strength is too weak compared to his ambition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"But his belief is so firm! I can feel that he himself deeply understands the difficulty of realizing his ambition. But he still goes forward without hesitation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"This kind of forward-moving attitude, willing to put everything into this matter, is truly admirable and enviable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Sun Lingtong felt even more strange: "If you say so, Little Zhuo, aren't you the same?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"To resurrect your mother, you started traveling the world at just the Foundation Establishment level, so recklessly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"You are much younger than Liu Er, so you are even more remarkable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In Sun Lingtong's heart, how could Liu Er be compared to his own little brother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo shook his head: "It's different, it's different!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Today's drinking session greatly changed Ning Zhuo's impression of Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">From the beginning, Ning Zhuo just wanted to use Liu Guan Zhang to facilitate his mixing into the expeditionary army of Two Note Country, to get to the front lines, to facilitate his capture of his mother's mechanical carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">So, although Ning Zhuo funded Liu Guan Zhang multiple times, with increasing amounts, it was all part of his scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">To say that he genuinely wanted to support Liu Guan Zhang, this intention was very small.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After all, Ning Zhuo and Liu Guan Zhang's relationship was different. The latter three were sworn brothers, Ning Zhuo just happened to be there and took advantage of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Just like Mu Lan schemed against Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo also schemed against Liu Guan Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">But as they fought side by side, Ning Zhuo's camaraderie with the Three Generals deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Including the fact that Liu Er once disliked Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo also somewhat felt it. Ning Zhuo certainly wouldn't mind these things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">From the recent conversation, Ning Zhuo could feel Liu Er's sincerity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Liu Er's tragic experiences also resonated deeply with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Liu Er's mother sacrificed herself for him, which was no different from Ning Zhuo's mother's choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo did not ask Liu Er why he didn't try to resurrect his mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Because the answer to this question was quite obvious - the sects near the mountain village, having set up so much, obviously wouldn't let the souls of the sacrificed fall into the underworld, leaving a loophole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">So, Liu Er's mother had already been annihilated, with no basis for resurrection at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Perhaps it is precisely because of this that Liu Er developed the ambition to create a pure land."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"This ambition itself is a substitute for his inability to save his mother, a resistance to his own fate, dissatisfaction with the world, his unyielding cry, his angry roar!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel sympathy for Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Resonance, sympathy, admiration, interest - these mixed emotions made Ning Zhuo feel an impulse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He told Sun Lingtong about his impulse: "Boss, you might not believe it, but compared to Mu Lan, I want to support Liu Er more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"I really want to fight alongside him, to witness his struggle and hard work."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"I don't know why, his ambition makes my blood boil!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Even though I am a pure human, not a half-demon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong shook his head repeatedly: "Little Zhuo, I feel like you're being foolish."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"We funded Liu Guan Zhang just to increase the possibility of obtaining your mother's relics."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Do you want to follow Liu Er in his struggle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Sun Lingtong shrugged: "I don't mind, this matter is definitely exciting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"But what about your mother?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">This simple question was like a bucket of ice water poured over Ning Zhuo's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo was silent for a moment, then smiled bitterly: "Boss, you're right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"I must save my mother first!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, then turned and hurried towards the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">On the way, Sun Lingtong suddenly said: "Be careful! There's a cultivator hiding ahead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">While Ning Zhuo was walking outside, Sun Lingtong had been controlling the Mechanical Dragon, using its mechanisms to scout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo didn't think, he directly retreated, quickly increasing the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The next second, he heard a familiar voice: "Oh? My One Leaf Obscuring Technique even fooled Meng Kui. Yet you easily saw through my concealment, not bad."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo retreated even faster!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The next moment, Lin Bufan revealed himself, taking out a token: "At such a young age, with such meticulous thoughts and experienced actions, not bad."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Little friend Ning, if you run again, the batch of Jade Steel Heavy Armor and the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence I have will be taken back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Hearing this, and confirming the token was correct, Ning Zhuo stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He happily ran back, cupping his hands in salute: "Sect Leader Lin, I didn't expect to see you at this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Great!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"What you brought is exactly what I need most right now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Lin Bufan stroked his beard: "Of course. Du Tiechuan is indeed one of the few great generals of Two Note Country, acting with such integrity that both sides have to follow his arrangements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"With this batch of Jade Steel Heavy Armor, after fully equipping the Red Flower Camp and the Three Generals Camp, there will still be some left."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">From his words, it was clear that Lin Bufan had a deep understanding of Ning Zhuo's situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo was not at all surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">From the Thousand Medicines Sect that Lin Bufan managed, it was evident that he was meticulous and thorough in his actions. This time, since he came to deliver goods, he naturally had to hide in advance, investigate clearly, confirm everything, and then show himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The two immediately proceeded with the handover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Jade Steel Heavy Armor had a simple design, giving a sense of solidity. The surface of the armor emitted a jade-like luster, somewhere between cyan and black.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The top of the helmet was slightly raised, the visor part slightly tilted forward, with fine talismans carved on both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The chest armor was wide, covering a large area, shaped like a shield. The back was relatively flat, with deflection arrays on both sides to ensure attacks from behind would be deflected and dispersed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The shoulder armor was large and thick, round in shape, covering the shoulders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The arm armor was designed to be flexible, with the joints between the armor plates tight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The heavy armor on the legs was engraved with three arrays, with effects of reducing weight, increasing agility, and helping cultivators recover stamina faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">As for the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence, it was sealed in a medicine bottle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo used his divine sense to penetrate it, and saw a small humanoid-shaped Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence sitting cross-legged, like a cultivator meditating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He exclaimed: "This Fire Essence has such strong spirituality!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Lin Bufan nodded: "Too many cultivators died in the Fire Persimmon Mountain, allowing this Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence to take advantage, absorbing the spirituality of the cultivators, thus becoming extremely dangerous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo pondered: "Senior, collecting this item must have involved a lot of risks, very difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"The Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence itself is already hard to deal with."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Not to mention, there's also the City Lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Meng Kui!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Lin Bufan: "You're right..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Immediately, he briefly narrated to Ning Zhuo how he helped Ning Jiu Fan and participated in the struggle for the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo bowed, sincerely thanking Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Lin Bufan reached out, helping him up: "Little friend Ning, what you've done is not small either."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"I really didn't expect that after arriving in Two Note Country, you would become the son-in-law of the Grand Marshal's Mansion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly, looking somewhat embarrassed: "The details still allow me to report in detail."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Lin Bufan had also heard a lot, but he didn't know more about the inside story, and was indeed curious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">After hearing Ning Zhuo's narration, he digested it for a moment, then stroked his beard and sighed: "Little friend Ning, you have extraordinary luck. Such coincidences and mishaps have instead made you the biggest beneficiary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"In my opinion, you might as well stay in Two Note Country, in Grand Marshal Mu's Mansion, and solidify your identity for a while."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Lin Bufan was quite happy to hear this news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">He knew that his daughter Lin Shanshan had a good impression of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">But as a father, Lin Bufan preferred to match his eldest disciple Linghu Jiu with his precious daughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Now, Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan were married. In Lin Bufan's eyes, it was a happy event!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo shook his head: "I have already agreed with General Mu Lan that after this war, I will leave Two Note Country."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Although Grand Marshal Mu's Mansion is good, I am not fortunate enough to stay here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Lin Bufan slightly shook his head: "That's a pity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to persuade Lin Bufan to stay temporarily and participate in this war. Currently, Two Note Country clearly had the upper hand, and if they captured a few giant wood mountains, there would surely be a lot of spoils. Among them, there would definitely be many herbs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Lin Bufan chuckled, pointing at Ning Zhuo's nose: "Good kid, still the same as ever."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Want to trick me into helping in the war?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Hehe, I won't fall for your trick."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"My Thousand Medicines Sect belongs to Southern Bean Country, as a Nascent Soul level cultivator, sneaking near the Two Note Country army is already breaking many rules."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"To help you again, participate in the upcoming war, that would be too much."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Let's not talk about this, take care, I'm off."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">After saying this, Lin Bufan waved his sleeve, flew into the sky, and quietly left, quite decisively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo carefully put away the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence and checked the Jade Steel Heavy Armor again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">In the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingtong was also happy for Ning Zhuo: "Little Zhuo, we originally wanted to manufacture weapons and sell them here. I didn't expect the first batch of heavy armor to be so timely!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo was also happy in his heart: "This is a lucky coincidence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"I was more looking forward to the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence before, but I didn't expect the Jade Steel Heavy Armor to make me even happier."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">With this batch of heavy armor, he no longer needed to make a choice, he had a better support plan for both the Three Generals Camp and the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo arrived at the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Without needing to report, Mu Lan immediately received him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"I bring good news," Ning Zhuo smiled at Mu Lan, his attitude casual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Mu Lan also smiled: "What a coincidence, husband, I also have good news to tell you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo's expression immediately became more serious: "General Mu Lan, just call me Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Mu Lan complied: "Okay, husband."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Zhuo sighed helplessly, first taking out the Jade Steel Heavy Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Mu Lan's eyes lit up, after inspecting it, she commented: "Although the quality is mediocre, the materials are solid, enough to pass the review platform's assessment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">This batch of Jade Steel Heavy Armor was produced by the Ning family branch. According to the current level of artifact refining of the branch, it was indeed mediocre.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Mu Lan also took out a piece of heavy armor and handed it to Ning Zhuo: "I told you before, this is the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor used by Tang Jifeng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Mechanical heavy armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ning Zhuo's eyes immediately lit up, excitedly stepping forward, his hands touching the surface of the heavy armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Great, so great!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Seeing Ning Zhuo so happy, his gaze glued to the mechanical heavy armor, Mu Lan knew that this gift was indeed to his liking, it was the right choice!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
