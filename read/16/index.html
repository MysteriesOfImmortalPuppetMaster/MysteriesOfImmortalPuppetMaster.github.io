<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Above Fire Persimmon Immortal Mountain, high up in the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Fire Persimmon Immortal City’s City Lord sat cross-legged in the air, looking at his Golden Core stage subordinate Chi Dun[^1].</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Chi Dun was a middle-aged man, blind in one eye and short in stature. However, his body was stout and muscular, making him like a walking pillar of stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Chi Dun, I order you to do everything in your power to track down that black shadow demonic cultivator.” Sitting on a meditation mat, the City Lord was surrounded by white mist and black clouds. The mist and clouds churned endlessly, just as his heart boiled with rage and gloom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Chi Dun had an embarrassed look on his face: “Sir, I will definitely do whatever it takes. But as you know, the cultivation technique I specialize in is the ‘Stone Heart Unhurried Soldier Technique’, so I’m worried my skills will be insufficient for this heavy responsibility.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Not a problem.” The City Lord waved his hand slightly, and a magic treasure flew out from his sleeve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This magic treasure was a bright yellow bell, small and exquisite. It immediately flew toward Chi Dun, who reached out and accepted it with both hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The City Lord said: “This alarm bell will help you track down the demonic cultivator. Don’t let me down!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Chi Dun took his leave, bringing the alarm bell and heading over to the prison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Let’s start with the easy part first. These Ning Clan cultivators were all at the scene, so I should interrogate them first. It’ll be much harder to deal with them once the Ning Clan intervenes and takes them away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“That black shadow demonic cultivator used them to shift Zheng Shuanggou’s attention. Maybe one of them was acting under the demonic cultivator’s orders?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Although this thought flashed through his mind, Chi Dun knew that the chances of it being the case were almost zero.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">However, he might as well take the opportunity to familiarize himself with the usage of the alarm bell as soon as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Originally, Ning Zhuo and the others had been rescued by Zheng Shuanggou, not imprisoned. But then, the immortal palace emerged and the sound of the Technique Transmission Bell echoed throughout the city, causing a big stir.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Thus, the City Lord personally ordered for all surviving cultivators, including them, to be detained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">On the one hand, he intended to interrogate them for clues. On the other, he wanted to make sure that they would stay quiet about the emergence of the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">At this point, the City Lord was going all out to salvage the situation and cover up the secret of the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Chi Dun first picked out the Foundation Establishment cultivators to interrogate. Soon, it was the turn of those in the Qi Refining stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Before long, Ning Zhuo was led into a solitary room and met Chi Dun face-to-face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Chi Dun flipped through the notebook in his hand without looking up. His divine sense had already enveloped Ning Zhuo’s whole body as he said: “You aren’t part of the Monster Hunting Association. Why did you suddenly head to the volcanic cavern?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo gulped, regarding Chi Dun with fear in his eyes before lowering his head and staring at the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Stammering, he talked about his encounter with Ning Chen and Ning Yong, the way he had been provoked by their words, and the events that followed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Chi Dun frowned as he listened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He had absolutely no interest in this young cultivator called Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“He’s only at the third level of Qi Refining, and something like this happened on his first trip into to the volcanic cavern. His luck is really bad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Or should I say it’s good? At least he survived. Many cultivators who were even stronger than him lost their lives.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Had Ning Zhuo been the only survivor, he would be quite conspicuous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">But including Ning Chen and Ning Yong, there were a total of three newbies in Qi Refining who had survived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“The black shadow demonic cultivator first used monster beast corpses to lure the Ning Clan’s people over, then provoked a beast tide. It was all to cover up his own aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“The Ning Clan cultivators were just used as cannon fodder. There most likely isn’t a spy among them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“If I were that demonic cultivator, even if I wanted a spy, I wouldn’t use this kid at the third level of Qi Refining.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Of course, Chi Dun wouldn’t dismiss his suspicion with just this much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He had been using the alarm bell this whole time, and the heart-questioning formation in the interrogation room was also active.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The alarm bell was extremely sensitive to malice. If one of these Ning Clan cultivators held any ill will toward Chi Dun, the alarm bell would immediately ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">As for the heart-questioning formation, it could detect whether or not a person was telling the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">As long as someone spoke dishonest words, the heart-questioning formation would shine with red and yellow light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Throughout the whole process of Ning Zhuo’s interrogation, the alarm bell and heart-questioning formation were both completely silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Chi Dun hadn’t held much suspicion toward a small figure like Ning Zhuo in the first place. Now, with the confirmation of the alarm bell and the heart-questioning formation, he no longer had a shred of doubt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“You can go.” Chi Dun said. But suddenly, he let out a noise of surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo’s nostrils were bleeding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo also seemed surprised. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand and saw the blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Waving his hand quickly, he said: “Sir, it’s nothing. It might be a lingering injury from the volcanic cavern. I’m fine, I’m really fine!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Chi Dun grunted. Not speaking anymore, he made a shooing motion with his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo bowed and quickly left, closing the door softly behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Chi Dun was about to call the next person in for interrogation when he suddenly paused. His divine sense spread out and transmitted a message to the guard outside the door: “Go over and tell the others to treat the Ning Clan cultivators better. Have they been slacking off? How are there still lingering injuries? Heal them!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Ning Clan was one of the three major cultivation clans in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Chi Dun didn’t want to offend them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Of course, if a Ning Clan cultivator was proven to have colluded with the black shadow demonic cultivator, that would be a different story.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo was immediately whisked away for another round of treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Of course, his nosebleed was the result of him secretly activating the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">When used on others, the heart seal produced by this magic treasure could influence their thoughts. When used on oneself, it could suppress and clear all kinds of thoughts and emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">It was a demon to others and a Buddha to the self.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo was led back to the prison cell. Before entering, he heard people arguing inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Ning Clan cultivators were having a heated discussion over the contents of the technique transmitted by the bell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">When Ning Zhuo walked into the cell, many Ning Clan cultivators turned to look at him. Seeing that he was fine, some of them nodded slightly in acknowledgment before turning back to continue the argument.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">During this trip to the volcanic cavern, they had all faced life and death together, so their relationship was now much closer than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Chen and Ning Yong even jumped to their feet and walked over to Ning Zhuo, concernedly asking him questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">In the first place, they were once classmates and had at least a basic level of relationship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This time, after they acted on Ning Zhanji’s orders, Ning Zhuo had almost died. They couldn’t help but feel guilty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">And it wasn’t just guilt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">During this trip to the volcanic cavern, Ning Zhuo had overcome his fear in the face of danger and erupted with courage, inspiring Ning Yong and Ning Chen to muster up their own bravery at the critical moment of life and death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Because of this, Ning Yong and Ning Chen felt both appreciation and admiration. These various emotions led to a qualitative change in their relationship with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“How was it? Are you alright?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“We’re cultivators of the Ning Clan, and our old ancestor is also in the Golden Core stage. If someone dares to use a soul-searching technique on us, the clan will definitely seek justice!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Chen and Ning Yong spoke one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo nodded: “I was a little nervous at first, but nobody caused any trouble for me. All I had to do was honestly tell the truth.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Somehow, it ended up with him comforting Ning Chen and Ning Yong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Good.” Ning Yong and Ning Chen responded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The next moment, the guard called them over and brought both of them away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo walked deeper into the cell and found his seat in the corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He had a chair for himself and a little table in front of him. There were fruits, nuts, and hot tea on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The rest of the Ning Clan cultivators had the same treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Of course, this wasn’t normal. They only received such treatment because they were members of the Ning Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo’s spot was in the corner of the prison cell. Not far away, there was a pile of smelly, rotting straw. There were also dried bloodstains on the brick wall, and handprints all over the bars. Standing there, it was almost as if you could still hear the past prisoners wailing and begging for mercy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo knew that if the truth was revealed, his end would be even more miserable. The first to go after him might not even be the City Lord’s side, but the Ning Clan! At that time, the smiling Ning Clan cultivators around him would instead be full of fury as they chased him with all their might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But Ning Zhuo had no regrets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He had decided to bomb the immortal palace long ago. What did he care of the risk to his life?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He slowly sat down and reached out to grab a roasted chestnut. The chestnut shell cracked open between his fingers with a crisp crunch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Then, he put the nut into his mouth and chewed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The current Lava Immortal Palace was just like this chestnut. Ning Zhuo had smashed its shell and lowered the selection standard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">But when it came to eating the nut inside, he still needed to be careful and cautious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">This matter was too important. Ning Zhuo was a mere third-level Qi Refining cultivator, and his current path was like walking on thin ice. If he was the slightest bit careless, if he revealed the slightest opening, he would be swallowed up by the icy lake and drown in its depths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Back then, Ning Zhuo’s mother had fallen in much the same way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo chewed the chestnut quietly, savoring the delicious flavor on his tongue as if savoring the thrill of his own dangerous situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Who would believe that this ordinary-looking youth was the true culprit behind the bombing of the immortal palace?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
