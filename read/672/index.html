<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo turned to Qing Chi and said, "Miss Qing Chi, why don't you explore a bit? This cave mansion is quite large, with more than just five chambers. Feel free to choose one to reside in. Staying cooped up in the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon all the time must be rather stifling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Qing Chi hummed in acknowledgment, then stared intently at Ning Zhuo for three breaths before lowering her head and walking away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Seeing her dazed and obedient demeanor, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but recall her lively spirit before she lost her memories. A mix of guilt and pity welled up in his heart, leaving him with a bitter taste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Lingtong returned after surveying the area and reported to Ning Zhuo that he had found nothing suspicious. He then asked, "When do we start digging into the mountain to find the teleportation chamber Mother left behind?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This presented a challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The cave mansion Meng Yaoyin had rented years ago wasn't this Stone Spring Cave Mansion. The one she had originally chosen had long since been occupied by someone else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo and his group now had to search through the massive mountain to locate a hidden teleportation chamber - no easy task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The mountain was protected by a Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">To bypass the formation, avoid attracting attention, and locate the teleportation array would inevitably take time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Fortunately, Mother left me a Method," Ning Zhuo sighed. "As long as I get within a hundred zhang, I'll sense its presence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sun Lingtong rolled up his sleeves. "The sooner we get this done, the better. Let's start digging now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Sharpening the axe doesn't delay the woodcutter," Ning Zhuo mused. "We should first investigate our neighbors and figure out exactly what kind of Formation we're dealing with here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The mountain peak was riddled with cave mansions. If any powerful cultivators discovered their activities, it would undoubtedly complicate matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Formation was also crucial. Understanding it would allow them to devise countermeasures; otherwise, they wouldn't even dare to conduct thorough reconnaissance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong patted his chest. "Alright. I'll start by probing the Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">As a member of the Void Sect, he was perfectly suited for this task. His understanding and mastery of Formations far surpassed Ning Zhuo's. Most importantly, he was utterly trustworthy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Then we'll leave it to you, Boss," Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong waved dismissively. "Don't be so formal with me." With that, he turned and headed deeper into the cave mansion to begin his work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Having assigned tasks to his companions, Ning Zhuo entered the cultivation chamber, retrieved a meditation cushion, and settled into a cross-legged posture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Instead of beginning his cultivation, he retrieved the Intelligence Jade Slip and began studying it intently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Earlier, he had used his divine sense to record the information, essentially memorizing it. Most of it remained vividly clear in his mind, but it lacked analysis and deeper understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">As he delved deeper into the material, the once-blurred surnames in Ning Zhuo's mind gradually cleared, like a dense fog dissipating under the morning sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Where there are people, there is the jianghu," Ning Zhuo mused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The structure of the Myriad Manifestations Sect could be summarized as "Eight Peaks and Sixteen Halls."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Eight Great Main Peaks and Sixteen Halls together formed the framework of this Super Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Eight Great Main Peaks were: Heavy Formation Peak, Myriad Beasts Peak, Crimson Cloud Peak, Violet Thunder Peak, Sword Cry Peak, Hundred Herbs Peak, Soaring Peak, and Flowing Cloud Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Sixteen Halls were: Foreign Affairs Hall, Internal Affairs Hall, General Affairs Hall, Merit Transmission Hall, Martial Arts Hall, Demon Subduing Hall, Alchemy Hall, Artifact Refining Hall, Formation Hall, Talisman Hall, Commerce Hall, Spirit Plant Hall, Beast Taming Hall, Military Hall, Spirit Cuisine Hall, and Medical Arts Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The current Sect Leader of the Myriad Manifestations Sect was Dong Chen, who also served as the Peak Lord of Heavy Formation Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Sect Leader election was held every hundred years, with the Peak Lords of the Eight Great Main Peaks as the primary candidates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">To become one of the Eight Great Peak Lords, one must rely on their own strength, overcome numerous challenges, and continuously occupy one of the Eight Great Main Peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This revealed the Myriad Manifestations Sect's unconventional approach to sect management!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The sect prided itself on its open-door policy, emphasizing low entry barriers. They even distribute the first few chapters of their foundational Cultivation Art freely, allowing anyone to practice it without charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Cultivators who join the Myriad Manifestations Sect could claim a Main Peak and become a Peak Lord if they possess sufficient strength and extensive connections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">This granted them eligibility for the Sect Leader election, potentially making them the sect's supreme leader!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">For most sects and organizations, such a direct path to the top was unimaginable - the path to advancement had no theoretical limit within the sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Therefore, the Eight Great Main Peaks represent the eight most powerful interest groups within the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"The sect's daily affairs, organizational operations, and other functions are managed through the Sixteen Halls."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"When cultivators from the Eight Great Main Peaks join these halls and hold positions within them, it effectively allows the eight peaks to exert control over the sect's administrative authority."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Among the eight peaks, they are further divided into the Old Four Peaks and the New Four Peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Old Four Peaks were Heavy Formation Peak, Myriad Beasts Peak, Crimson Cloud Peak, and Violet Thunder Peak. The New Four Peaks were Sword Cry Peak, Hundred Herbs Peak, Soaring Peak, and Flowing Cloud Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The distinction between "old" and "new" arose because the original four peaks had remained unchanged through countless eras, while the latter four peaks frequently rotated as their power on the Main Peak waned, leading to frequent changes of leadership and banners.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">This instability stemmed from the Myriad Manifestations Sect's vast membership. The Eight Great Main Peaks were reserved for the most exceptional cultivators, while the sect's massive base was filled with countless others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">These members outside the Main Peaks were not necessarily weak. Many outstanding individuals preferred to operate independently, harbored unspeakable secrets, or had offended powerful figures, all reasons for remaining outside the Eight Great Main Peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">These individuals often formed alliances and groups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">As these groups grew in strength and influence, they could eventually challenge the Eight Great Main Peaks. This dynamic explained why the New Four Peaks changed masters so frequently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">However, such challenges were not brutal or bloody. The Myriad Manifestations Sect's limited regulations strictly governed these transitions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Through this system of meritocratic leadership, the sect maintained its vitality, preventing internal strife from escalating into deadly infighting and mutual destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Individuals like Wen Ruanyu, despite being Golden Core True Disciples, were not members of the Eight Great Main Peaks. Instead, they held long-term assignments from the Foreign Affairs Hall and were stationed year-round in White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Meng Yaoyin was among them. Otherwise, her cave mansion wouldn't have been located on the small peak opposite Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yang Sanyan, however, was different. As a member of a Main Peak, his high-grade Innate Talent and arrogant demeanor had earned him early recognition and selection, even while he was still in the Qi Refining Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Intelligence Jade Slip also mentioned that Flowing Cloud Peak was the weakest among the Eight Great Main Peaks. It currently lacked a Peak Lord, and the faction occupying the Main Peak was relatively small, relying primarily on its extensive network of connections. To become Peak Lord, one had to pass a rigorous assessment. Only those who succeeded could assume the position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Upon reading this, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but wonder, "If Flowing Cloud Peak is the weakest, what's the relative strength ranking of the other seven peaks?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Intelligence Jade Slip provided no answer to this question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo mused, "Would the Intelligence Jade Slip priced two tiers higher offer such details?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Most likely not," he concluded, answering his own question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo was no ordinary genius. During his decade-long life of hidden cultivation, the City Lord's Mansion had been his primary subject of study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">To prepare for future adversaries, Ning Zhuo often practiced perspective-taking, imagining himself as the City Lord's Mansion and analyzing every action and policy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Your greatest enemy often understands you best!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Over time, this habit naturally cultivated in Ning Zhuo the strategic vision and insight of a leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">If he were the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he would never rank the Eight Great Main Peaks by strength in their Intelligence Jade Slip. This would only invite internal strife and resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"But relative strength undoubtedly exists."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Though the intelligence doesn't explicitly state it, I can deduce it easily enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">With this thought, Ning Zhuo's divine sense lingered on a section of the intelligence:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Information on the key personnel of the Sixteen Halls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Xiang Ji, the Hall Master of the Foreign Affairs Hall, was from Heavy Formation Peak. Chen Xuan, the Hall Master of the Internal Affairs Hall, also hailed from Heavy Formation Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo's eyes narrowed slightly. "Foreign Affairs and Internal Affairs are both controlled by Heavy Formation Peak - the Sect Leader's faction. This shows Dong Chen's considerable influence over the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhao Qian, the Hall Master of the General Affairs Hall, came from Myriad Beasts Peak. This hall was responsible for gathering cultivation resources - a fundamental and vital task, but also a grueling and thankless job.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Hall Master Wang Yan of the Alchemy Hall hailed from Crimson Cloud Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The Formation Hall and Talisman Hall were controlled by Heavy Formation Peak and Crimson Cloud Peak, respectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The top three of the Four Arts of Cultivation are all represented by Heavy Formation Peak and Crimson Cloud Peak," Ning Zhuo observed. "It's clear these two factions are the most powerful forces within the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Looking further, he noticed that Myriad Beasts Peak controlled the Beast Taming Hall, a fitting specialization.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Huh? What about Violet Thunder Peak?" Ning Zhuo murmured, surprised by his unexpected discovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The most crucial halls among the Sixteen Halls were almost entirely controlled by Heavy Formation Peak, Crimson Cloud Peak, and Myriad Beasts Peak. Violet Thunder Peak, one of the Old Four Peaks, held real power only within the Medical Arts Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This revelation was significant and immediately caught Ning Zhuo's attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Logically, the Old Four Peaks should have been formidable internal factions within the Sect. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to dominate a Main Peak for centuries, resisting all attempts to dislodge them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"The New Four Peaks represent the rising powers, while the Old Four Peaks are the Sect's established forces," Ning Zhuo reasoned. "Under normal circumstances, Violet Thunder Peak shouldn't have such limited influence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"There could be hidden resources supporting Violet Thunder Peak. Or perhaps..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Violet Thunder Peak has fallen into decline, nearing the brink of failure, and is on the verge of being expelled from its Main Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">If it was the latter possibility, the implications were enormous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Thoughts raced through Ning Zhuo's divine sea like lightning: This signifies a shift from the old to the new, a massive change in the Sect's direction!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Can I seize this opportunity to gain some advantage?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The Myriad Manifestations Sect's external environment was remarkably stable. As the Flying Cloud Kingdom's foremost Super Sect, it far surpassed all others, leaving no rival in the entire nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">However, such a monumental internal upheaval would inevitably create countless opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Having clawed his way up from the bottom, Ning Zhuo understood the value of such chances all too well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Perhaps I can use this to elevate my life to the next level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Just as he reached this thought, Old Chef's voice called from outside the door: "Young Master, the Spirit Food is ready."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Alright, I'll be right there," Ning Zhuo replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He held the Jade Slip, about to tuck it into his Storage Belt, when a thought struck him: The Intelligence Jade Slip clearly states that Flowing Cloud Peak is the weakest of the Eight Great Main Peaks. This is clearly meant to guide others; anyone seeking to challenge a Main Peak would naturally target Flowing Cloud Peak first. But what about Violet Thunder Peak?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Could Violet Thunder Peak have been involved in creating this Intelligence Jade Slip?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The four gathered around the stone table, each focusing on their tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong, covered in dust from his travels, was tasked with probing the Formation and digging tunnels, though he wouldn't venture deep into the mountain's interior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Qing Chi, distracted, kept glancing at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Old Chef also looked at Ning Zhuo. "Young Master, does the food suit your taste?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">His demeanor was worlds apart from his behavior at Vigorous Yang Manor, a transformation entirely due to Ning Zhuo saving his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo took a bite and immediately praised the dish, then asked curiously, "Old Chef, even your ordinary Spirit Food tastes so delicious. Why do you focus on Dark Cuisine?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Old Chef shook his head. "Dark Cuisine is my true passion. But since I serve you, Young Master, I'll naturally prepare dishes according to your preferences."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo said earnestly, "Whether the food tastes delicious truly doesn't matter. Old Chef, why not put your full effort into Dark Cuisine? It might help me progress faster. Just avoid enhancing my Soul. Focus on supporting my Physical Body cultivation instead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Old Chef chuckled bitterly. "Young Master Ning, you're unaware of two significant drawbacks here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"First, my Dark Cuisine specializes in the Ghost Attribute, and my forte lies in recipes that enhance the Soul's foundation. As for Physical Body cultivation, my skills are merely average."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Second, Gan Douding, the Hall Master of the Spirit Cuisine Hall at Myriad Manifestations Sect, is a fanatical devotee of Light Cuisine. She insists on dishes that excel in color, aroma, and flavor, emphasizing the cultivator's sensory experience. She despises the Dark Cuisine Sect above all else."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"If she discovers me preparing Dark Cuisine within Myriad Manifestations Sect... being expelled from the sect wouldn't matter much to me. My real concern is the severe trouble it would bring upon you, Young Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo immediately recalled the Intelligence Jade Slip, which indeed described Gan Douding's identity and sect affiliation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"I see," Ning Zhuo nodded. "Since we've just arrived at this Treasure Land, let's play it safe and avoid provoking unnecessary enemies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Just as they finished speaking, a cold shout echoed from the cave entrance: "People of Stone Spring Cave Mansion, come out now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo's group exchanged startled glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Instead of moving, Ning Zhuo retrieved his token, channeled spiritual energy into it, and conjured a phantom image in the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The illusion revealed three cultivators. The leader, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, exuded an overwhelming aura, while the two attendants were at the Qi Refining Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo's voice echoed from inside the cave: "Who are you, and what do you want?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The Foundation Establishment cultivator laughed heartily. "Listen well! This mountain peak has been claimed by my master. He values tranquility and wishes to expel all outsiders from this place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Before you arrived, we've already persuaded over a dozen newcomers to leave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Ignorance is no crime. Leave now, and I'll give you some Spirit Stones as compensation. Refuse, and my master, a dignified Golden Core cultivator, won't stoop to bullying the weak. But among our attendants, there are twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators. You'll face us in the Martial Arts Hall soon enough!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Qing Chi gritted her teeth, her face flushed with indignation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Old Chef glanced at Ning Zhuo with concern. "Young Master..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Sun Lingtong giggled, his eyes sparkling as he stared at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">After a moment of silence, Ning Zhuo spoke again: "You're offering Spirit Stones? How many?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The intruder sneered. "Ten mid-grade Spirit Stones! Go to the Internal Affairs Hall and get your rental fee refunded. You have plenty of time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily. "Then I thank you, sir."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">He accepted the offer immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
