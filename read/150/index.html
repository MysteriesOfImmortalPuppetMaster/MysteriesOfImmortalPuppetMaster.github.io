<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">True disciples hold a very high status and are extremely important to a sect, being one of the core strengths and future leaders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Immediately, an elder pondered, "I remember this matter. Not long ago, Cheng Bai took on a mission to investigate Fire Persimmon Immortal City in the Southern Bean Kingdom. There are rumors that an Immortal Palace might have emerged from Fire Persimmon Mountain, possibly the Lava Immortal Palace of the Three Sects' Ancestors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Sect Master of the Soul Devouring Sect's gaze darkened slightly, "The Three Sects' Ancestors... This person was extraordinary, able to contend with Integration Stage cultivators despite being at the Void Refining Stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"He practiced the techniques of the demonic, daoist, and buddhist paths simultaneously, indeed a talent. However, his later years were unfortunate, seemingly suffering from Qi deviation and committing suicide." The Sect Master thought for a moment and looked at one of the sect elders, "Elder Luo, what do you think should be done about this matter?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Elder Luo pondered aloud, "Our true disciple has fallen, we must investigate the true culprit and punish them severely! However, the Lava Immortal Palace is located in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. If we dispatch an elder-level figure, it might cause unnecessary misunderstandings. I believe it would be more appropriate to send one or two capable Golden Core cultivators, along with a few ghost generals for protection. First, we should identify the true culprit, then discuss and decide further actions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Sect Master smiled, "This is indeed a wise strategy. So, Elder Luo, who do you think would be a suitable true disciple for this task?" Elder Luo understood the Sect Master's intention in asking him and immediately replied, "I recommend my nephew, Luo Shang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Very well, Luo Shang it is," the Sect Master ordered, dispatching Luo Shang to Fire Persimmon Immortal City to investigate, accompanied by a ghost general with Nascent Soul-level combat power to protect him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This was already the operational limit under normal circumstances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In a major demonic sect like the Soul Devouring Sect, elders were at least at the Nascent Soul stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Dispatching an elder would undoubtedly make the Southern Bean Kingdom nervous, potentially leading to unnecessary conflicts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">If misunderstandings escalated, causing the Soul Devouring Sect to provoke a behemoth like the Southern Bean Kingdom, it would be unfavorable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">In the cultivation world, great power is often concentrated in one individual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">A Nascent Soul-level existence can guard a region, like Meng Kui guarding Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Similarly, a Nascent Soul cultivator can invade a region.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Such powerful beings should not be lightly moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Therefore, when the Soul Devouring Sect previously wanted to investigate the soul reserves in Fire Persimmon Mountain, they only sent the Golden Core true disciple Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">It wasn't that the Soul Devouring Sect lacked Nascent Soul-level cultivators, but under normal circumstances, sending Cheng Bai was the most appropriate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Now that Cheng Bai was suspected to have died in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the Soul Devouring Sect had a reason to send a stronger investigator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This investigator might not be at the Nascent Soul stage, but they must at least possess Nascent Soul-level means.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Hence, sending a ghost general with Nascent Soul-level combat power for protection was within the rules.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">As for why a grand demonic sect like the Soul Devouring Sect would adhere to rules?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The reason is simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">With significant assets comes a cautious heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Soul Devouring Sect occupies vast territories and controls countless cultivation resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">With such a large foundation, they naturally have many concerns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After receiving the order, Luo Shang immediately set off for Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Not long after he left, an inner disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect quietly sent out a message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The message was relayed through several intermediaries, eventually reaching a town.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The town's leader then transmitted the message to the nearest secret sect outpost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">In the outpost, several cultivators were discussing and analyzing various pieces of intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"A true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect has died? This is a major event!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The Soul Devouring Sect has preliminarily determined that the death occurred in Fire Persimmon Immortal City in the Southern Bean Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Isn't there a rumor that an Immortal Palace has emerged there?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The Lava Immortal Palace? That's just one of the twelve palaces of the Three Sects' Ancestors, indeed buried within Fire Persimmon Mountain. This has been confirmed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Wait, doesn't our Void Sect have any disciples in Fire Persimmon Immortal City?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Yes, there's Sun Lingtong, who manages the black market in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and is quite well-informed. However, he hasn't confirmed the emergence of the Immortal Palace, only reporting some disturbances."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Sun Lingtong... Isn't he the sole disciple of Xu Wuyan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Yes. Many years ago, Elder Xu was trapped in the Lava Immortal Palace. Sun Lingtong stayed in the Immortal City, always believing his master wasn't dead, just trapped within the city. The sect wanted to recall him due to his talent, but he refused."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Heh, quite admirable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"I believe this child's determination is commendable! Even if he returns to the sect, it might not be a good choice. Don't forget, Elder Qing is Elder Xu's arch-enemy and now holds significant power within the sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Enough idle chatter, let's report this matter first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Regardless of the Soul Devouring Sect or Fire Persimmon Immortal City, our sect should send disciples to investigate further."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">A few days passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Void Sect's secret outpost gathered more intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Void Sect cultivators discussed again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Strange, recently the number of reports about the emergence of Fire Persimmon Immortal City has suddenly surged."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"The source has been verified; it's from the Meng family of the Southern Bean Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"The Meng family?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Meng Kui, one of the four generals of the Meng family, is the city lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Why would he heavily promote this matter?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Indeed, very strange."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Has the higher-ups decided to send elite disciples to investigate Fire Persimmon Immortal City? I feel there might be an opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Just then, a voice suddenly came, "I have arrived."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In the secret chamber, the cultivators were startled, scattering in all directions, frantically channeling their Qi, ready for battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">A female cultivator slowly revealed her figure, showing her identity token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Only then did the cultivators relax their guard and salute her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The female cultivator acted swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After appearing, she requested all the intelligence related to Fire Persimmon Immortal City and immediately set off for Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"It's true disciple Yang Chanyu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"The sect actually sent her!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Yang Chanyu is Elder Qing's favored disciple. Her purpose this time must be significant. Sun Lingtong is in trouble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo reviewed the recent intelligence, frowning, "The recent atmosphere in the city seems a bit off!" Without the black market channel, he mainly relied on street rumors for intelligence, significantly reducing the quality of information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Even so, Ning Zhuo still sensed a subtle atmosphere, "There seem to be many unfamiliar faces in the city recently. The inns' business has improved. Some places frequently have fights and accidents. Upon careful review, these places are near important areas or key buildings in the Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">In recent days, he stayed in the Ning family territory, rarely stepping out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He was either diligently cultivating or tinkering in a makeshift workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Tree Martial Ape was destroyed, and the remaining skeleton became fragile after bearing the Golden Bone Fortification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo had to start from scratch, crafting a mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This time, he lacked many materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Last time, he was in the Zheng family, thanks to Zheng Jian's support, using many precious materials to create the Tree Martial Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This time, Ning Zhuo wasn't so lucky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">While diligently cultivating, a messenger brought a summons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo followed the order and secretly met with Zheng Jian and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Ning Zhuo, it's good to finally meet," Zheng Jian greeted warmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo not only saw Zheng Jian but also Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zesheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Congratulations on your recovery!" Ning Zhuo smiled sincerely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Zhou Zhu remained silent, while Zhou Zesheng said, "I heard you and Ning Xiaohui explored the Immortal Palace and encountered Meng Chong?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Shameful," Ning Zhuo sighed, showing a trace of fear, "The gap between us and Meng Chong is too vast; we had no chance to fight back. Honestly, I've been feeling heavy-hearted these past few days, unable to be cheerful. With Meng Chong ahead, how can we be his match?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zhou Zesheng nodded, his face darkening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Zheng Jian patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder, encouraging him, "If we unite, we might still win. It's too early to talk about failure, Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo forced a smile, looking deeply disheartened, "To contend with Meng Chong, I can't do it. I'll have to rely on you all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Xiaohui snorted, "Ning Zhuo, with such a mindset, how can you bear the Ning name? Failure and humiliation should make you hold your head high and strive harder to wash away the shame. Follow me closely and watch!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">In the subsequent actions, Ning Xiaohui was the first to have her soul extracted by Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Amidst her screams, her soul nearly shattered, triggering the Immortal Palace's mechanism, sending her soul back to her body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Zhou Zesheng continued, "This mission is crucial. We must clear as many checkpoints as possible to catch up with Meng Chong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo satisfied him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">In the following actions, Ning Zhuo communicated with Sun Lingtong, allowing the three allied teams to reach the preparation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The three sects' cultivators were excited upon seeing the leaderboard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Meng Chong is indeed first!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"There are so many people from the City Lord's reformation team on the list."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Outrageous! Meng Chong must have made significant progress while we were recovering!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"As we suspected, the City Lord's team is far ahead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Zhou Zesheng was the second to have his soul extracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong's attack order was logical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The first target was Ning Xiaohui, as her talent could not only control various mechanisms but also freeze wounds for treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The second was Zhou Zesheng, whose sharp mind and command skills made him a significant threat if left on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Meng Chong is so powerful, I really want to face him personally. Even if I lose, it doesn't matter. It would be good to see the gap and work harder afterward," Zheng Jian said expectantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo doubled his satisfaction—letting Yuan Dasheng focus on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Going to die, going to die, going to die!" Seeing Yuan Dasheng charging at him, Zheng Jian's talent triggered, frantically warning him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Zheng Jian became the third to have his soul devoured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zhou Zhu remained silent, left for last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Seeing his dull-witted appearance, Ning Zhuo chose him as a witness to see Ning Zhuo's "death" firsthand.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
