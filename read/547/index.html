<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The two armies faced each other from a distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The allied forces of Thousand Peaks Forest sprawled across the mountains, numerous in number and with a mighty presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In the position of commander sat an old man with a hunched figure, a gaunt face, an unremarkable appearance, and mottled skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">It was Lord Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">On both his sides, there were heroes of various kinds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">At the far left sat a blue-robed cultivator, middle-aged in appearance with an extraordinary demeanor, who was none other than the allied army’s strategist, Lu Hongtu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">At Lu Hongtu’s side, there was the Demon Heart Cave Master with eyes like whirlpools and a body covered in black-purple scales; there was also the Blood Shadow Cave Master, whose whole body was shrouded in a bloody glow; and the Venom Scorpion Cave Master, with a human body, a scorpion tail, and purple cloud-like gauze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">There was the pig-headed, human-bodied Ju Bing, Jin Tunhe inscribed with copper coin talismans, and Qian Ye, who was originally an illusionary fox demon, …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At the highest seat on the far right, a massive figure loomed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He had an elephant’s head and a human body, a robust physique, a chest as wide as a city gate, limbs as thick as tree trunks, and his entire skin was a pale blue. Especially striking were a pair of snow-white tusks, like two crescent moons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He was the contemporary Elephant King among the Pale Barbarian Elephant herd in Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">At his side stood Chen Lingfeng, with an eagle head and a human body; Wu Hen, who practiced the spirit dao; and Gu Ya, with blue hair and white skin, his face marked with wolf claw patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">There was also the barbarian old woman Bi Tengyi, and her husband, the Cang Teng King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">And Tu Ming, with deadly gear wrapped around his waist and a poisonous sack hanging from his neck…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It could be said that the elite of the Thousand Peaks Forest allied forces were all present, and nearly all the strong ones had gathered here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Lord Long looked into the distance at the grand camps of Two Note Nation, and saw that these camps resembled bronze fortresses, solemn and dignified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Along the walls, at intervals, watchtowers stood. Flags fluttered, and the soldiers stood on the walls, with their arms in perfect order and high morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Around the grand camp, on the battlefield outside the walls, many arrow towers were also erected, and defensive stakes and moats were arranged with precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Now the battlefield had been cleared, and was no longer just a heap of shattered stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Lord Long’s gaze unconsciously swept over to the other side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Not far from the grand camp, there lay a mountain, which was none other than Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Lord Long had raised his entire army this time to besiege the frontline grand camp of Two Note Nation, and one of the main objectives was to rescue the many members and followers of the Dragon King Temples on Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Lord Long spoke: “The enemy’s guard is severe and their defenses formidable. If anyone has any good suggestions, please speak up.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Everyone fell silent, and all their eyes turned towards Lu Hongtu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Since the outbreak of the great battle, Lu Hongtu had performed excellently, not hesitating to use his own funds and widely contacting fellow cultivators, strong figures, and various forces of Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">It could be said that the establishment of the allied forces, apart from the banner of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, also owed a crucial role to Lu Hongtu’s connections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Lu Hongtu was appointed as the allied forces’ strategist, a decision that was in keeping with everyone’s expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Afterward, Lu Hongtu strongly advocated and took the initiative to propose an ambush, which reaped considerable results and established his authority.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After the first major battle, Lord Long temporarily stepped aside, and various cultivators among the allied forces, coveting the spoils, acted independently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Although Chen Lingfeng and others strongly opposed, Lu Hongtu did nothing but watch indifferently, secretly letting things slide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This move was detrimental to the overall situation, but it earned Lu Hongtu more popularity and reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Therefore, at that moment, everyone, through their actions, elected him to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After a moment of contemplation, Lu Hongtu finally spoke slowly: “The enemy spared no expense in constructing such a camp that could almost be called a fortress wall.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Previously, many Taoist friends fell because of the enemy camp’s heavy military equipment. I suppose we have also witnessed the might of this grand camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Everyone listened in silence, with many nodding slightly in agreement, deeply resonating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Lu Hongtu continued: “Especially, Du Tiechuan stayed in the enemy camp to recuperate his injuries. If we truly provoked this strong enemy of the Soul Formation Level…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Lu Hongtu intentionally paused, successfully seeing a slight change in everyone’s expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In the last major battle, Du Tiechuan had defeated the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King head-on. That alone was enough to prove his combat strength!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The highest cultivation level among the allied forces was only at the Nascent Soul stage, with no one of the Soul Formation Level. If Du Tiechuan were forced to come out, none of those present would fare well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Lu Hongtu paused deliberately and looked towards Lord Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Accompanying his action, other cultivators also cast questioning and expectant glances towards Lord Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The meaning was clear - they were all asking whether the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King would make an appearance again in this great battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Lord Long, having no answer in his heart, could only say: “Every move of the divine is a secret; as it concerns the final outcome of this battle, I, an old man, cannot casually disclose it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“However, now that our allied forces have been mobilized, if under Du Tiechuan’s methods we were to be utterly annihilated, the entire situation in Thousand Peaks Forest would be completely overturned in favor of Two Note Nation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Lord Long did not answer directly, nor did he clearly take a stance, but through these words he successfully persuaded the cultivators present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Indeed, if we all were to fall in battle, then Thousand Peaks Forest would no longer have any defending forces, and the enemy could easily march in unimpeded!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King is so mighty, with a life force like an ocean; surely he has long since recovered to his original state.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“And Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain lies right there, with too many members of the Dragon King Temple on the mountain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">A glimmer of brilliance flashed in the depths of Lu Hongtu’s eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The key figures who could influence this great battle, aside from Du Tiechuan and the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, also included Young Master Sheng Xu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Has Young Master Sheng Xu been persuaded yet?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“According to the intelligence, he is still remaining in his original place.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“It appears that he was not invited, but the fact that he has been lingering in Thousand Peaks Forest all along is in itself rather suspicious.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Lu Hongtu kept calculating in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Because it concerned the deal of the Life Sea Dragon Spring, which would tarnish the reputation of the Divine King, this matter was kept strictly confidential by Lord Long and others, and Lu Hongtu was unaware of it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Below Young Master Sheng Xu are the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“If we could find those two, the combat power of the allied forces would increase drastically.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“What a pity…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">At that thought, the name Ning Zhuo sprang to mind in Lu Hongtu’s mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His eyes flickered slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The intelligence of the battle of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth had already been transmitted into the Thousand Peaks Forest alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The combined attack of the Twin Ghosts had killed and wounded many Nascent Soul cultivators in Two Note Nation’ armies, greatly weakening them; this was one of the opportunities for the Thousand Peaks Forest allied forces to proactively launch their siege.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">But in the end, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth were skillfully induced to defect by a certain method of Ning Zhuo, leading to their defeat and retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Therefore, the once modest Foundation Establishment cultivator Ning Zhuo had, at that moment in Lu Hongtu’s mind, become a name that had to be watched!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Ning Zhuo, Ning family… what a trouble they are.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“After this great battle, we shall strive to deal with this trouble as quickly as possible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Lord Long spoke, interrupting Lu Hongtu’s train of thought: “Strategist, please continue speaking.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lu Hongtu: “Yes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He continued: “The enemy’s walls are high, and they have long since concentrated all their strength in defense; if we were to launch a full assault, it would be extremely unwise.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Although our side has an army, as is well known, they are not well-trained, and in a head-on confrontation with the regular forces of Two Note Nation, we would not hold the advantage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Thanks to the Twin Ghosts, at present the number of Nascent Soul cultivators in the enemy’s army is far fewer than that of our side.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“This point can be greatly exploited!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">At this, Lu Hongtu scanned the surroundings and said: “My suggestion is that we Nascent Soul cultivators attack on our own, launch a challenge against the enemy, and engage in dueling generals.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Upon hearing this, everyone expressed their agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The allied forces were loosely organized and filled with many strong individuals, who were more skilled in one-on-one combat rather than in group battles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">This method of dueling generals was the most suitable for the allied forces to exploit their own strengths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">While the allied forces were discussing, on the city wall the large army of Two Note Nation was also in discussion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The supervising general Zhao Xi, dressed in official attire and holding a ceremonial staff, occupied the central position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">On the left were the Machinery Princess Shuang Ling, Chief General Shuang Jing of the White Jade Camp, Chief General Mu Lan of the Red Flower Camp, Chief General Lu Chi of the Fire Cloud Camp, and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">On the right were the spiritual chef master and his disciple, Ding Pi and Jia Wan; the devoted Song Ji of Two Note Nation; and Mo Yecheng, on whose shoulder stood a mynah bird, among others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“A great battle is about to commence, yet there are those in our army who have abandoned their posts and fled the field, deserving the death penalty!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">As Shuang Jing spoke, he glared darkly at Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Zhao Xi immediately waved his hand: “The strategist of the Three Generals Camp, Ning Zhuo - I had already issued a secret order; other arrangements have been made.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“I see,” Shuang Jing immediately apologized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Although Zhao Xi knew that Shuang Jing was trying to irritate him, he still frowned in annoyance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He thought to himself: “What is up with this Ning Zhuo?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“At a moment like this, he still hasn’t returned to the camp!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“If the enemy really dispatches the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, how should I respond?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">While he was thinking this, Zhao Xi saw a cultivator flying out from among the allied forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">His figure was blurry, his entire body enveloped in a layer of bloody light and shadow, his aura surging, as if the sound of waves was spreading in bursts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">It was none other than the Blood Shadow Cave Master of the Six Cave Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Blood Shadow Cave Master opened his mouth and immediately unleashed a string of insults, decrying the many generals of Two Note Nation as incompetent and cowardly, issuing a challenge to single combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“If they do not dare, then they are all cowards.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">At that moment, Chen Lingfeng had a military art bestowed upon him called “Challenge Formation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Accompanied by his provocation, the military art unleashed its power, causing the morale of both armies to become intricately linked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Zhao Xi’s face darkened, for he feared that his apprehensions were coming to pass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“The enemy’s high-level combat power has the advantage and is being fully exerted,” he thought, feeling quite uneasy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“Who will step forward to confront him?” Zhao Xi asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">As soon as he finished speaking, a Nascent Soul cultivator shouted loudly: “I’ll go!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Everyone saw that it was Xu Dali.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Xu Dali had now become a lone commander; the entire Barbarian General Camp had been wiped out, and only he had escaped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Upon arriving at the frontline main camp, because it was located in the heart of Thousand Peaks Forest where reinforcements were hard to come by, Xu Dali had never again been in command of an organized unit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Therefore, if he wanted to make a name for himself, without the support of an army, it would be rather difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">At this moment, however, it was a rare opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Xu Dali wanted to seize it fiercely and use it to turn his fortunes around!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">However, Zhao Xi displayed a hesitant expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Other cultivators also spoke up, stating that Xu Dali was injured and should continue to rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Of course, this was a polite and tactful way of putting it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Xu Dali, anxious, immediately pounded his chest to indicate that his injuries had completely healed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He was straightforward in nature and did not grasp the implied meaning of everyone’s words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Zhao Xi was also thinking: “The first dueling general is quite important; although Xu Dali is of the Nascent Soul level, his individual combat strength is not outstanding. It’s better to let it be!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Zhao Xi scanned the surroundings with his gaze, eventually fixating on a certain cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“Thunder Master, can I entrust the first battle to you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Thunder Master’s real name was Lei Qingyang, and his cultivation was at the Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He was eight chi tall, as erect as a pine, with muscle lines chiseled like by a knife and axe, his skin revealing faint golden lightning patterns, as if electric light flowed beneath his skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He had sword-like eyebrows reaching his temples, eyes like bright stars, and it seemed as if lightning flashed in his pupils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">His nose was high and prominent like a peak, his jawline was firm, his beard and hair were all white yet showed no signs of age, and occasionally, fine sparks of electricity flitted among his hair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He wore an indigo robe adorned with lightning cloud patterns, with the Big Dipper embroidered on the sleeves and thirty-six pieces of evil-averting thunder jade attached to the hem; as he walked, the jade pieces clashed, producing clear and melodious thunder sounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Hearing Zhao Xi call him, he immediately bowed slightly, performed a Dao salute, and in a resounding voice said: “I accept the command!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He acted with lightning speed, immediately flying away from the city wall towards the Blood Shadow Cave Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The other cultivators had no objections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Lei Qingyang was an established formidable expert, renowned for a long time with profound foundation, and he specialized in the “Nine Heavens Thunder Splendor True Scripture,” mastering the divine technique of Exorcism Thunder Blast, truly among the true lords.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Zhao Xi's choice was spot-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">This was the first dueling general, and its outcome was very important, as its result often had the greatest impact on morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The two of them flew even higher; while the Blood Shadow Cave Master continued to babble, Lei Qingyang shouted sharply and struck first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He pointed his finger, and all thirty-six pieces of evil-averting thunder jade on his robe’s hem flew out, heading towards the Blood Shadow Cave Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Bang bang bang…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The evil-averting thunder jade collided with each other in mid-air, and with each collision, a flash of lightning burst forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The lightning flashed towards the Blood Shadow Cave Master, and the evil-averting power had a restraining effect on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The Blood Shadow Cave Master sneered and threw out three crimson blood pearls from his sleeve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The blood pearls swelled violently in the wind, transforming into three-headed, hundred-zhang blood jiao, enveloped in a stench of decay, and pounced ferociously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The blood jiao, with its fierce momentum, directly broke through the thirty-six pieces of evil-averting thunder jade and besieged Lei Qingyang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Lei Qingyang, with a casual sword swipe, summoned the Tian Gang Lei Ji Sword that shot up from behind him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Swordsmanship - sword qi soaring to the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Thunder technique - electric snakes dancing wildly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The sword advanced with surging sword qi, piercing through the surroundings, transforming into myriad thunder snakes with immense power, and in the blink of an eye, twisted the blood jiao into a torrent of blood rain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Seizing the momentum, Lei Qingyang pursued, using his left hand to form a gesture that summoned the Nine Heavens Cloud and Thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">In an instant, the clouds split open, and nine Zixiao Lei Wan thunder pills, resembling laughing grinding disks, crashed down, directly targeting the Blood Shadow Cave Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The Blood Shadow Cave Master’s figure suddenly dispersed into a blood mist that spread across the sky; the thunder pills pierced through the mist, turning the vast expanse of mountains below into pulverized dust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The blood mist filled the sky, and at the same time gathered above Lei Qingyang’s head, condensing into a blood curtain that obscured the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Clatter, clatter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The blood curtain thickened and coalesced, transforming into a blood river that flowed across the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The blood river backflowed, turning into a viscous blood waterfall that enveloped Lei Qingyang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Lei Qingyang’s expression changed slightly; unwilling to resist head-on, just as he intended to shift his position, his figure was immobilized in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The blood mist coiled around him, transforming into streaks of blood talismans that temporarily restrained his movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">“When did I get hit by that move?!” Lei Qingyang exclaimed in great surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">He was unable to dodge; watching as the blood waterfall descended, he could only flip his palm and summon the Lei Ze Gourd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">From the gourd’s mouth, a sheet of deep blue thundercloud was sprayed out, and it hovered above Lei Qingyang’s head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">In the next moment, the blood waterfall collided with the thundercloud, immediately hissing, and both sides engaged in a fierce exchange of forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The blood mist was evaporated into scarlet steam, seemingly to no avail; in reality, it quietly coalesced behind Lei Qingyang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">The Blood Shadow Cave Master even materialized from within it, and with a blood-transforming divine blade in hand, directly stabbed towards Lei Qingyang’s back!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Lei Qingyang’s hairs stood on end, and his body erupted with blinding electric light at full force, shattering the tip of the blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Turning around, Lei Qingyang struck with his palm, the thunder patterns on his palm transforming into the Five Thunder Seal as they hit the Blood Shadow Cave Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">The Blood Shadow Cave Master let out a cold, mocking laugh and dissipated on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">He had only lost one of his Blood Shadow clones; when his true body reappeared, it was already high in the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
