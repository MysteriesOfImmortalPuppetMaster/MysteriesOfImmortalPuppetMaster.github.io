<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Meng Yehu regarded Ning Zhuo as his divine father, offering the highest loyalty.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt slightly awkward, but his expression did not show it. He nodded calmly and said, “Rise and speak.”<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yehu stood up.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s face was emotionless, but his shining eyes had completely betrayed his feelings.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes were bright and full of excitement. He began carefully sizing up Meng Yehu with his gaze and scrutiny.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yehu was eight feet tall, with a tiger’s head and a human body, entirely dark, interspersed with strips of silvery-white light that gleamed with a metallic sheen.<br/>
<br/>
His entire mechanical body appeared strong and imposing, yet also sinister and domineering.<br/>
<br/>
Upon his tiger’s head were two mechanical components called the Yin Sha Xuan Tong, which specifically combined Yin Sha energy, used to release powerful mental pressure that caused enemies to feel oppression and fear.<br/>
<br/>
His tiger torso was covered in a layer of mechanical scales called the Shadow Shield Layered Armor, which had three layers. Fully opened, it could instantly cover his entire body. Opening two layers would cover down to the knees. Folded up, it would be considered half-body armor, only covering the upper half and leaving both arms exposed.<br/>
<br/>
Hidden on the backs of both his hands and feet were mechanical components called You Lu Claws. The You Lu Claws were extremely sharp, yet carried no sharp aura, appearing dull and lusterless.<br/>
<br/>
At his tail was a mechanical component called the Hundred Blades Hidden Edge. Within the tiger’s tail was a storage array that concealed hundreds of blades; once unleashed, they could form a blade-storm in an instant, creating extremely powerful destructive force that was difficult to defend against.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from these mechanical components, Meng Yehu’s main arrays were the You Ming Binding Soul Array and the Source Flow Guiding Array. His main talismans included the Ghost Shadow Talisman, the Nightwalking Talisman, the Yin Sha Talisman, the Black Wind Talisman, and the Mist Talisman.<br/>
<br/>
Shadowy Blade · Night Tiger!<br/>
<br/>
This mechanical puppet’s design was originally drafted by Ning Zhuo, brought about by a chance fusion of many different plans.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed haphazard, yet the more carefully Ning Zhuo observed it, the more he felt that this design was extremely superior.<br/>
<br/>
“Clearly, Meng Yehu’s mechanical body excels at concealment, stealth, and attack. He lacks a spiritual energy pool, so his combat power is explosive but unsustainable.”<br/>
<br/>
“Although he has the Shadow Shield Layered Armor, it still cannot conceal his defensive weakness.”<br/>
<br/>
“Overall, Meng Yehu belongs to the type of mechanical puppet that has fierce attacking power, weak defense, and excels at concealment and stealth!”<br/>
<br/>
Because Ning Zhuo used solid materials, the combat power of Shadowy Blade · Night Tiger reached the Golden Core level.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo observed for a moment, nodded in satisfaction, and took out the Nightwalking Thornback Diagram he had spent a large sum to acquire. He handed it to Meng Yehu.<br/>
<br/>
“Take this and study it well, strive to learn the cultivation method in it as soon as possible,” Ning Zhuo instructed.<br/>
<br/>
“As you command, Father God!” Meng Yehu once again knelt on one knee, stretching out both arms with hands raised high above his head, respectfully receiving the scroll.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yehu withdrew to one side and fully concentrated on comprehending this method.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo began crafting the Split-Soul Mirror.<br/>
<br/>
As the two were busy, time quickly slipped away.<br/>
<br/>
Southern Bean Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning Clan’s branch family.<br/>
<br/>
“One-Armed Craftsman, is the armor I requested finished?” Ning Chen walked into the refining chamber and immediately felt a surge of intense heat rushing at him, enveloping him, instantly singeing the ends of his hair into curls.<br/>
<br/>
The One-Armed Craftsman had been the top weapon refiner in the black market, now becoming an important esteemed guest of the Ning Clan’s branch family.<br/>
<br/>
Even though he was so highly placed, he did not dare be careless in front of Ning Chen.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen’s identity was straightforward, but he was a fellow student of the branch clan’s patriarch, Ning Zhuo, and deeply trusted by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The One-Armed Craftsman forced out a smile. “Brother Chen, you’ve come at just the right time. I was about to send someone to call you over for the blood sacrifice refining of this armor that’s about to come out of the furnace.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen gave a faint smile. He cast a protective spell around himself, resisting the rolling heat from outside, before walking over to stand beside the One-Armed Craftsman, facing a large magic array.<br/>
<br/>
At the center of the array raged blazing earthfire drawn here from the depths of the Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen stood before the furnace. Following the One-Armed Craftsman’s instructions, he condensed some essence blood and shot it into the furnace.<br/>
<br/>
Clang!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the furnace shook violently, letting out a sharp metallic cry.<br/>
<br/>
The One-Armed Craftsman’s expression changed abruptly, instantly becoming tense, because this was not normal.<br/>
<br/>
In the following moment, a faint green glow, like a firefly, slowly flew out, heading toward Ning Chen.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen hesitated and stepped back.<br/>
<br/>
The One-Armed Craftsman burst into laughter, his furrowed brow smoothing out. “So it was a Jade Essence, you gave me quite a scare! Brother Chen, you’re in luck.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen also revealed a look of delight, taking the Jade Essence into his hand and examining it closely.<br/>
<br/>
As the name suggests, Jade Essence was the essence of jade.<br/>
<br/>
After landing between Ning Chen’s fingers, it lost its faint glow, turning into a small, pale green jade bead.<br/>
<br/>
“Any object with a jade-like quality may nurture Jade Essence. Brother Chen, the main material of your armor is Jade-Polished Profound Steel. I never expected it to have hidden a Jade Essence.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Jade Essence is good at hiding itself. I refined that piece of Jade-Polished Profound Steel into armor, and it still remained concealed within.”<br/>
<br/>
“You just condensed essence blood to refine the armor, incidentally refining it as well, so it’s now revealed.”<br/>
<br/>
The One-Armed Craftsman shook his head, clicking his tongue in admiration.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen’s face filled with joy.<br/>
<br/>
The uses of Jade Essence were quite extensive.<br/>
<br/>
First, it could help cultivators absorb external spiritual energy, then convert and refine it before releasing a gentle yet pure spiritual power, bestowing it upon the cultivator. This spiritual power not only helped cultivators in cultivation, increasing their own mana, it could also help them quickly recover mana during battle.<br/>
<br/>
At a critical moment, Jade Essence could unleash the spiritual energy it had stored to produce a powerful defensive barrier to protect its master. This barrier could resist both weapons and spells, and could also protect the cultivator’s mind, defending against spiritual attacks.<br/>
<br/>
If Jade Essence nurtured true sentience, it might even take shape, becoming some sort of external living form to aid the cultivator in battle.<br/>
<br/>
The Jade Essence in Ning Chen’s hand had not yet developed sentience, but the way it avoided danger and remained in hiding suggested that it was not far from attaining sentience.<br/>
<br/>
Thousand Medicines Sect.<br/>
<br/>
The Little Contention Peak.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone watched the battle.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong’s fight had reached the final critical juncture.<br/>
<br/>
His opponent had displayed a trump card, splitting into three copies, each one lifelike and indistinguishable.<br/>
<br/>
All three attacked Ning Yong at once, speaking in unison: “Ning Yong, if you can see through which is my real body, I’ll admit you’re good!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong gritted his teeth. He could not see through it. At this moment, he too was like an arrow at the end of its flight, with no strength to defend fully. He could only gamble, trying to strike the real one for a chance to continue the match.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong wore an angry expression and made a random guess, striking with all his might.<br/>
<br/>
Bang.<br/>
<br/>
His opponent’s body trembled, knocked back, and the other two duplicates disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
His opponent squinted his eyes, smiling coldly. “Again.”<br/>
<br/>
He gave a shudder, splitting into three, rushing Ning Yong once more.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong forced himself to guess again, gathering his last bit of strength.<br/>
<br/>
Bang!<br/>
<br/>
His opponent staggered back several steps, spitting blood, glaring angrily at Ning Yong.<br/>
<br/>
He roared, “Again!”<br/>
<br/>
Bang!!<br/>
<br/>
The third strike was once again guessed correctly by Ning Yong, sending his opponent crashing to the ground. He struggled a bit, then finally passed out completely.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong won!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong looked at his own hands, somewhat in disbelief. “Three times in a row and I guessed right?!”<br/>
<br/>
The bystanders began talking among themselves.<br/>
<br/>
“Who’d have thought this fellow Ning Yong could see through the Triple Treasure Split-Body Technique?!”<br/>
<br/>
“This Triple Treasure Split-Body Technique draws on a cultivator’s essence, energy, and spirit to form incredibly realistic copies. Ning Yong looked like he wasn’t doing anything special, but he ended up hitting the right one each time?”<br/>
<br/>
“Heh heh, how could it be that he used no method? He just tricked us.”<br/>
<br/>
“Remember that Ning Yong was arranged here by Ning Zhuo, and they’re fellow students, so he can’t be a simple individual.”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t be fooled by his usual loud and brash demeanor; we’ve all been deceived. He clearly has scheming within. At the start of the fight, he pretended he couldn’t see through the Triple Treasure Split-Body Technique, fooling all of us.”<br/>
<br/>
“Think of Ning Zhuo—since he was arranged by Ning Zhuo, how could he be someone with only bravery?”<br/>
<br/>
As the discussion went on, everyone’s gaze toward Ning Yong changed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong realized what was happening. He threw his head back, raised his arm, and shouted loudly, “I won, I won!”<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the atmosphere was stirred up, and cheers of congratulations surged toward him like a tide.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong was so excited his face turned red.<br/>
<br/>
He loved this kind of competition atmosphere too much!<br/>
<br/>
“The Patriarch really is so wise, knows me so well, sending me here.”<br/>
<br/>
“I love this place, I love it so much!”<br/>
<br/>
“Hahaha.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong exulted with laughter in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
However, not everyone was fooled by his stroke of luck.<br/>
<br/>
Among them were two female cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan transmitted a message with her divine sense: “That Ning Yong really had some dog’s luck. He actually guessed correctly three times in a row.”<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi quietly responded: “He’s a schoolmate of Young Master Ning Zhuo, so of course he’s blessed by some of Ning Zhuo’s aura. Even a slight wisp of that aura is enough for Ning Yong to defeat a strong opponent.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan, hearing Hua Guzi’s deep admiration for Ning Zhuo and seeing how close she seemed to be, felt a surge of jealousy. She transmitted another thought: “Hmph, to think I have Ning Zhuo’s instructions to look after Ning Yong. Now that Ning Yong has won, I’m feeling itchy to find someone to spar with.”<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi let out a strange ‘gugu’ laugh, fearlessly replying in secret, “Do you want me to tie you up again and beat you till your clothes fall off? I’ll gladly oblige!”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan’s eyes twitched. She replied coldly, “From our last fight, who was it that was beaten until they went limp on the ground, screaming miserably?”<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi’s face darkened, and she slipped away into the shadows.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan followed right behind, swiftly heading to the nearest dueling arena.<br/>
<br/>
Like their dozens of private battles before, neither would stop until they were both exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Time flashed by, and a few days passed.<br/>
<br/>
Southern Bean Kingdom, Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan formally took his leave of Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning Clan specially arranged a farewell banquet for Lin Bufan, with great pomp and ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
These days, the city’s people talked most about this event.<br/>
<br/>
“Who would have thought the Ning Clan could invite a Nascent Soul-level cultivator to come support them!”<br/>
<br/>
“In this operation to hunt down the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence, Lin Bufan’s contribution was definitely huge.”<br/>
<br/>
“With Lord Meng Kui and Lord Lin Bufan joining forces—and the sacrifice of one Golden Core elder from the Zhou family —it seems that Lin Bufan’s reinforcement was vital. Otherwise, that Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence might have escaped and threatened our Fire Persimmon Immortal City.”<br/>
<br/>
“The situation has really shifted too fast lately.”<br/>
<br/>
“Who would have thought that among the city’s three major families, the Zheng family would be destroyed, with the remaining members fleeing. The Zhou family lost two out of three, clearly weakening. Meanwhile, the Ning family gained the powerful support of a Nascent Soul-level ally, and their branch family took over the Zheng family’s territory, now becoming the top cultivation clan in the city!”<br/>
<br/>
All news regarding the battle with the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence was naturally released by the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, it greatly boosted the Ning family’s reputation.<br/>
<br/>
“Younger Brother Ning, you’re welcome to visit my Thousand Medicines Sect!” Lin Bufan spoke before leaving, his voice echoing throughout the city, showing his warm regard for the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui sat in the Lava Immortal Palace, snorting at the sound.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan secretly sent a mental message: “Lord Lin, please deliver this Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence, along with these Jade Steel Heavy Armors, to Ning Zhuo as quickly as possible. He has written again pressing for them, which suggests there’s an urgent need on his side.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan gave a cold snort of displeasure. “A mere junior of the clan, a Foundation Establishment lad, dares to command an elder like this. How pompous.”<br/>
<br/>
“If it weren’t for the Fire Essence’s extreme sentience requiring my personal escort, I really wouldn’t bother making this trip.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan bowed deeply to Lin Bufan, pleading once more.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan nodded slightly, leapt into the clouds, and flew up into the sky.<br/>
<br/>
His speed was extremely fast, and in a few breaths, he vanished from sight.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, in the forest near the Fire Persimmon Mountain, Zhu Xuanji looked toward Shen Lingshu as Lin Bufan’s retreating silhouette disappeared into the horizon.<br/>
<br/>
He had just intended to quietly catch up to Lin Bufan and have him carry a letter to Ning Zhuo, but Shen Lingshu intercepted him.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu said, “Just now, my spirit flared with insight. I felt a mystical premonition, so I quickly performed a divination in my mind.”<br/>
<br/>
“I calculated that it’s best not to send this letter out now, that it will serve a greater purpose later.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji asked, “Oh? In what way?”<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu waved a hand. “We shouldn’t discuss it further, we shouldn’t discuss it further.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji fixed his gaze on the letter in his hand. “I know Ning Zhuo’s intention. For the sake of rescuing his mother, he ignored his own safety, traveling the world at the Foundation Establishment stage. This letter is especially important to him. Lord Shen, please clarify, or I won’t accept your one vague sentence.”<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu smiled. “Zhu Xuanji, once again you speak on Ning Zhuo’s behalf, defending him.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji shrugged, looking calm. “I’ve always admired those who are loyal and filial. Ning Zhuo is such a person. Helping him is what I genuinely wish to do.”<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu smiled again. “If you want to help him, then head north to the Thousand Peaks Forest.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji glared, as if saying, ‘What nonsense are you spouting? Do you think I’m an idiot?’<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo is a son of destiny. Helping him this much is enough. As for approaching him personally? Over my dead body.”<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu nodded, eyeing Zhu Xuanji with a teasing look. “If you’re dead, of course you can’t go. But if a royal decree is issued?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji immediately felt uneasy. “What royal decree?”<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu gestured into the distance. There they saw a cultivator flying toward them, who brightened on seeing Zhu Xuanji. He used his divine sense to transmit: “Lord Divine Detective, I have finally found you. There is a decree from the royal capital that you must head to the border. A great battle is about to break out in the Thousand Peaks Forest between the Two Note Kingdom and another side. You are to move out at once, stand by for orders, and support our forces stationed in the Thousand Peaks Forest.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji cried out, “What?!”<br/>
<br/>
A moment later.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, half-knelt on the ground, stood up after receiving the decree from the capital’s messenger. He looked down at the decree in his hands, brows tightly knitted, his face filled with bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
“Lord Shen, since you already foresaw this, why didn’t you warn me in advance? I could have avoided this troublesome mission!” Zhu Xuanji glared at Shen Lingshu, brimming with resentment.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu smiled faintly. “I didn’t foresee it. I recommended you.”<br/>
<br/>
“What?!” Zhu Xuanji’s eyes bulged. “You—you—you… why have you harmed me?”<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu patted him on the shoulder. “If you don’t go, then I’d have to go. Your life is much tougher than mine, and aren’t you thinking of Ning Zhuo’s interests? This is perfect!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was left speechless, only able to stare daggers at Shen Lingshu for a long time.</div>
