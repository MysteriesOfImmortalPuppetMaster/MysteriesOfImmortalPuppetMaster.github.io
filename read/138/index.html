<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Don't kill!" Sun Lingtong shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Without needing his reminder, Ning Zhuo had already given the order to the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Yuan Dasheng, being a martial arts grandmaster, could control his actions with ease and immediately halted his attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Little Zhuo, use the talismans I gave you!" Sun Lingtong added.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo nodded, "Don't worry, boss, I'm familiar with these."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo took out several talismans and rushed to Cheng Bai, sticking them on his three dantians and other vital points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The talismans activated, emitting a continuous glow that completely sealed Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Hurry and leave!" Sun Lingtong urged before his vision went black, and he fainted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Meng Kui's expression slightly changed as he observed the outcome of the battle between Cheng Bai and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The result of this battle surprised him somewhat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">When he saw Ning Zhuo applying the talismans without immediately taking Cheng Bai's life, his brows furrowed even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Immediately, he murmured softly, sending a transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Chi Han and Fei Si had been on standby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Chi Han immediately soared into the sky, heading towards the site of Cheng Bai's defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo's retreat was very timely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">By the time Chi Han landed, the place was already a wasteland, devoid of any people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Sigh, too late." Chi Han quickly used a spell, attempting to find some clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">How could Ning Zhuo have left any obvious traces?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Seeing Chi Han in action, Zhu Xuanji, who was hundreds of miles away, immediately felt a stir in his heart, "The City Lord's Mansion has started to intervene. Meng Kui's divine technique is coming to an end!" Zhu Xuanji immediately realized this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">When the entire fate energy field was activated, the City Lord's Mansion, under Meng Kui's orders, had retracted all its tendrils, remaining inactive and watching from the sidelines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zhu Xuanji understood: This was because the City Lord's Mansion and Meng Kui's fate energy were intertwined, especially Fei Si and Chi Han, who were Meng Kui's right-hand men, their fate energy closely linked and inseparable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">If the two of them were drawn into the fate energy field, Meng Kui would be unsettled and also implicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Meng Kui's divine technique ended very quickly this time, far beyond my expectations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"According to previous battle records, he could sustain the technique for a long time. This time, he restrained himself a lot, considering the citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Perhaps, he is also taking care of the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"The performance of the Lava Immortal Palace under the beast horde attack was far below expectations. Sigh, its weakness also far exceeded my expectations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhu Xuanji ceased observing the battle and moved once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He cautiously advanced towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">During this process, whenever the wind chime rang, he would halt and retreat a certain distance, ensuring his fate energy remained unaffected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As Zhu Xuanji had anticipated, the intangible and formless field of fortune was rapidly contracting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Moreover, the speed of this contraction was increasing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo retracted the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng and, along with Sun Lingtong and Cheng Bai, arrived at an underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">For over a decade, he and Sun Lingtong had secretly searched for gaps in the Immortal City, constructing more than twenty underground bases in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Many of these bases had never been used since their construction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo typically only used one of these underground basesâ€”the one his mother had left for him, which had also once held Han Ming captive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This particular underground base was small in space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Since its completion, Ning Zhuo had never returned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Primarily, it housed a healing formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Due to the solid materials used, with almost no regard for cost, the healing effects were exceptionally outstanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At the beginning of his battle with Cheng Bai, Ning Zhuo had continuously teleported, deliberately exposing over a dozen underground bases to exhaust his formidable enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">However, there was no need to expose this healing-focused underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Such exposure would be a pure waste, and Ning Zhuo was not foolish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Thus, when Sun Lingtong awoke again, weakly opening his eyes, he found himself within the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The ineffective green light points swiftly merged into his body, vigorously repairing his physical injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">As soon as Sun Lingtong woke up, he said, "Little Zhuo! Help me up, I need to disarm Cheng Bai!" Ning Zhuo immediately stopped the healing formation and brought Sun Lingtong out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Sun Lingtong was extremely weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In the recent battle, both his body and soul had been severely injured, the wounds terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">If not for the nearly miraculous Autumn Life-Saving Pill, he would likely have already perished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sun Lingtong, unable to walk on his own, leaned on Ning Zhuo for support, breathing heavily, his face pale, and soon a layer of cold sweat appeared on his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Boss, can you manage?" Ning Zhuo asked with concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Sun Lingtong extended his small hand, "Give me a Vigorous Spirit Pill."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This pill could make a cultivator enter a powerful state in a short time, significantly restoring their mana, energy, and spirit, sweeping away any fatigue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The side effect was that they would fall into a very weak and lethargic state for a long period afterward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">In fact, Ning Zhuo had already taken one during his battle with Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">At that time, he was controlling the Blue Azure Iron Armor, unleashing its ultimate stance, but failed to hit Cheng Bai's fatal spot, striking his chest instead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Afterward, with Sun Lingtong's reminder, Ning Zhuo had mustered his strength to fight again, rekindling his vigor, and charged towards Cheng Bai amidst the ruins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">It was at this moment that Ning Zhuo, within the Blue Azure Iron Armor, secretly consumed a Vigorous Spirit Pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Only one Vigorous Spirit Pill could be taken within a day; taking more would have no effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">For those with weak constitutions, taking it rashly could even result in sudden death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sun Lingtong had taken it many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">When he lost contact with his master and was saved by Ning Zhuo, he was only at the Qi Refining Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Living in the vast Fire Persimmon Immortal City was very difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sometimes, facing danger, he had no choice but to take a Vigorous Spirit Pill to cope with immense crises.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Due to frequent consumption, Sun Lingtong had gained much experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">At this moment, after taking one, his breathing immediately became rougher, and his pale cheeks turned rosy again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">His energy, spirit, and vigor surged significantly, and his eyes began to sparkle once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Even his hair stood on end, as if electrified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He lowered his head, pulled down his pants, and took a glance inside, nodding in satisfaction. "This pill is of superior grade." The superior-grade Vigorous Wind Pill could make Sun Lingtong's entire body stand tall and proud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The medium-grade one wouldn't have the same effect. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">So far, Sun Lingtong had never consumed a supreme-grade Vigorous Wind Pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Supreme-grade pills were extremely rare and often possessed miraculous effects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun Lingtong, with his head held high and chest puffed out, marched confidently towards Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Cheng Bai's body was covered with talismans and placed within a formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He was unconscious, showing no signs of waking, and his three seas of essence, qi, and spirit were precisely suppressed by the talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong extended his delicate hand and gave Cheng Bai a light slap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Cheng Bai remained motionless, but the part of his cheek that was struck swelled up visibly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun Lingtong sat down cross-legged, clasped his hands together, closed his eyes, and began to chant a profound incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">After a while, he slowly opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">His sclera and pupils were covered with spiritual light, and his hands emitted white smoke, which swirled like clouds and mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Tiny silver lights, like countless shattered diamonds, sparkled continuously within the white smoke, dazzlingly bright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Sun Lingtong's chanting grew quieter and quieter, almost to the point of being inaudible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">After a few breaths, his hands completely disappeared, replaced by two streams of cloud smoke connected to his wrists.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Void Sect Techniqueâ€”Boundless Sea Cloud Grasp!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The white cloud smoke touched Cheng Bai's body and quickly penetrated into his upper dantian's divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The cloud smoke churned, flowing endlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Moments later, the cloud smoke retracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Unlike before, it was now greatly swollen, clearly enveloping something.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong manipulated the cloud smoke to float to an empty spot beside him and then slowly dispersed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">A seal was immediately revealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">It was a square jade seal, perfectly square, resembling black jade, cold and eerie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">On the seal's surface was a human skull, as clear as crystal, with a spirit pearl clutched within its teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The pearl constantly burned with blue Nether Fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The inscription on the bottom of the seal read: "Netherworld Ghost God!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Netherworld Ghost God Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">This was not just a magical tool but a Magical Treasure! Cheng Bai had relied on this Magical Treasure to summon the avatars of the Judge and the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">This was Cheng Bai's primary treasure, the core of his combat strength, and the first item Sun Lingtong had stolen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"This kind of jade seal can be refined with yin-attributed mana. Even though we are not ghost cultivators, if we ever venture into the underworld, this will be a powerful weapon!" "Let's seal it first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sun Lingtong took out talismans and placed them on the front and back of the Magical Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">He once again stirred the white smoke, sending it surging into Cheng Bai's Sea of Consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Not long after, the white smoke returned, bringing out a rattle drum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">It was the very Soul Shaking Rattle Drum that had given Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong such a hard time in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Like the Netherworld Ghost Seal, it was also a Magical Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sun Lingtong used a talisman: easily subduing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">After all, it was not a Spiritual Treasure and did not contain spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">There were no treasures hidden in the upper dantian of the Sea of Consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">However, Sun Lingtong still extracted a lot of divine sense, storing it all in a jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He then used the Sea Gazing Cloud Catching Hand, probing into Cheng Bai's Qi Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">There were no tangible treasures in the Qi Sea, but there were quite a few spell talisman seeds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">When a cultivator practices a certain spell to a certain extent, it will form a spell talisman seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Continuing to develop along this path can also lead to the development of divine abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">However, the difficulty and cost far exceed those of innate talents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Moreover, the divine abilities formed are relatively common.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Innate talents are recognized as the soil for divine abilities, and the divine abilities condensed from them are either exceptionally powerful or uniquely extraordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Sun Lingtong used the cloud smoke to extract the talisman seeds, obtaining only some shadowy images of the seeds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He took out talisman paper, and the cloud smoke, carrying the shadowy images of the seeds, fell onto it, immediately turning the talisman paper into one talisman after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"All are top-quality, they can be sold for money!" Sun Lingtong nodded in satisfaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo, however, said, "It's better to stockpile some for ourselves first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">In the recent battle, he had almost exhausted his accumulation of Mechanical Constructs over the past ten years, leaving him feeling very uneasy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Finally, Sun Lingtong used the cloud smoke to extract a large amount of Cheng Bai's mana, infusing it into the Spirit Storage Orb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The cloud smoke formally entered the lower dantian of the Essence Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Sun Lingtong fumbled around for a while, suddenly his body shuddered, and a look of surprise appeared on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">He blurted out, "It turns out to be this item, what a treasure, what a treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
