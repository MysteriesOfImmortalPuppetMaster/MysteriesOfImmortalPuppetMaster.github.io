<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Fire Element Heart Temple!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo had used one of the Five Viscera Spirit Arts to resolve the turmoil within Gongsun Yan's divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The rage, agitation, and other turbulent emotions within Gongsun Yan's divine sea were all manifestations of heart fire, rooted in the Fire Element.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Fire Element Heart Temple transforms the heart into a divine temple, allowing Ning Zhuo's divine sense to reside within the temple's deity statue. This granted him complete mastery over the Fire Element, making him its sovereign!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">By elevating his individual will above the Fire Element, he manipulated it at will, effectively placing his personal will above the natural order of heaven and earth. No wonder the Five Elements Divine Lord incurred the wrath of heaven and earth through this Cultivation Art. Despite his efforts to pass on his legacy, the art remained nearly impossible to transmit until he encountered Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">When Ning Zhuo activated this Divine Art, he gained absolute control over the Fire Element within his own body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Now, by applying it to Gongsun Yan, he naturally gained complete dominion over all Fire Element-related aspects within Gongsun Yan's body as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">All the rage, agitation, and other turbulent emotions were instantly swept away by Ning Zhuo's Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan, absorbed into his own Fire Element Heart Temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Heart Temple's divine statue ruthlessly suppressed the raging emotions, leaving not a ripple in its wake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Compared to Gongsun Yan, Ning Zhuo's Soul, divine sea, and spiritual power were vastly superior. It was hard to imagine such a stark disparity existing between two cultivators at the same Foundation Establishment level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This outcome was part of Ning Zhuo's original plan, but as he reached this stage, a minor unexpected event occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Innate Talent - True Self!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo's third Innate Talent suddenly activated, its profound power sweeping through the Fire Element Heart Temple in an instant, obliterating all traces of anger, agitation, and other foreign emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo was momentarily stunned, then a surge of joy washed over him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He had initially intended to suppress the emotions first, then use other methods to eliminate these external influences. Instead, his third Innate Talent had completely neutralized the internal threat in a single instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">After a moment's reflection, Ning Zhuo grasped the situation: "These anger, agitation, and other emotions all originated from Gongsun Yan - they were foreign, not my own."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Therefore, under the emphasis of the True Self Talent, these external influences were completely annihilated. Because they were not mine, they were merely external forces attempting to affect me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"So, if external methods that influence the mind are applied to me, they will directly trigger my True Self Talent, significantly reducing their effectiveness or even rendering them completely useless?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This was undoubtedly a pleasant surprise for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Although he had acquired this Innate Talent, it was by chance, and he still knew very little about it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Naturally, he wanted to learn more, but time was scarce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Many more pressing matters demanded his attention. After leading the Qing-Jiao Army back to the Living Realm from the Underworld, he faced a barrage of urgent issues requiring immediate resolution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">For example, he needed to quickly establish a new understanding with the White Paper City Lord to maintain the Qing-Jiao Army's position in the Ghostly Black Marshlands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He also needed to secure time to rush to the Myriad Manifestations Sect and participate in the Flying Cloud Assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Furthermore, he planned to secretly infiltrate the Jade Cleansing Pavilion to retrieve Meng Yaoyin's personal belongings from her lifetime, providing the most solid material foundation for Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's healing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Having accomplished these tasks, Ning Zhuo finally found the opportunity to advance his Qi Sea cultivation by another level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Now that he had mastered his second Innate Spell, his immediate priority was to refine his Innate Magical Artifact. After all, this path promised a clear and significant increase in his combat strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">However, delving into Innate Talent was a different matter entirely. Ning Zhuo still lacked a deep understanding of his True Self Talent. The benefits here were far less obvious, making it unsuitable for his limited processing resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"My Mysterious Talent was already mentioned by the Five Elements Divine Lord, so I'll set that aside for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"But both my True Self Talent and Early Wisdom Talent are worth exploring. The timing just isn't right at the moment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">When properly cultivated, Innate Talent could transform into Divine Arts, greatly amplifying one's power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Divine Technique: Life Hanging by a Thread, which Ning Zhuo had mastered, had proven invaluable in both his cultivation and combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Speaking of which, I also have a second Divine Art, Stone-Forged Earth Treasure, but I haven't found much use for it yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">This was unavoidable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The latter was clearly a method designed for management and development.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">While Stone-Forged Earth Treasure could fundamentally alter the properties of targeted objects, the process was far too slow to be of any practical use in combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">One could think of it as a more powerful, comprehensive, and portable version of the Jade Cleansing Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Seeing Gongsun Yan's burning gaze fixed on the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan in his hand, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but smile. "Do you want it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Gongsun Yan's desire was overwhelming, and he nodded unconsciously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The moment he did, regret washed over him. He realized with a jolt that Ning Zhuo had him firmly in his grasp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo gently swayed the fan. "This, however, I cannot give you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">This was his Innate Magical Artifact, imprinted with the talismanic mark of his Innate Spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">If it fell into another's hands, they could study the talismanic imprint to deepen their understanding of Ning Zhuo's Innate Spell and potentially decipher a portion of the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">An Innate Spell was the essence of a Cultivation Art; understanding it meant grasping the very nature of the art itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Rejected, Gongsun Yan's throat bobbed, and he suddenly sensed a mocking amusement in Ning Zhuo's smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He snorted coldly, attempting to project an air of dominance, but instead blurted out, "What must I do to obtain this treasure?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Don't blame him for his humility - the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan offered Gongsun Yan truly immense assistance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">For ordinary cultivators, the Innate Talent Fusion Heart was an object of envy, unattainable. But for Gongsun Yan, it was also a heavy burden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Tormented by the inner fire, Gongsun Yan had lost control of his cultivation countless times. Throughout his cultivation journey, he had poured vast amounts of energy and time into managing this affliction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yet, relying solely on his own efforts, he had been unable to fully resolve this flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">This was why he had been forced to depend on the Lin Clan and their Thunderstruck Wood: Spring's Rebirth to alleviate the lingering effects of the inner fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">But this only provided temporary relief, far from the targeted solution offered by the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo sighed, sensing the desperate longing of a chronically ill person for a cure. His smile faded slightly as he said earnestly to Gongsun Yan, "This is my Innate Magical Artifact, and I cannot part with it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Gongsun Yan froze for a moment, then his expression cleared with understanding. "I see. You want me to join you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Though he had gathered some intelligence on Gongsun Yan, it had all come from Shen Xi's Flying Messages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">His secret infiltration had been solely to resolve the trouble caused by Lin Jinglong, merely a private display of his capabilities. He had never intended to poach talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Seeing Ning Zhuo's silence, Gongsun Yan assumed he had guessed correctly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">This was a common occurrence for Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His exposed Innate Talent Fusion Heart, combined with his mastery of artifact crafting, had made him highly sought after. Countless individuals and factions had approached him, eager to recruit him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Gongsun Yan said, "I signed a contract with the Lin Clan. Although I retain my personal freedom and can terminate it at any time, the contract stipulates a hefty breach of contract fee."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Seeing Ning Zhuo's silence, Gongsun Yan continued, "Don't worry, I'll cover the breach of contract fee myself. However, I'm currently short on funds, so I'll have to use future Magic Artifacts or even magic treasures I forge as collateral."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Just compensate me first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Gongsun Yan immediately frowned. "You want to tear up the contract directly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"It's not impossible, considering it's not a high-grade contract..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"But would that really benefit you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"The Lin Clan wields considerable power. Offending such a major force would hinder your cultivation. The future is uncertain; we might cross paths with Lin Clan cultivators someday."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Moreover, Young Master, as a newcomer, arbitrarily breaking someone else's contract would violate the Righteous Path. What impression would that leave on others?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"It would create a negative impression and breed suspicion, severely undermining your ability to establish a foothold in the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo stared at Gongsun Yan, speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He had miscalculated Gongsun Yan's temperament and his desperate desire for a cure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">But Ning Zhuo couldn't be entirely blamed. After all, his information about Gongsun Yan came solely from Shen Xi's Flying Message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo hadn't anticipated that a simple show of goodwill and strength would lead to this. Before he could even speak, Gongsun Yan had already answered for himself, swiftly completing his transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo shook his mechanism fan. "If Fellow Daoist Gongsun wishes to join us, you are most welcome."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Please allow me..." Gongsun Yan strained slightly, struggling against his restraints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Behind him, Sun Lingtong, who controlled him, relaxed his grip accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Gongsun Yan knelt on one knee, clasped his hands in a fist, and bowed his head to Ning Zhuo. "Gongsun Yan pays his respects to Young Master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"No need for such formality," Ning Zhuo said with a smile, immediately helping Gongsun Yan to his feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">A short while later, Gongsun Yan arrived at Lin Jinglong's cave residence and informed the gatekeeper of his intention to visit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Given Gongsun Yan's high status and the Lin Clan's customary respect for him, he was immediately granted an audience with Lin Jinglong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Lin Jinglong greeted Gongsun Yan with a warm smile, inviting him to sit and drink tea. "Brother Gongsun, if you have any requests, please don't hesitate to ask. If I can assist, I will spare no effort."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Gongsun Yan nodded. "Indeed, I require your assistance, Young Master Lin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Lin Jinglong waved his hand dismissively. "Brother Gongsun, just call me Jinglong. We're not in public here - it's just the two of us. How can I help you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Gongsun Yan produced a Ghost Path Golden Core. "This should be sufficient to compensate the Lin Clan for my breach of contract."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Lin Jinglong: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">After a moment of stunned silence, Lin Jinglong reacted, his face a mixture of shock and suspicion. He instinctively rose to his feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He stared at Gongsun Yan. "Brother Gongsun, have I done something wrong? Why do you want to leave me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Gongsun Yan replied truthfully, "I've simply found someone more worthy of my allegiance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Who is it?" Lin Jinglong pressed. His gaze fixed on the Ghost Path Golden Core, and he suddenly recalled the one Shen Xi had shown Situ Xing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Could it be?!" A wave of intense unease washed over Lin Jinglong, mingled with a desperate sliver of hope. He stared intently at Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Gongsun Yan nodded, delivering the words that made Lin Jinglong's vision swim: "Young Master Lin has likely already guessed. Yes, the one who recruited me was Young Master Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Lin Jinglong was utterly dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Shen Xi had been right all along. In Lin Jinglong's original plan, Gongsun Yan was supposed to be one of the subordinates used to target Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Yet before Lin Jinglong had even met Ning Zhuo in person, one of his most trusted subordinates had defected to the enemy with such startling ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Was this even possible?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">You're supposed to be our opponent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Impressive tactics, Ning Zhuo, aren't they? Truly impressive!" Lin Jinglong gritted his teeth, his anger simmering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This was a blatant slap in the face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">His own subordinate had suddenly defected to the enemy. What would outsiders think of Lin Jinglong now? The entire Lin Clan would suffer, their reputation tarnished - easily outmaneuvered by their rivals, unable to retain talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Forcing down his rage, Lin Jinglong turned to Gongsun Yan and asked, "Brother Gongsun, what price did Ning Zhuo offer to make you switch sides? The Lin Clan isn't poor, and we've never mistreated you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Gongsun Yan shook his head. "I'd rather not discuss the details. As for mistreatment, I've forged numerous high-quality Magic Artifacts for the Lin Clan, fulfilling the terms of our contract. I haven't wronged the Lin Clan either."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Lin Jinglong could only grit his teeth. "That's true, but Brother Gongsun..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Gongsun Yan interrupted him by producing a Flying Message and handing it to Lin Jinglong. "This contains Young Master Ning Zhuo's battle strategy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Lin Jinglong unfolded the letter, his fury intensifying. "Very well, I was just about to settle accounts with you. Yet you come to my door, challenging me to a secret duel? Hmph, do you think the Lin Clan's proud son is so easily bullied?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">----</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Yes, he is that easily bullied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Fueled by rage, Lin Jinglong unleashed a barrage of Wood Element Spells, but none could touch Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">The Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan's wind covered the entire dueling arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Lin Jinglong's Yi Wood Lightning Spell struck Ning Zhuo, but to no avail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">A Defensive Magic Artifact flew from Ning Zhuo's body, easily repelling the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">The artifact's quality sent a chill down Lin Jinglong's spine. After his futile attempts, he was forced back by the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan, cornered at the edge of the arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Seeing Lin Jinglong on the verge of defeat, Ning Zhuo retracted the mechanical fan, a smile spreading across his face. "Fellow Daoist Lin, how about we call this a draw?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Lin Jinglong gritted his teeth, letting out a cold laugh. "Fine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">He then produced the Contract and, in front of Gongsun Yan, handed it to Ning Zhuo on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">This was the very reason Ning Zhuo had challenged him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Ning Zhuo summoned Gongsun Yan and immediately passed the Contract to him. After verifying its authenticity, Gongsun Yan burned it without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Having already paid the breach of contract penalty, Lin Jinglong suffered no backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Farewell," Lin Jinglong said, eager to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Wait," Ning Zhuo called out, his expression sincere. "Brother Lin, your clan's cultivation art is truly remarkable. The Spring Thunder technique you unleashed was lightning-fast. Fortunately, I happened to possess a defensive magic artifact."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Lin Jinglong nodded stiffly. "That much is true."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo's display of either the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan or the defensive magic artifact impressed Lin Jinglong with his wealth, while subtly diminishing his assessment of Ning Zhuo's personal combat prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo immediately proposed hosting a banquet for Lin Jinglong to continue their discussion, hoping to turn their rivalry into friendship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The phrase "turn rivalry into friendship" struck a chord with Lin Jinglong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">As a scion of a great clan, Lin Jinglong had received extensive education from a young age, giving him a broader perspective than his peers and the dignified bearing of a noble family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">To this day, Lin Jinglong remained unaware of the exorbitant price Ning Zhuo had paid to poach talent from the Lin Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Very well," Lin Jinglong said, forcing a smile as he accepted Ning Zhuo's invitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Shortly after.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">Inside Yu Heye's cave dwelling, Lin Jinglong and Ning Zhuo were honored guests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">Ning Zhuo shared his insights on the Wood Element, and after hearing just the first three sentences, Lin Jinglong's expression changed dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">After listening further, he quickly adopted an attitude of humble inquiry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">When Shen Xi and Su Lingkou arrived at the banquet, they found Ning Zhuo and the others exchanging toasts and engaging in lively conversation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">The cousins exchanged puzzled glances. Why did this scene feel so familiar?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">Ning Zhuo greeted them warmly, "Brother Shen, you've arrived! Please, take a seat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">"I'm not fond of conflict, but I excel at resolving it," Ning Zhuo continued. "The purpose of inviting you both here today is to resolve your differences. Let's exchange ideas and progress together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">Before Shen Xi could respond, Lin Jinglong nodded vigorously. "Indeed, indeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">Su Lingkou's expression turned wary, suspecting that Lin Jinglong and Ning Zhuo had already reached some secret agreement. "What about the ranking of our mountain peaks?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">Ning Zhuo chuckled. "That's simple! How about we settle it with rock-paper-scissors?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">Su Lingkou scoffed. "Can we really decide something so important so casually?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="286">But Lin Jinglong clapped his hands and burst into laughter. "An excellent suggestion, Brother Ning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="288">Shen Xi finally caught on. "Indeed, a brilliant idea."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="290">Su Lingkou: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
