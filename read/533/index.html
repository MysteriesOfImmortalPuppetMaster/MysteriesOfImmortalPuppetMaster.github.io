<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the midst of the dense mountains and forests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Lin Bufan was like an arrow shot from a bow, swiftly darting through the forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He lightly tapped the tree branches with his toes; his green robe dragged a jade-colored afterimage in the morning mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Suddenly, the tree branches before him turned into a swarm of snakes, multicolored, each opening its mouth to bite Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This sudden change was so abrupt, as if Lin Bufan had thrown himself into a trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Lin Bufan’s eyes flashed with a cold light, without the slightest hint of surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He pointed his finger, and the flying sword Cuijian shot out like lightning, piercing into the “snake nest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In the next moment, countless green sword radiances, like tender sprouts emerging from the grass, swarmed out, piercing and exterminating the myriad spotted poisonous snakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The poisonous snakes’ fragmented limbs and remains fell to the ground, transforming back into broken branches and withered leaves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Gao Cuo’s voice came from all around: “Fellow Daoist, you have worked hard; you treat each of my illusions with due seriousness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“However, in doing so, fellow Daoist, your consumption of spiritual energy far exceeds mine; how long can you support it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">His voice was filled with mockery and ridicule.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Lin Bufan snorted coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">It was not that he was too straightforward, but that the previous clash had already made him understand that these illusions were not purely fictitious; left unchecked, their development would cause even greater harm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“I could still sustain for seven days and seven nights.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“But do you have that kind of time to continue chasing and killing me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Lin Bufan retorted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Gao Cuo’s expression momentarily froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He had responsibilities, after all. The situation at the frontline camp of the Thousand Peak Forest Alliance was already different from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Lord Long had returned and reorganized the entire camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">If he did not return for long, he would likely be deemed a deserter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">That would be extremely bad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Sword Old chuckled and said, “Little Gao, have you learned your lesson?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Gao Cuo nodded slightly: “It was my mistake; after my initial attempt to launch a surprise attack on Lin Bufan failed, I conveniently concealed the battlefield.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“It was precisely this step that allowed Lin Bufan to guess my intentions, and now he is wholeheartedly fleeing, which is really annoying.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Sword Old, when will you be able to muster the power for a decisive strike again?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Sword Old sighed: “It will take another two days.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“And even if it were available, given the target’s temperament and abilities, I’m afraid it wouldn’t have the same effect as the previous surprise attack.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Time is your greatest shortcoming.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“If this battle drags on for too long, not only will you have a hard time reporting back, but it will also easily lead to unforeseen complications. Your battle with him could very well attract other cultivators.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Perhaps, it is time to retreat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Gao Cuo gritted his teeth, unwilling to accept defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He fell silent for a moment, then replied, “Last time, the Evil God’s Bone of Bikong Mountain had already been taken.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“This time, the Wood-in-Fire is equally important to me; must I also let it slip away?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Sword Old, from now on, I will launch a full assault!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Sword Old laughed softly: “This is your cultivation. Your choices are naturally under your own control. Since you have already decided, then let loose and go all out!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Alright!” Gao Cuo responded loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In the next moment, he exerted his full strength, and as his sleeve and robe billowed, seven illusionary duplicates split off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The illusions chased Lin Bufan from different directions, each burning with purple-black flames, with an astonishing might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">A chill ran through Lin Bufan’s heart as he commanded his flying sword to circle around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The flying sword Cuijian, moving at incredible speed, drew a circle in mid-air, completely shattering the illusory duplicates along its path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">But when it flew beside Lin Bufan, his heart sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He saw that the flying sword had been eroded by numerous purple-black markings, and his connection to it had dropped by more than half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Gao Cuo continued his attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">His true form diffused like ink, and within a few breaths, transformed into a rolling purple-black mist barrier, enveloping an area of ten li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Caught off guard, Lin Bufan was shrouded in the purple smoke, and he hurriedly activated his magical treasure to defend himself with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">In the next moment, the heavens and earth suddenly cleared, and the purple-black mist barrier abruptly vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Cold sweat dripped from Lin Bufan’s forehead: “What a formidable illusion! It’s exactly the same as the forest before the confrontation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He intended to retreat, but found that he was moving forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">When he tried to move left, he ended up moving to the right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Is it an illusion, or has my sense of direction become severely disoriented?” While Lin Bufan was pondering, Gao Cuo’s attack suddenly approached him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Boom boom boom…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A series of resounding booms, shaking the heavens and the earth, enveloped Lin Bufan in smoke and dust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Yet in his sight, the heavens and earth remained clear, with neither the distant mountains nor the nearby trees showing any sign of damage or change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ten Li Burning Forest, Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo infused his spiritual sense into a jade slip and examined Zhao Xi’s letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhao Xi had greatly praised the Three Generals Camp in his heart and briefly explained the situation regarding the main army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">It turned out that after the Three Generals Camp had departed, a squad of cultivators all at the Nascent Soul level had infiltrated the battlefield to seize important treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Naturally, the main army would not allow their spoils to be stolen right under the enemy’s nose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Therefore, each general mobilized and engaged in several rounds of fighting with the enemy led by the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">However, in the end, the ghost cultivators still managed to take away two heavyweight treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In this round of confrontation, the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts demonstrated an extraordinarily powerful overall strength, suppressing the main army’s Nascent Soul cultivators to the point that they could not lift their heads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The two were extremely arrogant, and even after being discovered, still attempted to destroy the dragon-shaped giant talisman deep underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">At a critical moment, Zhao Xi intervened, employing the national ritual staff, expending national power bricks, and performing national martial arts to repel the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“With just this battle, the main army lost face, while Zhao Xi instead managed to turn the tide and earned merit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Everyone else was losing face, which starkly contrasted with the good news our Three Generals Camp delivered.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Zhao Xi took the opportunity to suppress and seize more power… No wonder he was so delighted, having exchanged his battle merits for items and sent them here in advance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo understood the reason, and then looked at the Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This talisman was not in the usual long strip form, but rather a leaf.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The front of the leaf was white, the back black, and the leaf veins occasionally shimmered with a hint of orange-yellow flowing light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">If it were daytime, holding the leaf up to the sunlight would cause countless golden spots to appear on its front; if it were night and there was a moon, the back would display layers of moon halos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Even before Ning Zhuo had infused it with spiritual energy, merely by letting his spiritual sense permeate and observe, he could sense the vigorous vitality of this talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He had previously communicated with Zhao Xi, who had then introduced him to the Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This talisman was created by the royal family of the Three Suns Kingdom and was presented to Two Note Nation, making it a national-level gift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The royal family of Three Suns Kingdom primarily practiced the “Three Suns Supreme Origin Technique,” and by using this treasure talisman, Ning Zhuo would possess the advantage of the “Three Suns Supreme Origin Technique” during the nascent treasure cultivation stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“I didn’t expect Zhao Xi to deliver this talisman into my hands so quickly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“It was very likely that he had begun to operate right after our last communication.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Although this person was somewhat greedy, having given bribes, he truly got things done! No wonder he remains enduring; even if reported multiple times, he can still stand unyielding in the court of the Two Note Nation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">After Ning Zhuo examined it for a moment, he was certain that there was no trickery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He then had Sun Lingtong use his innate talent to test it, and no issues were found.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“The mechanism ring also showed no reaction.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo no longer hesitated, activated this treasure talisman, and began its first use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman radiated light, then instantly disintegrated, transforming into three strands of orange light, which shot into Ning Zhuo’s Spirit Sea, Qi Sea, and Essence Sea dantians respectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Without Ning Zhuo having to activate the three supreme methods, his divine power, spiritual energy, and essence began to operate autonomously along the path of the “Three Suns Supreme Origin Technique.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In Ning Zhuo’s three major dantians, three suns appeared respectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The suns hung high in the sky, continuously drawing in divine power, spiritual energy, and essence, then expelling them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">In an instant, the three dantians were bathed in sunlight, and countless treasure pills began to grow in profusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo was dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“Such efficiency is not less than a hundred times what I had before.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“The Three Suns Supreme Origin Technique is truly deserving of being the primary cultivation method of a nation’s royal family; it’s incredibly powerful!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo stood up and tried engaging in some other activities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He was pleasantly surprised to find that even when he fought, cast spells, or performed vigorous physical movements, it did not interfere with the autonomous operation of the Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“The only drawback is that the Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman consumes a great deal of essence, energy, and spirit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“If a real battle were to start, it wouldn’t be possible to let it continually drain my strength.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">After experiencing it for the time it took to drink half a cup of tea, Ning Zhuo immediately terminated the operation of the talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">At the merest thought, he projected three strands of orange light from his three major dantians; the orange light converged in the air and then reverted back into the previous treasure talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">The talisman, as light as a falling leaf, drifted down and landed into Ning Zhuo’s outstretched palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Ning Zhuo carefully examined the talisman and keenly noticed that the leaf patterns on it had become slightly blurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">“It seems the material of the talisman is quite good, allowing me to use it for a long period.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">This treasure talisman, being a gift among the cultivation nations, naturally had the best quality talisman material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">“Zhao Xi really did me a huge favor this time!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">“In this way, the efficiency increased a hundredfold, and soon I would be able to break through the second stage of treasure pill cultivation and advance to the third stage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">Ning Zhuo’s eyes filled with anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">In his own practice of the three supreme methods, at this stage of cultivation, he already possessed enormous advantages that most cultivators could not even approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Now, with the added boon of the Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman, it was like a tiger gaining wings!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">“I must also thank Liu, Guan, and Zhang…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">This time, exchanging for the talisman consumed most of the battle merits, and the gains of Liu, Guan, and Zhang were incomparable to Ning Zhuo’s.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">They had volunteered and actively offered to help Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">“Little Zhuo, our investment in the Three Generals Camp has finally begun to yield encouraging returns.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">In the mechanical dragon, Sun Lingtong was also quite pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">But subsequently, their mood turned sour.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Ning Zhuo, not waiting for Lin Bufan to come find him, realized something was amiss and went near the Ten Li Burning Forest to begin searching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Gao Cuo had concealed the battlefield, and as a result, even though Sun Lingtong possessed innate talent, the detection capability of the mechanical dragon was quite remarkable, and still no trace or clue was found.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">“Something must have happened over at Lin Bufan’s side.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">“I hope he can handle it properly and overcome the difficulty.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">Ning Zhuo did not continue his search.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Mainly because he had no way of contacting Lin Bufan. In these vast mountains, finding Lin Bufan was an extremely arduous task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">With Lin Bufan nowhere to be seen, the Wood-in-Fire naturally had to be postponed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Ning Zhuo quickly adjusted his mindset, returned to the Three Generals Camp, and resumed his vigorous cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">The Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman was very convenient to use; Ning Zhuo carried it on him almost day and night, continuously using it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">He devoted most of his time to the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">The battle at the Ten Li Burning Forest had already allowed Ning Zhuo to taste the sweetness of victoy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Now, as his physical foundation grew stronger, and with the leverage of military tactics, the battle power he could unleash became even stronger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">Two days later, a group of troops arrived at the Ten Li Burning Forest, and while taking control of the area, also brought Zhao Xi’s mobilization order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Order -Three Generals Camp, campaign against the Thousand Vine Talisman Heavenly Corridor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning were not surprised; this campaign target was exactly what they had previously proposed to Zhao Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">Having someone in charge up above made things convenient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">Zhao Xi successfully delivered this military order into the hands of the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">The Three Generals Camp had long been prepared; they uprooted their camp, set up fortifications, and swiftly marched towards the Thousand Vine Talisman Heavenly Corridor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">The Thousand Vine Talisman Heavenly Corridor was a corridor built among the peaks; through its meticulous construction, it allowed the divine energies of heaven and earth to shuttle through it, forming an artificial spiritual vein.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">And the planted Fu Leaf Vines, during their growth and influenced by the corridor itself, eventually grew into specific vine leaf talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning had long planned and led their troops to choose the middle section of the corridor for a full-scale assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">Just a moment ago, the vine wall had been silent, but suddenly it awakened; hundreds of vines suddenly shed their green, transforming into a dark iron hue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">The talismans on the vine leaves were activated, shooting out thousands of sharp arrows, enveloping the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">Battle formation -the Iron Barrel Formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">The Three Generals Camp had long been on high alert, defending without a single gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">A large area of the vine leaves was expended, and a section of the vine wall on the left turned crimson.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">In an instant, the vine leaf talismans transformed into countless streams of flames, shooting towards the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">Liu Er applied military tactics, enhancing the protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">Guan Hong swung his blade, cleaving through the raging streams of flame, hitting the corridor at the mountainside, instantly breaking its surface and exposing its interior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">Some enemy cultivators, in a panic, fled from the breach, retreating deep into the corridors on both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">Soon, on this section of the corridor, due to the complete consumption of the vine leaf talismans, its resistance plummeted to rock bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">After the defending cultivators lost a dozen bodies, they all retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="286">The battle began smoothly, but the real difficulty was yet to come.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="288">The Three Generals Camp could not attack in the same manner -on one hand, it would take too long and consume too many troops; on the other, depleting the vine leaf talismans here would result in too great a loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="290">Moreover, these losses were directly related to their battle merits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="292">“It is better to attack from within, so as not to trigger the vine leaves’ defenses.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="294">“But in that case, there would be no space to form a formation. Using only one squad of soldiers to form a formation would greatly diminish its effectiveness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="296">“Let my mechanized army try first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="298">Ning Zhuo proposed proactively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="300">He had three major mechanized platforms and could swiftly create mechanized puppets. This kind of attrition war was perfectly suited for his mechanized army!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="302">The Three Generals Camp soon took new action; while the main force remained stationed in place, the mechanized army launched a full-scale attack on both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="304">The Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts lurked in the shadows, taking in the entire scene with their eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="306">“The main force of the Three Generals Camp is still in formation, which is troublesome.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="308">“Ning Zhuo has already left the army and is operating alone; once he is a bit farther away from Liu, Guan, and Zhang, the two of us will launch a surprise attack!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
