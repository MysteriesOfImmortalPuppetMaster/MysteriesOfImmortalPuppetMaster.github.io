<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
In the midst of the dense mountains and forests.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan was like an arrow shot from a bow, swiftly darting through the forest.<br/>
<br/>
He lightly tapped the tree branches with his toes; his green robe dragged a jade-colored afterimage in the morning mist.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the tree branches before him turned into a swarm of snakes, multicolored, each opening its mouth to bite Lin Bufan.<br/>
<br/>
This sudden change was so abrupt, as if Lin Bufan had thrown himself into a trap.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan’s eyes flashed with a cold light, without the slightest hint of surprise.<br/>
<br/>
He pointed his finger, and the flying sword Cuijian shot out like lightning, piercing into the “snake nest.”<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, countless green sword radiances, like tender sprouts emerging from the grass, swarmed out, piercing and exterminating the myriad spotted poisonous snakes.<br/>
<br/>
The poisonous snakes’ fragmented limbs and remains fell to the ground, transforming back into broken branches and withered leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo’s voice came from all around: “Fellow Daoist, you have worked hard; you treat each of my illusions with due seriousness.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, in doing so, fellow Daoist, your consumption of spiritual energy far exceeds mine; how long can you support it?”<br/>
<br/>
His voice was filled with mockery and ridicule.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan snorted coldly.<br/>
<br/>
It was not that he was too straightforward, but that the previous clash had already made him understand that these illusions were not purely fictitious; left unchecked, their development would cause even greater harm.<br/>
<br/>
“I could still sustain for seven days and seven nights.”<br/>
<br/>
“But do you have that kind of time to continue chasing and killing me?”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan retorted.<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo’s expression momentarily froze.<br/>
<br/>
He had responsibilities, after all. The situation at the frontline camp of the Thousand Peak Forest Alliance was already different from before.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long had returned and reorganized the entire camp.<br/>
<br/>
If he did not return for long, he would likely be deemed a deserter.<br/>
<br/>
That would be extremely bad.<br/>
<br/>
Sword Old chuckled and said, “Little Gao, have you learned your lesson?”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo nodded slightly: “It was my mistake; after my initial attempt to launch a surprise attack on Lin Bufan failed, I conveniently concealed the battlefield.”<br/>
<br/>
“It was precisely this step that allowed Lin Bufan to guess my intentions, and now he is wholeheartedly fleeing, which is really annoying.”<br/>
<br/>
“Sword Old, when will you be able to muster the power for a decisive strike again?”<br/>
<br/>
Sword Old sighed: “It will take another two days.”<br/>
<br/>
“And even if it were available, given the target’s temperament and abilities, I’m afraid it wouldn’t have the same effect as the previous surprise attack.”<br/>
<br/>
“Time is your greatest shortcoming.”<br/>
<br/>
“If this battle drags on for too long, not only will you have a hard time reporting back, but it will also easily lead to unforeseen complications. Your battle with him could very well attract other cultivators.”<br/>
<br/>
“Perhaps, it is time to retreat.”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo gritted his teeth, unwilling to accept defeat.<br/>
<br/>
He fell silent for a moment, then replied, “Last time, the Evil God’s Bone of Bikong Mountain had already been taken.”<br/>
<br/>
“This time, the Wood-in-Fire is equally important to me; must I also let it slip away?”<br/>
<br/>
“Sword Old, from now on, I will launch a full assault!”<br/>
<br/>
Sword Old laughed softly: “This is your cultivation. Your choices are naturally under your own control. Since you have already decided, then let loose and go all out!”<br/>
<br/>
“Alright!” Gao Cuo responded loudly.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, he exerted his full strength, and as his sleeve and robe billowed, seven illusionary duplicates split off.<br/>
<br/>
The illusions chased Lin Bufan from different directions, each burning with purple-black flames, with an astonishing might.<br/>
<br/>
A chill ran through Lin Bufan’s heart as he commanded his flying sword to circle around him.<br/>
<br/>
The flying sword Cuijian, moving at incredible speed, drew a circle in mid-air, completely shattering the illusory duplicates along its path.<br/>
<br/>
But when it flew beside Lin Bufan, his heart sank.<br/>
<br/>
He saw that the flying sword had been eroded by numerous purple-black markings, and his connection to it had dropped by more than half.<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo continued his attack.<br/>
<br/>
His true form diffused like ink, and within a few breaths, transformed into a rolling purple-black mist barrier, enveloping an area of ten li.<br/>
<br/>
Caught off guard, Lin Bufan was shrouded in the purple smoke, and he hurriedly activated his magical treasure to defend himself with all his might.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the heavens and earth suddenly cleared, and the purple-black mist barrier abruptly vanished.<br/>
<br/>
Cold sweat dripped from Lin Bufan’s forehead: “What a formidable illusion! It’s exactly the same as the forest before the confrontation.”<br/>
<br/>
He intended to retreat, but found that he was moving forward.<br/>
<br/>
When he tried to move left, he ended up moving to the right.<br/>
<br/>
“Is it an illusion, or has my sense of direction become severely disoriented?” While Lin Bufan was pondering, Gao Cuo’s attack suddenly approached him.<br/>
<br/>
Boom boom boom…<br/>
<br/>
A series of resounding booms, shaking the heavens and the earth, enveloped Lin Bufan in smoke and dust.<br/>
<br/>
Yet in his sight, the heavens and earth remained clear, with neither the distant mountains nor the nearby trees showing any sign of damage or change.<br/>
<br/>
Ten Li Burning Forest, Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo infused his spiritual sense into a jade slip and examined Zhao Xi’s letter.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi had greatly praised the Three Generals Camp in his heart and briefly explained the situation regarding the main army.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that after the Three Generals Camp had departed, a squad of cultivators all at the Nascent Soul level had infiltrated the battlefield to seize important treasures.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, the main army would not allow their spoils to be stolen right under the enemy’s nose.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, each general mobilized and engaged in several rounds of fighting with the enemy led by the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
However, in the end, the ghost cultivators still managed to take away two heavyweight treasures.<br/>
<br/>
In this round of confrontation, the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts demonstrated an extraordinarily powerful overall strength, suppressing the main army’s Nascent Soul cultivators to the point that they could not lift their heads.<br/>
<br/>
The two were extremely arrogant, and even after being discovered, still attempted to destroy the dragon-shaped giant talisman deep underground.<br/>
<br/>
At a critical moment, Zhao Xi intervened, employing the national ritual staff, expending national power bricks, and performing national martial arts to repel the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
“With just this battle, the main army lost face, while Zhao Xi instead managed to turn the tide and earned merit.”<br/>
<br/>
“Everyone else was losing face, which starkly contrasted with the good news our Three Generals Camp delivered.”<br/>
<br/>
“Zhao Xi took the opportunity to suppress and seize more power… No wonder he was so delighted, having exchanged his battle merits for items and sent them here in advance.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo understood the reason, and then looked at the Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman before him.<br/>
<br/>
This talisman was not in the usual long strip form, but rather a leaf.<br/>
<br/>
The front of the leaf was white, the back black, and the leaf veins occasionally shimmered with a hint of orange-yellow flowing light.<br/>
<br/>
If it were daytime, holding the leaf up to the sunlight would cause countless golden spots to appear on its front; if it were night and there was a moon, the back would display layers of moon halos.<br/>
<br/>
Even before Ning Zhuo had infused it with spiritual energy, merely by letting his spiritual sense permeate and observe, he could sense the vigorous vitality of this talisman.<br/>
<br/>
He had previously communicated with Zhao Xi, who had then introduced him to the Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman.<br/>
<br/>
This talisman was created by the royal family of the Three Suns Kingdom and was presented to Twin Rivers Nation, making it a national-level gift.<br/>
<br/>
The royal family of Three Suns Kingdom primarily practiced the “Three Suns Supreme Origin Technique,” and by using this treasure talisman, Ning Zhuo would possess the advantage of the “Three Suns Supreme Origin Technique” during the nascent treasure cultivation stage!<br/>
<br/>
“I didn’t expect Zhao Xi to deliver this talisman into my hands so quickly.”<br/>
<br/>
“It was very likely that he had begun to operate right after our last communication.”<br/>
<br/>
“Although this person was somewhat greedy, having given bribes, he truly got things done! No wonder he remains enduring; even if reported multiple times, he can still stand unyielding in the court of the Twin Rivers Nation!”<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo examined it for a moment, he was certain that there was no trickery.<br/>
<br/>
He then had Sun Lingtong use his innate talent to test it, and no issues were found.<br/>
<br/>
“The mechanism ring also showed no reaction.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo no longer hesitated, activated this treasure talisman, and began its first use.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman radiated light, then instantly disintegrated, transforming into three strands of orange light, which shot into Ning Zhuo’s Spirit Sea, Qi Sea, and Essence Sea dantians respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Without Ning Zhuo having to activate the three supreme methods, his divine power, spiritual energy, and essence began to operate autonomously along the path of the “Three Suns Supreme Origin Technique.”<br/>
<br/>
In Ning Zhuo’s three major dantians, three suns appeared respectively.<br/>
<br/>
The suns hung high in the sky, continuously drawing in divine power, spiritual energy, and essence, then expelling them.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the three dantians were bathed in sunlight, and countless treasure pills began to grow in profusion.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was dumbfounded.<br/>
<br/>
“Such efficiency is not less than a hundred times what I had before.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Three Suns Supreme Origin Technique is truly deserving of being the primary cultivation method of a nation’s royal family; it’s incredibly powerful!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood up and tried engaging in some other activities.<br/>
<br/>
He was pleasantly surprised to find that even when he fought, cast spells, or performed vigorous physical movements, it did not interfere with the autonomous operation of the Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman.<br/>
<br/>
“The only drawback is that the Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman consumes a great deal of essence, energy, and spirit.”<br/>
<br/>
“If a real battle were to start, it wouldn’t be possible to let it continually drain my strength.”<br/>
After experiencing it for the time it took to drink half a cup of tea, Ning Zhuo immediately terminated the operation of the talisman.<br/>
<br/>
At the merest thought, he projected three strands of orange light from his three major dantians; the orange light converged in the air and then reverted back into the previous treasure talisman.<br/>
<br/>
The talisman, as light as a falling leaf, drifted down and landed into Ning Zhuo’s outstretched palm.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully examined the talisman and keenly noticed that the leaf patterns on it had become slightly blurred.<br/>
<br/>
“It seems the material of the talisman is quite good, allowing me to use it for a long period.”<br/>
<br/>
This treasure talisman, being a gift among the cultivation nations, naturally had the best quality talisman material.<br/>
<br/>
“Zhao Xi really did me a huge favor this time!”<br/>
<br/>
“In this way, the efficiency increased a hundredfold, and soon I would be able to break through the second stage of treasure pill cultivation and advance to the third stage.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes filled with anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
In his own practice of the three supreme methods, at this stage of cultivation, he already possessed enormous advantages that most cultivators could not even approach.<br/>
<br/>
Now, with the added boon of the Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman, it was like a tiger gaining wings!<br/>
<br/>
“I must also thank Liu, Guan, and Zhang…”<br/>
<br/>
This time, exchanging for the talisman consumed most of the battle merits, and the gains of Liu, Guan, and Zhang were incomparable to Ning Zhuo’s.<br/>
<br/>
They had volunteered and actively offered to help Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, our investment in the Three Generals Camp has finally begun to yield encouraging returns.”<br/>
<br/>
In the mechanical dragon, Sun Lingtong was also quite pleased.<br/>
<br/>
But subsequently, their mood turned sour.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, not waiting for Lin Bufan to come find him, realized something was amiss and went near the Ten Li Burning Forest to begin searching.<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo had concealed the battlefield, and as a result, even though Sun Lingtong possessed innate talent, the detection capability of the mechanical dragon was quite remarkable, and still no trace or clue was found.<br/>
<br/>
“Something must have happened over at Lin Bufan’s side.”<br/>
<br/>
“I hope he can handle it properly and overcome the difficulty.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not continue his search.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly because he had no way of contacting Lin Bufan. In these vast mountains, finding Lin Bufan was an extremely arduous task.<br/>
<br/>
With Lin Bufan nowhere to be seen, the Wood-in-Fire naturally had to be postponed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly adjusted his mindset, returned to the Three Generals Camp, and resumed his vigorous cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Enclosures Treasure Talisman was very convenient to use; Ning Zhuo carried it on him almost day and night, continuously using it.<br/>
<br/>
He devoted most of his time to the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat.<br/>
<br/>
The battle at the Ten Li Burning Forest had already allowed Ning Zhuo to taste the sweetness of victoy.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as his physical foundation grew stronger, and with the leverage of military tactics, the battle power he could unleash became even stronger!<br/>
<br/>
Two days later, a group of troops arrived at the Ten Li Burning Forest, and while taking control of the area, also brought Zhao Xi’s mobilization order.<br/>
<br/>
Order -Three Generals Camp, campaign against the Thousand Vine Talisman Heavenly Corridor!<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning were not surprised; this campaign target was exactly what they had previously proposed to Zhao Xi.<br/>
<br/>
Having someone in charge up above made things convenient.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi successfully delivered this military order into the hands of the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp had long been prepared; they uprooted their camp, set up fortifications, and swiftly marched towards the Thousand Vine Talisman Heavenly Corridor.<br/>
<br/>
The Thousand Vine Talisman Heavenly Corridor was a corridor built among the peaks; through its meticulous construction, it allowed the divine energies of heaven and earth to shuttle through it, forming an artificial spiritual vein.<br/>
<br/>
And the planted Fu Leaf Vines, during their growth and influenced by the corridor itself, eventually grew into specific vine leaf talismans.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning had long planned and led their troops to choose the middle section of the corridor for a full-scale assault.<br/>
<br/>
Just a moment ago, the vine wall had been silent, but suddenly it awakened; hundreds of vines suddenly shed their green, transforming into a dark iron hue.<br/>
<br/>
The talismans on the vine leaves were activated, shooting out thousands of sharp arrows, enveloping the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Battle formation -the Iron Barrel Formation!<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp had long been on high alert, defending without a single gap.<br/>
<br/>
A large area of the vine leaves was expended, and a section of the vine wall on the left turned crimson.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the vine leaf talismans transformed into countless streams of flames, shooting towards the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er applied military tactics, enhancing the protection.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong swung his blade, cleaving through the raging streams of flame, hitting the corridor at the mountainside, instantly breaking its surface and exposing its interior.<br/>
<br/>
Some enemy cultivators, in a panic, fled from the breach, retreating deep into the corridors on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, on this section of the corridor, due to the complete consumption of the vine leaf talismans, its resistance plummeted to rock bottom.<br/>
<br/>
After the defending cultivators lost a dozen bodies, they all retreated.<br/>
<br/>
The battle began smoothly, but the real difficulty was yet to come.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp could not attack in the same manner -on one hand, it would take too long and consume too many troops; on the other, depleting the vine leaf talismans here would result in too great a loss.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, these losses were directly related to their battle merits.<br/>
<br/>
“It is better to attack from within, so as not to trigger the vine leaves’ defenses.”<br/>
<br/>
“But in that case, there would be no space to form a formation. Using only one squad of soldiers to form a formation would greatly diminish its effectiveness.”<br/>
<br/>
“Let my mechanized army try first.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo proposed proactively.<br/>
<br/>
He had three major mechanized platforms and could swiftly create mechanized puppets. This kind of attrition war was perfectly suited for his mechanized army!<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp soon took new action; while the main force remained stationed in place, the mechanized army launched a full-scale attack on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
The Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts lurked in the shadows, taking in the entire scene with their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“The main force of the Three Generals Camp is still in formation, which is troublesome.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo has already left the army and is operating alone; once he is a bit farther away from Liu, Guan, and Zhang, the two of us will launch a surprise attack!”</div>
