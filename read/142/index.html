<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 142: Yuan Dasheng vs Meng Chong (Third Battle)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Meng Chong was entering the preparation room for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The five stone pillar leaderboards were very conspicuous, especially as they slowly rotated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Meng Chong immediately noticed the stone pillars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been watching him closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Seeing Meng Chong enter the preparation room, its half-closed eyelids opened wider in excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was in poor condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Previously, the Lava Immortal Palace had been in a perilous situation, resisting the group attack of the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had personally intervened, entering the Daoist's mechanical puppet to control it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After a hard battle, it managed to turn the tide and ultimately killed the Golden Core Stage Fire Fusion Demon Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Its spiritual energy was greatly depleted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Mainly because it was not compatible with the Daoist's mechanical construct at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Even now, many Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were still besieging the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had to organize the mechanical constructs, build defenses, arrange various repairs, and oversee the trials of the Qi Refining Stage disciples.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Such a complex and enormous workload was a long-term, continuous drain on its spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Even so, seeing Meng Chong approach the leaderboard, it couldn't help but get excited and sent out a crucial message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In an instant, a flame whip condensed and lashed at it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit retracted its head and dragon claws into its shell, enduring the pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Meng Chong received the reminder, his spirit sharpened, realizing that this was the preparation room and not particularly dangerous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He slightly lowered his guard and walked to the leaderboard of the five stone pillars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Following the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's instructions, Meng Chong first touched the stone pillar, obtaining the trial disciple's mark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Then, he looked up at the leaderboard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Qi Refining Leaderboard, Essence Refining Leaderboard, Spirit Refining Leaderboard, Progress Leaderboard, and Speedrun Leaderboard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Among the five leaderboards, he ranked second on the Qi Refining Leaderboard, Progress Leaderboard, and Speedrun Leaderboard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">His name was absent from the Essence Refining Leaderboard and Spirit Refining Leaderboard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Meng Chong felt indignant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">From childhood to adulthood, he had always strived to be first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He had immortal potential, was a genius among geniuses, and was destined to be above others, a figure at the peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">How could he settle for second place?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But when Meng Chong saw the name in the first place, he was relieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The first position on all five leaderboards had the same name - Entry Standard!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Only by surpassing this standard can one be admitted into the Lava Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"The three sect masters are indeed mighty beings at the Void Refining Stage. Each trial is extremely difficult, and the entry standard is so high. Excellent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"This makes me even more eager to challenge it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Moreover, having a name on the leaderboard comes with rewards. That's really nice. Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Meng Chong's fighting spirit surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">After studying the preparation room for a while, he pushed the door open and entered Room Four.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Lava Immortal Palace Main Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shrank into its shell, being whipped by the flame whip, while also being infuriated by Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It had clearly reminded him, specifically telling Meng Chong that he was "second"! But Meng Chong didn't think much of it and laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This made the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit feel like spitting blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">It had done everything it could, but Meng Chong couldn't detect the subtleties within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Fine!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This flame whip was endured in vain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Checkpoint Two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">After Meng Chong left, Ning Zhuo quickly crawled out of the mechanical trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He first came to the first door, using the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal to open a crack, peeking into Room One.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Confirming no one was coming, he closed the door and summoned the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Times had changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">With more participants, Ning Zhuo himself found it inconvenient to enter and exit the Lava Immortal Palace, let alone summon the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The trend was clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In the future, the risk of Ning Zhuo summoning the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng, would only increase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A teleportation circle appeared, bringing Yuan Dasheng to the puppet Ning Zhuo's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"General, reporting to the lord!" The Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng, knelt on one knee before Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo was very interested in Yuan Dasheng's performance at the Wisdom Spirit Stage, but now was not the time for detailed research.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"The mechanical body of the Golden Blood Battle Ape is far inferior to the Tree Martial Ape."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"But it is the only construct recognized by the Lava Immortal Palace that can freely enter and exit the palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Just for this reason, the Golden Blood Battle Ape has immense value and cannot be replaced."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo led Yuan Dasheng through the second checkpoint, arriving at the second door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">To prevent Meng Chong from still being in Room Three, the puppet Ning Zhuo stayed behind, letting Yuan Dasheng push the door open and scout ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He found Room Three in disarray, with mechanical puppets reduced to piles of scrap and wine spilled on the floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Just as expected." Ning Zhuo pushed the door open and, seeing the scene, was not surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He had anticipated this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Every time Meng Chong was thwarted or obstructed, he would return with significantly improved strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"This is the aptitude of an immortal, and also fate energy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo sighed, leading Yuan Dasheng through Room Three, arriving at the third door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">It was still the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng who pushed the door open and entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Meng Chong was not found.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo did not rush in but instead had the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng retrieve the surveillance mechanical components from the corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After examining them, Ning Zhuo obtained crucial information through Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He became aware of Meng Chong's entire activity process here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">First, Meng Chong interacted with the ranking stone pillar, then various mechanical pedestals and mechanical crafting tools, before finally leaving and entering the next stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Meng Chong obtained the trial disciple's mark... Strange, it seems he already knew the detailed steps here and didn't make any attempts, just directly succeeded," Ning Zhuo remarked as he passed by the ranking stone pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Now, there were two names on the ranking list again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Previously, it was Yuan Dasheng who had made it onto the list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But after Yuan Dasheng was schemed against and secretly harmed by Ning Zhuo, ultimately becoming his mechanical construct, the ranking list had only Ning Zhuo's name for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo had carefully considered what name to change it to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Firstly, he couldn't change it to the name of someone else in the Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">If the City Lord's Mansion or any of the four major forces launched a full investigation, they could easily capture the person, verify the truth, and deduce that the names on the ranking list could be altered or that someone was cheating, which would be extremely disadvantageous for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Secondly, he couldn't change it to a dead person's name either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Because Yuan Dasheng had been removed from the list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">This proved that deceased competitors would be excluded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">If Ning Zhuo's name remained on the list, the flaw would be glaringly obvious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Living and dead names are both out of the question, so I'll have to get creative," Ning Zhuo had thought at the time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In the end, he changed the name to "Entry Standard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This had many benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The first was hiding his identity as a competitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The second was corresponding with the trial disciple's mark, mutually "testifying" for each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">In Ning Zhuo's personal judgment, since he could figure out the trial disciple's mark, others would likely figure it out too.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">By then, each trial disciple's mark would be Ning Zhuo's best endorsement of trust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The third benefit was accommodating future changes in his ranking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">If "Entry Standard" was surpassed by others, they would think, "I've met the standard to become an entry disciple."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">And if "Entry Standard" surpassed others, they would think, "Oh, the entry standard is flexible." Just like many family assessments that only reward the top ten, the entry standard of the Lava Immortal Palace also fluctuates based on the trial disciples' performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo brushed past the ranking stone pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">It was still the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng who pushed the door open and entered Room Four first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Through the surveillance mechanical components, Ning Zhuo discovered that after Meng Chong entered the room, his steps paused slightly, then he successively cast spells to obtain the corresponding mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo: "Strange! Here too, Meng Chong seemed to know in advance. Without any exploration, he directly found the answers." Ning Zhuo quickened his pace with Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">There was no sign of Meng Chong in Room Five either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The surveillance mechanical components displayed Meng Chong's graceful movements as he passed through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo carefully examined and confirmed once again that Meng Chong had made significant progress - he could now infuse his spells with immortal aptitude!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This made Ning Zhuo even more solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Room Six.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Meng Chong laughed heartily, "Now this is interesting. WildSprint Thunderclap!" He shouted, his figure moving like lightning, dodging several spell attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He used his immortal aptitude again, this time infusing it into the Embrace Ice Technique and a burst of qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Embrace Ice Technique and the burst of qi merged, forming a straight line of freezing energy that quickly struck a spell puppet amidst the flashing lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The spell puppet was instantly frozen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Meng Chong created a gap and took the opportunity to escape the encirclement of the spell puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">However, just as he was about to feel triumphant, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng suddenly appeared!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Ah, it's you!!" Meng Chong exclaimed with wild joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng, engulfed in flames, charged forward to engage Meng Chong in close combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Meng Chong was fearless, even excited, "Last time, I was burned to death by the flames. This time, I won't be. I have spell protection." Meng Chong cast the Embrace Ice Technique and a burst of qi, combined with the Qi Dispersion Ring, enveloping himself in dense freezing energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">With the freezing energy counteracting the flames, Meng Chong was no longer afraid of being burned to death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">But in the next moment, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng's palm imprinted on Meng Chong's chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The spell - Five Elements Chaos Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">This was a reward from the third gate, used by Ning Zhuo for the first time in actual combat against Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">As for the effect... it was excellent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">In an instant, the spiritual energy within Meng Chong's body was completely disrupted, turning from orderly to a tangled mess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"I..." Meng Chong's body couldn't move, and he also suffered the backlash from the interrupted Embrace Ice Technique and other spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng then struck, easily removing Meng Chong's puppet head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Then, with a forceful squeeze, the puppet head was instantly crushed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Meng Chong could only leave with intense unwillingness, his soul flying out of the palace and returning to his own body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">He suddenly opened his eyes, still incredulous, "What kind of spell is this? It seems to counter the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique?" "Lost again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"No matter, this time I gained a lot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Meng Chong had a strong anticipation for the next entry into the palace, his fighting spirit high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"By the way, send the latest information to Fei Si and Grandpa, let them help me think of a faster way to pass the trials."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
