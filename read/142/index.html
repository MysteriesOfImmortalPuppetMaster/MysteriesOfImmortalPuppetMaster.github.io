<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 142: Yuan Dasheng vs Meng Chong (Third Battle)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong was entering the preparation room for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
The five stone pillar leaderboards were very conspicuous, especially as they slowly rotated.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong immediately noticed the stone pillars.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been watching him closely.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Meng Chong enter the preparation room, its half-closed eyelids opened wider in excitement.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was in poor condition.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, the Lava Immortal Palace had been in a perilous situation, resisting the group attack of the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had personally intervened, entering the Daoist's mechanical puppet to control it.<br/>
<br/>
After a hard battle, it managed to turn the tide and ultimately killed the Golden Core Stage Fire Fusion Demon Ape.<br/>
<br/>
Its spiritual energy was greatly depleted.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly because it was not compatible with the Daoist's mechanical construct at all.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, many Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were still besieging the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had to organize the mechanical constructs, build defenses, arrange various repairs, and oversee the trials of the Qi Refining Stage disciples.<br/>
<br/>
Such a complex and enormous workload was a long-term, continuous drain on its spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, seeing Meng Chong approach the leaderboard, it couldn't help but get excited and sent out a crucial message.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, a flame whip condensed and lashed at it!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit retracted its head and dragon claws into its shell, enduring the pain.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong received the reminder, his spirit sharpened, realizing that this was the preparation room and not particularly dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
He slightly lowered his guard and walked to the leaderboard of the five stone pillars.<br/>
<br/>
Following the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's instructions, Meng Chong first touched the stone pillar, obtaining the trial disciple's mark.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he looked up at the leaderboard.<br/>
<br/>
Qi Refining Leaderboard, Essence Refining Leaderboard, Spirit Refining Leaderboard, Progress Leaderboard, and Speedrun Leaderboard.<br/>
<br/>
Among the five leaderboards, he ranked second on the Qi Refining Leaderboard, Progress Leaderboard, and Speedrun Leaderboard.<br/>
<br/>
His name was absent from the Essence Refining Leaderboard and Spirit Refining Leaderboard.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong felt indignant.<br/>
<br/>
From childhood to adulthood, he had always strived to be first.<br/>
<br/>
He had immortal potential, was a genius among geniuses, and was destined to be above others, a figure at the peak.<br/>
<br/>
How could he settle for second place?!<br/>
<br/>
But when Meng Chong saw the name in the first place, he was relieved.<br/>
<br/>
The first position on all five leaderboards had the same name‚ÄîEntry Standard!<br/>
<br/>
"Only by surpassing this standard can one be admitted into the Lava Immortal Palace?"<br/>
<br/>
"The three sect masters are indeed mighty beings at the Void Refining Stage. Each trial is extremely difficult, and the entry standard is so high. Excellent!"<br/>
<br/>
"This makes me even more eager to challenge it."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, having a name on the leaderboard comes with rewards. That's really nice. Hahaha!"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong's fighting spirit surged.<br/>
<br/>
After studying the preparation room for a while, he pushed the door open and entered Room Four.<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace Main Hall.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shrank into its shell, being whipped by the flame whip, while also being infuriated by Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
It had clearly reminded him, specifically telling Meng Chong that he was "second"! But Meng Chong didn't think much of it and laughed heartily.<br/>
<br/>
This made the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit feel like spitting blood.<br/>
<br/>
It had done everything it could, but Meng Chong couldn't detect the subtleties within.<br/>
<br/>
Fine!<br/>
<br/>
This flame whip was endured in vain.<br/>
<br/>
Checkpoint Two.<br/>
<br/>
After Meng Chong left, Ning Zhuo quickly crawled out of the mechanical trap.<br/>
<br/>
He first came to the first door, using the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal to open a crack, peeking into Room One.<br/>
<br/>
Confirming no one was coming, he closed the door and summoned the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Times had changed.<br/>
<br/>
With more participants, Ning Zhuo himself found it inconvenient to enter and exit the Lava Immortal Palace, let alone summon the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
The trend was clear.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, the risk of Ning Zhuo summoning the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng, would only increase.<br/>
<br/>
A teleportation circle appeared, bringing Yuan Dasheng to the puppet Ning Zhuo's side.<br/>
<br/>
"General, reporting to the lord!" The Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng, knelt on one knee before Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was very interested in Yuan Dasheng's performance at the Wisdom Spirit Stage, but now was not the time for detailed research.<br/>
<br/>
"The mechanical body of the Golden Blood Battle Ape is far inferior to the Tree Martial Ape."<br/>
<br/>
"But it is the only construct recognized by the Lava Immortal Palace that can freely enter and exit the palace."<br/>
<br/>
"Just for this reason, the Golden Blood Battle Ape has immense value and cannot be replaced."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo led Yuan Dasheng through the second checkpoint, arriving at the second door.<br/>
<br/>
To prevent Meng Chong from still being in Room Three, the puppet Ning Zhuo stayed behind, letting Yuan Dasheng push the door open and scout ahead.<br/>
<br/>
He found Room Three in disarray, with mechanical puppets reduced to piles of scrap and wine spilled on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
"Just as expected." Ning Zhuo pushed the door open and, seeing the scene, was not surprised.<br/>
<br/>
He had anticipated this.<br/>
<br/>
Every time Meng Chong was thwarted or obstructed, he would return with significantly improved strength.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the aptitude of an immortal, and also fate energy!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed, leading Yuan Dasheng through Room Three, arriving at the third door.<br/>
<br/>
It was still the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng who pushed the door open and entered.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong was not found.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not rush in but instead had the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng retrieve the surveillance mechanical components from the corner.<br/>
<br/>
After examining them, Ning Zhuo obtained crucial information through Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
He became aware of Meng Chong's entire activity process here.<br/>
<br/>
First, Meng Chong interacted with the ranking stone pillar, then various mechanical pedestals and mechanical crafting tools, before finally leaving and entering the next stage.<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Chong obtained the trial disciple's mark... Strange, it seems he already knew the detailed steps here and didn't make any attempts, just directly succeeded," Ning Zhuo remarked as he passed by the ranking stone pillar.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there were two names on the ranking list again.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, it was Yuan Dasheng who had made it onto the list.<br/>
<br/>
But after Yuan Dasheng was schemed against and secretly harmed by Ning Zhuo, ultimately becoming his mechanical construct, the ranking list had only Ning Zhuo's name for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had carefully considered what name to change it to.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, he couldn't change it to the name of someone else in the Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
If the City Lord's Mansion or any of the four major forces launched a full investigation, they could easily capture the person, verify the truth, and deduce that the names on the ranking list could be altered or that someone was cheating, which would be extremely disadvantageous for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, he couldn't change it to a dead person's name either.<br/>
<br/>
Because Yuan Dasheng had been removed from the list.<br/>
<br/>
This proved that deceased competitors would be excluded.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo's name remained on the list, the flaw would be glaringly obvious.<br/>
<br/>
"Living and dead names are both out of the question, so I'll have to get creative," Ning Zhuo had thought at the time.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, he changed the name to "Entry Standard."<br/>
<br/>
This had many benefits.<br/>
<br/>
The first was hiding his identity as a competitor.<br/>
<br/>
The second was corresponding with the trial disciple's mark, mutually "testifying" for each other.<br/>
<br/>
In Ning Zhuo's personal judgment, since he could figure out the trial disciple's mark, others would likely figure it out too.<br/>
<br/>
By then, each trial disciple's mark would be Ning Zhuo's best endorsement of trust.<br/>
<br/>
The third benefit was accommodating future changes in his ranking.<br/>
<br/>
If "Entry Standard" was surpassed by others, they would think, "I've met the standard to become an entry disciple."<br/>
<br/>
And if "Entry Standard" surpassed others, they would think, "Oh, the entry standard is flexible." Just like many family assessments that only reward the top ten, the entry standard of the Lava Immortal Palace also fluctuates based on the trial disciples' performance.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo brushed past the ranking stone pillar.<br/>
<br/>
It was still the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng who pushed the door open and entered Room Four first.<br/>
<br/>
Through the surveillance mechanical components, Ning Zhuo discovered that after Meng Chong entered the room, his steps paused slightly, then he successively cast spells to obtain the corresponding mechanical components.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "Strange! Here too, Meng Chong seemed to know in advance. Without any exploration, he directly found the answers." Ning Zhuo quickened his pace with Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
There was no sign of Meng Chong in Room Five either.<br/>
<br/>
The surveillance mechanical components displayed Meng Chong's graceful movements as he passed through.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully examined and confirmed once again that Meng Chong had made significant progress‚Äîhe could now infuse his spells with immortal aptitude!<br/>
<br/>
This made Ning Zhuo even more solemn.<br/>
<br/>
Room Six.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong laughed heartily, "Now this is interesting. WildSprint Thunderclap!" He shouted, his figure moving like lightning, dodging several spell attacks.<br/>
<br/>
He used his immortal aptitude again, this time infusing it into the Embrace Ice Technique and a burst of qi.<br/>
<br/>
The Embrace Ice Technique and the burst of qi merged, forming a straight line of freezing energy that quickly struck a spell puppet amidst the flashing lightning.<br/>
<br/>
The spell puppet was instantly frozen.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong created a gap and took the opportunity to escape the encirclement of the spell puppets.<br/>
<br/>
However, just as he was about to feel triumphant, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng suddenly appeared!<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, it's you!!" Meng Chong exclaimed with wild joy.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng, engulfed in flames, charged forward to engage Meng Chong in close combat.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong was fearless, even excited, "Last time, I was burned to death by the flames. This time, I won't be. I have spell protection." Meng Chong cast the Embrace Ice Technique and a burst of qi, combined with the Qi Dispersion Ring, enveloping himself in dense freezing energy.<br/>
<br/>
With the freezing energy counteracting the flames, Meng Chong was no longer afraid of being burned to death.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng's palm imprinted on Meng Chong's chest.<br/>
<br/>
The spell‚ÄîFive Elements Chaos Technique!<br/>
<br/>
This was a reward from the third gate, used by Ning Zhuo for the first time in actual combat against Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
As for the effect... it was excellent!<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the spiritual energy within Meng Chong's body was completely disrupted, turning from orderly to a tangled mess.<br/>
<br/>
"I..." Meng Chong's body couldn't move, and he also suffered the backlash from the interrupted Embrace Ice Technique and other spells.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng then struck, easily removing Meng Chong's puppet head.<br/>
<br/>
Then, with a forceful squeeze, the puppet head was instantly crushed.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong could only leave with intense unwillingness, his soul flying out of the palace and returning to his own body.<br/>
<br/>
In the City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly opened his eyes, still incredulous, "What kind of spell is this? It seems to counter the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique?" "Lost again!"<br/>
<br/>
"No matter, this time I gained a lot."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong had a strong anticipation for the next entry into the palace, his fighting spirit high.<br/>
<br/>
"By the way, send the latest information to Fei Si and Grandpa, let them help me think of a faster way to pass the trials."</div>
