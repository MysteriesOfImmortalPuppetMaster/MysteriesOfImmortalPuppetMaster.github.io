<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"The three families are planning to jointly attack Yuan Dasheng..." Ning Zhuo took this matter very seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The situation was unclear, and Yuan Dasheng couldn't exert his full strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Due to the rescue of Sun Lingtong, many of Yuan Dasheng's techniques were exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">For instance, the Shattering Sun Hand, the Backhand Grab, and the Righteous Bone Golden Firmness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Of course, the Immortal Material aspect should still be confidential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Most people would think it was made of excellent materials, allowing Yuan Dasheng to resist the Ghost Fire's scorching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This could be inferred from the reactions of Meng Kui and others after the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">If they had discovered the spiritual nature and Immortal Material, they would have conducted a frantic city-wide search instead of the current calm observation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Even so, it was best not to display the Immortal Material Righteous Bone Golden Firmness on the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo also considered that the Golden Blood Battle Ape's body was made of low-grade materials, so its performance couldn't be expected to improve much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"How can I maximize Yuan Dasheng's strength?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">While pondering this question, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel fortunate—luckily, he had focused on the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra over the past ten days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"By forging spiritual mechanical components through the Fire Burial Sutra, I can enhance Yuan Dasheng's combat power! This should be the way to break the impasse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"But why are the three families confident they can challenge Yuan Dasheng?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"The Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai has also appeared, so in the minds of the three families, they will also consider Cheng Bai. The source of their confidence is probably the preparation room, right?" In the Lava Immortal Palace, after Room No. 3, there was a preparation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The preparation room contained numerous mechanical platforms and tools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">By paying some spirit stones, one could repair puppet bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In the subsequent two preparation rooms, spirit stones could also be used to purchase many low-grade materials for modifying puppet bodies to some extent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The strength of the human race lies in wisdom, and the field where wisdom can be most effectively utilized is tools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">A fulcrum and a lever can allow a person to lift objects far beyond their strength limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">This is the simplest mechanism, yet it has the power to move hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Cultivation in a hundred arts is about how to use various resources more reasonably and cultivatively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Among the hundred arts of cultivation, mechanical arts can be considered the pinnacle of tools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo's gaze deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"The reformation teams of the three families exploring the Immortal Palace are now all at the peak of the third level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"These days, they have been actively practicing mechanical arts, conducting extensive exercises on puppet bodies and hanging rings, becoming extremely familiar with them. Now, they plan to make good use of the preparation room, fully unleash their creativity, and burst out with strong combat power to overthrow Yuan Dasheng's suppression in one fell swoop." Ning Zhuo's mind was sharp, and he quickly grasped the key point of the three families' joint action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">It was the preparation room!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"The current question is, should I let Yuan Dasheng appear in the first three levels in advance to block them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The joint action of the three families actually had a fatal flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">As long as Yuan Dasheng intercepted them in advance, they wouldn't even be able to enter the first preparation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">However, this simplest and most violent answer was not the optimal solution to this problem!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"If I do this, it might work once. But if it happens two or three times, the three families will become highly suspicious due to Yuan Dasheng's precise interceptions. If they can't break through, the three families might even cooperate with the City Lord's Mansion!" This was entirely possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">On the path of soul entry into the Immortal Palace, the City Lord's Mansion had the most significant advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The three families united to compete with Meng Chong and others but were always at a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Meng Chong and others dominated the preparation room rankings (as they saw it), and the three families, due to Yuan Dasheng, couldn't fully utilize their numerical advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">If Ning Zhuo suppressed them too much, causing the three families to fall into despair, they would inevitably seek the assistance of the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Would the City Lord's Mansion agree?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">It's hard to say.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">If there were only the soul entry route into the Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo believed the City Lord's Mansion would be unlikely to agree to cooperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">But now, the physical entry route into the Immortal Palace was also an option.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">On this route, the City Lord's Mansion had little competitiveness and was almost insignificant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The dominant forces were the Zhou family and the Zheng family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">And the top one was Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He had previously contributed three quasi-Golden Core Stage mechanical constructs in one go, making him the current number one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"For the City Lord's Mansion, they need Meng Chong to progress faster, the faster, the better, to surpass Zhu Xuanji's progress!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Yuan Dasheng repeatedly repelling Meng Chong is a significant obstacle. Therefore, first jointly attacking Yuan Dasheng, defeating him, and uncovering his internal mechanical structure is highly motivating for the City Lord's Mansion. Even if Yuan Dasheng is repaired by the Immortal Palace and reintroduced into the trial levels, they would have obtained crucial information to defend against and target him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"So, the key point for the City Lord's Mansion's decision is—whether the combined strength of the three families will surpass Meng Chong's if they eliminate the monkey mechanism. If it does, they won't agree to cooperate. If it doesn't, they will likely cooperate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Currently, Yuan Dasheng was already struggling to face Meng Chong alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Once the four major forces united, Yuan Dasheng would face a massive team led by Meng Chong, with other geniuses assisting, and the reformation team numbering over a hundred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Even if the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai were brought in, exhausting its last bit of spirituality to participate, the outcome would likely be more defeats than victories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"So, letting them enter the preparation room, allowing them to fully prepare for battle, and then letting Yuan Dasheng appear is the correct approach?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"More accurately, this battle cannot let the three families suffer a crushing defeat. Yuan Dasheng must win but leave them with some false hope—as if with just a bit more effort next time, they could defeat Yuan Dasheng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">If Yuan Dasheng appeared too strong, the three families would despair and still seek cooperation with the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The City Lord's Mansion would then see the true strength of Yuan Dasheng and feel pressured, prompting them to decide to cooperate with Meng Kui and Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Only by making the three families believe they were just a step away from success would they not seek cooperation with the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">They would desire to break through Yuan Dasheng themselves and let the repaired Yuan Dasheng continue to obstruct Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Only in such a situation would it be most beneficial to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo felt the pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The complex situation required him to pursue a complex outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yuan Dasheng's defeat was unacceptable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Yuan Dasheng's overwhelming victory was also unacceptable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He had to achieve a narrow victory while giving the three families some false hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Only by doing this could Ning Zhuo truly be the master of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Battle is merely an action. It is a tool."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Just like not long ago, Zhou Zeshen actively proposed a sparring match with me. He used the tool of battle to accumulate friendship and enhance our relationship."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"And the battle between Yuan Dasheng and the three families is my tool to maintain control over the Lava Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo shared this information and his analysis of the situation with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong praised him and sighed, "Little Zhuo, your understanding of the various forces and your grasp of human nature are more proficient than mine. In this aspect, I am increasingly reassured."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo humbly replied, "Not at all. I still have many shortcomings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sun Lingtong said, "In that case, I will also put in more effort recently to unlock Cheng Bai's storage bag!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">After being wanted, Sun Lingtong stayed in one of the few underground bases, relocating every once in a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">His injuries had long since healed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Usually, besides cultivating and exploring the Immortal Palace, he focused on studying Cheng Bai's storage bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">During Ning Zhuo's intervention in the black market, he had risked appearing in the city to give orders to the Turtle Breath Gang's leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">That was his only outing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">With the development of cultivation to this day, cultivators' storage tools were equipped with verification, defense, and self-destruct measures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Back then, when Ning Zhuo killed the three ghosts of the Huang family, he had also pondered for a long time before opening the three storage bags.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">At that time, a small ghost head flew out of the bag, attempting to attack Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo was not careless and had prepared in advance, directly killing the small ghost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">As a disciple of a major demonic sect, Cheng Bai's storage bag had high defense specifications.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sun Lingtong, being only at the Foundation Establishment Stage, had been diligently trying to unlock Cheng Bai's storage bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Although there was progress, it was very slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">According to Ning Zhuo's speculation, the storage bag was so tightly guarded because it was very important to Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">It likely contained many of Cheng Bai's personal items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">These items, under the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra, would add spirituality to the mechanical puppet Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo nodded, "If the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai can participate in this battle, I will be more confident. But don't take too many risks, Brother Sun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"After Cheng Bai's death, there has been no movement from the Soul Devouring Sect, which is quite unusual."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"It's very likely that their people have already arrived."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong understood the gravity of the situation and nodded, "I understand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He showed a solemn expression, "The hook-nosed and triangular-eyed demon cultivators from the Soul Devouring Sect are imprisoned by the City Lord's Mansion. I'm not worried about them—they are bait set up by the City Lord's Mansion. What I am more concerned about is Han Ming."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Since that battle, Han Ming has not appeared. If she secretly contacted the Soul Devouring Sect, the threat to us would be even greater."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Sigh... we can only take it one step at a time." Ning Zhuo sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">After taking control of the black market, he paid close attention to collecting information in this regard, but so far, there had been no results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">A few days later, Ning Zhuo indeed received a notification to go to the Zhou family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In an underground hall, the entire reformation team of the three families gathered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The heads of the three families appeared together, officially announcing the start of a new joint action!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"I've long been displeased with that mechanical ape."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"With the three families united, and led by five geniuses, we will surely avenge our previous defeat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"These days, my mechanical arts have improved a lot. I am no longer the same as before!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Hahaha, let's give it our all." The crowd enthusiastically exchanged words, their morale high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The heads of the three families made the following arrangements: they sealed the underground hall for several days of special training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">During this period, all reformation team members would eat and sleep there, and random outings were prohibited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">After the meeting, Zhou Zeshen, with a smile, approached Ning Zhuo, "Brother Yu, come with me. We need to discuss the specific battle plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and initiated the conversation, "Brother Zhou, thank you for the rivet rapid-fire crossbow. It was very useful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Zhou Zeshen laughed heartily, "Next time we spar, I will definitely bring your mechanical monkey blueprint, Brother Ning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"This way, please." Zhou Zeshen gestured with his arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo: "Please."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
