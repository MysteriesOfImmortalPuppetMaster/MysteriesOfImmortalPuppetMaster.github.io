<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
As Zhou Nongying watched, Fei Si tried to win Ning Zhuo over to the City Lord Mansion’s side. However, Ning Zhuo’s response was lukewarm, almost completely opposite of in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, Zhou Nongyin was very satisfied with this attitude. He knew that this junior Ning Zhuo was clever, knowing well who his friends and enemies were.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, the Lava Immortal Palace belonged to the Meng family, and Meng Kui would definitely not relinquish his hold over it easily. With the Lava Immortal Palace as an excuse, the Meng family would be able to continuously send a stream of cultivators to Fire Persimmon City.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, the whole city would be taken over by the Meng family.<br/>
<br/>
Under these circumstances, the Zhou and Ning families naturally had to ally together to face the Meng family’s ambitions.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo’s attitude, Fei Si was disinclined to stay here any longer and quickly left. Ning Zhuo politely accompanied him all the way to the gates.<br/>
<br/>
Just before departing, Fei Si smiled and brought up Chi Dun. Ever since the beast tide ended, Chi Dun had been wanting to challenge Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin and regain his honor.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled slightly in response, knowing well that Fei Si was trying to threaten him.<br/>
<br/>
Since that was the case, he wouldn’t back down. “I may be young and weak, but I have a competitive spirit. If Lord Chi Dun truly desires a duel, then this junior is completely willing to accommodate him. It’s just… if the Night Rain Demon Weapon isn’t controlled carefully, it’s possible that Lord Chi Dun will die. That would be terrible!”<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si’s smile immediately dropped from his face. Nodding indifferently to Ning Zhuo, he turned around and walked away.<br/>
<br/>
Watching Fei Si’s retreating figure, Ning Zhuo’s gaze darkened. He knew that his close relationship with Fei Si had now disappeared, and the two would henceforth stand on opposing sides.<br/>
<br/>
“Lord Zhu Hou, the director of the orphanage, has arrived!” The receptionist’s loud voice rang out again, reading off the list of gifts brought by Zhu Hou.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, the guests felt their hearts shake!<br/>
<br/>
Although Zhu Hou was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, he was part of the Southern Bean Kingdom’s royal family, with an immensely respected status. Moreover, the royal family had specially placed him here in order to observe the situation in the city and weaken Meng Kui’s influence.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had just returned from the gate when he heard the receptionist’s voice. Turning around, he greeted Zhu Hou with a warm smile.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Hou was different from the others; he directly entered the banquet hall, causing an immediate sensation.<br/>
<br/>
After chatting and laughing freely in the banquet hall, he eventually left to discuss matters with Ning Zhuo and Zhou Nongying.<br/>
<br/>
This time, he had come representing the Southern Bean royal family, offering support to Ning Zhuo’s branch family and the Zhou family in hopes that they would thwart the Meng family’s designs on Fire Persimmon City.<br/>
<br/>
After a pleasant conversation where all three sides agreed on cooperation, the two guests took their leave, and Ning Zhuo returned to the banquet hall.<br/>
<br/>
As he sat down at the main table, the cultivators who had been waiting anxiously came forward and raised their glasses to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The first to speak were Ning Youfu and Ning Houjun, the two former elders belonging to the branch family.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Ning Zhuo was the patriarch of the branch family, his status far exceeded these two former elders.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Youfu showed a submissive attitude, and Ning Houjun was even more respectful. This was because he had a request; he hoped that his descendants could be pardoned for their crimes and return to the branch family.<br/>
<br/>
As he begged, Ning Houjun’s eyes were red, and he was on the verge of tears.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn’t immediately agree, but said that he would first observe carefully before making a decision.<br/>
<br/>
“With the family splitting, I hope that you two elders will serve as pillars for my branch family and shelter the future generations under your wings.” Ning Zhuo took the initiative to invite the two elders to join his new branch family.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Youfu and Ning Houjun looked at each other and agreed on the spot. Previously, when they had stepped down from the position of elder, it wasn’t entirely by their own will.<br/>
<br/>
Standing nearby, the academy elder’s expression turned gloomy. However, he had no choice but to watch helplessly in indignation as Ning Zhuo’s branch family accepted new members and increased its strenght.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiangqian and other former stewards also went up to Ning Zhuo, hoping that they could all join Ning Zhuo’s branch family. In response, Ning Zhuo said that the list would soon be made public.<br/>
<br/>
Next, Ning Zhuo’s classmates and members of the recultivation team like Ning Chen and Ning Yong came forward.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gave them some encouraging words. He had always been well-regarded among these people, mainly due to those times he imparted his insights.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as the patriarch of a new branch family, his status was far above them, strengthening their desire to become his followers.<br/>
<br/>
The leaders of the Monkey Head Gang and Crane Beak Gang also came over. Both of them were trembling with excitement.<br/>
<br/>
What was happening now was something they had only been able to dream about prior to joining Ning Zhuo. As Ning Zhuo’s status rose, his followers also benefited, and these black market gangs were finally able to mingle in the circles of the righteous path.<br/>
<br/>
The gang leaders had personally seen Zhou Nongying, Fei Si, Zhu Hou, and others coming to congratulate Ning Zhuo, causing their loyalty to immediately rise a hundredfold.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Cha, Feng Heizi, and the One-Armed Craftsman left their tables one after another and walked over to give their congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Cha’s expression was slightly complicated as he sighed, “Ning Zhuo, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I would have never thought that you could rise to this point. Congratulations!!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood up and grabbed Chen Cha by the hand, showing a closeness that made Feng Heizi and the One-Armed Craftsman feel envious.<br/>
<br/>
“Back then, the Ning family patriarch was still alive. He asked me to comment on Ning Zhuo’s mechanical explosive monkey.”<br/>
<br/>
At the banquet, Feng Jiqing was boasting to cultivators sitting at the same table.<br/>
<br/>
“When I first saw it, I was stunned! Other things aside, the storage formation was perfectly designed. Well, if I had to change it, I would have gone with cloud whale lungs.<br/>
<br/>
“Hahaha, but compared to that genius, I am too ordinary, not worth mentioning. It’s my greatest honor to be in the same city as Master Ning Zhuo.”<br/>
<br/>
…<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui floated slightly in the air, hovering above the circular pit where there was once a throne.<br/>
<br/>
A magic mirror shimmered in front of him, showing the scene at Ning Zhuo’s branch family.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui could see everything, but there was only one person he paid attention to – Ning Zhuo. He closely observed the young man in white with a meaningful gaze.<br/>
<br/>
Had someone told him before all this happened that he would be outwitted by a junior like this, he would never have believed them.<br/>
<br/>
Who could have expected that in this Fire Persimmon Mountain, there was a youngster at the Qi Refining stage who was capable of hiding and enduring for more than ten years, bombing the Lava Immortal Palace and eventually seizing it for himself?<br/>
<br/>
“Grandpa!” Meng Chong smashed open the door to the main hall and rushed over to Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
“Is that Ning Zhuo opening his branch family today? I’m going to duel him! I haven’t lost yet!!” Meng Chong loudly proclaimed his intention of taking revenge.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui snorted coldly and flicked a finger. The force shooting out from his finger made Meng Chong immediately shrink back, holding his forehead and wincing in pain.<br/>
<br/>
“Grandpa, why did you hit me?”<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui said, “I told you to practice diligently and master a few other arts of cultivation, but you never listened to my advice.<br/>
<br/>
“Didn’t you see it this time? Ning Zhuo relied on his masters of mechanical arts to leave you in the dust. That monkey you regarded as your lifelong enemy was nothing more than one of his creations. In the end, he forced the position of palace master on to me!<br/>
<br/>
“Look at him, only sixteen years old, even younger than you.<br/>
<br/>
“You were so close, but you failed at the last moment, and his puppet extracted your soul. Despite being so young, he has such expertise in mechanical arts, and today, he’s even established his own branch family.<br/>
<br/>
“Chong’er, when a genius is superior to you, you must learn from them!”<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong was stunned.<br/>
<br/>
His grandfather had always been proud of him. But Meng Kui’s words at this moment made Meng Chong feel extremely strange. In the past, it was him alone who had been praised in such a manner.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the name “Ning Zhuo” was placed on an even higher pedestal than Meng Chong himself.<br/>
<br/>
“Chong’er’s loss is understandable. Even you and me, weren’t we both fooled by that cunning kid?” Meng Hu arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Picking up Meng Chong, he said, “Let me bring Chong’er away first. Although the Three Schools Supreme Sage’s method can establish a foundation with three dantians, its focus is more on mechanical arts. Moreover, the opportunity for it has been lost, so it’s not suitable for Chong’er.<br/>
<br/>
“Coincidentally, Imperial Teacher Wu Ting of the Xianglei Kingdom is currently recruiting disciples. Chong’er has the Mad Thunderbolt talent; if he becomes the disciple of Xianglei’s imperial teacher, his future will be even better.”<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui nodded and said, “Okay, let’s send him there.”<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much Meng Chong struggled and shouted, Meng Hu was undeterred. He turned into an arc of light and flew away.<br/>
<br/>
Along in the palace, Meng Kui sighed softly.<br/>
<br/>
If he could have obtained the complete methods of all three schools, it would have been good for Meng Chong to stay here and continue cultivating.<br/>
<br/>
However, he had only obtained the complete methods for the Daoist school, found in the body of the Daoist Master mechanical construct. As for the methods found by those entering the Immortal Palace by soul, they could only raise a cultivator up through the Qi Refining stage.<br/>
<br/>
The methods for the subsequent stages were all hidden in the Dharma Bell. Unfortunately, Meng Kui had encountered great difficulty in cracking open the bell. In fact, he didn’t even know where to start!<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui, who was well versed in the mysteries of fate energy, knew that the fate energy of the Lava Immortal Palace had already been seized by others. Those who had fallen behind wouldn’t get a sniff of the benefits, with everything good going to the one who took it first.<br/>
<br/>
It was already nigh impossible for someone like Meng Chong to catch up. Having lost the initiative, persisting on this route would be a waste of time. It was better for him to decisively withdraw now and take another path.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui’s consciousness radiated outward, and he once again observed the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
“Big loss, a big loss!” He shook his head. Deep down, he honestly hadn’t wanted to take over this mess.<br/>
<br/>
But he had no other choice. The Meng family had plans for Fire Persimmon City, so it needed a valid reason to control the city for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
After all, the national policy of the Southern Bean royal family was to swap out city lords from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
Having the identity of Lava Immortal Palace Master would undoubtedly help the Meng family achieve its goal.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, even though a wise man like Meng Kui knew that it was a trap, he had voluntarily fulfilled Ning Zhuo’s wish and taken on the responsibility of palace master.<br/>
<br/>
“Rebuilding the Lava Immortal Palace will be incredibly expensive. I’ll need to ask the family for help.” Although Meng Kui was at the Nascent Soul stage, he couldn’t bear the cost of fixing the Lava Immortal Palace all by himself. This was enough to show just how expensive it would be.<br/>
<br/>
But what troubled Meng Kui the most wasn’t the issue of repairs; instead, it was the positions within the palace.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace had various official positions. Although the buildings had fallen, the positions associated with the buildings didn’t disappear.<br/>
<br/>
According to the agreement between Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji, no matter who became the palace master of the Immortal Palace, the people who held official positions couldn’t be fired.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, even though Meng Kui was the palace master, many of the official positions were held by people of the three families’ recultivation teams.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, the Meng family’s control over the Lava Immortal Palace in the future would undoubtedly be greatly reduced!<br/>
<br/>
And it was also because of this that Zhou Nongying and Ning Zhuo had the confidence to ally together against the Meng family.<br/>
<br/>
…<br/>
<br/>
In the banquet hall, the celebration was almost over when the receptionist’s voice suddenly rang out again. “Master Song Fuli has arrived!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned. An unwelcome guest was here.<br/>
<br/>
Expression indifferent, Song Fuli neither brought out any gifts nor walked through the threshold.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, he just stood there, blocking the door.</div>
