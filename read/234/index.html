<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo's Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zhu Xuanji and Ning Zhuo stood facing each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo's breathing was steady, but his heart was tight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He thought to himself, "This moment has finally arrived."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ever since Zhu Xuanji appeared and entered Fire Persimmon Immortal City...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ever since Ning Zhuo came into contact with the Three Sect Superior Techniques and decided to cultivate these three techniques...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo had already anticipated this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">No, to be precise, the anticipation started even earlier, more than a decade ago, when Ning Zhuo had already foreseen this day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He had long expected that his cultivation would be examined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He had also prepared for this early on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">However, when the moment of the test truly arrived, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel his heart race.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">If it were any other Golden Core Stage cultivator, it would be fine, but facing Zhu Xuanji, who possessed the Golden Eyes talent, Ning Zhuo had no experience and couldn't grasp the details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">As a Qi Refining Stage cultivator, Ning Zhuo had to conceal his true cultivation from a Golden Core Stage cultivator, which was extremely difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The accelerated heartbeat of Ning Zhuo was immediately noticed by Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He said softly, "Your heart is beating a bit fast. Why, are you feeling nervous?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo grinned, "Of course, Lord Zhu. Is this Demonic Blood Vein Technique really compatible with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique? Is the rumored Three Sect Superior Techniques true?" Ning Zhuo's face was full of anticipation for the Three Sect Superior Techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Concerning his path of cultivation and the Three Sect Superior Techniques, it was natural for his heart to beat a little faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zhu Xuanji chuckled, "Since you asked, I'll tell you some good news. From what we have seen so far, the Demonic Dao Scripture we obtained is indeed compatible with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Although this Demonic Dao Scripture only goes up to the fifth level of the Qi Refining Stage, from these contents, it is already evident that it has some connection with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique." Then, Zhu Xuanji changed the topic, "The Three Sect Superior Techniques cultivate the upper, middle, and lower dantian respectively. Once you can use these three techniques to establish your foundation, your future will undoubtedly be bright. In this world, techniques that can establish a foundation using three dantians are extremely rare!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"So this time, I will not only check your Qi Sea but also your Essence Sea. I will also examine your Divine Sea. How about that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Could Ning Zhuo refuse?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He immediately showed a look of joy and eagerly said, "Lord Zhu, that would be wonderful! Please, go ahead and examine me thoroughly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">As Ning Zhuo spoke, he secretly activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and the Hidden Cloud Bud under his tongue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">These two treasures were the key to resisting the examination!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Zhu Xuanji emitted a trace of blood energy, which penetrated Ning Zhuo's body, delving deep into his Essence Sea lower dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Apart from the magical artifact, only blood energy could enter and exit the lower dantian Essence Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhu Xuanji's blood energy carried his divine sense, circling above Ning Zhuo's Essence Sea, taking in its entirety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Hidden Cloud Bud played its role, firmly covering the true appearance of the Essence Sea, showing Zhu Xuanji only the scene that Ning Zhuo had deliberately arranged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo had been training this for over a decade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He was already so familiar with it that it had become as instinctive as breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Zhu Xuanji's exploration of the Essence Sea revealed that it was similar to that of ordinary cultivators, albeit with a slightly deeper foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">After all, Ning Zhuo had been consuming a lot of spiritual food recently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Zhu Xuanji retracted his blood energy and then infused his mana into Ning Zhuo's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Similarly, his mana also carried his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zhu Xuanji's mana entered Ning Zhuo's middle dantian Qi Sea, where he saw five-colored clouds surging, sensing that Ning Zhuo's cultivation had reached the fourth level, already at the peak of the fourth level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"It seems that the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique is indeed very suitable for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhu Xuanji praised lightly and withdrew his mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Finally, he directly released his divine sense to probe Ning Zhuo's upper dantian Divine Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Divine Sea was Ning Zhuo's most fortified area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Not only was there the Hidden Cloud Bud to cover the true scene, but the Buddha Heart Demon Seal was also there to suppress and deceive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">As expected, Zhu Xuanji's sweep revealed an empty Divine Sea, but its capacity was large.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">This made Zhu Xuanji think of Ning Zhuo's talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">To this day, Ning Zhuo's talent had not been tested by the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">But from Ning Zhuo's Divine Sea, some clues could be seen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Zhu Xuanji withdrew his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The golden glimmers in his eyes also dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"I have good news for you. Very good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"All three of your dantians are suitable for cultivating the Three Sect Superior Techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"You have talent, and the talent lies in your Divine Sea. From this point of view, the path of divine cultivation is most suitable for you. Just like the Void Sect's core technique—Void Technique, which specializes in the Divine Sea and also cultivates the Essence Sea."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Do you know about the Void Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Perhaps... you are more familiar with Sun Lingtong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo replied, "Of course, I know Sun Lingtong. He was the controller of the last round of the black market."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"As for my talent, I have considered it too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"But I think the Three Sect Superior Techniques suit me better. Now that I have obtained the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique and the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, maybe in the future, I can also get the Divine Sea cultivation technique for the upper dantian."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhu Xuanji nodded, "Indeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He looked seriously at Ning Zhuo, "But I must remind you, don't be too complacent. Although we have obtained the Demonic Dao Scripture, your situation is still somewhat dangerous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo showed a puzzled expression, "Lord Zhu, what do you mean?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"The reason I am in danger is that many people previously thought the Demonic Dao Scripture was in my hands. Now that the Demonic Dao Scripture has emerged and was taken by the ancestor of the Zheng family, many people saw this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The battle among the Golden Core cultivators had attracted much attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">In the Immortal City, the scale of cultivators was large, and they had mastered many techniques, making it easy to observe the battlefield from afar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Zhu Xuanji sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"On the surface, it seems so."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"But to be honest with you, I feel that things are not that simple."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo immediately cupped his fists and bowed deeply, "Please, Lord Zhu, enlighten me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhu Xuanji sighed again, "Ning Zhuo, you have seen puppet shows, right? Now I feel like there is a hidden hand behind the scenes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"The recent Golden Core battle was like a puppet show, with all the participating Golden Core cultivators acting like puppets, completely unaware."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"The stage just now might have been deliberately set up by the hidden hand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo was stunned, "Lord Zhu, are you referring to the City Lord's Mansion?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Indeed, during the recent battle, only Chi Han from the City Lord's Mansion took action, while Fei Si did not. And the City Lord himself remained an observer. If he had taken action, he could have suppressed the entire scene."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Zhu Xuanji shook his head and sighed, "It's difficult to make him take action. You may not understand his style. To make him personally intervene, the situation must be extremely urgent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Perhaps it is the City Lord's Mansion?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo said, "As for investigating the case, Lord Zhu, I don't understand much. But I believe that you will definitely succeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Zhu Xuanji's expression changed slightly, and he smiled, "You seem to have a lot of confidence in me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo chuckled, "Of course, because you are the divine constable, you are Zhu Xuanji, who investigates and ensures the safety of the people. You are the most righteous person I have ever seen. The righteous path will surely prevail."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Zhu Xuanji was slightly taken aback, seriously examining the young man in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo's eyes were clear, and he spoke sincerely, revealing his firm belief in the righteous path at that moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Seeing such a Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji seemed to see his younger self.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Like Ning Zhuo, he was also full of firm belief in the righteous path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zhu Xuanji laughed again, "You little rascal, was framing Yuan Dasheng also part of your righteous path?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo spread his hands, "The Monkey Head Gang was originally a gang of black market origins. Besides, what does it matter if I get rid of a monkey?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"And as for the black market, this is what I think."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"If I control the black market, I can make it more orderly, maintain stability, and reduce bloodshed. At the same time, I can make my clan live better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Then why shouldn't I do it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"I feel that the three major families all want to meddle in the black market, but they care too much about their reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"I also care about my reputation, but I can't help it, I need to eat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"I have to fill my stomach first before I can practice my righteous path and help my clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly and patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder, "At least you are pragmatic."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">With that, Zhu Xuanji took his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo escorted him to the courtyard gate, watching until Zhu Xuanji disappeared from sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo turned back into the courtyard, his eyebrows gradually rising, and his face showing more and more joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">After returning to his room and closing the door, he couldn't help but clench his fists and raise his arms in excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">From this action, it was clear—he was very happy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">After all, he had not only obtained the Demonic Blood Vein Technique but also received Zhu Xuanji's recognition of his talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He was also told that cultivating the Three Sect Superior Techniques simultaneously was completely feasible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">With a face full of excitement, Ning Zhuo entered the underground chamber to begin his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">However, whether studying the mechanical constructs' texts or sitting in meditation, he was somewhat distracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">From time to time, he would pause and grin foolishly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">These small actions revealed his youthful nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Occasionally, he would furrow his brows, showing some doubt, as if recalling the last conversation with Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">But then he would shake his head, as if saying, "Why think about this? If the sky falls, there are taller people to hold it up!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He even murmured to himself, "Isn't there still Lord Zhu Xuanji?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
