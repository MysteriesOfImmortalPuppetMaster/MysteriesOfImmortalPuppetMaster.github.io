<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Sun Lingtong did not intercept in advance but left the preparation room, heading straight into the depths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo was not by his side now, so Sun Lingtong was like an unregistered resident, unable to claim any rewards or open the door</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Thus, Sun Lingtong waited for Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng to push open the door first, then squeezed in afterward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit saw this and ground its teeth in anger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Meng Chong led the charge, breaking through the second and third barriers, bringing sixteen similar puppets into the preparation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In an instant, the speedrun, progress, and Qi Refining rankings were filled with names.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The rankings only recorded the top ten, leaving many others in the teens, unqualified to be listed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo exhaled a breath of turbid air, feeling a slight joy in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This way, when he entered the preparation room in the future, it would be perfectly reasonable for his name not to be on the list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">If the rankings had been empty before, his absence would have been a huge flaw!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Using the enemy, Ning Zhuo resolved this hidden danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Charge, charge, charge!" Meng Chong advanced fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">With him leading the way, the sixteen puppets behind him remained unscathed, lying flat all the way to Room Nine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Finally here." Sun Lingtong hid in a corner, camouflaged with multiple layers, showcasing the Void Sect's disguise skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong peered through two small holes, observing the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Boom, boom, boom...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Meng Chong laughed heartily, engaging in a fierce battle with Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He had fought his way through, finally discovering his target, his fighting spirit soaring, electric light swirling around him, fighting with great enthusiasm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">As for the other members, they were engaged in chaotic battles with numerous martial and magical puppets, with no formation, the battlefield in disarray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Sun Lingtong waited for a moment, seeing the timing was right, then secretly chuckled and commanded Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai lay flat in a makeshift coffin, buried under the floor tiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Cheng Bai did not show himself, lying flat while casting spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Immediately, ghostly wails and howls filled the air!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Various beast souls emerged from the ground, pouncing on the Reformation Team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Where did these beast souls come from?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">This was thanks to Ning Zhuo's brilliant idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After understanding Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, he thought of the first trial of the Buddhist Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">There were many coffins inside, sealed with numerous heads, including demonic beasts and spirit plants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Did these have souls?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Most likely, yes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Because when constructing spiritual mechanisms, it was essential to preserve them intact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The more complete the body, soul, mana, essence blood, and divine sense, the better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Thus, Ning Zhuo brought Sun Lingtong and Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai to the first trial of the Buddhist Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">With the help of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, the souls in these coffins were summoned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai took the opportunity to replenish a significant amount of combat power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Reformation Team had just defeated all the martial and magical puppets and were watching the battle between Meng Chong and Yuan Dasheng, tired and relaxed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Caught off guard, many reacted slowly, getting hit by ghosts, their souls collided, even bitten, screaming in pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The scene was chaotic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The air temperature plummeted, ghosts rose, flying in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Reformation Team from the City Lord's Mansion was in disarray, scattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"An ambush?!" Meng Chong glanced over, only to be counterattacked by Yuan Dasheng, sent flying, crashing into the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Roar!" Yuan Dasheng roared, beating his chest, exuding a heroic aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Then, he beckoned provocatively at Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Meng Chong's eyes widened, feeling underestimated by a mechanical construct!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He growled, charging again, engaging Yuan Dasheng in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">After several exchanges, Yuan Dasheng suddenly abandoned defense, extending his arms to embrace Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Meng Chong's eyes flashed with brilliance: "A flaw!" WildSprint Thunderclap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He shot out like lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Yuan Dasheng's arms crossed, embracing nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Almost simultaneously, Meng Chong appeared behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Meng Chong struck heavily at Yuan Dasheng's back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">As he succeeded, a black shadow appeared, attacking him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Meng Chong, caught off guard, was hit in the back by the shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">It was the lurking Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">With this strike, Meng Chong lost his mobility, his soul forcibly extracted from his puppet body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Meng Chong: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Reformation Team, chased by numerous beast souls, saw this and finally woke up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Young Master Meng Chong!" "Save the young master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Another special mechanical puppet appeared!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">They disregarded their safety, rushing towards Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Cheng Bai retreated silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Yuan Dasheng jumped in front of them, becoming an insurmountable obstacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Ah..." Meng Chong screamed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">His soul fell into Cheng Bai's hands, shrinking rapidly like a balloon with a hole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Nine Turns Soul Devouring Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Though Cheng Bai was dead, his Golden Core remained, and so did the Nine Turns Soul Devouring Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">In life, he easily extracted Sun Lingtong's soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This time, he succeeded in extracting Meng Chong's soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He operated the Nine Turns Soul Devouring Technique, devouring Meng Chong's soul!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Meng Chong's hands gripped Cheng Bai's arms, legs kicking, instinctively trying to use WildSprint Thunderclap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But Sun Lingtong was prepared, precisely commanding: "Use the Soul Shaking Throat Drum!" Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai's Adam's apple moved slightly, emitting a drum sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The drum sound hit Meng Chong, making him feel dizzy, his limbs going limp, no longer struggling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Cheng Bai took the opportunity to fiercely extract his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Meng Chong's soul shrank to the limit, on the verge of collapse, triggering the Life Hanging by a Thread on his head, gently pulling him out of the Immortal Palace, sending him back to his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Without Meng Chong, the numerous Reformation Team members were no threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Under the joint efforts of Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng and Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, they were quickly extracted, all devoured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Before their souls dissipated, they were sent back to their bodies by the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"We won!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Too easy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sun Lingtong emerged from the corner, clapping his hands, very excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He jogged to Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, giving an order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Cheng Bai squatted down, extending his palm, pressing it against Sun Lingtong's puppet body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The next moment, pure soul essence was infused into Sun Lingtong's soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong tilted his head back, taking a deep breath, shouting in comfort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">His soul had been injured, though treated with the Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pill, it was still a long way from full recovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">But now, with the soul essence, his soul injury healed rapidly, reaching peak condition, continuously surpassing limits, growing swiftly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Wonderful, truly wonderful!" Sun Lingtong was overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Stop, stop." He called out in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He absorbed half of the soul essence, leaving the other half for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"My soul injury is completely healed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"All future soul essence will be for Ning Zhuo. The more his soul power grows, the more Illusory True Lotus Seeds he can receive!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He called out to Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng: "Ning Zhuo, come quickly, there's something good to eat!" Ning Zhuo, through Yuan Dasheng, witnessed the entire process, swallowing unconsciously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">It had been a long time since he absorbed soul essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Han Ming had lost it, Cheng Bai was made into a mechanical puppet, allowing him to regain the channel for obtaining soul essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"The City Lord's Mansion has vast resources, treating Meng Chong and others' soul injuries is easy." "This is great!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but imagine the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">With Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, Ning Zhuo suddenly realized that all the cultivators participating in the trial were resources for his cultivation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"By the way, when will the three families' Reformation Team collectively enter the palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">........</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Forest of Ten Thousand Ghosts</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Netherworld Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The main sect of the Soul Devouring Sect was located here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Soul Lamp Tower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Countless soul lamps burned quietly, most emitting green flames, but some burned in other colors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Among the myriad soul lamps, a gray-white flame suddenly extinguished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The guarding disciple initially thought he was too sleepy, hallucinating, but after rubbing his eyes and looking again, he stood up in horror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Not good, true disciple Cheng Bai's soul lamp has extinguished!" The guarding disciple ran, kneeling before the elder to report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"What?!" The elder couldn't sit still, standing up immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Is it Cheng Bai? The soul lamp of Judge Cheng Bai?" The elder confirmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The disciple nodded repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The elder's face turned grave, rushing to the Soul Lamp Tower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Seeing the extinguished soul lamp, he had no more illusions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Our sect's true disciple has fallen!" The elder's face was extremely dark, sighing deeply, terrifying killing intent spreading.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The guarding disciple felt like he was in the depths of winter, his teeth chattering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The elder didn't linger, immediately leaving the tower to report to the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">In the main hall of the Soul Devouring Sect, the current sect master and several elders were discussing important matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Next year is our sect's once-a-decade disciple competition. The specific content of the competition should be finalized this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"A powerful soul beast has appeared in the Soul Crystal Mine of the Ghost Shadow Mountains, with combat power comparable to the Nascent Soul stage. It greatly interferes with our sect's soul crystal mining, requiring the sect to send elders to eliminate it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"The Ghost Mother White Bone Lotus in the Sub-Ghost Valley has accumulated for over twenty years and will bloom in three years. Recently, it is heard that true disciples of righteous sects are secretly plotting to destroy the Sub-Ghost Valley branch and the Ghost Mother White Bone Lotus."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Recently, the Blood Fiend Sect has repeatedly caused trouble in the middle section of the Ghost Cry River. According to intelligence, it is led by the new elder of the Blood Fiend Sect, Xue Shouren, who seems to have big plans. This person is a traitor of our sect, knowing much about us. Now he has joined the Blood Fiend Sect and become an elder. If not eliminated, he will become a great threat in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The Soul Devouring Sect, a major demonic sect, had vast influence, not only dominating one area but also establishing numerous branch sects, extending its reach to multiple cultivation countries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The position of sect master was not easy, dealing with countless affairs daily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Urgent report!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Our sect's true disciple Cheng Bai's soul lamp has extinguished, confirmed dead." The sect master and elders stopped their discussion, looking at the reporting disciple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The sect master's face darkened: "Can the soul be summoned?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The disciple hurriedly said: "The Soul Summoning Banner was used seven times, but Cheng Bai's soul did not return. The elders at the Soul Summoning Platform judged that Cheng Bai's soul has scattered."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The sect master angrily slapped the armrest: "Good, good, good. Our sect has lost a true disciple. Who did it? Find out the culprit, there will be retribution!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
