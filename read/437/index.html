<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 437: Divine Ability —Breaking the Army!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Although Xu Dali was not adaptable, he had battlefield experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He was extremely anxious because he knew his side was falling into the abyss of defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Iron Bucket Formation could not be fully deployed; if it was just the small inner circle, it would be hard to reverse the defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sitting atop his heavily armored rhino, Xu Dali shouted loudly, "Bring me my command flag!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Four Foundation Establishment body cultivators immediately moved the heavy command flag over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Such a significant military implement condensed military strength; especially when the battle formation was activated, it was even harder to move, let alone store it in a storage bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After moving the command flag beside Xu Dali, the four Foundation Establishment warriors were red-eyed and thick-necked, exhausted and drenched in sweat, panting heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Xu Dali extended his rough big hand, grabbed the flagpole, and suddenly shouted loudly, activating the military tactic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Military Tactic —Condense Morale!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">At that moment, the soldiers' attention all fell upon the main command flag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The command flag had not fallen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This battle was not over yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">There was still hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Countless cultivators' minds were stirring, generating similar thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Invisible military strength began to accumulate on the command flag; the flag started to flutter on its own in a windless environment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Fight, fight, fight!" Xu Dali shouted loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The personal guards and elite soldiers around him also shouted along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">For a moment, the frustrated morale was suddenly lifted significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Not only did the Barbarian Demon Camp feel Xu Dali's fighting spirit, but even the besieging barbarian cultivators changed their expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Xu Dali may not be smart, but he is tough and has strong fighting spirit; he's a hard bone to chew," the barbarian cultivators showed a bit of admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">They despised weakness and admired toughness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Heh heh, interesting." Seeing this, Bi Tengyi just stretched out a finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Nascent Soul-level Qi suddenly erupted, surging and vast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Divine Ability —Creeping Hell!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">As the Barbarian Demon Camp's morale was condensing and the main command flag fluttered, suddenly a jade-green wind arose out of thin air, sweeping over the army in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">An ominous aura spread out; the ground cracked, splitting into countless fine fissures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Dark green vines and thorns, like giant pythons and swarms of snakes, crazily gushed out from underground!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">These thorns and vines grew astonishingly, twisting and stretching, entangling cultivators' bodies, assassinating one fresh life after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Even Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators, even if they activated all their defenses, were pierced like thin paper in an instant, blood splattering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">They struggled desperately; various attacks struck the vines but could hardly cause any damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">After a few breaths, these cultivators died tragically on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Meanwhile, the thorns and vines had grown into large patches, spreading out in all directions, covering the sky and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The dense thorns were like countless sharp knife tips, reaping countless lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Barbarian Demon Camp fell into chaos!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Unlike Lone Fang, Bi Tengyi mastered a divine ability and was a True Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Although Tu Ming was also a Nascent Soul True Lord, his Formless Poison was only at the spell level, not a divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The power of a divine ability naturally surpassed that of spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The outer Barbarian Demon army was brutally slaughtered, with over half dead or injured. Vines shuttled everywhere around, forming a terrifying dark green hell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Bi Tengyi revealed a ferocious smile. Under her deliberate control, large patches of vines divided the battlefield into sections, trapping the cultivators of the Barbarian Demon Camp, forming one cage after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The cultivators could not break out; the vines would suddenly dart out every so often, entangling the unluckiest one and lifting them high up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Then, in full view of everyone, they would strangle the unlucky cultivator to death. The thorns pierced through their armor, stabbed into their flesh, causing the cultivator to wail in pain, despair, and terror during the strangulation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">This caused the morale of the Barbarian Demon Camp to plummet like an avalanche!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The morale that Xu Dali had gathered using military tactics quickly diminished, falling to the bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Seeing this, the deputy general hurriedly petitioned, "General, the situation is lost; we can retreat now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But Xu Dali said, "No way!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"I am the vanguard who opens the way; how can I have any reason to retreat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Only fight to the death, fight to the death without retreat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Xu Dali's stubborn temper flared up; he stiffened his neck and held his ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The deputy general gritted his teeth, sighed inwardly, showed a resolute expression, and no longer mentioned retreating, focusing wholeheartedly on fighting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The defeat of the Barbarian Demon Camp was already a foregone conclusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But at the core, the small Iron Bucket Formation remained as solid as ever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Xu Dali's personal guards and elite soldiers firmly held their positions; even though the wolf packs continuously assaulted, they remained unmoved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">On the mountainside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Cangteng King looked at Bi Tengyi, asking about her condition with concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Bi Tengyi's mouth and nose were bleeding, and her aura rapidly declined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">She didn't mind and grinned, saying, "So, attacking national defense and bearing the backlash of a nation's might feels like this. Hehehe, hahaha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Her laughter was hoarse and unpleasant, like the cawing of a crow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Although the Barbarian Demon Camp had a complex composition and was newly formed, Xu Dali was a general of Two Note Country, carrying a general's seal. This Barbarian Demon Camp was an army registered under Two Note Country, thus part of the national defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Casual cultivators like Bi Tengyi, without the backing of another country's national power, would inevitably suffer backlash from the nation's might when attacking national defense alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">At this time, Bi Tengyi not only suffered minor injuries but was also suppressed by the nation's power, with her combat strength dropping by thirty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">It would take some time of recuperation to gradually recover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Leaving Two Note Country's borders and entering another country's territory would reduce the suppression by the nation's power significantly, and the recovery speed would also accelerate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">For the cultivators of Thousand Peaks Forest, their disadvantage was here —the Thousand Peaks Forest was one of Two Note Country's territories, and the cultivators did not have another nation's national body to share the backlash for them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Another mountainside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Such a big move, is the old woman of the Ancient Vine Tribe not wanting to live?" The Poisonous Belly High Priest Tu Ming was slightly surprised in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He was also a True Lord, mastering divine abilities, but was very cautious when making a move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">After all, suffering suppression from the nation's might, combat strength recovered very slowly, and next, they would have to face the main forces and vanguard of Two Note Country's army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This battle had just begun; naturally, they had to hold back somewhat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The Poisonous Belly High Priest made up his mind and released a secret messenger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Soon, a venomous snake emerged from the grass, came before Bi Tengyi, and conveyed Tu Ming's intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Tu Ming: "Xu Dali alone has shown the toughness of Two Note Country's cultivators and cannot be underestimated. Now, a small half of the Barbarian Demon Camp's cultivators are trapped by the vines, which is unfavorable to the overall situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"I hope you, Bi Tengyi, act according to the plan and use this group of routed soldiers to attack the White Jade Camp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Bi Tengyi sneered but was unwilling: "Mo Yuan Cave Master's mind is indeed sharp, able to manage the Six Caves Sect so prosperously, reaping benefits overtly and covertly. But this old woman has paid so much price, and now this batch of military achievements is about to be in my pocket. Now you want me to act according to his arrangement; who will pay for this loss?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Tu Ming's words made sense, but Bi Tengyi's interests were real.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Tu Ming was a Nascent Soul True Lord; Bi Tengyi was the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">This was the downside of an alliance; unable to be of one mind, everyone was more concerned about their own gains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But Tu Ming had anticipated this and, using the venomous snake messenger, said, "Bi Tengyi, have you forgotten that Lord Long might be watching you from the sky?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">A Divine Decree was rigid; although it could assist in recording military merits, it was limited to recording headcounts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Bi Tengyi's expression changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">She had signed the Divine Decree, requiring her to go all out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">She was the first in this surprise attack team to achieve this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Therefore, the Ginseng Beard Dragon King had sent His temple officiant, Lord Long, to personally supervise the battle and record the entire battle process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Although Bi Tengyi was unwilling, she did not dare to defy the Ginseng Beard Dragon King's will. She snorted coldly and agreed: "I will take the initiative to open a passage, allowing this group of routed soldiers to escape this battlefield. But as for how to guide them to attack the White Jade Camp, that is not our responsibility."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The venomous snake messenger conveyed Tu Ming's laughter: "Don't worry, I will personally set out and send subordinates to drive them along the way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"As for here..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Leave it to the people of the Azure Moon Tribe."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
