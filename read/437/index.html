<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 437: Divine Ability —Breaking the Army!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Although Xu Dali was not adaptable, he had battlefield experience.<br/>
<br/>
He was extremely anxious because he knew his side was falling into the abyss of defeat.<br/>
<br/>
The Iron Bucket Formation could not be fully deployed; if it was just the small inner circle, it would be hard to reverse the defeat.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting atop his heavily armored rhino, Xu Dali shouted loudly, "Bring me my command flag!"<br/>
<br/>
Four Foundation Establishment body cultivators immediately moved the heavy command flag over.<br/>
<br/>
Such a significant military implement condensed military strength; especially when the battle formation was activated, it was even harder to move, let alone store it in a storage bag.<br/>
<br/>
After moving the command flag beside Xu Dali, the four Foundation Establishment warriors were red-eyed and thick-necked, exhausted and drenched in sweat, panting heavily.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali extended his rough big hand, grabbed the flagpole, and suddenly shouted loudly, activating the military tactic.<br/>
<br/>
Military Tactic —Condense Morale!<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, the soldiers' attention all fell upon the main command flag.<br/>
<br/>
The command flag had not fallen!<br/>
<br/>
This battle was not over yet.<br/>
<br/>
There was still hope.<br/>
<br/>
Countless cultivators' minds were stirring, generating similar thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Invisible military strength began to accumulate on the command flag; the flag started to flutter on its own in a windless environment.<br/>
<br/>
"Fight, fight, fight!" Xu Dali shouted loudly.<br/>
<br/>
The personal guards and elite soldiers around him also shouted along.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the frustrated morale was suddenly lifted significantly.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did the Barbarian Demon Camp feel Xu Dali's fighting spirit, but even the besieging barbarian cultivators changed their expressions.<br/>
<br/>
"Xu Dali may not be smart, but he is tough and has strong fighting spirit; he's a hard bone to chew," the barbarian cultivators showed a bit of admiration.<br/>
<br/>
They despised weakness and admired toughness.<br/>
<br/>
"Heh heh, interesting." Seeing this, Bi Tengyi just stretched out a finger.<br/>
<br/>
Nascent Soul-level Qi suddenly erupted, surging and vast!<br/>
<br/>
Divine Ability —Creeping Hell!<br/>
<br/>
As the Barbarian Demon Camp's morale was condensing and the main command flag fluttered, suddenly a jade-green wind arose out of thin air, sweeping over the army in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
An ominous aura spread out; the ground cracked, splitting into countless fine fissures.<br/>
<br/>
Dark green vines and thorns, like giant pythons and swarms of snakes, crazily gushed out from underground!<br/>
<br/>
These thorns and vines grew astonishingly, twisting and stretching, entangling cultivators' bodies, assassinating one fresh life after another.<br/>
<br/>
Even Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators, even if they activated all their defenses, were pierced like thin paper in an instant, blood splattering.<br/>
<br/>
They struggled desperately; various attacks struck the vines but could hardly cause any damage.<br/>
<br/>
After a few breaths, these cultivators died tragically on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the thorns and vines had grown into large patches, spreading out in all directions, covering the sky and earth.<br/>
<br/>
The dense thorns were like countless sharp knife tips, reaping countless lives.<br/>
<br/>
The Barbarian Demon Camp fell into chaos!<br/>
<br/>
Unlike Lone Fang, Bi Tengyi mastered a divine ability and was a True Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Although Tu Ming was also a Nascent Soul True Lord, his Formless Poison was only at the spell level, not a divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
The power of a divine ability naturally surpassed that of spells.<br/>
<br/>
The outer Barbarian Demon army was brutally slaughtered, with over half dead or injured. Vines shuttled everywhere around, forming a terrifying dark green hell.<br/>
<br/>
Bi Tengyi revealed a ferocious smile. Under her deliberate control, large patches of vines divided the battlefield into sections, trapping the cultivators of the Barbarian Demon Camp, forming one cage after another.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators could not break out; the vines would suddenly dart out every so often, entangling the unluckiest one and lifting them high up.<br/>
<br/>
Then, in full view of everyone, they would strangle the unlucky cultivator to death. The thorns pierced through their armor, stabbed into their flesh, causing the cultivator to wail in pain, despair, and terror during the strangulation.<br/>
<br/>
This caused the morale of the Barbarian Demon Camp to plummet like an avalanche!<br/>
<br/>
The morale that Xu Dali had gathered using military tactics quickly diminished, falling to the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, the deputy general hurriedly petitioned, "General, the situation is lost; we can retreat now."<br/>
<br/>
But Xu Dali said, "No way!"<br/>
<br/>
"I am the vanguard who opens the way; how can I have any reason to retreat?"<br/>
<br/>
"Only fight to the death, fight to the death without retreat!"<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali's stubborn temper flared up; he stiffened his neck and held his ground.<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general gritted his teeth, sighed inwardly, showed a resolute expression, and no longer mentioned retreating, focusing wholeheartedly on fighting.<br/>
<br/>
The defeat of the Barbarian Demon Camp was already a foregone conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
But at the core, the small Iron Bucket Formation remained as solid as ever.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali's personal guards and elite soldiers firmly held their positions; even though the wolf packs continuously assaulted, they remained unmoved.<br/>
<br/>
On the mountainside.<br/>
<br/>
Cangteng King looked at Bi Tengyi, asking about her condition with concern.<br/>
<br/>
Bi Tengyi's mouth and nose were bleeding, and her aura rapidly declined.<br/>
<br/>
She didn't mind and grinned, saying, "So, attacking national defense and bearing the backlash of a nation's might feels like this. Hehehe, hahaha."<br/>
<br/>
Her laughter was hoarse and unpleasant, like the cawing of a crow.<br/>
<br/>
Although the Barbarian Demon Camp had a complex composition and was newly formed, Xu Dali was a general of Two Note Country, carrying a general's seal. This Barbarian Demon Camp was an army registered under Two Note Country, thus part of the national defense.<br/>
<br/>
Casual cultivators like Bi Tengyi, without the backing of another country's national power, would inevitably suffer backlash from the nation's might when attacking national defense alone.<br/>
<br/>
At this time, Bi Tengyi not only suffered minor injuries but was also suppressed by the nation's power, with her combat strength dropping by thirty percent.<br/>
<br/>
It would take some time of recuperation to gradually recover.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Two Note Country's borders and entering another country's territory would reduce the suppression by the nation's power significantly, and the recovery speed would also accelerate.<br/>
<br/>
For the cultivators of Thousand Peaks Forest, their disadvantage was here —the Thousand Peaks Forest was one of Two Note Country's territories, and the cultivators did not have another nation's national body to share the backlash for them.<br/>
<br/>
Another mountainside.<br/>
<br/>
"Such a big move, is the old woman of the Ancient Vine Tribe not wanting to live?" The Poisonous Belly High Priest Tu Ming was slightly surprised in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
He was also a True Lord, mastering divine abilities, but was very cautious when making a move.<br/>
<br/>
After all, suffering suppression from the nation's might, combat strength recovered very slowly, and next, they would have to face the main forces and vanguard of Two Note Country's army.<br/>
<br/>
This battle had just begun; naturally, they had to hold back somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
The Poisonous Belly High Priest made up his mind and released a secret messenger.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, a venomous snake emerged from the grass, came before Bi Tengyi, and conveyed Tu Ming's intentions.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming: "Xu Dali alone has shown the toughness of Two Note Country's cultivators and cannot be underestimated. Now, a small half of the Barbarian Demon Camp's cultivators are trapped by the vines, which is unfavorable to the overall situation."<br/>
<br/>
"I hope you, Bi Tengyi, act according to the plan and use this group of routed soldiers to attack the White Jade Camp."<br/>
<br/>
Bi Tengyi sneered but was unwilling: "Mo Yuan Cave Master's mind is indeed sharp, able to manage the Six Caves Sect so prosperously, reaping benefits overtly and covertly. But this old woman has paid so much price, and now this batch of military achievements is about to be in my pocket. Now you want me to act according to his arrangement; who will pay for this loss?"<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming's words made sense, but Bi Tengyi's interests were real.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming was a Nascent Soul True Lord; Bi Tengyi was the same.<br/>
<br/>
This was the downside of an alliance; unable to be of one mind, everyone was more concerned about their own gains.<br/>
<br/>
But Tu Ming had anticipated this and, using the venomous snake messenger, said, "Bi Tengyi, have you forgotten that Lord Long might be watching you from the sky?"<br/>
<br/>
A Divine Decree was rigid; although it could assist in recording military merits, it was limited to recording headcounts.<br/>
<br/>
Bi Tengyi's expression changed slightly.<br/>
<br/>
She had signed the Divine Decree, requiring her to go all out.<br/>
<br/>
She was the first in this surprise attack team to achieve this.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the Ginseng Beard Dragon King had sent His temple officiant, Lord Long, to personally supervise the battle and record the entire battle process.<br/>
<br/>
Although Bi Tengyi was unwilling, she did not dare to defy the Ginseng Beard Dragon King's will. She snorted coldly and agreed: "I will take the initiative to open a passage, allowing this group of routed soldiers to escape this battlefield. But as for how to guide them to attack the White Jade Camp, that is not our responsibility."<br/>
<br/>
The venomous snake messenger conveyed Tu Ming's laughter: "Don't worry, I will personally set out and send subordinates to drive them along the way."<br/>
<br/>
"As for here..."<br/>
<br/>
"Leave it to the people of the Azure Moon Tribe."</div>
