<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Looking at the young man in white before her, Lin Shanshan felt a strange sensation in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
It was a feeling she had never experienced in her more than twenty years of life.<br/>
<br/>
"So it's Young Master Ning Zhuo. If you're seeking guidance or instruction, you should be heading to the original mountain. Why are you here in the back of the mountain of this place?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan struggled to calm her emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was wearing the Myriad-Mile Dragon around his waist.<br/>
<br/>
Hidden within the Myriad-Mile Dragon, Sun Lingtong watched the situation with interest. Upon hearing Lin Shanshan‚Äôs question, he answered on his own accord, ‚ÄúOf course, after seeing you, he came here specifically.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Following the jade slip provided by Ning Jiufan and the bits of intelligence he had obtained from Meng Yaoyin, Ning Zhuo had carefully planned his journey.<br/>
<br/>
The first stop was Stomach Yin Mountain, and the second was Myriad Medicine Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the day, when the Ning family relocated, they cleverly traversed underground rivers to avoid the blockade of powerful enemies on the surface.<br/>
<br/>
The exit of the underground river was what is now the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, guarded by Linghu Jiu.<br/>
<br/>
The entire Ning family arrived at Myriad Medicine Valley, causing quite a stir at the time.<br/>
<br/>
The grand sect, Myriad Medicine Sect, was highly skilled in alchemy and healing. When the Ning family arrived, they were utterly exhausted and stayed in the valley to recuperate for some time.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, Meng Yaoyin had suffered from premature labor, but thanks to a magical artifact from the sect, the Fetal Breath Spirit Fragrance, the crisis was averted.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin, in her later years as a Mechanical Buddha Doctor, still retained her sanity long enough to recount this experience to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs primary goal for this trip was to acquire the Fetal Breath Spirit Slip. Additionally, he aimed to seek out relics from the Ning family‚Äôs time living in the Myriad Medicine Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong manipulated the Myriad-Mile Dragon to pierce through the void and arrive at the valley.<br/>
<br/>
First, he and Ning Zhuo sneaked out, disguised themselves, and gathered much information locally.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, they had a good understanding of the general situation in the Myriad Medicine Sect. They knew that the woman in front of them, Lin Shanshan, was the only child of the current sect master, Lin Bufan, making her the heiress of this grand sect.<br/>
<br/>
Though not at the center of power, she held considerable influence over the higher-ups.<br/>
<br/>
After deliberation, Ning and Sun orchestrated the current "coincidental" encounter.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Ability: Life-Hanging Thread!<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Ning Zhuo laid eyes on Lin Shanshan, he secretly planted his divine ability within her.<br/>
<br/>
He then discreetly used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal to enhance her favorable impression of him.<br/>
<br/>
Back when Ning Zhuo was in the early stages of Qi Refining, he was already able to invoke a trace of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal‚Äôs power, affecting Ning Ze, the three Huang family ghosts, and even resisting the detection of Golden Core stage cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Ning Zhuo was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, while Lin Shanshan was only in the early stage of Foundation Establishment. At the same level, Ning Zhuo could easily influence her.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly clasped his hands in salute and explained that he had come from this direction, intending to visit the Myriad Medicine Sect. Unaware of the location of Great Contest Peak, he had inadvertently wandered into this area.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled as she approached him, saying it was no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
"Great Contest Peak hasn‚Äôt been a forbidden area for many years. The Ten Thousand Demon Cave no longer has demonic beasts emerging, and it‚Äôs now very safe."<br/>
<br/>
"You needn‚Äôt worry too much, Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"Our Myriad Medicine Sect has always welcomed outside cultivators like yourself. The core of our sect‚Äôs philosophy is to be open and friendly with others."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately complimented her, "I have long heard of your sect's excellent reputation and have admired it for a long time. That‚Äôs why I traveled such a great distance to come here."<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest, I was quite nervous."<br/>
<br/>
"But just hearing your few simple words has given me great comfort."<br/>
<br/>
"I am not so anxious anymore. Thank you, Miss Lin."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too polite.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúHaving more people is no problem,‚Äù Ning Zhuo said as he took out a Mist Rust Orchid from his storage belt. "Please accept this as a small gift, Miss Lin. I‚Äôve just arrived here and could use your help with something."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan did not accept the Mist Rust Orchid, smiling as she replied, ‚ÄúWhat do you need help with?‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, "I am new to this place and worry about entering forbidden areas by mistake. Seeing that you‚Äôre a local cultivator, I boldly ask if you could guide me to Small Contest Peak."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan nodded, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a small matter. Follow me. As for this gift, I won‚Äôt accept it.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan, being the sect master's daughter, had seen many rare herbs and treasures. A common Mist Rust Orchid didn‚Äôt catch her attention at all.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, she began leading the way for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
As they walked through the forest, Lin Shanshan was slightly ahead, leading by half a step.<br/>
<br/>
Sunlight streamed through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the grass and the small forest paths.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain breeze blew gently, the leaves rustled, birds chirped brightly, and the creek flowed smoothly‚Äîa picturesque scene.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan took the initiative to explain the general situation of Myriad Medicine Valley and the sect to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Feigning ignorance, Ning Zhuo asked several questions, even though he already knew the answers, successfully creating a relaxed atmosphere for conversation.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúMiss Lin, wait a moment.‚Äù Ning Zhuo suddenly stepped forward to push aside a branch for her.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan‚Äôs goodwill toward Ning Zhuo increased slightly, but under the influence of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, her fondness for him increased tenfold!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo spoke humorously, making Lin Shanshan enjoy the conversation. She even found herself occasionally laughing out loud.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan had been born when her father was already the sect master of the Myriad Medicine Sect. Although she was older than Ning Zhuo by five years, now twenty-one, her life experiences were far more limited.<br/>
<br/>
One had grown up sheltered from the world, unknowing of its dangers, while the other had lost his parents early and faced many hardships, sharpening his wit and conversational skills.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the entire conversation, Ning Zhuo controlled the dialogue completely.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan didn‚Äôt notice anything out of the ordinary until she and Ning Zhuo reached the foot of Small Contest Peak and met her sect members handling identification matters. She suddenly realized, "How did we already walk out of the rear mountain of Great Contest Peak? How did time pass so quickly?"<br/>
<br/>
"Sister Lin." Her fellow disciples greeted Lin Shanshan with courtesy upon seeing her.<br/>
<br/>
In front of others, Lin Shanshan regained her composure and stepped aside to introduce Ning Zhuo. "This young man has just arrived in our Myriad Medicine Valley. I met him along the way and brought him here. Please see to it that he is properly accommodated."<br/>
<br/>
Her fellow disciple smiled broadly, "Since Sister Lin has brought him here, I‚Äôll naturally take care of it."<br/>
<br/>
"How about we let him stay in cave dwelling number 328 for now?"<br/>
<br/>
The disciple glanced at Lin Shanshan, his eyes seeking her approval.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan hesitated for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
She had done this kind of thing many times, guiding outsiders to Myriad Medicine Valley and helping them settle at Small Contest Peak. Normally, her fellow disciples would, out of respect for her, arrange for the visitor to have a better cave dwelling.<br/>
<br/>
There were about five hundred cave dwellings on Small Contest Peak. The lower the number, the better the dwelling. Dwelling 328 was middle-tier at best.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan typically didn‚Äôt mind such arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
But this time, she felt differently. Ning Zhuo had made such a good first impression that she wanted to help him a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan knew that this request would technically violate sect rules. Was it too much to ask?<br/>
<br/>
Buddha Heart Demon Seal!<br/>
<br/>
Seeing her hesitation, Ning Zhuo decisively used a trace of the artifact‚Äôs power.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan‚Äôs doubts melted away, and she directly asked, "Is there a better cave dwelling available?"<br/>
<br/>
Her fellow disciple was startled. He hadn‚Äôt expected Lin Shanshan to make such a request.<br/>
<br/>
"This must be the first time the young lady has done this, right?" The disciple‚Äôs curiosity grew as he studied Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing his white robes and extraordinary bearing, the disciple couldn‚Äôt help but wonder more about Ning Zhuo‚Äôs background.<br/>
<br/>
As he speculated, he said, "If I‚Äôm not mistaken, there‚Äôs dwelling number 281 available. How about that?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan immediately regretted making her request but quickly nodded. "That will do."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo received the token, and Lin Shanshan felt a sudden urge to accompany him further.<br/>
<br/>
"What‚Äôs happening to me?" Lin Shanshan shook her head inwardly, suppressing the impulse.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to overdo it, Ning Zhuo refrained from further activating the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, letting things unfold naturally.<br/>
<br/>
After bidding farewell to Lin Shanshan, Ning Zhuo took out another gift‚Äîtwo Mist Rust Orchids. He offered them, but Lin Shanshan waved her hand and smiled, declining.<br/>
<br/>
The disciple, watching this exchange, chuckled inwardly, "Two mere Qi Refining-grade Mist Rust Orchids? The young lady wouldn‚Äôt even glance at them. This kid must be out of his depth."<br/>
<br/>
Little did he know, this was all part of Ning Zhuo‚Äôs plan.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan felt no offense, nor did she think Ning Zhuo was underestimating her. Instead, she found this young man to be simple, sincere, and, in a way, adorably naive.<br/>
