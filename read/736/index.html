<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In another cave dwelling, Che Zhuzi held the intelligence report in his hand. The light in the room illuminated half his face, leaving the other half in shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Che Zhuzi's expression was complex and conflicted. "I never imagined Ning Zhuo's talent would be so extraordinary - a first-rate genius!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"If only I had known he had already secured first place twice among the Confucian cultivators..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">His thoughts shifted. "No, I must maintain neutrality. That's what benefits me most."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Although Ning Zhuo has taken the initiative to propose a larger deal, the Ban Clan remains a force to be reckoned with."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Ban Ji's talent should have earned him a Stone Token in the first round. But Ning Zhuo thwarted his plans at every turn."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"It doesn't matter that he didn't stand out in the first round. He'll undoubtedly secure a spot in the second."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">As a merchant, Che Zhuzi naturally preferred to play both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">As a Demon Cultivator who wasn't yet desperate, he was already living comfortably by trading Void Spider Silk. Why should he commit to one side and place a premature, high-stakes bet?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In his current position, Che Zhuzi instinctively avoided risk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Still, I should send a congratulatory letter to Ning Zhuo for obtaining the Stone Token."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"And include some customary gifts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo's acquisition of the Stone Token dramatically increased his value and status in Che Zhuzi's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Confucian cultivators were gathered for a meeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Hahaha! As expected, a tiger father begets no dog son. Meng Yaoyin's son is truly remarkable!" The Confucian cultivators were discussing Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Upon learning of Ning Zhuo's achievement, they were universally delighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"We should write to Wen Ruanyu and share this good news."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Indeed. Imprisonment must be unbearable. Since he cares so deeply for Ning Zhuo's lineage, this news will surely dispel the gloom in his heart and bring him immense joy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"No wonder Wen Ruanyu has been so attentive to Ning Zhuo. The boy is a first-rate cultivation prodigy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Song Taosheng stroked his beard. "While his cultivation aptitude is impressive, I'm even more impressed by his performance during the Three Questions of the Heart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Demon Subduing Hall's Rising Cloud Trial was far more rigorous than most trials, carrying significant weight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo's performance during the Three Questions of the Heart had been exceptional. Moreover, the audience included not only high-ranking cultivators from the Demon Subduing Hall but also many other cultivators participating in the Rising Cloud Trial. As a result, news of his achievement spread rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Now, with Ning Zhuo's acquisition of the Stone Token and his rising fame, these remarkable feats were widely circulated and became common knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Song Taosheng's words resonated with most of the Confucian cultivators present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Chu Xuangui, among them, recalled Ning Zhuo's performance during the Rising Cloud Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">At the time, Ning Zhuo had seemed deeply versed in the rules, displaying remarkable synergy despite their first meeting. Though they hadn't exchanged a single word in secret, their collaboration had been seamless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">I never imagined this young man, with his nimble skills, possessed such unwavering integrity. Such individuals are truly rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo's innate sense of justice naturally endeared him to the Confucian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">One cultivator suddenly asked, "Now that Ning Zhuo has obtained the Stone Token and gained renown, do we still need to continue supporting him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Confucian cultivators exchanged varied glances at this question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Some began to ponder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Others expressed concern. "Indeed. Others are unaware of the troubles surrounding Ning Zhuo, which we learned in advance through Wen Ruanyu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Given Ning Zhuo's current reputation, the sect's higher-ups will have to think twice before moving against him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Judging by the outcome, our initial objectives have already been achieved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"If we continue to support him further, it might arouse suspicion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">At this point, Song Taosheng couldn't contain himself. He snorted coldly, cutting them off. "Suspicion? Are you all so afraid?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">A Confucian cultivator spoke with a grave expression: "Old Master Song, there's no need to speak so harshly. We're not worried about our personal safety, but rather about the consequences if our secret support for Ning Zhuo is exposed. It would severely damage the reputation of all Confucian cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Nearly every Confucian cultivator in the Sect is gathered here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"We need new members and must grow stronger. But how can we attract talented Confucian cultivators if we're burdened with a tarnished reputation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">His words carried weight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">By deliberately downplaying his personal concerns and focusing on the collective interests of the Confucian cultivators, he compelled many to reconsider their stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sensing the shift in the atmosphere, Chu Xuangui decisively countered: "That's a flawed argument!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"How often does a prodigy like Ning Zhuo emerge?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"He's not just a genius who excelled in the first round; he also passed the Three Questions of the Heart. A young man with such character is invaluable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Since he's proven himself so capable and is practically one of our own, why shouldn't we increase our support and provide him with even greater resources?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Chu Xuangui voiced his own conviction, not only rejecting the proposal to withdraw support but also advocating for increased assistance to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The cultivators exchanged glances before one spoke up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Soon, everyone was sharing their opinions, each clinging to their own perspective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">As Song Taosheng listened, he sensed the situation was deteriorating, his brow gradually furrowing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Confucian cultivators were adept at self-preservation. Having achieved their objectives ahead of schedule, withdrawing promptly had become the consensus among an increasing number of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Song Taosheng's Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he pondered. He first turned his gaze toward Chu Xuangui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">To his surprise, Chu Xuangui had already fixed his gaze on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Their eyes met for only an instant, yet they instantly understood each other's intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Unlike the other Confucian cultivators, both Song Taosheng and Chu Xuangui had taken the initiative to support Ning Zhuo from the start. Having met and interacted with him, they held a favorable impression of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The others' impressions of Ning Zhuo were vague, based solely on intelligence reports - objective but lacking personal connection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Having already invested in Ning Zhuo, Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng naturally wanted him to go further and reach greater heights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Song Taosheng closed his eyes slightly and leaned back in his chair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Chu Xuangui immediately understood: Song Taosheng intended to play the long game, leaving him to lead the charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A faint smile played on Chu Xuangui's lips as he slowly rose to his feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">With all the other Confucian cultivators seated, Chu Xuangui's movement immediately drew their attention. They realized he had something to say.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Chu Xuangui surveyed the room with a smile. "Actually, there's no need to debate whether we should continue supporting that Ning Zhuo kid."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"If you believe in the young man, go ahead and lend him a hand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Those who have concerns are perfectly justified in observing from the sidelines."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Heh heh heh." Chu Xuangui chuckled. "My greatest feeling right now might differ from yours, fellow Daoists. I feel relieved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Someone, puzzled, immediately asked, "Why relieved?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Chu Xuangui clasped his hands in a respectful bow to the assembly. "Fellow Daoists, I won't hide it from you. My greatest worry all along has been Senior Ning Zhuozhang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"If Senior Ning Zhuozhang were to discover your secret support for Ning Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Given his temperament, he would likely give you all a severe scolding!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This statement immediately resonated with many Confucian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Indeed, indeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"That's exactly right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Fellow Daoist Chu and I share the same concerns."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Chu Xuangui shifted his tone. "But now, everything has changed. Based on Ning Zhuo's current performance, both his strength and character are impeccable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Even if Senior Ning Zhuozhang were to learn of this, he wouldn't criticize us. He would simply see it as us nurturing the younger generation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">As these words were spoken, smiles, subtle or overt, spread across the faces of the Confucian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Some, however, fell into thoughtful contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Song Taosheng couldn't resist narrowing his eyes slightly, glancing at Chu Xuangui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He had initially expected to collaborate with Chu Xuangui on this matter, but the latter's performance had far exceeded his expectations!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">On the surface, Chu Xuangui appeared concerned about how Senior Ning Zhuozhang might react. In reality, he was subtly reminding everyone of Senior Ning Zhuozhang's likely opinion of Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Within the Confucian cultivator community of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Chu Xuangui, Song Taosheng, and Wen Ruanyu were considered the pillars of the group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">But Senior Ning Zhuozhang was the soul of the sect, the core of the core, their ultimate trump card!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">His attitude influenced nearly every Confucian cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">What would Senior Ning Zhuozhang think of Ning Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Even those who had never personally met Ning Zhuo could answer with absolute certainty: "Of course, he would admire him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Thus, as the Confucian cultivators realized Senior Ning Zhuozhang would likely admire Ning Zhuo, their own perceptions began to shift accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This shift in attitude was remarkably natural.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Except for a few exceptions, most Confucian cultivators remained oblivious to the change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The conversation soon circled back to the original topic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Speaking of which, Ning Zhuo isn't even a Confucian cultivator. Helping him would be like assisting an outsider. Even if this matter comes to light in the future, it will only showcase the noble character and integrity of our Confucian cultivator community."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"We must continue supporting Ning Zhuo. How else could we face Wen Ruanyu? We promised him at least a second Rising Cloud Trial for Ning Zhuo and pledged our full support!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"How can we abandon our word?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Confucian cultivators tacitly avoided mentioning Senior Ning Zhuozhang, instead devising other reasons to justify their continued support for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Everyone agreed: they would continue supporting Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Then you should organize a third Rising Cloud Trial next."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"How should we proceed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"The crucial question is: how can we make it most beneficial for Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Simple. First, spread the word. Then, I suspect Ning Zhuo will likely send us some signals." Chu Xuangui finally spoke up at this point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Song Taosheng smiled faintly. "This old one concurs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Qing Huangzi had just finished writing a letter. By the candlelight, he silently reread it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Qing Huangzi bows respectfully, presenting this letter to Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo:..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"...Knowing my frail body is like decaying wood, with little life remaining, I fear betraying the Late Master's trust and failing myself. Thus, I dare to send this letter, pouring out my heart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"When the Late Master passed, his withered hand still clutched the reed, his spiritual energy as faint as a wisp of smoke. His final words were but one request..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"At that time, I wept bitterly, raising my hand to the heavens and swearing to never betray his trust! Yet, alas, my innate talent is dull. Despite dedicating my entire life to the Mechanical Arts..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Now, as my life dwindles, I fear the Late Master's lifeblood will be buried with this decaying body!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Recently, I learned Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo obtained the Stone Token and faced the Three Questions of the Heart in the Demon Subduing Hall. Your conduct was dignified and righteous, your resolve unmatched..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"The Rising Cloud Trial is merely a hurdle for mediocrity, unfit for a True Dragon's soaring flight. To cling to such trivial rules would be to tarnish a radiant pearl, a sin I dare not commit! Therefore, I boldly use my frail body and meager reputation to break convention! I waive all petty trials and entrust the legacy of this lineage directly to you! This is no impulsive act, but the culmination of observing your talent and virtue, recalling the Late Master's dying wish, and sensing the urgency of the times. These three forces converge, overwhelming my restraint!"...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">After reading the entire letter, Qing Huangzi sighed deeply. With a subtle movement of his divine sense, he opened the seclusion window.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He infused the flying letter with spiritual energy, mimicking its flight through the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Green Stone Cave Dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Within the Martial Arts Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, a Magic Artifact-grade zither floating three inches above the ground before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The Big-Headed Youth's eyes were half-closed, his ten fingers blurring into afterimages as they danced across the strings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Sound waves swept across the ground, activating over a dozen bamboo figurines no larger than an adult's palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">These weren't directly controlled by Divine Sense, but rather animated by specific musical notes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">As more bamboo figures awakened, their movements grew increasingly fluid and lifelike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">One figure crouched low and lunged forward, its arms crossed like mantis blades, slicing through the air with a sharp hiss. Another spun into a flying kick, its leg blurring like a whip. A third adopted a horse stance, hands clasped in a simple yet powerful Black Tiger Heart Strike. Still others moved with eerie fluidity, their ghostly forms stirring up chilling yin winds...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo's hands glided across the zither, sometimes plucking with precision, other times strumming with fierce abandon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The bamboo figurines began to pair off and engage in combat. Their movements were swift and precise, each strike accompanied by a crisp "snap" from their joints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo's fingerwork shifted again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">A series of clear, resonant notes flowed forth, like pearls cascading onto a jade plate, yet imbued with a strange, vibrating energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The remaining bamboo figurines responded to the sound, abandoning their individual duels to coordinate and form various battle formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Three figures stood back-to-back in a triangular formation, each acting as a corner of the triangle, their positions balanced for both offense and defense - the fundamental Small Three Talents Battle Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Four figures formed a square, each guarding a cardinal direction, while a fifth figure stood at the center, directing and supporting the others. Their spiritual energy flowed in harmony, creating the Four Symbols Plum Blossom Battle Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Seven figures aligned like the Big Dipper, their movements synchronized, their spiritual energy subtly connected in a single line, forming the Big Dipper Seven Stars Battle Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Even Ning Zhuo, who had participated in the great wars of the Two Note Kingdom, had never witnessed such mastery of battle formations. This knowledge had been acquired from the Soul-Burning Ferry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">As the final note faded, the dueling bamboo figurines froze mid-strike, while those in battle formations maintained their rigid formations. All stood motionless, awaiting their commander's next command.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp and clear, his heart filled with serene joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">His zither skills had reached a state of perfect mastery, the result of nearly a century of relentless practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The profound mysteries of the Vowel Reed Book had been fully revealed during his recent practice, leaving no secrets unrevealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Moreover, Ning Zhuo had deciphered the subsequent consonant principles and even created corresponding bamboo figurines. These figurines had also performed flawlessly during his practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"I should be able to win Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Trial now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Hmm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Shortly after, Ning Zhuo read Qing Huangzi's letter, his expression complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"I've invested so much effort into this, and now Qing Huangzi wants to give me the inheritance willingly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Ning Zhuo deeply appreciated the positive impact of his recent high-profile actions, which had rapidly enhanced his reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"Very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"This will save me considerable time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"With that time, I can study even more things."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo lowered his gaze slightly, his expression turning profound.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
