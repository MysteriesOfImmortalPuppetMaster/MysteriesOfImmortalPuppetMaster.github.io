<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 402: This is Completely Absurd!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">For a moment, all the spectators were shocked and uncertain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo had comprehended techniques during battle, learning the Three Thousand Water Strikes technique from Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">However, his Three Thousand Water Strikes were unconventional, appearing like dragons and pythons, continuously weaving through and combining attacks to form three massive strikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Shen Lingshu, unaware of the truth, lost his composure. His eyes widened in shock: "I've finally witnessed the legendary supreme comprehension ability with my own eyes. Is this what a child of destiny is like? Truly extraordinary!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Zhu Xuan Ji also said: "Is Ning Zhuo's comprehension ability really this powerful? No wonder he's made such progress in wood element techniques! He truly deserves to be chosen by the Three Sect Masters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">However, Ning Jiu Fan, Lin Bu Fan, Lin Shan Shan, and others knew the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This was because Ning Zhuo had received guidance from the Five Elements Divine Master again under the Spirit Concealment Willow, elevating his realm. He had informed those around him about this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Not only Sun Ling Tong and Ning Jiu Fan knew, but even Linghu Jiu wasn't kept in the dark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Since Linghu Jiu knew, naturally Lin Bu Fan and Lin Shan Shan were also aware.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Lin Bu Fan stopped stroking his beard, his eyes flashing with brilliance: "Just what level has this brat Ning Zhuo's Five Elements realm been elevated to?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"To achieve this level, learning something after seeing it just once... he must be at least at the Master level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Upon reaching the Master realm, one grasps the fundamental principles. Any cultivator at the Master level can create various techniques and skills following these fundamental principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Master, indeed - one who can establish their own school of thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo's current battle comprehension was essentially because he had already mastered the fundamental principles of the water element. Upon seeing Linghu Jiu use the Three Thousand Water Strikes technique, it was like seeing one application of the water element.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He then followed these principles, imitating this application method. It was like building from a high vantage point, working downward, naturally resulting in a high success rate of imitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Jiu Fan's mouth opened in a silent laugh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo's amazing performance brought honor to him as the Ning family's ancestor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Ning Zhuo... is indeed reliable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"A Master-level Five Elements realm... even I envy that. After cultivating for so long, I haven't reached that level, yet this brat Ning Zhuo achieved it in just a few days through a fortunate encounter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"This is simply unbelievable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Lin Shan Shan also understood: "I get it now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Big Head Ning's Five Elements realm is so profound that he can comprehend any Five Elements technique he sees."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"He has mastered the principles from the inside out, so he only needs to observe and try a few times to imitate any application."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Given some time to practice and make mistakes, he can imitate Senior Brother's wood and water techniques quite well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Doesn't this mean he can instantly understand any Five Elements enlightenment diagram?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Can he learn all the Five Elements techniques in the world instantly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Heavens, how old is Ning Zhuo anyway?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Despite Lin Shan Shan's usual grace, she now felt intense envy turning into jealousy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">She couldn't help feeling angry, feeling like she had wasted too much time. But then she realized that even if she had practiced diligently, she couldn't reach Ning Zhuo's level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">After all, guidance from the Five Elements Divine Master and the Spirit Concealment Willow were extraordinary opportunities that ordinary people could never replicate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Realizing this, Lin Shan Shan became even more angry: "Why haven't I encountered such good fortune?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Linghu Jiu was the first to accept this reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Both shocked and delighted, he praised: "Brother Ning Zhuo, what an excellent realm!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo hurriedly replied: "Brother, you praise me too much. I merely received help from ancient masters, it wasn't my own achievement. I can hardly speak of it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">But at that moment, the Five Elements Divine Master's laughter rang out: "Haha, what's there to be modest about? Kid, you're just too humble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"You should know that even if I guide others, they couldn't possibly elevate their Five Elements realm to such a degree."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Your comprehension ability is rare, and you have celestial talent to assist you. Given time, you'll surely sweep through the world, or at least dominate a region!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Hearing the Five Elements Divine Master's evaluation, everyone had different expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo's heart skipped a beat: "Celestial talent? My second talent, no, my original talent, is it supreme?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Xuan Ji and Shen Lingshu weren't surprised, both thinking that as the destined child, such achievements were natural. How else could he face the great Buddhist-Demonic dispute in the future?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Jiu Fan was repeatedly delighted: "Ning Zhuo's future is promising, our Ning family has produced a dragon! Future prosperity is within reach!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Lin Shan Shan and Lin Bu Fan's expressions were much more complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Lin Bu Fan fell into deep thought. Ning Zhuo's future achievements would be so great, possessing celestial talent, only sixteen years old, and his Five Elements realm had reached at least the Master level in water. With such guidance from the Five Elements Divine Master, given time, his achievements would surely surpass his own!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">How should one face such a person, since he isn't an enemy?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"My senior disciple Linghu Jiu only has superior talent, and with his casual and straightforward nature, even if he inherits my Myriad Medicine Sect in the future, he'll probably just maintain it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"In comparison, this brat Ning Zhuo, bearing ambition, skilled in tactics, eloquent in speech, and decisive and ruthless in action."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Though kidnapping Shan Shan angered me greatly, setting aside personal feelings and thinking back, his actions were quick, precise, and underhanded. If it were me, I would have done the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"If... if I were to marry Shan Shan to him, what would happen?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Suddenly, a bold idea emerged in Lin Bu Fan's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Thinking of this, he couldn't help but shift his gaze to Lin Shan Shan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Lin Shan Shan's expression was also complex, showing both joy and resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Her thoughts fluctuated, her eyes bright: "This big-headed fool, I knew he was extraordinary from our first meeting. My judgment was indeed correct!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Seeing his beloved daughter staring intently at Ning Zhuo, Lin Bu Fan felt mixed emotions and firmly rejected his previous thought: "No, with Shan Shan's personality and tactics, if she married Ning Zhuo, she might be consumed completely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Ning Zhuo is thick-skinned and black-hearted, definitely not a good match for Shan Shan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Instead, Jiu'er is straightforward and generous, deeply in love with Shan Shan, and will surely treat her well in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Lin Bu Fan had married and had children, and accepted disciples, all for the sake of his power and cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But as he said earlier in the reception hall - people change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">After spending time together and investing energy in Lin Shan Shan, Linghu Jiu, and others, his thoughts as a father and master gradually changed him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He hoped more for Lin Shan Shan's future to be stable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Water Element - Water Barrier Surrounding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, having successfully imitated and mastered another technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Jade-like water flows surrounded him as he stood on the water's surface, using Three Thousand Water Strikes, forcing Linghu Jiu to repeatedly retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The battlefield environment that Linghu Jiu had extensively modified also became something Ning Zhuo could utilize.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Regarding terrain advantage, both benefited equally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Linghu Jiu took a deep breath and immediately developed a new tactic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He laughed loudly: "Brother, can you still imitate the following techniques?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Wind Element Technique - Wind Wave Surge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Fierce winds swept through, forming shocking wind waves that collided with Three Thousand Water Strikes, destroying the water element.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Wind Element Technique - Wind Blade Storm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Linghu Jiu charged forward again, and wherever he passed, the winds were extremely sharp, causing the surging water flows to continuously weaken and collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, unable to see through these techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Wind, Thunder, Ice, Magnetic, and other elements, though closely related to the Five Elements, strictly speaking, were not among them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Wind Element Technique - One Generation of Wind Flow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Eight Directions Sword Technique - Upper Direction Sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Linghu Jiu held his sword, moving gracefully, his sword light flowing like water and wind, actually able to combine techniques with swordplay, displaying attacks far superior to before -</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Upper Wind Sword!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Even with the Demonic Blood Vein Technique and Water Barrier Protection, Ning Zhuo didn't dare face its sharp edge, continuously retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Linghu Jiu pursued aggressively, the wild wind following his voice, growing stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo secretly cursed his misfortune, clearly understanding his previous tactical error. Against Linghu Jiu's offensive momentum, one success led to a hundred, becoming stronger with the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The best strategy would have been to suppress and crush it while it was just beginning, before it gained momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">At this moment, with just Ning Zhuo's technique methods, it was truly difficult to stop, unless...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">In the next moment, Ning Zhuo decisively released his mechanical creation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Thirty floating mechanical devices appeared, equipped with arms and legs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo's fingers slightly spread, moving frequently, pulling and pushing, alternately extending and contracting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The thirty mechanical creations divided into three waves, charging toward Linghu Jiu in succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The upwind sword struck the mechanical creatures, causing damage, but not severe. Ning Zhuo had used quite solid materials in their construction, all using foundation-level materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Frost source.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Old cold legs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Suffering body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Especially the latter, which made the damaged mechanisms even more formidable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Linghu Jiu was forced to switch from offense to defense, his sword creating brilliant lights, firmly guarding all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Around him, the thirty mechanical fists and feet attacked in turns, coordinating perfectly, forming continuous waves of attacks that left Linghu Jiu struggling to defend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Seeing the battle situation reversed again, the spectators' expressions changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Many wondered to themselves, how did they compare to Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu at the Foundation Establishment level? They couldn't match these endless techniques! Ning Zhuo launched his offensive, decisively escalating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He controlled the mechanical creatures while casting spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Earth veins hidden, mysterious roots deep, vines entangling, all things bound. Rise!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Roots appeared from nowhere, entangling Linghu Jiu, creating openings even if only for moments, enough for the mechanisms to launch punches and kicks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Pine winds howling, mighty waves surging, forest seas rolling, overturning the earth. Sweep!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Green light like tides sent Linghu Jiu tumbling. The mechanical attacks followed like shadows, continuously striking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Ancient woods creaking, tree realm vast, heaven and earth changing color, spirit roots descending. Descend!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ancient forests appeared again, countless branches and roots working with the mechanical attacks, pressing Linghu Jiu into a corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Linghu Jiu's injuries grew worse, his face bruised, and with many frost effects on his body, his combat ability seriously declining, approaching defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Lin Bufan and Lin Shanshan's expressions changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">With such combat power, Ning Zhuo could definitely establish himself on Small Contest Peak. Even the highest-ranked Lai Wuying and Zheng Xingshi would struggle against such attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Jiufan stroked his beard with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Linghu Jiu let out a light whistle, finally revealing his trump card at the crucial moment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He wielded his sword, gathering gentle light. The sword intent dispersed into ethereal manifestations, neither here nor there, like floating life in a dream, real yet unreal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The Desolate Sword Classic - Moon River Dream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Life is like a dream, one goblet still awakens the river moon... Ning Zhuo saw a vision where Linghu Jiu sat in a lonely boat, raising his cup to toast the moon's reflection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">When Ning Zhuo came to his senses, he had already fallen for it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Half of the thirty mechanical creatures fell apart, countless foundations exhausted, unable to function.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Linghu Jiu broke free of the encirclement with one move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He charged toward Ning Zhuo, his sword thrusting directly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">At this moment, the battlefield was deep in the red ancient woods, with Ning Zhuo concealed in the canopy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Seeing Linghu Jiu's killing thrust, Ning Zhuo wouldn't just wait there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He used wood element magic "Fragrant Flower Misleading Tracks" to instantly teleport away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">But Linghu Jiu had planned for this, his posture unchanged, smoothly executing his second move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Desolate Sword Classic - Snow River Lonely Boat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He became one with his sword, like a boat sailing through snowy seas, each move flowing. Like a pearl boat on the river, fearless of waves!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Lonely fishing in the cold river, heart like a solitary boat...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Lonely yet determined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Another vision appeared before Ning Zhuo, seeing snowflakes falling, Linghu Jiu fishing alone from a boat on the river, occasionally drinking cold wine from his gourd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">When he looked closely, he saw a sharp sword light enlarging before his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Linghu Jiu's sword move ignored the teleportation, directly locking onto Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">In an instant, Ning Zhuo's pupils contracted, his heart's warning bells ringing wildly, sensing intense threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Dasheng protect me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He patted his belt, releasing a Golden Core level mechanical monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Heavy Armored Blood Ape: Dasheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Shu Dasheng's body was massive like a city gate, directly blocking Linghu Jiu's path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Linghu Jiu's sword strike left a shallow mark on Shu Dasheng's body. Shu Dasheng shouted, his arms shaking, bravely charging at Linghu Jiu, trying to grab him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Wood Element - Hollow Bamboo Shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Linghu Jiu's shadow was caught, but his true body circled around Dasheng, continuing toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Lonely Sword Scripture - Horizon's Lonely Snow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Linghu Jiu struck with his sword, the sword light dispersing into white snow, boundless and desolate, lonely and bone-chilling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Desolation and cold, even soul-crushing despair filled Ning Zhuo's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Ning Zhuo snorted coldly, and backed into a corner, he fiercely brought out the Snake Scythe!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">This was the Night Rain Demon Weapon!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Zhu Xuanji's expression changed dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">This mechanical scythe had left a deep impression on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Bad! It's the Horizon's Lonely Snow!" Lin Shanshan suddenly leaped down, intervening in the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Senior Brother's move isn't fully mastered, he can't control it perfectly, yet its power is extraordinary and could endanger Ning Zhuo's life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">With intense worry, Lin Shanshan acted without thinking, falling between Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu, trying to stop them with all her might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Junior Sister!" Linghu Jiu was shocked, hurriedly changing his move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"This?!" Seeing Lin Shanshan with her back to him, completely unguarded, Ning Zhuo was already swinging the Snake Scythe with full force, only able to forcefully change its direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">A purple scythe-shaped blade light shot out, flying into empty space, leaving a purple blade mark that wouldn't fade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Linghu Jiu's sword light circled around Lin Shanshan, stopping at Ning Zhuo's throat, condensing into a sharp sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The three froze in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Ning Zhuo stared at the sword tip below his chin, his voice dry: "I've lost."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">But Linghu Jiu looked at the still-lingering purple blade mark, his eyes showing shock, slowly withdrawing his sword: "No, I lost."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The Five Elements Divine Lord appeared voluntarily, staring intently at the purple blade mark, moved to say: "What technique is this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">As a Fashen with Nascent Soul level combat power, the purple blade mark was like tiny raindrops to him, hardly worth mentioning. What moved him was the essence contained within the purple blade mark!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Lin Bufan's expression also froze, for in the instant Ning Zhuo swung with full force, he sensed power that could threaten himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Merely at early Foundation Establishment, yet able to threaten someone at the Nascent Soul level?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">This was completely unprecedented!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
