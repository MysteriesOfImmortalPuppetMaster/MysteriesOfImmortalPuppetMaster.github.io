<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo stared at Yang Weida's corpse, silent and motionless for a long moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Yang Weida's face was serene, as if he were merely asleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but recall their interactions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">They had first met on the ship. Yang Weida appeared simple and rugged, but was actually shrewd and bold. He had demanded a reward from Qing Yan, requesting the stomach pouch of a bone-piercing crocodile, only to be flatly refused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">To Ning Zhuo, this was nothing more than a bargaining tactic - starting with an exorbitant price. In the end, Qing Yan still gave him six Magic Artifact-grade Soul-Ferrying Lamp Wicks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Afterward, Yang Weida was taken away by Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Later, at Hidden Yang Manor, Yang Weida peddled his Yang-Enhancing Ointment to the male cultivators, and it proved wildly popular.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Then, at Vigorous Yang Manor, he cultivated diligently, striving tirelessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Finally, when the Golden Swallow Trident gained a new master, he decisively pledged allegiance to Ning Zhuo, offering a substantial sum of wealth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He claimed it was his entire fortune, but without proof, Ning Zhuo remained skeptical. Even so, the wealth Yang Weida voluntarily offered would undoubtedly be a massive windfall for most Foundation Establishment cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">To be honest, Ning Zhuo quite admired Yang Weida.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This cultivator lacked innate talent, but he had always worked tirelessly, never hesitating to sacrifice himself and possessing a true spirit of adventure. Even after repeated setbacks, his fighting spirit remained undimmed, and he could adapt flexibly to changing circumstances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">When Ning Zhuo promised to secure Yang Weida's future in White Paper Immortal City, it wasn't just because of his willingness to surrender, but also because he saw genuine potential in the man himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Yet...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He was dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">All his efforts, all his past hardships and triumphs, had vanished like dust in the wind, unnoticed by anyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">This time, too many Male Consorts had died - nearly everyone from the Vigorous Yang Manor. Yang Weida was just one among many.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo's emotions were complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">White Paper Immortal City was like a colossal vortex, swallowing countless lives from past to present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The brutal conflicts within made cultivators' lives as worthless as blades of grass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Yang Weida had once confided in Ning Zhuo about his bitterness, how the very things he had desperately pursued and failed to obtain were treated with indifference by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Their joys and sorrows were worlds apart, yet they shared a strange sense of mutual sympathy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Yang Weida's death deeply moved Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"What difference is there between Yang Weida and me?" he wondered. "To the City Lord of White Paper Immortal City and the Lord of the Forgetful River Prefecture, I'm just another ant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"In this chaotic vortex, even a moment's carelessness could lead to my death and the dissipation of my cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Meanwhile, Wen Ruanyu arrived at Vigorous Yang Manor, his face flushed crimson with fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"That damned traitor! Who the hell is he?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Wen Ruanyu longed to tear the traitor apart right then and there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Previously, he had believed that his relentless surveillance would leave the traitor no opportunity to strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But now it seemed the traitor had merely been biding his time, preparing a devastating blow from the shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Wen Ruanyu clenched his fists so tightly that veins bulged on the backs of his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He dared not imagine the repercussions of the Vigorous Yang Manor's near annihilation, or the devastating blow it would deal to the morale of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Every time such thoughts surfaced, a chill ran down his spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo spoke up from beside him: "If we can't expose the traitor soon, panic will inevitably spread."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Even I have to admit, this traitor's reach is truly astonishing!" Wen Ruanyu nodded, his voice hoarse. "We must investigate with all our might. We must uncover the traitor's identity and provide answers to the entire Immortal City. Otherwise, White Paper Immortal City could descend into chaos!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This traitor's actions had placed White Paper Immortal City in grave danger. Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu, who had been overseeing the investigation, now bore an immense responsibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The reporting cultivators arrived swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"You're saying all the Male Consorts died from poisoning?" Wen Ruanyu frowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo showed no surprise. The Male Consorts' bodies bore no external wounds, only twisted faces contorted in agony. Poisoning seemed the most likely cause of death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"What kind of poison was it? Do we have any leads?" Wen Ruanyu pressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"A potent toxin, originating from... a certain Spirit Food," the cultivator replied immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Where did this Spirit Food come from?" Wen Ruanyu continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The cultivator named a person, causing Ning Zhuo's eyes to widen in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Wen Ruanyu was equally incredulous. "From his hands? Are you absolutely certain?! This can't be! It couldn't possibly be him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Wen Ruanyu was the first to defend the suspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">This was because the man was an elder of White Paper Immortal City, a veteran Spirit Chef of the Dark Cuisine School, and the very elder who had gifted Ning Zhuo his Spirit Chef inheritance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Soon, the Spirit Chef Elder was brought before Wen Ruanyu and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"This is utterly ridiculous!" The elder, bound hand and foot, vehemently denied the accusation, his voice trembling with indignation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Old Chef, please calm down," Wen Ruanyu reassured him. "With me here, I promise you won't be wrongly accused."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Spirit Chef Elder glared. "Even if you suspect others, you shouldn't suspect me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Yes, yes, yes," Wen Ruanyu nodded frantically, sweat beading on his forehead as he bowed low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Despite the elder's firm denial, he remained the only suspect for the time being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">After much persuasion, Wen Ruanyu convinced the Spirit Chef Elder to remain calm, promising temporary detention pending further investigation and advising him to devise evidence to clear his name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo also offered a few words of comfort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Once they were alone, Wen Ruanyu rubbed his temples. "This situation is growing increasingly complicated. I'm almost certain this is a set-up by an internal traitor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"This scheme is childish, but it's utterly disgusting!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"This traitor is trying to mess with our minds. Don't get too worked up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly, crossing his arms. "I initially shared your assessment. This is clearly a setup, but..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"But what?" Wen Ruanyu pressed, noticing Ning Zhuo's earlier contemplation. "You've been thinking about something since the negotiations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"I know you received the Old Chef's favor and inherited a portion of his Spirit Chef legacy. Yet during the negotiations, you barely said a few words."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"To an outsider, it might even seem like I was the one who received the Old Chef's legacy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Wen Ruanyu, being a Confucian cultivator, delivered his criticism with characteristic subtlety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo shook his head again, his expression unchanging as he met Wen Ruanyu's gaze. "You misunderstand me. I just find something peculiar about this situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Wen Ruanyu's interest piqued. "Oh? What's peculiar?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He deeply respected Ning Zhuo's judgment. If Ning Zhuo sensed something amiss, there was likely a genuine issue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">But Ning Zhuo merely shrugged, a wry smile crossing his face. "It's just a vague feeling. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something feels off. I've tried to delve deeper, but I can't grasp what it is."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"I see..." Wen Ruanyu sighed in disappointment. "If you figure it out, be sure to tell me first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Hmm," Ning Zhuo nodded. "Before anything else, I should visit the prison myself to personally instruct the warden to take good care of Old Chef."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Wen Ruanyu shook his head. "With such rampant and ruthless internal treachery, it's best not to reveal your status as the Vice City Lord. I'll handle it. If you're worried, you can come with me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Forget it," Ning Zhuo said, frowning and shaking his head. "As long as Old Chef is safe, that's enough. The most critical issue now is to uncover the traitors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"I want to investigate the scene personally."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Alright," Wen Ruanyu nodded. "I'll accompany you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Together, they thoroughly searched the Vigorous Yang Manor but found nothing of significance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"This just gets stranger and stranger..." Ning Zhuo muttered, watching cultivators collect the corpses one by one, still unable to make sense of it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Wen Ruanyu sighed. "Think carefully. I'll gather manpower and figure out how to clean up this mess."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ever since Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer's death, the pressure on him had increased significantly. Now, with this major incident, the pressure had skyrocketed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The next day, Ning Zhuo received a flying message from Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The message's contents caused Ning Zhuo's expression to change instantly. He was shocked, then utterly bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo hurried to the prison, where he found Wen Ruanyu and the Spirit Chef Elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Spirit Chef Elder was covered in wounds, tightly bound, and barely breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Wen Ruanyu stood before him, glanced at Ning Zhuo, and turned back to the elder. "You've truly confessed? This isn't a joke!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The Spirit Chef Elder sneered. "I did it! I killed those Male Consorts. I'm one of the traitors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"The White Paper City Lord thinks she can use the Golden Swallow Trident to regain her former glory and reclaim power. That's impossible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Heh heh heh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"The Sun Family is too ambitious, and you cultivators secretly protecting Sun Tiesheng are naive and shallow. I moved in and out of this place like it was empty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"You held a victory banquet and invited me to prepare Spirit Food. What difference is there between that and handing me the opportunity to kill you all?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Hahaha! This is a heaven-sent chance, and the White Paper Immortal City is destined to fall!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Spirit Chef Elder had confessed to his crimes without reservation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">His attitude had undergone a complete transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">No matter what Wen Ruanyu and Ning Zhuo said, he stubbornly clung to his confession, refusing to recant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">With no other choice, the two arranged for the Spirit Chef Elder to be properly secured while they withdrew to discuss the matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Do you think he's the traitor?" Ning Zhuo asked, then answered himself, "I don't think so."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo still vividly remembered the Spirit Chef Elder preparing Spirit Food for him on the spot and voluntarily gifting him the Spirit Food inheritance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">It made no sense for a traitor to do such a thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"But if he isn't, why would he confess?" Wen Ruanyu frowned deeply. "And his conviction is unwavering. He must know the consequences - execution for his crimes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo stared intently at Wen Ruanyu. "Actually... the elder's confession benefits both of us, doesn't it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">After all, they had been tasked with investigating the matter but had made no progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This traitor's attack had nearly wiped out all the male consorts in the Vigorous Yang Manor, leaving them with immense responsibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">As one of the few ordinary male consorts, Ning Zhuo himself was under considerable suspicion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">If they simply went along with the confession, both Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu would immediately face far less pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Wen Ruanyu met Ning Zhuo's gaze without hesitation. "Why are we testing each other? I know your character, and you should know my aspirations. I am a Confucian cultivator. I would never fabricate a false case to serve my own interests!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Wen Ruanyu spoke with unwavering conviction, his expression resolute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo nodded. "Did you order his torture?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Wen Ruanyu shook his head again. "Absolutely not. I left with you last night and haven't returned since. I issued strict orders that no one but you and I were to approach the prison cell. Anyone who disobeyed would be executed without mercy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo nodded. "Alright, if it wasn't you, then who else could have issued such an order? Who else could have slipped into the prison unnoticed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Wen Ruanyu's face turned ashen. He lowered his head, staring intently at the floor tiles, and fell into a deathly silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">After a long pause, he finally spoke, his voice hoarse and strained. "I know what you're implying."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"The current City Lord did indeed save the old man's life..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">These simple words seemed to weigh a thousand pounds each as Wen Ruanyu forced them out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo shifted his gaze from Wen Ruanyu to the City Lord's Mansion in the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">He asked meaningfully, "How long has it been since you last saw the City Lord?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">After a pause, he added, "I mean, her true form."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Wen Ruanyu startled and also looked toward the City Lord's Mansion. "A long time... a very long time indeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Wen Ruanyu was the White Paper Immortal City Lord's right-hand man. Especially after Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer's sacrifice, only Wen Ruanyu and Tie Guzheng remained as the true pillars of the vast White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo was the Vice City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The only person capable of secretly bypassing the two of them to reach the prison and sway the Spirit Chef Elder's attitude was likely the City Lord herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Why would she do this?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo could answer that question himself: "For the sake of White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The Vigorous Yang Manor incident had spiraled out of control, plunging the entire Immortal City into panic and severely damaging morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">People inevitably asked themselves: If the heavily guarded Vigorous Yang Manor could be wiped out in one fell swoop, what hope did the rest of us have?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The City Lord's Mansion had repeatedly disappointed us. Could we truly withstand this Ghost Tide under their leadership?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">And this wasn't just a Ghost Tide - it was an invasion by the Underworld's armies!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">In this dire situation, the White Paper City Lord's decision to sacrifice a cultivator, demonstrating swift action in uncovering one of the traitors, was undoubtedly the quickest way to resolve the crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Time was of the essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">If public sentiment continued to fester, deeply affecting the entire Immortal City and triggering a mass exodus, the consequences would be irreversible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo's heart churned with conflicting emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"I understand the City Lord. Everything is for the greater good, requiring patience. And sometimes, such sacrifices are necessary and worthwhile."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Patience... just like the decade-plus he had endured in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo frowned, feeling deeply uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">If he were still the same person he had been in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he would have swallowed his complex emotions, lowered his head, gritted his teeth, and silently endured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">But after traveling extensively and gradually changing, a voice now rose from the depths of his heart, growing louder with each passing moment: "If I were the White Paper City Lord, I wouldn't do this! Not even if someone were willing to die for me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo knew someone who would make such a sacrifice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">He had no doubt that Sun Lingtong would lay down his life for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Just as he had no doubt that he himself would willingly do the same for Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">This truth had already been proven in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, during their confrontation with Qi Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"The White Paper City Lord granted me the Four Treasures of Soul Cultivation, appointed me Vice City Lord, and later provided substantial support to the Qing-Jiao Army. But what exactly am I to her, this so-called savior?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">He instinctively gazed south, toward the colossal paper statue left behind by his mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Meng Yaoyin had once been a savior, sacrificing her lifespan to save the Immortal City, now reduced to nothing more than a paper statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"The White Paper City Lord arranged things for the Old Spirit Chef, and she once arranged things for my mother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"What about me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"How will she arrange things for me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Our savior..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Just then, wails of ghosts and howls of wolves echoed from beyond the city walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Immediately, war drums began to beat in rapid succession, and battle flags fluttered in the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The Ghost Tide had returned, its scale far surpassing any previous assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The city's defenses were once again engaged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Tie Guzheng's face was ashen as he stared intently into the distance. He saw the vast Underworld Army emerging on the horizon, its numbers swelling like a dark tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Based on the military intelligence he had gathered, Tie Guzheng immediately concluded: this ever-growing Underworld Army had mobilized its entire force for this attack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">With the Vigorous Yang Manor nearly destroyed by traitors and the city's populace gripped by fear, launching an assault at this moment was indeed an opportune strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">White Paper Immortal City was in grave danger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
