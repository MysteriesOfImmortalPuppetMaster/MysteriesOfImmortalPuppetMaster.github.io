<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 488: Drilling the Mechanical Puppets</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
A formation of mechanical puppets stood in two long rows, silent and unmoving.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong each stood at the head of these two lines of mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
They both used their divine senses to control the mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
While advancing forward in formation, the puppets pressed on their own heads, twisting them around a few times before removing them.<br/>
<br/>
By the time they reached Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, they were all headless forms. The puppets were carrying their own removed heads in their hands.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning each took out one Divided-Spirit Mirror after another. Using divine sense and spiritual energy, they slightly modified the mechanical puppets, and finally inserted the Divided-Spirit Mirrors into them.<br/>
<br/>
The mirror surface of the Divided-Spirit Mirrors was similar in texture to crystal, transparent like a deep pool, refracting a vast blue light that resembled starlight flowing.<br/>
<br/>
The mirror frames, made of jade, were lustrous and smooth, as radiant as the azure waves under the first morning light. Their four corners curved upward slightly, reminiscent of the clouds ancient painters depicted, lofty and profound. When divine sense penetrated the mirror frames, one could see internal veins like the roots of an ancient tree.<br/>
<br/>
This was one of the treasured mirrors recorded in the Foundation-Building chapter of the Mirror Stand Soul-Linking Art; it could receive divine sense and split divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
Among all the treasured mirrors, the Divided-Spirit Mirror was the cheapest to produce. This was also a deliberate, carefully designed choice by the Three Sects’ seniors. Because, among all the treasured mirrors, the Divided-Spirit Mirror was the most in demand.<br/>
<br/>
Just like what Ning Zhuo was doing now, installing a Divided-Spirit Mirror on every mechanical puppet.<br/>
<br/>
These four hundred-plus Divided-Spirit Mirrors were produced by Sun and Ning over the past few days, working day and night without rest.<br/>
<br/>
The entire process of installation did not take much time.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong tested their control, both of them showed delight. When Ning Zhuo released his divine sense, all he needed was to project it into the nearest mechanical puppet, and it would grow stronger several times over within the Divided-Spirit Mirror.<br/>
<br/>
Not only could Ning Zhuo link and control that puppet, but the extra portion of divine sense was divided into six or seven parts, dispersing outward.<br/>
<br/>
These six or seven parts of divine sense were drawn in by the other Divided-Spirit Mirrors. Upon entering those mirrors, they too became a bit stronger, and the excess divine sense was again split into several portions and projected outward.<br/>
<br/>
After several rounds of such projection, Ning Zhuo gained control over a vast number of mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
When he unleashed his divine sense to the fullest, it spread everywhere and very soon covered all four hundred-plus mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
“Let me try, let me try,” Sun Lingtong said, finding it interesting and eager to give it a go.<br/>
<br/>
He could also invest his divine sense into the Divided-Spirit Mirrors, but even though his total divine sense was obviously higher than Ning Zhuo’s, the boost he received from the mirrors was only about half of Ning Zhuo’s. Also, the portions of divine sense he could split off were at most three or four.<br/>
<br/>
The Divided-Spirit Mirrors did offer Sun Lingtong a lot of help in controlling the puppets, but not that much.<br/>
<br/>
After all, the Mirror Stand Soul-Linking Art and the Divided-Spirit Mirror were part of the same system.<br/>
<br/>
This made Sun Lingtong feel once again, from the bottom of his heart, that the Three Sects’ seniors possessed extraordinary talent. The Three Sects’ top-level technique they established was rare in this world; not only could one cultivate three dantians at once, but even a single part of it contained abundant content and an entirely complete system.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt both excited and exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
In order to rush production of enough Divided-Spirit Mirrors, he had pulled all-nighters for several days, virtually without sleep or rest.<br/>
<br/>
Both Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had heavy dark circles under their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo yawned. “Let’s get some sleep first, Boss. I’m so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded. “You sleep first. I’ll power through a bit longer.”<br/>
<br/>
They were traveling away from home, so he and Ning Zhuo arranged their rest in shifts as much as possible, always keeping one on guard.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo naturally agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Since they were kids, Sun Lingtong had always sent Ning Zhuo to bed first, while he kept watch. Ning Zhuo had long been used to this arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
Young people usually slept soundly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had pushed himself to his limits. As soon as he lay down, he fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
He snored through a deep sleep, and when he opened his eyes on the bed, his gaze grew bright and spirited, sweeping away his previous fatigue.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately switched places with Sun Lingtong so that his friend could rest. He wrapped the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon around his waist and lifted the tent flap, stepping outside to greet the afternoon sun.<br/>
<br/>
He went to see Liu, Guan, and Zhang—those three generals—drilling their troops. Noting how hard they kept training, he used his divine sense to send them a greeting, then left the camp.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also wanted to drill troops!<br/>
<br/>
But since the Three Generals’ Camp had already reached full capacity after Ning Zhuo’s investment, and the camp space was limited and barely accommodated their own training, he considered his options and headed to the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, he only needed to show his waist token to enter and leave Red Flower Camp. Sometimes, before he even reached the entrance, the soldiers on duty spotted him and immediately opened the gate for him.<br/>
<br/>
Inside Red Flower Camp, Mulan was also drilling her troops.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, after the ambush operation, once the various troops returned to Green Forest Immortal City to rest and reorganize, they actively recruited fresh soldiers and focused on intensive training, racing against the clock.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, how much sweat was shed could well determine life or death on the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
So, whether general or soldier, all wanted to train hard. Everyone knew that they would be heading to the front line again.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the Three Generals’ Camp, the Red Flower Camp was far more spacious.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, the Red Flower Camp was of a higher classification, so its camp area was large, considerably above the standard of a new unit like the Three Generals’ Camp. On the other hand, though Red Flower Camp also took in recruits, they were carefully handpicked, not blindly adding numbers.<br/>
<br/>
The reason was that the Red Flower Formation was far more difficult than most formations. Under those circumstances, simply piling on more people would only get in the way, disrupting the formation and greatly reducing the entire army’s combat power.<br/>
<br/>
When she saw Ning Zhuo arrive, Mulan immediately stepped away, letting her lieutenant take over the training. She came forward to greet Ning Zhuo herself.<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo… Young Master.” Mulan’s face was expressionless, but her eyes flickered, revealing that she was not calm inside.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo waved a hand, stating his reason for coming: he wanted to borrow some open land in the camp for drilling troops.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan agreed at once.<br/>
<br/>
She arranged it personally and led Ning Zhuo all the way to the practice ground.<br/>
<br/>
Since Ning Zhuo had chosen to train in Red Flower Camp, he saw no need to hide from Mulan. Therefore, he openly took out all his mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan’s eyes lit up slightly.<br/>
<br/>
She was aware that Ning Zhuo had spent a great deal of money to procure a large number of mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
“Still, although Ning Zhuo used mechanical puppets in the ambush, that was only controlling them individually.”<br/>
<br/>
“Single control versus group control are two entirely different matters. I wonder what level his skill in this regard might be?”<br/>
<br/>
A strong sense of interest rose inside Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
After a few brief interactions, Ning Zhuo, by a twist of fate, had become Mulan’s husband. Naturally, she was curious about her husband.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, as the daughter of a prominent military family, she had been sensitive to all sorts of military matters since childhood and took them seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Under Mulan’s watchful eye, Ning Zhuo began his first trial drill.<br/>
<br/>
He composed himself and released his divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
Through constant projection and reception by the Divided-Spirit Mirrors, Ning Zhuo soon achieved full control over all the mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
It was as if he had gained many extra limbs; he formed a close connection with these puppets, and controlling their movements simply expended his divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo first tried the simplest action: making the puppets all walk in unison.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing more than four hundred mechanical puppets suddenly move, Mulan was surprised and could not help glancing at Ning Zhuo, thinking, “He’s only at the Foundation-Building stage, yet he quickly connected to so many mechanical puppets.”<br/>
<br/>
Controlling so many puppets at once was a first for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Although he had previously stockpiled a fair amount of mechanical constructs in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, those were the result of more than ten years of hard work, gathered bit by bit from the market.<br/>
<br/>
Back then, his level was insufficient. Compared to these four hundred-plus military-grade mechanical puppets in front of him, what he had acquired from the marketplace was much inferior.<br/>
<br/>
His older constructs were mostly shaped like beasts, with simpler structures that were easier to operate.<br/>
<br/>
But the current military-grade puppets were more complex in structure, requiring greater skill to manipulate. They could perform a wider variety of flexible and refined movements.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo focused all his attention.<br/>
<br/>
He felt like a toddler learning to walk, first groping around on all fours, then slowly standing, then beginning to toddle forward.<br/>
<br/>
Watching from the side, Mulan soon realized that was exactly what was happening.<br/>
<br/>
“So Ning Zhuo has never before controlled such a large number of mechanical puppets.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan frowned slightly, deciding to find an opportunity to persuade Ning Zhuo to abandon this troop training.<br/>
<br/>
Such underdeveloped skills used on the battlefield would be irresponsible to himself and especially to his allies and comrades.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, since Ning Zhuo was her husband, the son-in-law of the Mu General’s household, he certainly could not just do as he pleased.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took out some spiritual food from his storage belt, stuffed it into his mouth, chewed a few times, and swallowed.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after, he also took out some pills and swallowed them.<br/>
<br/>
Both the spiritual food and the pills helped him recover his divine sense more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
His divine sense consumption was tremendous, to the point that his head felt heavy, as if it contained an iron anvil.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan, observing all this, thought, “In the end, Ning Zhuo is only at Foundation-Establishment level, so his divine sense is limited. He’s done quite well to hold out until now.”<br/>
<br/>
“He may have picked this up quickly, but it’s still far from ready for the battlefield.”<br/>
<br/>
“I must stop him.”<br/>
<br/>
“Bringing this into battle would be a joke.”<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, Ning Zhuo opened his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
He once again mobilized his divine sense to control the puppets. Different from before, this time he did not rely on divine sense alone; he used both divine sense and his Buddha Heart Demon Seal!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had long ago planted heart-imprints in all these puppets.<br/>
<br/>
A dual-control method of divine sense and heart-imprints!<br/>
<br/>
The puppets suddenly became nimble, as though their dullness had been replaced with consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
“How is that possible?!” Mulan’s pupils contracted in shock.<br/>
<br/>
She never imagined that after shutting his eyes for just a brief rest, Ning Zhuo would suddenly make such an astonishing leap in progress the moment he opened them again!<br/>
<br/>
Now, when the mechanical army marched forward or backward, it was no longer the previously scattered, disorganized movement; instead, it became swift and uniform.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan also noticed a detail—different puppets could even adjust their spacing with one another!<br/>
<br/>
That would have been impossible before.<br/>
<br/>
“If Ning Zhuo can make such fine adjustments, it means he still has a lot of capacity to spare.”<br/>
<br/>
“How did he suddenly improve so dramatically? It’s like he’s become a different person altogether.”<br/>
<br/>
It was a transformation like being reborn!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was also quite pleased.<br/>
<br/>
Once he fully employed his heart-imprints, his consumption of divine sense plummeted drastically, down to less than a tenth of before.<br/>
<br/>
He no longer had any difficulty controlling the puppets, with plenty of spare energy to spare, operating them smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment, when Ning Zhuo got used to that state, he stretched out both hands, opened his fingers, and activated his spiritual energy threads.<br/>
<br/>
Ten threads dropped onto some of the nearby puppets.<br/>
<br/>
In that instant, it was as if he had poured a soul into them: their movement speed became several times more agile, and their displayed combat power rose significantly.<br/>
<br/>
“With this method, I can operate some of the stronger puppets.”<br/>
<br/>
“But I don’t need it for now.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had already decided that the commanding officer of this mechanical army would be the Shadowy Blade of Night—Night Tiger. The latter possessed greater spirituality, even more than the Heavy-Armor Blood Ape—Da Sheng.<br/>
<br/>
There was no need to control Night Tiger at all; letting it operate freely would be more effective.<br/>
<br/>
“Still, anything concerning its spirituality is best kept hidden, not to be revealed. In the future, if I use Shadowy Blade of Night—Night Tiger, I’ll pretend it’s tethered to a thread of spiritual energy.”<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo contemplated, Sun Lingtong awakened in the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
He drowsily came to the dragon’s head cabin and, seeing Ning Zhuo training the puppets, his eyes gradually lit up.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, Little Zhuo, hurry, let me have a turn!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong showed intense enthusiasm for drilling mechanical soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
“All right, Boss, I’ll hand a portion of the puppets over to you. You must take them right away!” Ning Zhuo hinted to him discreetly.<br/>
<br/>
Having grown up together for more than ten years, Sun and Ning were as coordinated as could be.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the mechanical puppets switched their controlling master from Ning Zhuo to Sun Lingtong, and the handover process was smooth as silk.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan watched from the sidelines. She observed the entire process but did not see any hint of behind-the-scenes maneuvering between Ning and Sun.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong himself was fairly accomplished in both techniques and innate gifts, and he had studied the mechanical-craft compendium left behind by Meng Yaoyin from an early age. So once he got familiar with these mechanical puppets, he handled them with skill and precision.<br/>
<br/>
At first, he encountered some difficulties due to unfamiliarity, causing a few stumbles.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan, noticing those initial bumps, glanced at Ning Zhuo. “They still have a long time for training, and Ning Zhuo is nearing his limit.”<br/>
<br/>
But as Sun Lingtong became more adept, the mechanical army’s performance kept improving.<br/>
<br/>
“……” Mulan realized that, once again, she had miscalculated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sent his voice via divine sense: “Hahaha, Boss, with your help, my workload has dropped by at least forty percent.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong answered, “Little Zhuo, this is so much fun.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, “Boss, let’s not just play around. Once you’ve gotten the hang of things, we’ll start practicing formations. Without a formation, an army is nothing more than scattered sand. On the battlefield, they would become fodder for the cannons and end up as sacrificial pawns.”<br/>
<br/>
After another half cup of tea’s time, Sun and Ning had grown far more proficient.<br/>
<br/>
They formed a battle array.<br/>
<br/>
The formation was —Lightfoot Gale Formation!<br/>
<br/>
Working together, Sun and Ning joined forces to form the battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
They almost succeeded, but at the final moment, two or three mechanical puppets were mishandled and did not move to their designated spots on time.<br/>
<br/>
Sensing imminent failure, Ning Zhuo hastily intervened, shooting out his spiritual energy threads.<br/>
<br/>
He deliberately exerted more spiritual energy, and at the last juncture, these three puppets made the correct moves and reached their correct positions.<br/>
<br/>
Boom.<br/>
<br/>
With a faint rumble, the Lightfoot Gale Formation succeeded.<br/>
<br/>
Tiny gusts of wind swirled among the entire mechanical force, lifting and twining around the puppets, increasing their speed, making them agile, and rendering them nearly silent.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Mulan could no longer conceal her reaction. Her expression changed.<br/>
<br/>
Now that they could successfully form a battle array, this mechanical army instantly became a reliable fighting force worth anticipating.<br/>
<br/>
“I underestimated Ning Zhuo.”<br/>
<br/>
“He truly was a rare prodigy! His gift for controlling mechanical contraptions is the greatest I’ve ever seen.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan watched Ning Zhuo intently, and her feelings grew more complicated.<br/>
<br/>
The more she worked with Ning Zhuo, the more virtues she discovered in him by chance.<br/>
<br/>
Those virtues accumulated in her heart, causing her impression of Ning Zhuo to rise higher and higher.</div>
