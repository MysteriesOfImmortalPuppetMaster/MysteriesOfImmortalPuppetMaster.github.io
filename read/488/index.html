<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 488: Drilling the Mechanical Puppets</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">A formation of mechanical puppets stood in two long rows, silent and unmoving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong each stood at the head of these two lines of mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">They both used their divine senses to control the mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">While advancing forward in formation, the puppets pressed on their own heads, twisting them around a few times before removing them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">By the time they reached Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, they were all headless forms. The puppets were carrying their own removed heads in their hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sun and Ning each took out one Divided-Spirit Mirror after another. Using divine sense and spiritual energy, they slightly modified the mechanical puppets, and finally inserted the Divided-Spirit Mirrors into them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The mirror surface of the Divided-Spirit Mirrors was similar in texture to crystal, transparent like a deep pool, refracting a vast blue light that resembled starlight flowing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The mirror frames, made of jade, were lustrous and smooth, as radiant as the azure waves under the first morning light. Their four corners curved upward slightly, reminiscent of the clouds ancient painters depicted, lofty and profound. When divine sense penetrated the mirror frames, one could see internal veins like the roots of an ancient tree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This was one of the treasured mirrors recorded in the Foundation-Building chapter of the Mirror Stand Soul-Linking Art; it could receive divine sense and split divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Among all the treasured mirrors, the Divided-Spirit Mirror was the cheapest to produce. This was also a deliberate, carefully designed choice by the Three Sects‚Äô seniors. Because, among all the treasured mirrors, the Divided-Spirit Mirror was the most in demand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Just like what Ning Zhuo was doing now, installing a Divided-Spirit Mirror on every mechanical puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">These four hundred-plus Divided-Spirit Mirrors were produced by Sun and Ning over the past few days, working day and night without rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The entire process of installation did not take much time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">When Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong tested their control, both of them showed delight. When Ning Zhuo released his divine sense, all he needed was to project it into the nearest mechanical puppet, and it would grow stronger several times over within the Divided-Spirit Mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Not only could Ning Zhuo link and control that puppet, but the extra portion of divine sense was divided into six or seven parts, dispersing outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">These six or seven parts of divine sense were drawn in by the other Divided-Spirit Mirrors. Upon entering those mirrors, they too became a bit stronger, and the excess divine sense was again split into several portions and projected outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">After several rounds of such projection, Ning Zhuo gained control over a vast number of mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">When he unleashed his divine sense to the fullest, it spread everywhere and very soon covered all four hundred-plus mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">‚ÄúLet me try, let me try,‚Äù Sun Lingtong said, finding it interesting and eager to give it a go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He could also invest his divine sense into the Divided-Spirit Mirrors, but even though his total divine sense was obviously higher than Ning Zhuo‚Äôs, the boost he received from the mirrors was only about half of Ning Zhuo‚Äôs. Also, the portions of divine sense he could split off were at most three or four.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Divided-Spirit Mirrors did offer Sun Lingtong a lot of help in controlling the puppets, but not that much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After all, the Mirror Stand Soul-Linking Art and the Divided-Spirit Mirror were part of the same system.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This made Sun Lingtong feel once again, from the bottom of his heart, that the Three Sects‚Äô seniors possessed extraordinary talent. The Three Sects‚Äô top-level technique they established was rare in this world; not only could one cultivate three dantians at once, but even a single part of it contained abundant content and an entirely complete system.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo felt both excited and exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">In order to rush production of enough Divided-Spirit Mirrors, he had pulled all-nighters for several days, virtually without sleep or rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Both Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had heavy dark circles under their eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo yawned. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get some sleep first, Boss. I‚Äôm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong nodded. ‚ÄúYou sleep first. I‚Äôll power through a bit longer.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">They were traveling away from home, so he and Ning Zhuo arranged their rest in shifts as much as possible, always keeping one on guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo naturally agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Since they were kids, Sun Lingtong had always sent Ning Zhuo to bed first, while he kept watch. Ning Zhuo had long been used to this arrangement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Young people usually slept soundly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo had pushed himself to his limits. As soon as he lay down, he fell asleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He snored through a deep sleep, and when he opened his eyes on the bed, his gaze grew bright and spirited, sweeping away his previous fatigue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He immediately switched places with Sun Lingtong so that his friend could rest. He wrapped the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon around his waist and lifted the tent flap, stepping outside to greet the afternoon sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He went to see Liu, Guan, and Zhang‚Äîthose three generals‚Äîdrilling their troops. Noting how hard they kept training, he used his divine sense to send them a greeting, then left the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo also wanted to drill troops!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">But since the Three Generals‚Äô Camp had already reached full capacity after Ning Zhuo‚Äôs investment, and the camp space was limited and barely accommodated their own training, he considered his options and headed to the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Nowadays, he only needed to show his waist token to enter and leave Red Flower Camp. Sometimes, before he even reached the entrance, the soldiers on duty spotted him and immediately opened the gate for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Inside Red Flower Camp, Mu Lan was also drilling her troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In fact, after the ambush operation, once the various troops returned to Green Forest Immortal City to rest and reorganize, they actively recruited fresh soldiers and focused on intensive training, racing against the clock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">At that time, how much sweat was shed could well determine life or death on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">So, whether general or soldier, all wanted to train hard. Everyone knew that they would be heading to the front line again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Compared to the Three Generals‚Äô Camp, the Red Flower Camp was far more spacious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">On one hand, the Red Flower Camp was of a higher classification, so its camp area was large, considerably above the standard of a new unit like the Three Generals‚Äô Camp. On the other hand, though Red Flower Camp also took in recruits, they were carefully handpicked, not blindly adding numbers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The reason was that the Red Flower Formation was far more difficult than most formations. Under those circumstances, simply piling on more people would only get in the way, disrupting the formation and greatly reducing the entire army‚Äôs combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">When she saw Ning Zhuo arrive, Mu Lan immediately stepped away, letting her lieutenant take over the training. She came forward to greet Ning Zhuo herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">‚ÄúNing Zhuo‚Ä¶ Young Master.‚Äù Mu Lan‚Äôs face was expressionless, but her eyes flickered, revealing that she was not calm inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo waved a hand, stating his reason for coming: he wanted to borrow some open land in the camp for drilling troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Mu Lan agreed at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">She arranged it personally and led Ning Zhuo all the way to the practice ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Since Ning Zhuo had chosen to train in Red Flower Camp, he saw no need to hide from Mu Lan. Therefore, he openly took out all his mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Mu Lan‚Äôs eyes lit up slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">She was aware that Ning Zhuo had spent a great deal of money to procure a large number of mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">‚ÄúStill, although Ning Zhuo used mechanical puppets in the ambush, that was only controlling them individually.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">‚ÄúSingle control versus group control are two entirely different matters. I wonder what level his skill in this regard might be?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">A strong sense of interest rose inside Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">After a few brief interactions, Ning Zhuo, by a twist of fate, had become Mu Lan‚Äôs husband. Naturally, she was curious about her husband.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">More importantly, as the daughter of a prominent military family, she had been sensitive to all sorts of military matters since childhood and took them seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Under Mu Lan‚Äôs watchful eye, Ning Zhuo began his first trial drill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He composed himself and released his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Through constant projection and reception by the Divided-Spirit Mirrors, Ning Zhuo soon achieved full control over all the mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">It was as if he had gained many extra limbs; he formed a close connection with these puppets, and controlling their movements simply expended his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo first tried the simplest action: making the puppets all walk in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Seeing more than four hundred mechanical puppets suddenly move, Mu Lan was surprised and could not help glancing at Ning Zhuo, thinking, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs only at the Foundation-Building stage, yet he quickly connected to so many mechanical puppets.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Controlling so many puppets at once was a first for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Although he had previously stockpiled a fair amount of mechanical constructs in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, those were the result of more than ten years of hard work, gathered bit by bit from the market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Back then, his level was insufficient. Compared to these four hundred-plus military-grade mechanical puppets in front of him, what he had acquired from the marketplace was much inferior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">His older constructs were mostly shaped like beasts, with simpler structures that were easier to operate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">But the current military-grade puppets were more complex in structure, requiring greater skill to manipulate. They could perform a wider variety of flexible and refined movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo focused all his attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He felt like a toddler learning to walk, first groping around on all fours, then slowly standing, then beginning to toddle forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Watching from the side, Mu Lan soon realized that was exactly what was happening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">‚ÄúSo Ning Zhuo has never before controlled such a large number of mechanical puppets.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Mu Lan frowned slightly, deciding to find an opportunity to persuade Ning Zhuo to abandon this troop training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Such underdeveloped skills used on the battlefield would be irresponsible to himself and especially to his allies and comrades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Moreover, since Ning Zhuo was her husband, the son-in-law of the Mu General‚Äôs household, he certainly could not just do as he pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo took out some spiritual food from his storage belt, stuffed it into his mouth, chewed a few times, and swallowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Shortly after, he also took out some pills and swallowed them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Both the spiritual food and the pills helped him recover his divine sense more quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">His divine sense consumption was tremendous, to the point that his head felt heavy, as if it contained an iron anvil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Mu Lan, observing all this, thought, ‚ÄúIn the end, Ning Zhuo is only at Foundation-Establishment level, so his divine sense is limited. He‚Äôs done quite well to hold out until now.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">‚ÄúHe may have picked this up quickly, but it‚Äôs still far from ready for the battlefield.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">‚ÄúI must stop him.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">‚ÄúBringing this into battle would be a joke.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">But in the next moment, Ning Zhuo opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He once again mobilized his divine sense to control the puppets. Different from before, this time he did not rely on divine sense alone; he used both divine sense and his Buddha Heart Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo had long ago planted heart-imprints in all these puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">A dual-control method of divine sense and heart-imprints!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The puppets suddenly became nimble, as though their dullness had been replaced with consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">‚ÄúHow is that possible?!‚Äù Mu Lan‚Äôs pupils contracted in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">She never imagined that after shutting his eyes for just a brief rest, Ning Zhuo would suddenly make such an astonishing leap in progress the moment he opened them again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Now, when the mechanical army marched forward or backward, it was no longer the previously scattered, disorganized movement; instead, it became swift and uniform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Mu Lan also noticed a detail‚Äîdifferent puppets could even adjust their spacing with one another!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">That would have been impossible before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">‚ÄúIf Ning Zhuo can make such fine adjustments, it means he still has a lot of capacity to spare.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">‚ÄúHow did he suddenly improve so dramatically? It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs become a different person altogether.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">It was a transformation like being reborn!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo was also quite pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Once he fully employed his heart-imprints, his consumption of divine sense plummeted drastically, down to less than a tenth of before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He no longer had any difficulty controlling the puppets, with plenty of spare energy to spare, operating them smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">After a moment, when Ning Zhuo got used to that state, he stretched out both hands, opened his fingers, and activated his spiritual energy threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ten threads dropped onto some of the nearby puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">In that instant, it was as if he had poured a soul into them: their movement speed became several times more agile, and their displayed combat power rose significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">‚ÄúWith this method, I can operate some of the stronger puppets.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt need it for now.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo had already decided that the commanding officer of this mechanical army would be the Shadowy Blade of Night‚ÄîNight Tiger. The latter possessed greater spirituality, even more than the Heavy-Armor Blood Ape‚ÄîDa Sheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">There was no need to control Night Tiger at all; letting it operate freely would be more effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">‚ÄúStill, anything concerning its spirituality is best kept hidden, not to be revealed. In the future, if I use Shadowy Blade of Night‚ÄîNight Tiger, I‚Äôll pretend it‚Äôs tethered to a thread of spiritual energy.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">As Ning Zhuo contemplated, Sun Lingtong awakened in the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He drowsily came to the dragon‚Äôs head cabin and, seeing Ning Zhuo training the puppets, his eyes gradually lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">‚ÄúLittle Zhuo, Little Zhuo, hurry, let me have a turn!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Sun Lingtong showed intense enthusiasm for drilling mechanical soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">‚ÄúAll right, Boss, I‚Äôll hand a portion of the puppets over to you. You must take them right away!‚Äù Ning Zhuo hinted to him discreetly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Having grown up together for more than ten years, Sun and Ning were as coordinated as could be.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Many of the mechanical puppets switched their controlling master from Ning Zhuo to Sun Lingtong, and the handover process was smooth as silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Mu Lan watched from the sidelines. She observed the entire process but did not see any hint of behind-the-scenes maneuvering between Ning and Sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Sun Lingtong himself was fairly accomplished in both techniques and innate gifts, and he had studied the mechanical-craft compendium left behind by Meng Yaoyin from an early age. So once he got familiar with these mechanical puppets, he handled them with skill and precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">At first, he encountered some difficulties due to unfamiliarity, causing a few stumbles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Mu Lan, noticing those initial bumps, glanced at Ning Zhuo. ‚ÄúThey still have a long time for training, and Ning Zhuo is nearing his limit.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">But as Sun Lingtong became more adept, the mechanical army‚Äôs performance kept improving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù Mu Lan realized that, once again, she had miscalculated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo sent his voice via divine sense: ‚ÄúHahaha, Boss, with your help, my workload has dropped by at least forty percent.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Sun Lingtong answered, ‚ÄúLittle Zhuo, this is so much fun.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo said, ‚ÄúBoss, let‚Äôs not just play around. Once you‚Äôve gotten the hang of things, we‚Äôll start practicing formations. Without a formation, an army is nothing more than scattered sand. On the battlefield, they would become fodder for the cannons and end up as sacrificial pawns.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">After another half cup of tea‚Äôs time, Sun and Ning had grown far more proficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">They formed a battle array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The formation was ‚Äî Light Body Swift Wind Formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Working together, Sun and Ning joined forces to form the battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">They almost succeeded, but at the final moment, two or three mechanical puppets were mishandled and did not move to their designated spots on time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Sensing imminent failure, Ning Zhuo hastily intervened, shooting out his spiritual energy threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">He deliberately exerted more spiritual energy, and at the last juncture, these three puppets made the correct moves and reached their correct positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">With a faint rumble, the Light Body Swift Wind Formation succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Tiny gusts of wind swirled among the entire mechanical force, lifting and twining around the puppets, increasing their speed, making them agile, and rendering them nearly silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Seeing this, Mu Lan could no longer conceal her reaction. Her expression changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Now that they could successfully form a battle array, this mechanical army instantly became a reliable fighting force worth anticipating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">‚ÄúI underestimated Ning Zhuo.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">‚ÄúHe truly was a rare prodigy! His gift for controlling mechanical contraptions is the greatest I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Mu Lan watched Ning Zhuo intently, and her feelings grew more complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The more she worked with Ning Zhuo, the more virtues she discovered in him by chance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Those virtues accumulated in her heart, causing her impression of Ning Zhuo to rise higher and higher.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
