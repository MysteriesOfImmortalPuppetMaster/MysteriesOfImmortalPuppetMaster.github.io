<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"I..." Under normal circumstances, Ban Ji would have already unleashed a torrent of curses. He was known for his short temper and had no pretense of Righteous Path decorum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">But just as the curses were about to erupt, he suddenly remembered where he was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This wasn't the Ban Clan's territory; it was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, with countless eyes watching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Forcing the curses back down, he glared at Ning Zhuo with eyes burning like fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This little brat actually treats me like a Demonic Cultivator! This Righteous Path facade is utterly detestable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">No, wait. Even though I'm a Demonic Cultivator, I'm also of the Ban Clan. I'm righteous! I'm righteous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Realizing his mistake, Ban Ji immediately retorted, accusing Ning Zhuo of slander.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">To his surprise, Ning Zhuo tilted his large head, looked down his nose at Ban Ji, and said with disdain, "Ban Ji, your reputation precedes you. Now it seems you're all talk and no action - a hypocritical coward, nothing more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">With that, he flicked his sleeve and strode away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"You..." Ban Ji seethed with rage, his fists clenching instinctively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In the past, Ban Ji would have annihilated any cultivator who dared to provoke him, either through his own martial prowess or by summoning the Ban Clan's forces to overwhelm the offender.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But now, he couldn't.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ban Ji's eyes burned crimson as he glared at Ning Zhuo's retreating back, his fists clenched so tightly he longed to punch through the man's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This is infuriating!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ban Ji had never been so publicly humiliated, so thoroughly slapped in the face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">And he couldn't even refute it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Because he had done exactly what Ning Zhuo accused him of. Even his recent denial sounded weak and unconvincing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">I want to kill him with a single punch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">I want to stomp on his head and scream, "So what if I did it?! What are you going to do about it?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">A violent impulse surged through Ban Ji, his Demonic Art activating instinctively, causing malevolent Qi to erupt from his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">But he couldn't act on it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Doing so would be a blatant violation of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's rules. Even the entire Ban Clan couldn't protect him from the consequences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">I don't care about myself! But how will my parents face the clan?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">This is unbearable! Utterly unbearable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">For a moment, Ban Ji was so enraged he wanted to roar at the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">This is truly unbearable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">If only I didn't have a family, the thought flashed through his divine sea with unprecedented intensity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Demonic Path emphasized indulging one's desires and emotions, urging practitioners to fully express their feelings. To hell with heaven and earth - I am the greatest! My personal emotions are paramount; the world revolves around me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Only by adhering to this principle could Demonic Cultivators smoothly cultivate their Demonic Arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This fundamental tenet naturally clashed with rules and regulations, making it difficult for Demonic Cultivators to integrate into tightly knit organizations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">However, Demonic Cultivators were also skilled at manipulating the emotions of others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Now, Ning Zhuo had ruthlessly stirred up Ban Ji's intense anger and hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ban Ji clenched his teeth so hard they ground together with a grating sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">I've made my decision!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">I will crush you to ashes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">I will trample you underfoot and wash away this humiliation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Just you wait. You'll pay for this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Why hasn't the Rising Cloud Minor Trial started yet?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ban Ji's entire body radiated murderous intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Many onlookers' eyes gleamed with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">They had witnessed a juicy drama and a lively spectacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Some nodded inwardly, thinking, "Ning Zhuo truly lives up to his reputation as a rising star of the Righteous Path. His unwavering righteousness under the Three Trials of the Heart is evident in his actions today."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Others frowned in confusion, wondering, "How could the prestigious Ban Clan tolerate someone like Ban Ji? His Demonic Art is remarkably powerful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Still others shook their heads secretly, concluding, "With just a few verbal exchanges, Ban Ji was provoked to the brink of losing control. The clear disparity between their capabilities is now undeniable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Everyone yearned to roam freely, believing themselves to be the greatest under heaven, yet none wished for others to become such domineering Demonic Cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Thus, the crowd naturally leaned toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">In this initial verbal clash, Ning Zhuo had already gained the upper hand, using Ban Ji as a foil to highlight his own virtues and win over a portion of the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Having sized up Ban Ji upon their first meeting, Ning Zhuo deliberately provoked him before withdrawing. After surveying the crowd, he approached Lu Zeng, bowing respectfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"May I inquire if you are Senior Lu Zeng?" Ning Zhuo asked with a composed smile and impeccable courtesy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo naturally paid even closer attention to Mechanism Cultivators, and Lu Zeng was among the individuals he had gathered intelligence on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Lu Zeng wore indigo robes, his waist encircled by numerous tool pouches. A bronze compass-ruler hung from his chest, while a wooden mechanism box was strapped to his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo knew that Lu Zeng's primary cultivation method was the Connected Thread Coupling Art, and his Lifebound Treasure was a mechanical construct called the Thousand-Mechanism Lotus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Lu Zeng faced Ning Zhuo with genuine warmth, his broad smile radiating sincerity as he waved his hands repeatedly. "Please, please, you flatter me. Let's treat each other as equals."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Though Ning Zhuo's cultivation was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, Lu Zeng would never underestimate him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo had distinguished himself as a prodigy in the very first wave of trials, his future prospects at least Golden Core-level. He had already earned the favor of the Confucian cultivator community and the Demon Subjugation Hall, and his public confrontation with Ban Ji and the Ban Clan demonstrated his formidable confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Even a blind man could see the boundless potential of such a figure. Lu Zeng, being far from blind, naturally treated him as an equal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After a brief exchange, Lu Zeng proactively gifted Ning Zhuo a Jade Token, explaining that it would grant him discounts on future transactions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Lu Zeng already operated several shops. If he successfully joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he anticipated establishing a branch within the sect's main mountain gate, selling a wide array of mechanism attachments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He specialized in crafting these attachments, and the brilliance of the Connected Thread Coupling Art was fully realized in them. Simply affixing one to a mechanical construct would cause fine threads to materialize, tightly binding the two together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Through mass sales of these attachments, Lu Zeng amassed cultivation resources, fueling his own cultivation progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">After presenting the jade pendant to Ning Zhuo, Lu Zeng proactively sent another pendant flying toward Ban Ji, right before Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"You two are both dragons and phoenixes among men, true geniuses of Mechanism cultivation. If we can establish future business dealings, the more the merrier!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">A sharp glint flashed in both Ning Zhuo's and Ban Ji's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">With this gesture, Lu Zeng publicly declared his neutrality: I'm a businessman. I'll befriend both of you and offend neither!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This aligned with his humble origins as an outer sect handyman and matched the personality traits described in intelligence reports about him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">After exchanging a few more words with Lu Zeng, Ning Zhuo excused himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He then approached Tie Zheng, the Golden Core cultivator, who stood nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Tie Zheng stood eight feet tall, his face hidden behind a bronze beast mask. Clad in martial artist attire, his exposed elbows and knees were replaced with polished steel bone spheres.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He carried a massive broadsword with a qilin-beast head hilt on his back, a heavy iron chain coiled around his waist. Twelve bronze bells, each shaped like a beast's head, hung from the chain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo attempted to strike up a conversation, but Tie Zheng responded coldly. After a few terse exchanges, Ning Zhuo withdrew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He knew Tie Zheng's background and wasn't bothered by the man's aloof demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Tie Zheng had been born into a prominent clan, but repeated betrayals by his parents, wife, and sworn brothers had filled him with contempt and loathing for humanity. He abandoned his family to become a solitary cultivator, spending his days training alone in the wilderness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He trusted his sword more than anyone else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Through a stroke of fortune in the wilderness, he had gained the ability to cultivate sword beasts. To date, he had raised twelve such creatures, each crafted from Golden Core-level blades, making them Golden Core-level beasts themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">This gave him a combat prowess far exceeding the norm, making him a renowned Golden Core-level rogue cultivator in the Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo then approached Ao Pan and offered a respectful bow. "Junior Ning Zhuo greets Senior. I am unaware of your esteemed name and humbly beg your forgiveness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo recognized the first two Golden Core cultivators present, but Ao Pan was unfamiliar to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Having thoroughly studied the intelligence reports at his disposal, Ning Zhuo was certain that Ao Pan's name was nowhere to be found.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This could only mean that Ao Pan had recently arrived at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ao Pan stood seven feet tall, his hunched posture resembling that of an old ape. Three claw marks scarred his left cheek, and his eyes were mismatched in size. His right eye was smaller and cloudy like stone, while his left eye was slightly larger, with a vertical pupil and a golden iris.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"No need to apologize for your ignorance. I'm from the Subduing Waves Kingdom and only arrived yesterday."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Ning Zhuo, I know of you. Like you, I'm an outsider here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Among the three Golden Core cultivators, Ao Pan showed the warmest attitude toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Subduing Waves Kingdom?" Ning Zhuo's interest was piqued. He seized the opportunity to steer the conversation, exchanging a few words with Ao Pan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Having read extensively, Ning Zhuo possessed a solid grasp of general knowledge and was familiar with some of the customs and traditions of the Subduing Waves Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ao Pan, in turn, spoke of matters he knew well, immediately feeling a sense of kinship. He wanted to continue chatting with Ning Zhuo, but Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in apology and took his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Though he's a body cultivator, he's quite shrewd. I tried probing him subtly by bringing up the Subduing Waves Kingdom, but he deftly evaded every attempt, offering only vague responses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">After a brief exchange, Ning Zhuo had already grasped Ao Pan's temperament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">In comparison, Tie Zheng seemed far more reliable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo decisively withdrew from the conversation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ao Pan watched the retreating figure of the large-headed youth, his mismatched eyes narrowing slightly. "This kid's even more slippery than I am. He passed the Three Trials of the Heart with righteous fervor, but he's no simpleton. He possesses remarkable social finesse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"He drew me into talking about the Subduing Waves Kingdom, extracting all sorts of information about me, while I still don't even know where he's from!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Before the Rising Cloud Minor Trial began, Ning Zhuo continued to cultivate connections with the surrounding cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">His gaze soon settled on Zhang Wangxing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The man radiated an unmistakable aura of peak Foundation Establishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Zhang Wangxing was powerfully built, yet he wore an even larger, coarse gray robe. A massive hood concealed his face, further obscured by a spell-conjured shadow that shrouded his features.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Though it was broad daylight outside Profound Armor Cave, Ning Zhuo could only make out the lower edge of the shadow beneath the hood, tracing the curve of Zhang Wangxing's jawline. Even this line occasionally flickered with subtle tremors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Fellow Daoist, might you be Zhang Wangxing?" Ning Zhuo called out proactively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Zhang Wangxing nodded slightly, his voice hoarse. "Indeed, it is I, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo knew his reputation. Though only at the Foundation Establishment stage, Zhang Wangxing possessed Golden Core-level combat prowess. He cultivated the Flesh Transformation Sutra, a technique that perfectly complemented his low-grade Innate Talent. Despite his polite demeanor, he was a rogue cultivator who took on any job for a high price, using the earnings to fund his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zhang Wangxing transmitted a message with his divine sense: "If you plan to deal with Ban Ji in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, I can assist you. Given your noble lineage, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, I trust you won't be stingy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo didn't refuse, replying with his divine sense: "We'll see. The situation remains unclear, but I'll contact you if needed, Fellow Daoist Zhang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Zhang Wangxing chuckled softly. "Be careful, Fellow Daoist. To be frank, if Ban Ji were to hire me, I'd accept."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">His tone carried an implicit threat, a clear attempt to raise his price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">This put Ning Zhuo in a delicate position. Realizing he couldn't linger, he promptly excused himself and departed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"I made a grand entrance, secured a stone token in the first wave, defied the Ban Clan, provoked Ban Ji, and earned the equal treatment of Golden Core cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Yet here I am, at a disadvantage before a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator. How ironic."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel a sense of irony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">After leaving Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo traveled the world, witnessing its majestic mountains and rivers and encountering people of all kinds. Now, gathered beneath the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Flying Cloud Assembly, with cultivators from every corner of the land, his horizons expanded further, and his heart stirred with frequent inspiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Young Master Ning Zhuo!" A Mechanism Cultivator approached Ning Zhuo and bowed in greeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">This cultivator, also at the Foundation Establishment stage, was stout and muscular, with dark, gleaming skin like a hunk of iron. He carried a square iron shield on his back and moved with deliberate slowness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo smiled warmly upon seeing him and called out his name: "Zhang Dadan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">This was an old acquaintance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Zhang Dadan had participated in Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Minor Trial, and Ning Zhuo had even hosted a banquet for him afterward. Besides Zhang Dadan, the other attendees had included Patchwork Sun, Chen San, Jiang Xiaobian, and Huo Wa'er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo still remembered them vividly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo clapped Zhang Dadan on the shoulder. "What about the others?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">He learned that Patchwork Sun had originally planned to come with Zhang Dadan but was delayed by another Rising Cloud Minor Trial. Fortunately, the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's Rising Cloud Minor Trial had multiple rounds, similar to the Demon Subjugation Hall, so he hadn't missed his chance entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Chen San had already pledged allegiance to Ning Zhuo and was currently carrying out his missions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Jiang Xiaobian and Huo Wa'er, however, had no interest in the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor. It didn't align with their cultivation paths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">For them, with so many Rising Cloud Minor Trials available, there were bound to be ones more suited to their interests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">After exchanging a few words with Zhang Dadan, Ning Zhuo was approached by other cultivators eager to strike up a conversation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ban Ji had previously maintained a cold and aloof demeanor, as if warning strangers to keep their distance. As a Demonic Cultivator with a notorious reputation (greatly amplified by Ning Zhuo's rumors), even those who wished to curry favor hesitated, weighing the risks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo, however, was different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">His mere presence had provoked Ban Ji into a frenzy, allowing Ning Zhuo to seize the upper hand and display his dominance. Increasingly, cultivators became convinced that the power behind Ning Zhuo was no less formidable than that of the Ban Clan. Otherwise, how could they explain his unwavering confidence and overwhelming presence?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Moreover, Ning Zhuo actively engaged in conversation, treating even someone like Zhang Dadan with warmth and friendliness, which stirred the hearts of the observing cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">As a result, Ning Zhuo didn't need to seek out others; many cultivators actively approached him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He responded to each one with consistent kindness and sincerity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">This scene starkly contrasted with Ban Ji's isolation. Standing alone by the cliff wall, he looked utterly neglected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ban Ji watched Ning Zhuo, now surrounded by a crowd, his eyes twitching uncontrollably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Damn it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">This familiar scenario was repeating itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">This is bad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">If this continues, will Ning Zhuo rally another group of fools to gang up on me again?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">He's a real headache!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">A true nuisance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Zhuo had only been present for a short time, yet after just a few rounds of socializing, Ban Ji already felt the pressure mounting once more.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
