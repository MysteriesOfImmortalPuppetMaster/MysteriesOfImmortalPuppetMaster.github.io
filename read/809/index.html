<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The long night was not yet over; the moonlight was like white silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ancient trees coiled like dragons; dense clouds and mist swirled in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zhu Fenxiang quietly infiltrated the Green Stone cave abode to meet with Ning Zhuo in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Tonight, Zhu Fenxiang wore a dark Daoist robe, holding a purple copper incense burner in her hands. Three sticks of incense were inserted into the burner, and three wisps of blue smoke circled her entire body, helping to mask her appearance and revealing only her graceful silhouette.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo was puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">According to common sense, he and Zhu Fenxiang should have little contact and minimize their meetings. The more secretive their relationship, the more beneficial it would be.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zhu Fenxiang acted with swift determination: "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, I won't waste words. Come, let's talk inside."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo nodded: "Alright." He then led her into the Cultivation Chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Coincidentally, Qing Chi, who was passing by, saw this scene. Her eyes went wide, and her heart tightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"It seems a female cultivator just secretly went into the room with the Young Master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Who is she?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The two entered the room. Zhu Fenxiang got straight to the point: "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo. I have successfully invited three Confucian Deities. Tomorrow is the checkpoint for the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, presided over personally by Gu Qing’s mentor, Zhao Hansheng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"To be honest, it was precisely because I relied on the blessings of these three Confucian Deities that I was able to pass the first four rounds."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"If you secretly receive the blessings of these three gods, it should be a huge help in defeating Gu Qing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly but remained silent, waiting for what was to follow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Although he and Zhu Fenxiang were secret allies, it was mostly due to the True Lord of Earth Prison Suppression. Their relationship was not like that of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, nor did it compare to that between Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Therefore, since Zhu Fenxiang was actively offering help this time, she naturally had demands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">There was a price to pay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo waited quietly for her to state her conditions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zhu Fenxiang bit her lower lip lightly and lowered her voice: "I am willing to guide you to this opportunity, Fellow Daoist, and obtain the protection of the gods. However, there is no such thing as a free lunch in this world - you must agree to one thing. Ally with me in secret, infiltrate under Situ Xing's command, pass information to me, and coordinate from the inside."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"When the time is right, you and I will strike together. I will attack from the front, and you strike from the back. We will surely cause Situ Xing to suffer a crushing defeat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Hearing this, Ning Zhuo chuckled and shook his head slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zhu Fenxiang frowned: "Why do you laugh, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo stood with his hands behind his back: "Fellow Daoist Zhu, your plan is ingenious. But I, Ning Zhuo, have always acted openly and uprightly. Hiding my head and tail, engaging in secret schemes? That is not my Dao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo could employ strategy, but backstabbing was not something he could do in public; it was not something a young man with such a strong sense of justice would do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo’s voice was sonorous: "If Fellow Daoist Zhu wants to cooperate with me, I naturally welcome it. But the plan needs to change. I will first wait for Situ Xing to work hard at managing his faction. When the time is right, I will challenge him publicly, defeat him fair and square, and make him hand over the position of Chief with bowed hands!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhu Fenxiang stared blankly at the big-headed youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Before this, she might have had doubts. But after the first four rounds of the Confucian cultivation minor trials, especially the battle over the Noble Spirit Xuan Paper, Ning Zhuo’s fame had shaken the main mountain gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, causing her impression of him to rise again and again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo’s abundant confidence in himself also touched Zhu Fenxiang’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"That works too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Since Fellow Daoist Ning has made up his mind, I will not force the issue. I also believe that you will not disappoint me in the future, Fellow Daoist!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Time is limited. Let me invite the gods first and grant you their blessings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The two of them tidied up the Cultivation Chamber slightly, arranged offerings, and set up an altar table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Zhu Fenxiang took out three statues and placed them on the table with great solemnity. Then, she placed the purple copper incense burner in front of the three statues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Her lips moved as she silently recited prayers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">In just a moment, blue smoke spread from the incense burner, gathering at the top of the room like rolling clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Golden light flashed continuously within the smoke clouds, appearing more and more frequently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The golden lights gradually grew larger, allowing Ning Zhuo to recognize that each gleam of gold was a shimmering character.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The golden characters accumulated rapidly, faintly emitting the sound of chanting scriptures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Subsequently, the aura of deities appeared out of thin air, becoming extremely dense in the blink of an eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zhu Fenxiang and Ning Zhuo bowed at the same time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The first figure emerged from the golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">This Confucian Deity wore a long black robe embroidered with patterns of the sun, moon, mountains, and rivers. He held two bamboo scrolls in his hands: one was the Analects and the other was the Great Learning. His face was as warm and smooth as jade, his long beard hung to his chest, his brow held the compassion of educating the common people, and his eyes hid the light of eternal wisdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">It was none other than God Kong (Confucius).</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">God Kong looked down at Ning Zhuo, observed him for a while, and nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">A soft light radiated from His body. Ning Zhuo bathed in this soft light, accepting God Kong’s blessing. The confusion, anxiety, and unease in his heart melted away like ice and snow, gradually turning into a state of clarity and purity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The second figure also gradually appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">His figure was tall and upright, with an awe-inspiring righteousness between his brows. His gaze was like a torch, seemingly able to pierce through the vanity of the human heart. He was also clad in black robes, holding the Mencius and the Book of Rites.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Rites are the order of heaven and earth; Benevolence is the root of the human heart." God Meng's (Mencius) voice was like a great bell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The deity's blessing seemed to be carved into the depths of Ning Zhuo's soul along with the sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The third figure then emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">God Zisi wore a gentle smile, holding the Book of Rites and the Family Instructions of Yan. His body emitted a glow as warm as jade. He spoke no words, simply gently opening the classics in his hand. Countless golden characters flew out, circling Ning Zhuo like fireflies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Countless memories suddenly surged in Ning Zhuo’s mind; they were all the Confucian classics he had once read. Just as he wanted to identify them carefully, these teachings suddenly vanished without a trace, as if everything had been an illusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The walls of the Cultivation Chamber trembled slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Qing Chi lay against the base of the wall, trying hard to listen, but could hear nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">She gritted her teeth, her expression complex: "What exactly are the Young Master and that mysterious female cultivator doing? They haven't come out for half a day!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The walls of the Cultivation Chamber stopped vibrating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Qing Chi hurriedly straightened up, pretending to be passing by.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The door opened, and Zhu Fenxiang, holding the purple copper incense burner and shrouded in smoke, glanced at Qing Chi as she passed, then drifted away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="119"/>
<paragraph index="120">The next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">On the temporarily constructed nine-story jade platform, Zhao Hansheng stood with his hands behind his back, his black robes dark as ink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Below the stage, three thousand cultivators stood in silence, each stationed at a stall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">There were white-haired old scholars, children of noble families in brocade robes, sword cultivators with fierce auras, and many unorthodox practitioners in strange attire - the temptation of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page was indeed powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">In the front row on the left, Gu Qing, in a moon-white scholar's shirt that was spotless, stood with his eyes closed to rest his spirit, his face solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">In the back row, Ning Zhuo stood quietly, his hands hanging naturally, his wide sleeves swaying gently in the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Around them, gazes occasionally lingered on Gu Qing and Ning Zhuo. The outcome of this round would determine the result of the entire Confucian cultivation minor trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Zhao Hansheng spoke slowly, his voice not loud, but clearly reaching everyone's ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">He informed everyone in the venue of the rules for this trial. The refining method for the Dao-Bearing Jade Page would be taught in nine segments. Each segment had corresponding assessment standards. Cultivators had to produce results that met the standards to be qualified to listen to the next segment of the paper-making content.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Hearing this, the gathered cultivators erupted in a commotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">They had originally thought that the paper-making method for the Dao-Bearing Jade Page would be as easily obtained as in the first four rounds. But now, Zhao Hansheng was telling them that it was impossible to gain such an advantage so easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">In today's round, everyone would face the cruel pressure of elimination!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">"Now, the first chapter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Zhao Hansheng took out a yellowed jade slip from his sleeve and slowly unfurled it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">He began to recite. It was not a simple reading, but carried a certain rhythm, like plucking the strings of an ancient zither or the soft chiming of bells: "Observe the sequence of the four seasons, the stars and frost forming their pattern. The Yi and Zhen constellations cast light upon Nanpu; the Heng and Lu mountains breathe into the Eastern Sea. Let the boy hold the azure jade disc to pay homage to the essence of Taiyi; order E and Ying to hold the black scepter to collect the soul of Gushe. When the dew is white at the third watch, see the withered mulberry turn to jade; in the depths of the nine-fathom abyss, there is an old clam containing a pearl..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">The voice echoed within the formation space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">The first time, everyone pricked up their ears and maintained focus; the second time, sweat began to appear on many foreheads; by the end of the third time, a suppressed commotion arose in the venue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">"This... what is this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">"I don't understand it at all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">"What Yi and Zhen at Nanpu, what withered mulberry turning to jade... is this talking about paper making?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Zhao Hansheng put away the jade slip and announced expressionlessly: "Three shichen (six hours). Begin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">Transparent light curtains rose around the stalls, separating the three thousand people into independent areas. Inside each area was a set of basic tools: a jade knife, a bronze cauldron, a clay pot, a wooden table, and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">Gu Qing was the first to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">He didn't even think; he directly grabbed the jade knife, selected suitable southern branches of paper mulberry from the various materials, and used the knife to cut them into inch-long pieces. Every cross-section glowed with a pale golden hue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Gu Qing then took out a small jade bottle and uncorked it, releasing a clear, cold fragrance. He poured the liquid from the bottle into the bronze cauldron and started a fire. His movements were smooth and flowing; every detail was precise, as if practiced thousands of times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">Almost everyone else was hearing the paper-making method for the Dao-Bearing Jade Page for the first time. But not Gu Qing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">He had long ago learned this method from his mentor, Zhao Hansheng, and had successfully refined it before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">He quickly left everyone behind, taking a commanding lead alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Ning Zhuo observed Gu Qing with his divine sense and sighed softly in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">The opponent's advantage was immense. However, Ning Zhuo’s state of mind was stable; after all, his true goal was never to defeat Gu Qing, but to learn the method of creating the spirit paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">But Zhao Hansheng was obviously guarding against this. To obtain the complete method, he had to go all out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged and closed his eyes. The content Zhao Hansheng had recited echoed repeatedly in his mind. Characters appeared in the Divine Sea within his Upper Dantian, then were disassembled and reassembled into sentences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Ning Zhuo analyzed it word by word and sentence by sentence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">"'Yi and Zhen casting light' seems to refer to the astrological fields, corresponding to certain geographical directions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">"'Boy holding the azure jade disc' implies using pure Yang to contact the jade tool?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">"'Withered mulberry turning to jade' should refer to a certain material that needs to undergo such a transformation..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">He clearly felt the vast difference in the methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">In the previous four rounds, whether it was the Mountain and River Page, the Heavenly Star Note Paper, the Noble Spirit Xuan Paper, or the Heart Fire Silk, the refining methods were simple, direct, and easy to understand. But the creation method for the Dao-Bearing Jade Page appeared on the surface to be a flowery essay using a large number of classical allusions to describe scenery and express emotion. In reality, however, it wrote out the true creation method. It was just that ordinary cultivators found it hard to read; the threshold for comprehension was too high!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Ning Zhuo did not major in Confucian methods, but fortunately, his fundamentals were solid. In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he read all kinds of classics. As long as the basic Confucian classics were available on the market, he had read them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">The paper-making method of the first segment was gradually translated by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">He began to inspect the precious materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">"I need to strictly select suitable materials according to the content of the method. Raw materials are the start of everything; I cannot make a mistake."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">Most of the materials were related to the Five Elements, which was favorable for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Everything in the world basically could not escape the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Coupled with the fact that Ning Zhuo’s artifact refining realm had improved significantly, selecting materials did not stump him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Three shichen later, the Grand Formation activated, suppressing the cultivators and forcing them to stop simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">In most people's bronze cauldrons, there was just a pile of boiled rotten wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">A few had refined a substance similar to paper pulp, but the color was turbid and lacked any spiritual light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">In front of Gu Qing, a cauldron of pale golden liquid was glowing faintly, with starlight vaguely flickering on the surface - perfect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Zhao Hansheng’s divine sense specifically lingered on Ning Zhuo’s stall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">He saw that the liquid in Ning Zhuo’s bronze cauldron was pale green. It wasn't pure enough, but it indeed had the embryonic form of "Literary Light Pulp." Most critically, a few silver threads floated in the liquid - traces of Ning Zhuo integrating a wisp of his own divine sense into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">"He knows the how, and also the why." Zhao Hansheng nodded slightly in his heart. "Pass."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">After the first segment ended, eight hundred people were directly removed from the venue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Zhao Hansheng gave the crowd no time to rest. He unfurled the jade slip once again: "Now, regarding the cold pool dissolving anger, it is not due to the woodcutter's wind; the ancient well creating waves, is it because of the Chiwen dragon? Throw Bian He's jade into the great furnace; cook the ferns of Yi and Qi as fuel. Seven returns and purple smoke forms the seal script; nine turns and green marrow congeals into fat. The Goddess of the Xiang is suddenly startled, hearing the music of the Xianchi; Feng Yi lets out a long whistle, secretly crossing the ripples of the vast water..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">The cultivators: ?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">The difficulty of understanding the content of the second segment was more than double that of the first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">The cultivators hurriedly memorized it by heart, then thought hard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">"This is deliberately making things difficult!" A short-tempered cultivator smashed his jade knife. "I'm not taking this test anymore!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">He was immediately teleported out by the Grand Formation, causing no further negative impact on the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Gu Qing remained calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">He carefully selected from the pile of materials, choosing suitable pine wood, cypress wood, and bamboo joints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">"Pine, bamboo, and cypress - the Three Friends of Winter, symbolizing the gentleman." An old man observing from the side murmured, "So 'the ferns of Yi and Qi' doesn't mean actual ferns, but refers to high-purity fuel..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Because one could observe other stalls, many smart cultivators copied Gu Qing’s every move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">Gu Qing lit the wood, and the flames intertwined in three colors: cyan, white, and green. He poured the Literary Light Pulp refined earlier into a new bronze cauldron and began to steam and boil it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">During the boiling process, he took out the pulp every shichen to beat it, then put it back. He repeated this seven times - exactly the "Seven Returns" referred to in the creation method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">With each beating, the color of the pulp deepened, and the texture became purer. By the seventh time, the pulp had turned into a semi-transparent cyan-purple, like solidified jadeite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">"Green marrow congeals into fat... perfect appearance, not bad." seeing this, Zhao Hansheng nodded inwardly, quite pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">His divine sense spread out and landed on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">The colors of Ning Zhuo’s flame were mixed together, far inferior to the purity of Gu Qing’s three-colored fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">"With fire like that, he is bound to fail." Zhao Hansheng thought to himself, "However, to reach this level on a first attempt is already a decent standard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">Just as he thought this, the flame Ning Zhuo was maintaining suddenly became distinct, the three colors clearly separated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">Fire Element Heart Temple!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
