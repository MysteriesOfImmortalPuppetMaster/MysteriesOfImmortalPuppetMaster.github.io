<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 175: Ning Zhuo vs. Zhou Zeshen (Part 1)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The crowd gathered at the Ning family's martial arts arena.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo initially wanted to rent the martial arts arena in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, but Zhou Zeshen suggested there was no need to waste money.<br/>
<br/>
He also mentioned there was no need to go all the way to the Zhou family; they could just have a small sparring match at the Ning family's arena.<br/>
<br/>
This statement made Ning Zhuo glance at Zhou Zeshen, deep in thought.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong immediately stood up and raised his hand, saying, "I'll go contact the family about using the martial arts arena." Seeing Ning Zhuo nod, Ning Yong excitedly ran out of the courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen, with a smile, proposed, "Big bets harm the body, small bets add fun. Brother Ning, why don't we wager something?" Ning Zhuo also smiled, "It seems Brother Zhou came prepared."<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen spread his hands, "You saw right through me, Brother Ning. I thought I couldn't come empty-handed, so I brought this." As he spoke, Zhou Zeshen took out a small crossbow from his storage belt.<br/>
<br/>
The crossbow was small, only slightly larger than an adult's palm, with a delicate and sturdy steel structure.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, it didn't have a traditional arrow nest but a small rectangular wooden box instead.<br/>
<br/>
"This is a Rivet Force Crossbow, slightly modified by me, with considerable power." Zhou Zeshen revealed a confident smile, "Brother Ning, if you win, I'll give this to you along with the mechanical blueprint." Ning Zhuo's heart stirred, and he took out a Mechanical Fire Monkey, "If you win, I'll give this to you, along with the corresponding mechanical blueprint. I'm just worried I won't have to give it away." "Hahaha." The two exchanged a glance and laughed heartily.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong soon returned, panting, saying he had booked the Ding-character martial arts arena.<br/>
<br/>
The crowd immediately left the courtyard and headed to the arena in groups.<br/>
<br/>
The branch cultivator in charge of the arena treated Ning Zhuo with respect and enthusiasm, asking what kind of battlefield they needed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked at Zhou Zeshen.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen said, "Since we have mountains here, let's use a mountainous terrain." Thus, several formations in the arena activated.<br/>
<br/>
The originally flat ground immediately had red soil rising, piling higher and higher.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed as if an invisible force was molding the red soil into two small hills, towering over the Ning family's walls.<br/>
<br/>
But that wasn't all.<br/>
<br/>
The power of the Wood element acted on the hills, causing grass and trees to mature within a few breaths, forming a dense forest.<br/>
<br/>
A dark cloud condensed, floating over the battlefield, pouring rain along the way.<br/>
<br/>
A large amount of water appeared out of thin air, forming a small river between the two hills.<br/>
<br/>
According to Zhou Zeshen's request, the arena did not activate the concealment formation.<br/>
<br/>
Such a large commotion quickly attracted other Ning family members.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo's classmates explained, everyone quickly understood the situation.<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo is going to spar with the Zhou family's genius Zhou Zeshen!"<br/>
<br/>
"Why?"<br/>
<br/>
"Zhou Zeshen requested the sparring."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh no, Zhou Zeshen looks cunning. Is Young Master Ning Zhuo being schemed against? Is Zhou Zeshen trying to use our Ning Zhuo to gain fame?" "Ahem, that's a bit much. Zhou Zeshen has been famous for a long time, much earlier than Young Master Ning Zhuo." "Didn't you see them talking happily? They're both smiling."<br/>
<br/>
"This is bad. I've heard of Zhou Zeshen; he has the talent of Water Accumulating into a Deep Pool and has been nurtured by his family for a long time. But although Young Master Ning Zhuo has talent, it hasn't been detected yet. How can he fight?" "Young Master Ning Zhuo, rise up!" "We all support you!!"<br/>
<br/>
More and more Ning family members gathered, discussing and cheering for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo waved to everyone, causing the cheers to grow even louder.<br/>
<br/>
With the battlefield set, Ning Zhuo and Zhou Zeshen entered the arena, each standing on a hilltop, facing each other.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen transmitted his voice, "Brother Ning, please."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo replied, "Brother Zhou is the guest, you should go first."<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, then I'll show my skills." Zhou Zeshen patted his storage belt, releasing ten Mechanical Ground Drilling Mice.<br/>
<br/>
The Ground Drilling Mice were swift and agile, moving effortlessly through the dense forest.<br/>
<br/>
Each mouse had a mana thread attached to it.<br/>
<br/>
As the mice moved away from Zhou Zeshen, the threads extended, floating and stable.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also patted his belt, releasing five Mechanical Fire Monkeys.<br/>
<br/>
He similarly used mana threads to control the monkeys, making them leap and swing among the branches.<br/>
<br/>
The arena was limited in size, and both sides' mechanisms were fast, quickly meeting at the foot of Ning Zhuo's hill.<br/>
<br/>
The Ground Drilling Mice had sharp spiral drills at their front, capable of drilling holes into the Fire Monkeys upon impact.<br/>
<br/>
The Fire Monkeys were much larger and stronger.<br/>
<br/>
They moved nimbly and cooperated well, quickly gaining the upper hand.<br/>
<br/>
Crack, crack...<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen's mana threads connected to his ten fingers.<br/>
<br/>
After the clash, three of his fingers twitched slightly, and the threads snapped.<br/>
<br/>
This meant he had lost three Ground Drilling Mice!<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the unfavorable situation, Zhou Zeshen clasped his fingers inward, making the remaining seven mice retreat simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
"Good!" The Ning family members watching cheered loudly.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, their view was obstructed by the forest, and the chaotic battle made it hard to discern the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Now, with Zhou Zeshen's mice retreating, the sides were clear, and everyone could see.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen had lost three mice, while Ning Zhuo had almost no losses, only one Fire Monkey lagging due to a damaged leg.<br/>
<br/>
In the first probing clash, Zhou Zeshen decisively retreated, trying to distance his mice from the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, unwilling to let them go, increased his mana output, commanding the Fire Monkeys to pursue.<br/>
<br/>
However, the mice were faster, with a clear advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the monkeys couldn't catch up, Ning Zhuo said, "Brother Zhou, be careful, I'm going to use weapon attachments." The next moment, the Fire Monkeys spat out red firecrackers.<br/>
<br/>
The monkeys threw the firecrackers forcefully.<br/>
<br/>
The explosions caused the ground to crack, trees to fall, and smoke to rise.<br/>
<br/>
When the smoke cleared, only a few mechanical remnants were left at the explosion site.<br/>
<br/>
At the critical moment, the mice had burrowed underground to escape.<br/>
<br/>
Only two mice, unfortunately caught in the concentrated blast area, were blown to pieces despite burrowing.<br/>
<br/>
"Only five left." Ning Zhuo calculated silently.<br/>
<br/>
He frowned slightly.<br/>
<br/>
The burrowing mice had entered the mountain, making Ning Zhuo lose track of them.<br/>
<br/>
They could be returning to Zhou Zeshen or preparing to attack Ning Zhuo from underground.<br/>
<br/>
"Should I continue attacking or use a detection spell?" Ning Zhuo chose to cast a spell to scout his surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
"Is he choosing to defend first?" Zhou Zeshen, standing on the hill, saw this and a gleam flashed in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
He noted this detail.<br/>
<br/>
A person's true nature often reveals itself more directly and honestly in battle.<br/>
<br/>
This was one reason Zhou Zeshen suggested the sparring.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family wanted to recruit Ning Zhuo, and Zhou Zeshen realized Ning Zhuo had immense potential.<br/>
<br/>
Following the current trend, he would undoubtedly become a significant figure in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
To recruit a key figure, one must first understand them well.<br/>
<br/>
A friendly sparring match often helps cultivators quickly bond and understand each other.<br/>
<br/>
"Fire Monkeys are only five, Ning Zhuo's control pressure isn't high." "He could cast a detection spell while commanding the Fire Monkeys." "Indeed."<br/>
<br/>
"He understands my main intention for the sparring!" "As expected of a genius like me."<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen's lips curled slightly, feeling comfortable dealing with someone as smart as Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Many things didn't need to be said to be understood.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo deliberately slowed the battle pace, while Zhou Zeshen threw out a storage bag.<br/>
<br/>
The bag landed, its mouth wide open, releasing over a dozen Mechanical Bats—Night Sky Bats.<br/>
<br/>
The Night Sky Bats flew through the air towards Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Ning Zhuo patted his belt, releasing a flock of Mechanical Thunder Silence Birds.<br/>
<br/>
These mechanisms were very popular due to their simple control and ease of use.<br/>
<br/>
The Thunder Silence Birds collided with the Night Sky Bats in mid-air, initiating the second direct clash between Ning Zhuo and Zhou Zeshen.<br/>
<br/>
The Thunder Silence Birds attacked straightforwardly, while the Night Sky Bats were elusive, with agile turns and superior evasion.<br/>
<br/>
The Night Sky Bats, from the Mudflow Sect, were clearly superior in performance to the popular Thunder Silence Birds.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's Thunder Silence Birds outnumbered the Night Sky Bats, but after the clash, the birds quickly dwindled, clearly at a disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family members looked serious, some frowning, silently worrying for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"He's holding back." Zhou Zeshen's heart stirred.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, Ning Zhuo controlled five Fire Monkeys with great skill, showing high control proficiency.<br/>
<br/>
But in this aerial battle, Ning Zhuo's Thunder Silence Birds were almost unoperated, moving straightforwardly, making their attack paths easy to predict.<br/>
<br/>
This gave Zhou Zeshen a significant advantage.<br/>
<br/>
"Is it because my Ground Drilling Mice retreated in the first clash? So Ning Zhuo is sparing my face by deliberately losing here." "This guy..."<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen gritted his teeth, feeling conflicted.<br/>
<br/>
He appreciated Ning Zhuo's consideration for his face, such tacit understanding.<br/>
<br/>
But he also felt frustrated, rarely experiencing such condescension as a genius.<br/>
<br/>
"Though it's a friendly sparring, I've always been serious." "I'm giving my all, but you're holding back..."<br/>
<br/>
"Though it's kind, it's also a form of humiliation for me." "Ning Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
"I want you to take me seriously!!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen shouted in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Spurred by this, he took out a medium-sized mechanism from his storage belt.<br/>
<br/>
This mechanism resembled a fierce tiger, about two and a half zhang long, five chi tall at the shoulder, with three-inch claws, two-inch teeth, white fur with black stripes, and a golden tiger's gaze, appearing quite formidable.</div>
