<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 175: Ning Zhuo vs. Zhou Zeshen (Part 1)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The crowd gathered at the Ning family's martial arts arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo initially wanted to rent the martial arts arena in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, but Zhou Zeshen suggested there was no need to waste money.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He also mentioned there was no need to go all the way to the Zhou family; they could just have a small sparring match at the Ning family's arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This statement made Ning Zhuo glance at Zhou Zeshen, deep in thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Yong immediately stood up and raised his hand, saying, "I'll go contact the family about using the martial arts arena." Seeing Ning Zhuo nod, Ning Yong excitedly ran out of the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zhou Zeshen, with a smile, proposed, "Big bets harm the body, small bets add fun. Brother Ning, why don't we wager something?" Ning Zhuo also smiled, "It seems Brother Zhou came prepared."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zhou Zeshen spread his hands, "You saw right through me, Brother Ning. I thought I couldn't come empty-handed, so I brought this." As he spoke, Zhou Zeshen took out a small crossbow from his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The crossbow was small, only slightly larger than an adult's palm, with a delicate and sturdy steel structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Notably, it didn't have a traditional arrow nest but a small rectangular wooden box instead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"This is a Rivet Force Crossbow, slightly modified by me, with considerable power." Zhou Zeshen revealed a confident smile, "Brother Ning, if you win, I'll give this to you along with the mechanical blueprint." Ning Zhuo's heart stirred, and he took out a Mechanical Fire Monkey, "If you win, I'll give this to you, along with the corresponding mechanical blueprint. I'm just worried I won't have to give it away." "Hahaha." The two exchanged a glance and laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Yong soon returned, panting, saying he had booked the Ding-character martial arts arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The crowd immediately left the courtyard and headed to the arena in groups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The branch cultivator in charge of the arena treated Ning Zhuo with respect and enthusiasm, asking what kind of battlefield they needed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo looked at Zhou Zeshen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Zhou Zeshen said, "Since we have mountains here, let's use a mountainous terrain." Thus, several formations in the arena activated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The originally flat ground immediately had red soil rising, piling higher and higher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">It seemed as if an invisible force was molding the red soil into two small hills, towering over the Ning family's walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">But that wasn't all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The power of the Wood element acted on the hills, causing grass and trees to mature within a few breaths, forming a dense forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">A dark cloud condensed, floating over the battlefield, pouring rain along the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">A large amount of water appeared out of thin air, forming a small river between the two hills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">According to Zhou Zeshen's request, the arena did not activate the concealment formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Such a large commotion quickly attracted other Ning family members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After Ning Zhuo's classmates explained, everyone quickly understood the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Young Master Ning Zhuo is going to spar with the Zhou family's genius Zhou Zeshen!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Why?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Zhou Zeshen requested the sparring."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Oh no, Zhou Zeshen looks cunning. Is Young Master Ning Zhuo being schemed against? Is Zhou Zeshen trying to use our Ning Zhuo to gain fame?" "Ahem, that's a bit much. Zhou Zeshen has been famous for a long time, much earlier than Young Master Ning Zhuo." "Didn't you see them talking happily? They're both smiling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"This is bad. I've heard of Zhou Zeshen; he has the talent of Water Accumulating into a Deep Pool and has been nurtured by his family for a long time. But although Young Master Ning Zhuo has talent, it hasn't been detected yet. How can he fight?" "Young Master Ning Zhuo, rise up!" "We all support you!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">More and more Ning family members gathered, discussing and cheering for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo waved to everyone, causing the cheers to grow even louder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">With the battlefield set, Ning Zhuo and Zhou Zeshen entered the arena, each standing on a hilltop, facing each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Zhou Zeshen transmitted his voice, "Brother Ning, please."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo replied, "Brother Zhou is the guest, you should go first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Alright, then I'll show my skills." Zhou Zeshen patted his storage belt, releasing ten Mechanical Ground Drilling Mice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Ground Drilling Mice were swift and agile, moving effortlessly through the dense forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Each mouse had a mana thread attached to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">As the mice moved away from Zhou Zeshen, the threads extended, floating and stable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo also patted his belt, releasing five Mechanical Fire Monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He similarly used mana threads to control the monkeys, making them leap and swing among the branches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The arena was limited in size, and both sides' mechanisms were fast, quickly meeting at the foot of Ning Zhuo's hill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Ground Drilling Mice had sharp spiral drills at their front, capable of drilling holes into the Fire Monkeys upon impact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Fire Monkeys were much larger and stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">They moved nimbly and cooperated well, quickly gaining the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Crack, crack...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhou Zeshen's mana threads connected to his ten fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After the clash, three of his fingers twitched slightly, and the threads snapped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This meant he had lost three Ground Drilling Mice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Seeing the unfavorable situation, Zhou Zeshen clasped his fingers inward, making the remaining seven mice retreat simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Good!" The Ning family members watching cheered loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Earlier, their view was obstructed by the forest, and the chaotic battle made it hard to discern the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Now, with Zhou Zeshen's mice retreating, the sides were clear, and everyone could see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Zhou Zeshen had lost three mice, while Ning Zhuo had almost no losses, only one Fire Monkey lagging due to a damaged leg.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In the first probing clash, Zhou Zeshen decisively retreated, trying to distance his mice from the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo, unwilling to let them go, increased his mana output, commanding the Fire Monkeys to pursue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">However, the mice were faster, with a clear advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Seeing the monkeys couldn't catch up, Ning Zhuo said, "Brother Zhou, be careful, I'm going to use weapon attachments." The next moment, the Fire Monkeys spat out red firecrackers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The monkeys threw the firecrackers forcefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The explosions caused the ground to crack, trees to fall, and smoke to rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">When the smoke cleared, only a few mechanical remnants were left at the explosion site.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">At the critical moment, the mice had burrowed underground to escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Only two mice, unfortunately caught in the concentrated blast area, were blown to pieces despite burrowing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Only five left." Ning Zhuo calculated silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He frowned slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The burrowing mice had entered the mountain, making Ning Zhuo lose track of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">They could be returning to Zhou Zeshen or preparing to attack Ning Zhuo from underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Should I continue attacking or use a detection spell?" Ning Zhuo chose to cast a spell to scout his surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Is he choosing to defend first?" Zhou Zeshen, standing on the hill, saw this and a gleam flashed in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He noted this detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">A person's true nature often reveals itself more directly and honestly in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">This was one reason Zhou Zeshen suggested the sparring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Zhou family wanted to recruit Ning Zhuo, and Zhou Zeshen realized Ning Zhuo had immense potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Following the current trend, he would undoubtedly become a significant figure in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">To recruit a key figure, one must first understand them well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">A friendly sparring match often helps cultivators quickly bond and understand each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Fire Monkeys are only five, Ning Zhuo's control pressure isn't high." "He could cast a detection spell while commanding the Fire Monkeys." "Indeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"He understands my main intention for the sparring!" "As expected of a genius like me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Zhou Zeshen's lips curled slightly, feeling comfortable dealing with someone as smart as Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Many things didn't need to be said to be understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo deliberately slowed the battle pace, while Zhou Zeshen threw out a storage bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The bag landed, its mouth wide open, releasing over a dozen Mechanical Bats—Night Sky Bats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The Night Sky Bats flew through the air towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo patted his belt, releasing a flock of Mechanical Thunder Silence Birds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">These mechanisms were very popular due to their simple control and ease of use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The Thunder Silence Birds collided with the Night Sky Bats in mid-air, initiating the second direct clash between Ning Zhuo and Zhou Zeshen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Thunder Silence Birds attacked straightforwardly, while the Night Sky Bats were elusive, with agile turns and superior evasion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Night Sky Bats, from the Mudflow Sect, were clearly superior in performance to the popular Thunder Silence Birds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo's Thunder Silence Birds outnumbered the Night Sky Bats, but after the clash, the birds quickly dwindled, clearly at a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Ning family members looked serious, some frowning, silently worrying for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"He's holding back." Zhou Zeshen's heart stirred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Earlier, Ning Zhuo controlled five Fire Monkeys with great skill, showing high control proficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">But in this aerial battle, Ning Zhuo's Thunder Silence Birds were almost unoperated, moving straightforwardly, making their attack paths easy to predict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This gave Zhou Zeshen a significant advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Is it because my Ground Drilling Mice retreated in the first clash? So Ning Zhuo is sparing my face by deliberately losing here." "This guy..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Zhou Zeshen gritted his teeth, feeling conflicted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He appreciated Ning Zhuo's consideration for his face, such tacit understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">But he also felt frustrated, rarely experiencing such condescension as a genius.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Though it's a friendly sparring, I've always been serious." "I'm giving my all, but you're holding back..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Though it's kind, it's also a form of humiliation for me." "Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"I want you to take me seriously!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zhou Zeshen shouted in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Spurred by this, he took out a medium-sized mechanism from his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This mechanism resembled a fierce tiger, about two and a half zhang long, five chi tall at the shoulder, with three-inch claws, two-inch teeth, white fur with black stripes, and a golden tiger's gaze, appearing quite formidable.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
