<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The situation took a sharp downturn!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The City Guards of White Paper Immortal City heavily surrounded the Quiet Whispers Pavillion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Pavillion's great array had already been activated; Sun and Ning could not escape into the void, becoming birds in a cage, turtles in a jar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Lady!!!" The City Guards burst into the pavilion, discovered Sang Le Youling's corpse, and couldn't help but cry out mournfully in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Impossible, this is fake."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Lady Sang Le Youling was skilled in divination, how could she perish so easily?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Catch him, he is the murderer, the murderer who killed Lady Sang Le Youling!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Many people found it hard to believe, many were panic-stricken, and many were filled with hatred and anger, vowing to kill Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"I am not the murderer!! I am merely at Foundation Establishment, how could I kill a Golden Core cultivator, and someone like Lady Sang Le Youling?!" Ning Zhuo shouted loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">At this moment, his face was deathly pale, showing expressions of terror and anger. It was partly acting, partly a genuine display of emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Heavens have mercy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He was just about to take out the token, declare his true identity, and state his divination request. He had waited so hard for today's meeting time, never expecting that Sang Le Youling would actually be dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Clearly, she was fine this morning, continuously meeting with the male consorts awaiting promotion. After eating lunch, by the afternoon, it had come to this?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The City Guards naturally wouldn't just stand by and watch because of Ning Zhuo's self-defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">They rushed towards Ning Zhuo one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo took a step back, positioning himself directly beside Sang Le Youling's corpse: "Stop! Whoever approaches me, I will destroy her remains."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Whoever among you wants to provoke me, bear the guilt of desecrating the corpse of a hero of White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The City Guards immediately halted, looking at Ning Zhuo with a mixture of shock and anger, shouting curses at his immense audacity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo tilted his head back, laughed loudly, then his face filled with ferocity, and he spoke menacingly: "One way or another, I'm going to die, if you dare lay hands on me, slander me, then the worst that can happen to me is death, but i will drag you all down with me. I absolutely mean what I say!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The City Guards were stunned, looking at each other, then immediately cursed loudly at Ning Zhuo, but ultimately, they did not advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo, however, did not stop, instead pointing his finger at the crowd: "You bunch of idiots, why aren't you reporting upwards immediately. Sang Le Youling has been killed, the enemy will surely seize this opportunity to launch an offensive. Military intelligence is urgent like fire, if you delay even a step, ultimately leading to troubles both internal and external, the immortal city being breached, every single one of you will be sinners!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">As soon as Ning Zhuo's voice fell, several explosions were heard, flames rose from a corner of the city, and simultaneously, the area outside the city shook, accompanied by the sound of countless ghostly wails and wolf howls. It was evident that the ghost tide had risen again, launching a fierce attack on White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The City Guards' faces changed colour one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo's words had come true too quickly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">And just from the sheer force of it, the intensity of the enemy's attack was unprecedented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"What are you still standing stunned for? I couldn't escape before, do you think I can escape now? Compared to me, White Paper Immortal City is ten thousand times more important!" Ning Zhuo continued to curse angrily, "You bunch of idiots!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The City Guards wavered again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Just then, a figure descended rapidly onto the scene: "Yellow-faced brat, shut up!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The arrival was none other than Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">It turned out that this group of City Guards, upon discovering the fact of Sang Le Youling's death, had already reported it immediately at the first instance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Wen Ruanyu burst into Pavillion of Quiet Whispers, his eyes fixed dead on Sang Le Youling's corpse, the last shred of hope remaining in his heart completely dissipating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">His expression became extremely gloomy, his gaze like sharp knife light, staring deadly at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo placed one hand on Sang Le Youling's neck, immediately snorted coldly: "Lord Wen, I did not kill her!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Outside the city, you saw me. I was brought over by Commander Qing Yan, I am a local."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"But if you ignore all evidence and just determine that I am the murderer, then there is only one possibility - you are the spy! All the City Guards present, you can all bear witness!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Wen Ruanyu's pupils shrank, his aura flared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The City Guards were dumbfounded. Just moments ago Ning Zhuo was cursing them, now he suddenly wanted them to bear witness, acting like a complete ruffian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">But on second thought, hey, there was some truth to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Some City Guards began to secretly size up Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Feeling these hidden gazes, Wen Ruanyu became so angry that killing intent permeated the air: "Lady Sang Le Youling has died, you were the closest person, you should have been interrogated under severe torture, yet now you dare to threaten me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo shook his head, gave a bitter smile: "Lord Wen, I was also forced into this. If I had hesitated or flinched even slightly, I would have become a prisoner."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I am not afraid of death, but I worry that when death approaches, I still haven't grasped my fate in my own hands."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Besides, I am also a victim. Lady Sang Le Youling was truly not killed by me, my conscience is clear!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Lord Wen, I also advise you, don't be foolish."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"If you intend to extract a confession through torture, frame me as the murderer in a short time, seeking a scapegoat to stabilize the morale in the city, this will instead fall right into the enemy's calculations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Because as long as the enemy forces later actively reveal evidence of their actions, you will bear additional guilt, and once the entire Immortal City realizes that a high-ranking official like you was so easily deceived, the army's morale will inevitably suffer an even greater blow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Wen Ruanyu's face was already as black as the bottom of a pot: "Sharp-tongued disciple. I won't make things difficult for you either, put this on yourself. If you really force me to act, the scene won't be so pleasant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">As he spoke, he threw out a Red Jade Sealed Talisman, shooting it towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo snorted coldly, spread his palm, revealing his natal artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">A flash of mirror light, and a massive figure appeared out of thin air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">It was precisely Heavy Armored Blood Ape · Dasheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Yuan Dasheng stood in front of Ning Zhuo, reaching out to catch the talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In an instant, the City Guards gasped in low voices.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"A Golden Core level mechanical puppet!" Wen Ruanyu couldn't help but change expression, his vigilance greatly increased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Pavillion of Quiet Whispers's great array was fully activated, confining the space, making it impossible for Ning Zhuo to escape into the void. But the space inside the pavilion was integrated and not suppressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This point, Ning Zhuo had also just discovered, and immediately released Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">However, very quickly, Yuan Dasheng's Golden Core aura was forcefully suppressed, directly dropping to the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This was White Paper Immortal City, the entire city was under the influence of the city-protecting great array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Little Zhuo, there's no problem with the talisman." Within the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, Sun Lingtong used his Spirit Eye to observe, secretly sending a divine sense transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yuan Dasheng then handed the sealing talisman over to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo glanced at it, put the sealing talisman into his bosom, showing no intention of sealing himself at all, but instead directly cupped his hands: "Many thanks to Lord Wen for bestowing the talisman."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Wen Ruanyu laughed out of extreme anger, finally losing patience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Just as he was about to make a move, he heard a voice from behind: "Stop."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Wen Ruanyu and the City Guard soldiers all changed expression drastically, quickly turning around and bowing to the newcomer: "Paying respects to Lord City Lord!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The White Paper Immortal City Lord's condition was very poor, always in a sealed state, how could she be out now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo was surprised and doubtful, looked up, and suddenly understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He saw the person who spoke was two zhang tall, face completely white, lips ink-black. A head of long hair, twisted from three thousand six hundred fine strands of snow xuan paper, hung down to the waist. The neck and shoulders were delicate bone structures supported by bamboo strips, and paper thin as cicada wings was stacked on the shoulders creating complex wrinkled patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The plain white large skirt was densely covered with runes, and as the hemline dragged, it stirred up waves of cold yin energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">And at the waist, tied with a section of red rope, was most eye-catching. At the end of the red rope hung a small bronze bell, yet it made no sound at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">It was strikingly a magic treasure level paper human puppet!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The paper human puppet emanated a Nascent Soul level aura. Like a white cloud carrying rolling yin energy, she floated into Pavillion of Quiet Whispers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">She didn't even glance at Ning Zhuo, merely fixing her gaze on Sang Le Youling's corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Although her face was expressionless, during her long pause, a thick emotion of sorrow and grief permeated the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Little Le, I didn't expect you would perish during this time of internal and external troubles." The White Paper City Lord's paper avatar spoke softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The entire scene was silent, only the sounds of the ghost tide outside the city, and the sounds of bombing from the renewed turmoil within the city, occasionally reached here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The paper avatar remained silent for a long moment, then finally looked up at Ning Zhuo: "My mood is very bad, I want to kill someone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"I give you three breaths of time to prove you have no connection to Sang Le Youling's death."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"After three breaths, you will accompany Little Le in death."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo was horrified, cold sweat breaking out on his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He wanted to argue, but the paper avatar had already begun counting down: "Three."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"One."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Even Wen Ruanyu's heart jumped; the paper avatar didn't count two, skipping it directly, revealing her impatience and killing intent without reservation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Little Zhuo, I'll cover the rear, you go first!" Sun Lingtong's hair stood on end, about to rush out of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo's life hung by a thread, heart pounding with fear, he suddenly extended his palm: "I can prove it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In that short moment, his head was already covered in cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo stared deadly at the White Paper avatar: "We only need to cut open Lady Sang Le Youling's abdomen to prove my innocence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Wen Ruanyu immediately shouted angrily: "Audacious! You still intend to desecrate Lady Sang Le Youling's corpse!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The City Guards also became agitated, but constrained by the presence of the City Lord's avatar, they dared not speak out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The White Paper avatar, however, fell into contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Suddenly, she extended a finger, and abruptly swiped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Spiritual Energy like a knife directly cut open Sang Le Youling's belly, and also cut open the stomach along the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Seeing the large amount of residual spirit food in the stomach, Ning Zhuo's guarded heartstring relaxed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He cupped his hands and said: "Lord City Lord, Lady Sang Le Youling treated herself by consuming Underworld Meals. And these Underworld Meals are difficult to digest, and one cannot use spiritual energy to aid digestion, otherwise eating them would be pointless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"After lunch, according to the arrangement, I was the first male consort to have an audience with Lady Sang Le Youling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"If I had killed Sang Le Youling, it must have been not long ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"But the undigested spirit food in Sang Le Youling's abdomen proves that she died earlier, not long after finishing the Underworld Meal, she was attacked and killed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Everyone fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Everyone's gaze turned towards Sang Le Youling's corpse, then one by one, turned towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sun Lingtong was delighted: "Little Zhuo, that makes sense!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Wen Ruanyu frowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo let out a turbid breath: "I had no time to commit the crime, because at that time, I was in the dining hall of Cang Yang Biefu, consuming Underworld Meal on the spot. Many people witnessed this scene!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The paper avatar snorted coldly, killing intent still lingering: "The deduction is not bad. However, you still cannot completely clear your suspicion. Who exactly are you?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
