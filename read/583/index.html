<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Dining Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">An emaciated old man glared at Ning Zhuo, snapping, “You’re the pockmarked brat who insisted I personally cook your meal?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo quickly cupped his hands respectfully, “Thank you for your help, senior.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Hmph,” the Spirit Chef Elder snorted arrogantly. Though his cultivation had stalled at the late Foundation Establishment stage throughout his life, his culinary skills as a spiritual chef were undeniably outstanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo sat in front of the chef, attracting curious, envious, wary, and jealous gazes from many male consorts in the dining hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Spirit Chef Elder took out a massive bronze cauldron, pouring in copious amounts of water from the Underworld Flood Dragon River. Channeling ghostly Netherfire with both hands, he heated the bronze vessel. Soon, the cauldron vibrated and boiled intensely, emitting steam that carried eerie sounds of ghostly wails and snake hisses, deeply unsettling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The chef then retrieved a piece of mystical tortoise shell, grinding it with a swift movement of his palms into bluish-gray powder. Adding this powder into the boiling water, he simmered the mixture briefly before dumping numerous other ingredients into the cauldron. Soon after, he ceased the Netherfire, completing the spiritual meal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Within the cauldron now lay a Underworld Styx Broth, its surface deep and dark like inked jade. Upon closer inspection, twisted remnants of souls seemed to wriggle within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo scooped a spoonful from the huge bronze cauldron and brought it to his lips. The moment the broth entered his mouth, it felt like swallowing rusted bronze shards, gritty and pungent. He barely managed to choke it down, a metallic tang lingering strongly in his throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">By the time he finished the entire cauldron of broth, Ning Zhuo’s lips and tongue had turned a bronze hue. Yet, his soul’s foundation experienced a tremendous surge. After several days of regularly consuming spiritual meals, his soul foundation had grown to three hundred times that of an ordinary person!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Spirit Chef Elder scrutinized Ning Zhuo, somewhat impressed yet also disgruntled, “Fine, at least you managed to finish everything, boy. But devouring it so quickly doesn’t give me any satisfaction - do you mean to suggest my cooking was actually delicious?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">His temper was indeed eccentric; pleased that Ning Zhuo finished the food, yet annoyed at the lack of torment from his dishes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Now watch closely: my second dish!” The Spirit Chef Elder declared, resuming his preparations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He brought forth a large cauldron, rapidly invoking lightning clouds and swirling purple energies within it. Chanting incantations, he threw in Mystic Bird Tear Crystals, swiftly slicing them into pieces with his palm and adding them to the cauldron. Using the martial arts technique Dragon Claw Hands, he continually struck the cauldron, tossing in more ingredients as he went.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Some ingredients melted instantly, while others stubbornly bobbed within the cauldron. Suddenly, with a sharp shout, thunder boomed inside, black smoke billowed upwards, forming dense clouds under the ceiling beams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">A scorched smell filled the hall, causing Ning Zhuo and others to suspect the dish had failed miserably. But the chef confidently swept away the smoke with a wave, proudly retrieving several chunks of blackened pastry from the cauldron bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">It was the “Three Lives Toothbreaker Cake.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“This is far too hard!” Ning Zhuo groaned after attempting to bite down, his jaws aching severely. He turned helplessly toward the chef.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Arms folded, the chef sneered in amusement, “Can’t even chew this? Kid, and you had the audacity to choose my dishes?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Refusing to be defeated, Ning Zhuo summoned no spells but activated his demonic blood vein technique, forming dense blood sinews around his jaw muscles, greatly amplifying his biting strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Finally managing to break off a small piece, it felt as tough as black iron. Worse still, it tasted rancid and sour, reminiscent of rotten lotus pods, nearly making Ning Zhuo vomit. Each swallow felt like grinding stones in his throat, an unprecedented test for his stomach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Such spiritual food, if eased with spiritual energy, would significantly diminish its effectiveness. Thus, Ning Zhuo clenched his stomach, enduring the pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The chef watched smugly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Not good; if I continue, my stomach might rebel,” Ning Zhuo thought urgently. With quick wit, he activated his Demonic Blood Vein Technique, enlarging his stomach by thirty percent and coating it in tough sinew layers. His digestive power surged exponentially.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">At last, under these extreme circumstances, Ning Zhuo gradually managed to digest the stubborn cakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The bloating pain in his stomach gradually subsided.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo ate slowly, accommodating his digestion, ultimately managing not to embarrass himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Seeing that Ning Zhuo had finished the entire Three-Life Broken Tooth Pastry, the Spirit Chef Elder’s severe expression eased slightly, acknowledging, “You indeed qualify to savor my exquisite culinary creations.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Hearing “exquisite culinary creations,” Ning Zhuo couldn’t help but twitch at the corner of his eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He had finally managed to consume five spiritual dishes, his belly swollen to the point where he could only sit half-reclined, enduring the surrounding gazes that were either envious or puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Those envious admired Ning Zhuo’s willingness to expend his points for large quantities of Underworld Meals, significantly enhancing his soul foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The puzzled ones wondered why he would waste points on soul-enhancing foods instead of pills to boost Yang energy, thereby achieving better rankings - a positive cycle most sought after. Why would Jiao Ma, who had merely “luckily” ranked forty-seventh, squander and slack off?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“My soul foundation is already three hundred and twenty times that of an ordinary person,” Ning Zhuo sighed sincerely. “It increased so much just from a single meal! Truly awful to taste, yet undeniably effective.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Though Ning Zhuo hadn’t traveled extensively, his experiences had been diverse, greatly enriching his perception. At this moment, he profoundly understood how rare and valuable this opportunity for soul cultivation was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Spiritual chefs of the old man’s caliber weren’t individuals he could casually encounter. Nor was there another place like White Paper Immortal City, providing such abundant fresh ingredients in a uniquely favorable environment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">All these conditions combined created this seemingly ordinary but incredibly rare chance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Perfect for making up my shortcomings!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo had suffered greatly in this area, particularly during the battle against the Twin Ghosts, vividly realizing how dangerously vulnerable his soul had been.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Therefore, he was highly motivated to rectify this glaring weakness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“I’m just at the Foundation Establishment stage, not yet at Golden Core. Low cultivation has its advantages - it allows me to easily strengthen areas my main techniques neglect through supplementary arts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">When his cultivation rose, such as reaching Golden Core, consuming these Underworld Meals would yield drastically reduced benefits. The early stages of cultivation were precisely the optimal period for foundation building, an opportunity he must not miss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“Jiao Ma, you’ve only been here briefly, yet you’re already ranked. How did you achieve that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Could you share some insights?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“You’re spending your hard-earned points on Underworld Meals; aren’t you worried you’ll drop off the rankings?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Seeing Ning Zhuo reclining, some male concubines approached him in small groups, mingling envy and reluctance as they sought his advice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Patting his bloated stomach lazily and with a touch of smugness, Ning Zhuo responded, “I primarily cultivate the Three Furnace True Yang Scripture, along with a secret divine medicine from Yang Weida. Surpassing most of you is easy, naturally, I’m not worried.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Yet, he shamelessly omitted the true hero, the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Their ears perked up immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Everyone knew about the Three Furnace True Yang Scripture since Ning Zhuo had made the rankings. But what was this divine medicine from Yang Weida?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Exchanging excited glances, they realized Ning Zhuo had inadvertently leaked valuable information. Indeed, he was too inexperienced!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Everyone already had primary cultivation methods, many switching to techniques like Soul Fragrance Charm or Concealed Ghost Embryo Technique. None would adopt the Three Furnace True Yang Scripture. However, Yang Weida’s pills could be universally consumed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Alchemy was foremost among cultivation arts, making such skills incredibly convenient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Yang Weida’s ranking, being in the thirties, further proved his medicine’s effectiveness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Immediately, several men abandoned Ning Zhuo without so much as a farewell, rushing off to find Yang Weida.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Without doubt, these men headed straight for the Yang Enhancement Court, driven by ambition and concern for their futures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo was equally ambitious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Once he digested most of his spiritual food, regaining some mobility, he returned to First-Class Room No.1, resuming his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Male concubines from Hidden Yang Manor, upon promotion to the Three Courts, would meet privately with Sang Le Youling, who would perform divinations to ensure they weren’t spies before admitting them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">At that time, Ning Zhuo would naturally meet the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, present his token, and secure the divination opportunity he sought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">For now, patience was required.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had just survived an assassination attempt. The entire city of White Paper was now on edge, where even the rustling leaves set hearts racing. If Ning Zhuo revealed his true identity under such tense circumstances, it would surely invite dangerous misunderstandings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Moreover, he absolutely couldn’t reveal the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">This treasure was precisely what the Lord of White Paper City desperately needed, aligning perfectly with her cultivation path. Though she was known for her righteousness, the city was deeply compromised, riddled with hidden dangers. Placing his life in someone else’s hands was far too risky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Even if the City Lord herself bore no malice and strictly adhered to righteous principles, internal infiltration by their enemies had turned the city into a leaking sieve. If Ning Zhuo openly demonstrated significant value, he would immediately become a target for assassination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Look at Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer - highly influential and trusted by the City Lord herself, not to mention skilled in divination - yet reduced to this precarious state. This alone highlighted how severe the crisis truly was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo continued diligently cultivating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He still possessed some National Power Bricks, but at this stage of Wondrous Visions Sowing Talismans cultivation, progress hinged not on accumulating resources, but rather on his comprehension of cultivation techniques themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Cultivating three techniques simultaneously presented Ning Zhuo with a pleasant dilemma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He had fully mastered the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication, and his progress in the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique was swift, given his deep insights into the Five Elements. However, his cultivation in the Demonic Blood Vein Technique lagged significantly behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Thus, Ning Zhuo allocated most of his focus to understanding the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, spending only two-tenths of that effort on the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique. Yet, even with limited time, the latter’s progress still vastly outpaced the former.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Besides practicing techniques, Ning Zhuo also leveraged the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat to temper his physical body. Physical improvements brought comprehensive benefits - just considering digestion alone, his enhanced physique greatly boosted his ability to absorb spiritual meals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Lastly came the cultivation of his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“This area has always been my weakest link. As long as I continue improving it to avoid being targeted, I’ll be satisfied,” Ning Zhuo reasoned modestly, oblivious to the fact that his standards were set absurdly high by comparing himself against the legendary Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Ghost Tide continued to escalate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Numerous Lantern Ghosts emerged, spewing dark flames onto the city walls, drawing considerable attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer suddenly dispatched a flying message, swiftly arriving in the hands of the City Defense Commander, Tie Guzheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">After swiftly scanning the message with his divine sense, Tie Guzheng quickly mobilized a group of defenders to the western wall, equipping them specifically with paper daggers. He commanded them to hold firm and prepare to intercept enemy ropes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sure enough, beneath the western walls, a group of Hanging Ghosts secretly gathered, using dark flames as cover while releasing ropes to scale the walls rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Yet, the defenders were ready. As soon as the ropes were secured, paper daggers swiftly sliced through them, causing the Hanging Ghosts to plummet to their deaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Tie Guzheng, upon receiving news of this victory, exhaled deeply, silently praising Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer’s unwavering reliability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Within the Hidden Yang Manor, Ning Zhuo’s soul strength quietly climbed to four hundred and fifty times that of an ordinary cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Outside, ghosts surged relentlessly, battering White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Inside the city, in a hidden corner, a Ghost Gate was covertly established, aiming to coordinate an inside-out attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Unexpectedly, Wen Ruanyu swiftly led a squad of defenders straight to the location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The Ghost Gate had barely spat out some Ghost Soldiers when it was caught red-handed and instantly destroyed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Wen Ruanyu sighed in relief, appreciating Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer’s foresight. Had these hidden Ghost Soldiers succeeded, the consequences would have been dire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sounds of chaos filtered into Hidden Yang Manor, causing the male consorts to anxiously whisper among themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">On the public rankings, Ning Zhuo remained in the forties, silently consuming multiple servings of Underworld Meals under the watchful eye of the elderly Spirit Chef.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">His soul strength had surpassed five hundred, now reaching nearly six hundred ninety times that of a normal cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Meanwhile, enormous Ghost Mothers appeared amidst the Ghost Tide, continuously birthing countless lesser ghosts, rapidly bolstering enemy numbers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Attack!” Prepared by another timely warning from Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, Tie Guzheng led elite warriors teleporting directly into the heart of the Ghost Tide, swiftly slaying the Ghost Mothers before quickly retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Though they lost over a dozen skilled warriors and Tie Guzheng suffered minor injuries, the crisis was decisively averted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo’s soul strength skyrocketed to eight hundred and thirty-eight times that of an ordinary cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Finally, his opportunity had arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">A select group of exceptional male consorts would soon be individually summoned by Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer for divination. Those who passed would successfully advance into the esteemed Third Courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
