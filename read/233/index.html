<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 233: The Ferocious Might of the Serpent Scythe</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Such a treasure, such a treasure!" Zheng Danlian laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Despite his initial high expectations, he found that he had still greatly underestimated the combat power of the Mechanical Black Serpent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Come back," Zheng Danlian commanded in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">But the next moment, his expression changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Mechanical Black Serpent did not respond immediately; it took a full three breaths before it swam back under Zheng Danlian's control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The other Golden Core cultivators did not pursue it immediatelyâ€”they were all stunned by the power of the Mechanical Black Serpent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The true disciple of the Great Purity Palace clutched his severed arm, still shaken: "This is definitely not an ordinary Night Rain Demon Weapon!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The true disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion also stared intently at the Mechanical Black Serpent, his heart trembling: "I didn't expect that within Fire Persimmon Immortal City, a small Zhou family could control such a sharp mechanical weapon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Hahaha, I'm back!" Zheng Shuangjun returned to the family territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The family territory had already activated a massive defensive formation, fully operational.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Zheng Shuangjun, fighting within the formation, would have a tremendous geographical advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Uh!" Zheng Shuangjun's laughter abruptly stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He stared wide-eyed at his own hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Demonic Dao Scripture he was holding quickly disintegrated, like paper burning into flying ashes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Soon, Zheng Shuangjun's hands were empty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"W-what's going on?!" Zheng Shuangjun panicked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Hand over the scripture!" Luo Shang, who hadn't seen this scene, commanded the ghost generals to attack again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zheng Shuangjun hurriedly shouted, "Wait, there's something wrong with this scripture!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"There's nothing wrong, a scripture is a scripture!" The true disciple of the Great Purity Palace sneered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He had personally felt the profound meaning of the scripture entering his mind, so he was very certain that this was indeed the scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Even though Zheng Shuangjun had retreated into the family formation, the disciples of the Great Purity Palace were still frantically attacking the formation's light shield, trying to reclaim the Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"These heretical outsiders dare to continue attacking our family formation!" Seeing his family territory being affected, Zheng Danlian snorted coldly and rushed over at full speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Mechanical Black Serpent followed closely by his side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zheng Danlian soon faced the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He reached out, and the Mechanical Black Serpent leapt up, transforming mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">By the time it landed in Zheng Danlian's hand, it had already become a long-handled scythe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The scythe was entirely pitch black, without a trace of any other color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Its aura was extremely restrained, so much so that it almost seemed like an ordinary object.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Zheng Danlian held the scythe and slashed fiercely at the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The true disciple stood still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In an instant, he seemed to be in the midst of night rain, filled with desolation, sorrow, pain, and despair!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">His eyes lost focus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He was cut into countless pieces, with blood and mana gushing out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">This was just a single slash from the scythe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">All the Golden Core cultivators present, including those from the three-family alliance, gasped in shock, genuinely feeling that the scythe's power was beyond belief!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zheng Danlian himself was also stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The next moment, he loosened his grip, and the scythe transformed back into the Mechanical Black Serpent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The serpent swiftly moved, crushing the fragmented flesh of the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace, then opened its mouth and swallowed the Golden Core of the true disciple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zheng Danlian felt a deep chill in his heart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">This was because the Mechanical Black Serpent's fierce action was not under his control; it acted on its own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"This... this demonic weapon is still unruly and bloodthirsty. Our previous refining plan has failed!" Everyone was horrified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The battlefield suddenly fell into a dead silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">All along, although the Golden Core cultivators had been fighting, they had been relatively restrained, not wantonly slaughtering civilians or destroying cities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This was because they all knew that Meng Kui, the Nascent Soul-level city lord, was watching from the mountain peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">No one expected that the Black Scythe would directly kill a Golden Core cultivator so decisively and cleanly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">All the Golden Core cultivators present, including Zhu Xuanji and Zheng Danlian, felt a chill down their spines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">They thought to themselves, if they were in the shoes of the Shadow Demon Cultivator from the Great Purity Palace, could they withstand the ferocity of this demonic scythe?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">No one had that confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The things from the Night Rain Dynasty were vastly different from the current principles of cultivation, making them difficult to defend against.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Seeing Zheng Danlian holding the black scythe, everyone's fighting spirit was extinguished as if doused by extreme cold and snow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The first to retreat was the Shadow Demon Cultivator from the Purple Dawn Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">As for Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu, they had already left the battlefield midway through the chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Don't use this demonic weapon anymore," Zhu Xuanji left a word and chased after the Shadow Demon Cultivator from the Purple Dawn Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zheng Danlian came to his senses, holding the long-handled black scythe, and shouted, "I killed the Shadow Demon Cultivator! Someone, collect his corpse. This is my Zheng family's contribution to Fire Persimmon Immortal City!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">However, the next moment, a ghost general appeared beside the corpse of the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The ghost general clapped and laughed, "It's over, it's over, this person is a true disciple of the Great Purity Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"You're lying!" The faces of the two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family instantly changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The other Golden Core cultivators also changed their expressions, looking towards the corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Zheng Shuangjun realized something was wrong and hurried to the corpse, trying to collect the body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">But at this moment, another ghost general appeared, blocking Zheng Shuangjun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Just as they were about to fight, Zheng Danlian swung the black scythe in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In an instant, a Golden Core-level and a Foundation Establishment-level ghost general were both cut into countless pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">But it was already too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Luo Shang's voice came again, "Zheng family of Fire Persimmon City, how do you plan to explain this to the Great Purity Palace? Hahaha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">His laughter was filled with schadenfreude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">On the other side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Zhu Xuanji, you can't catch up with me, give up," the true disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion said as he left the Immortal City, finally unleashing his full power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He moved like purple lightning, his speed reaching its limit, quickly disappearing into the horizon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Purple Dawn Pavilion!" Zhu Xuanji recognized his background and realized that the other party indeed had a strong speed advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After some thought, he turned back to the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">There were more pressing matters to attend to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Not long after.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">In the Zheng family's council hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Zhu Xuanji and the Golden Core cultivators from the three families all had solemn expressions, and the atmosphere in the hall was extremely oppressive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">After discussing the black scythe and the unfortunate true disciple of the Great Purity Palace, they couldn't come up with a reliable solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The Demonic Dao Scripture, which they had high hopes for, was only comprehended by Zheng Shuangjun to the fifth level of the Qi Refining Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">After the meeting, Zhu Xuanji concealed his true appearance and aura, walking alone on the street.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"The situation has escalated," he frowned deeply and sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The incident of killing the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace in the chaos had put the Zheng family in a dire situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Should he protect the Zheng family?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Could he protect them?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">These were the questions Zhu Xuanji had to consider and carefully weigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">If he didn't protect them, the three-family alliance he had painstakingly built would immediately fall apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But if he protected them, he would have to face accountability and the Great Purity Palace, a super sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This was terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This put Zhu Xuanji in a dilemma!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"How did things develop to this point?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"This Night Rain demonic weapon is far more sinister than I imagined. How did the Zheng family obtain it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Zhu Xuanji knew that the Zheng family had obtained this opportunity from the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">But he had never delved into the specifics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Today's battle made Zhu Xuanji deeply understand the ferocity of this demonic weapon!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">This completely disrupted Zhu Xuanji's original plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"The good news is that the Shadow Demon Cultivator has appeared."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"The bad news is that more than one Shadow Demon Cultivator appeared, and I didn't catch a single one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Strange..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">A strange feeling lingered in Zhu Xuanji's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">But no matter how much he thought about it, he couldn't figure out what was strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">When he came back to his senses and returned to reality, Zhu Xuanji unexpectedly found himself in front of Ning Zhuo's residence again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"In any case, with the Demonic Dao Scripture falling into the hands of the Shadow Demon Cultivator, the danger on Ning Zhuo's side has greatly decreased..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Zhu Xuanji suddenly fell into a strange silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He stood quietly outside the courtyard gate, staring at the house in front of him for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He entered the house and saw Ning Zhuo again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Zhu Xuanji smiled, with a hint of golden light in his eyes: "Ning Zhuo, I used you as bait before, making you bear a lot of risks. This time, I will reward you with a cultivation technique to thank you for your cooperation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo pretended to be overjoyed, his eyes shining, and eagerly asked, "Lord Zhu, what technique is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly, "Demonic Blood Vein Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Demonic Blood Vein Technique?" Ning Zhuo chewed on the words, as if hearing them for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Zhu Xuanji didn't notice any flaws and continued, "Before you start cultivating, let me check your foundation to see if you are suitable for this technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Come, extend your hand, and let me examine your three dantians to comprehensively assess your aptitude."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo's heart skipped a beat, but he had no choice but to brace himself and say, "Thank you, Lord Zhu!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
