<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Such a treasure, such a treasure!" Zheng Danlian laughed heartily.<br/>
<br/>
Despite his initial high expectations, he found that he had still greatly underestimated the combat power of the Mechanical Black Serpent.<br/>
<br/>
"Come back," Zheng Danlian commanded in secret.<br/>
<br/>
But the next moment, his expression changed slightly.<br/>
<br/>
The Mechanical Black Serpent did not respond immediately; it took a full three breaths before it swam back under Zheng Danlian's control.<br/>
<br/>
The other Golden Core cultivators did not pursue it immediately—they were all stunned by the power of the Mechanical Black Serpent.<br/>
<br/>
The true disciple of the Great Purity Palace clutched his severed arm, still shaken: "This is definitely not an ordinary Night Rain Demon Weapon!"<br/>
<br/>
The true disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion also stared intently at the Mechanical Black Serpent, his heart trembling: "I didn't expect that within Fire Persimmon Immortal City, a small Zhou family could control such a sharp mechanical weapon."<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha, I'm back!" Zheng Shuangjun returned to the family territory.<br/>
<br/>
The family territory had already activated a massive defensive formation, fully operational.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun, fighting within the formation, would have a tremendous geographical advantage.<br/>
<br/>
"Uh!" Zheng Shuangjun's laughter abruptly stopped.<br/>
<br/>
He stared wide-eyed at his own hands.<br/>
<br/>
The Demonic Dao Scripture he was holding quickly disintegrated, like paper burning into flying ashes.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, Zheng Shuangjun's hands were empty.<br/>
<br/>
"W-what's going on?!" Zheng Shuangjun panicked.<br/>
<br/>
"Hand over the scripture!" Luo Shang, who hadn't seen this scene, commanded the ghost generals to attack again.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun hurriedly shouted, "Wait, there's something wrong with this scripture!"<br/>
<br/>
"There's nothing wrong, a scripture is a scripture!" The true disciple of the Great Purity Palace sneered.<br/>
<br/>
He had personally felt the profound meaning of the scripture entering his mind, so he was very certain that this was indeed the scripture.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Zheng Shuangjun had retreated into the family formation, the disciples of the Great Purity Palace were still frantically attacking the formation's light shield, trying to reclaim the Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
"These heretical outsiders dare to continue attacking our family formation!" Seeing his family territory being affected, Zheng Danlian snorted coldly and rushed over at full speed.<br/>
<br/>
The Mechanical Black Serpent followed closely by his side.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian soon faced the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace.<br/>
<br/>
He reached out, and the Mechanical Black Serpent leapt up, transforming mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
By the time it landed in Zheng Danlian's hand, it had already become a long-handled scythe.<br/>
<br/>
The scythe was entirely pitch black, without a trace of any other color.<br/>
<br/>
Its aura was extremely restrained, so much so that it almost seemed like an ordinary object.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian held the scythe and slashed fiercely at the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The true disciple stood still.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, he seemed to be in the midst of night rain, filled with desolation, sorrow, pain, and despair!<br/>
<br/>
His eyes lost focus.<br/>
<br/>
He was cut into countless pieces, with blood and mana gushing out.<br/>
<br/>
This was just a single slash from the scythe.<br/>
<br/>
All the Golden Core cultivators present, including those from the three-family alliance, gasped in shock, genuinely feeling that the scythe's power was beyond belief!<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian himself was also stunned.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he loosened his grip, and the scythe transformed back into the Mechanical Black Serpent.<br/>
<br/>
The serpent swiftly moved, crushing the fragmented flesh of the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace, then opened its mouth and swallowed the Golden Core of the true disciple.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian felt a deep chill in his heart!<br/>
<br/>
This was because the Mechanical Black Serpent's fierce action was not under his control; it acted on its own.<br/>
<br/>
"This... this demonic weapon is still unruly and bloodthirsty. Our previous refining plan has failed!" Everyone was horrified.<br/>
<br/>
The battlefield suddenly fell into a dead silence.<br/>
<br/>
All along, although the Golden Core cultivators had been fighting, they had been relatively restrained, not wantonly slaughtering civilians or destroying cities.<br/>
<br/>
This was because they all knew that Meng Kui, the Nascent Soul-level city lord, was watching from the mountain peak.<br/>
<br/>
No one expected that the Black Scythe would directly kill a Golden Core cultivator so decisively and cleanly!<br/>
<br/>
All the Golden Core cultivators present, including Zhu Xuanji and Zheng Danlian, felt a chill down their spines.<br/>
<br/>
They thought to themselves, if they were in the shoes of the Shadow Demon Cultivator from the Great Purity Palace, could they withstand the ferocity of this demonic scythe?<br/>
<br/>
No one had that confidence.<br/>
<br/>
The things from the Night Rain Dynasty were vastly different from the current principles of cultivation, making them difficult to defend against.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Zheng Danlian holding the black scythe, everyone's fighting spirit was extinguished as if doused by extreme cold and snow.<br/>
<br/>
The first to retreat was the Shadow Demon Cultivator from the Purple Dawn Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
As for Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu, they had already left the battlefield midway through the chaos.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't use this demonic weapon anymore," Zhu Xuanji left a word and chased after the Shadow Demon Cultivator from the Purple Dawn Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian came to his senses, holding the long-handled black scythe, and shouted, "I killed the Shadow Demon Cultivator! Someone, collect his corpse. This is my Zheng family's contribution to Fire Persimmon Immortal City!"<br/>
<br/>
However, the next moment, a ghost general appeared beside the corpse of the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The ghost general clapped and laughed, "It's over, it's over, this person is a true disciple of the Great Purity Palace!"<br/>
<br/>
"You're lying!" The faces of the two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family instantly changed.<br/>
<br/>
The other Golden Core cultivators also changed their expressions, looking towards the corpse.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun realized something was wrong and hurried to the corpse, trying to collect the body.<br/>
<br/>
But at this moment, another ghost general appeared, blocking Zheng Shuangjun.<br/>
<br/>
Just as they were about to fight, Zheng Danlian swung the black scythe in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, a Golden Core-level and a Foundation Establishment-level ghost general were both cut into countless pieces.<br/>
<br/>
But it was already too late.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang's voice came again, "Zheng family of Fire Persimmon City, how do you plan to explain this to the Great Purity Palace? Hahaha."<br/>
<br/>
His laughter was filled with schadenfreude.<br/>
<br/>
On the other side.<br/>
<br/>
"Zhu Xuanji, you can't catch up with me, give up," the true disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion said as he left the Immortal City, finally unleashing his full power.<br/>
<br/>
He moved like purple lightning, his speed reaching its limit, quickly disappearing into the horizon.<br/>
<br/>
"Purple Dawn Pavilion!" Zhu Xuanji recognized his background and realized that the other party indeed had a strong speed advantage.<br/>
<br/>
After some thought, he turned back to the city.<br/>
<br/>
There were more pressing matters to attend to.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zheng family's council hall.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and the Golden Core cultivators from the three families all had solemn expressions, and the atmosphere in the hall was extremely oppressive.<br/>
<br/>
After discussing the black scythe and the unfortunate true disciple of the Great Purity Palace, they couldn't come up with a reliable solution.<br/>
<br/>
The Demonic Dao Scripture, which they had high hopes for, was only comprehended by Zheng Shuangjun to the fifth level of the Qi Refining Stage.<br/>
<br/>
After the meeting, Zhu Xuanji concealed his true appearance and aura, walking alone on the street.<br/>
<br/>
"The situation has escalated," he frowned deeply and sighed.<br/>
<br/>
The incident of killing the true disciple of the Great Purity Palace in the chaos had put the Zheng family in a dire situation.<br/>
<br/>
Should he protect the Zheng family?<br/>
<br/>
Could he protect them?<br/>
<br/>
These were the questions Zhu Xuanji had to consider and carefully weigh.<br/>
<br/>
If he didn't protect them, the three-family alliance he had painstakingly built would immediately fall apart.<br/>
<br/>
But if he protected them, he would have to face accountability and the Great Purity Palace, a super sect.<br/>
<br/>
This was terrifying.<br/>
<br/>
This put Zhu Xuanji in a dilemma!<br/>
<br/>
"How did things develop to this point?"<br/>
<br/>
"This Night Rain demonic weapon is far more sinister than I imagined. How did the Zheng family obtain it?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji knew that the Zheng family had obtained this opportunity from the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
But he had never delved into the specifics.<br/>
<br/>
Today's battle made Zhu Xuanji deeply understand the ferocity of this demonic weapon!<br/>
<br/>
This completely disrupted Zhu Xuanji's original plan.<br/>
<br/>
"The good news is that the Shadow Demon Cultivator has appeared."<br/>
<br/>
"The bad news is that more than one Shadow Demon Cultivator appeared, and I didn't catch a single one."<br/>
<br/>
"Strange..."<br/>
<br/>
A strange feeling lingered in Zhu Xuanji's heart.<br/>
<br/>
But no matter how much he thought about it, he couldn't figure out what was strange.<br/>
<br/>
When he came back to his senses and returned to reality, Zhu Xuanji unexpectedly found himself in front of Ning Zhuo's residence again.<br/>
<br/>
"In any case, with the Demonic Dao Scripture falling into the hands of the Shadow Demon Cultivator, the danger on Ning Zhuo's side has greatly decreased..."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji suddenly fell into a strange silence.<br/>
<br/>
He stood quietly outside the courtyard gate, staring at the house in front of him for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
He entered the house and saw Ning Zhuo again.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji smiled, with a hint of golden light in his eyes: "Ning Zhuo, I used you as bait before, making you bear a lot of risks. This time, I will reward you with a cultivation technique to thank you for your cooperation."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pretended to be overjoyed, his eyes shining, and eagerly asked, "Lord Zhu, what technique is it?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly, "Demonic Blood Vein Technique."<br/>
<br/>
"Demonic Blood Vein Technique?" Ning Zhuo chewed on the words, as if hearing them for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji didn't notice any flaws and continued, "Before you start cultivating, let me check your foundation to see if you are suitable for this technique."<br/>
<br/>
"Come, extend your hand, and let me examine your three dantians to comprehensively assess your aptitude."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's heart skipped a beat, but he had no choice but to brace himself and say, "Thank you, Lord Zhu!"</div>
