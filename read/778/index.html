<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Grandmother: "Ah Xiang, do you know the biggest difference between my Zhu family and other powers?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Childhood Zhu Fenxiang: "I know, Grandma. Other families and sects all have a main cultivation method, but our family majors in a technique!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Grandmother nodded: "Correct, good child, you are right. The foundation of our Zhu family lies not in a cultivation method, but in a technique - the Divine Summoning Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"To support a family in becoming a super power, the Divine Summoning Art is naturally profound and extensive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"To master this technique is both easy and difficult. Succeeding once counts for nothing, and failing countless times does not matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Child, you possess the talent of 'Incense Ascending to Heaven.' Mastering this technique will be much easier for you than for your peers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"But you must be mentally prepared. You need to know: to truly invite a significant God, your talent only adds a few bargaining chips to your favor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Grandmother’s cultivation of Zhu Fenxiang was extremely strict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In Zhu Fenxiang's childhood memories, there were only the cold, hard bluestone slabs beneath her kneeling knees; the long, complex, and tongue-twisting prayers; and the deep, cold, heavy darkness after her divine sense was exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">With the elders' careful cultivation, the junior's obedient striving, and the boost from her innate talent, Zhu Fenxiang displayed amazing cultivation efficiency from a young age, repeatedly achieving stunning results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This was a golden age of cultivation, where Gods were countless!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">At first, it was only demigods and false gods, then minor gods with official positions, and then, Zhu Fenxiang set her sights on the Great Gods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Even among Great Gods, there was a hierarchy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Several years ago, in preparation for this Myriad Manifestations Sect Flying Cloud Assembly, Zhu Fenxiang began seeking the aid of a Great God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">After careful screening and a stroke of luck, she obtained a statue related to Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">It was like obtaining a supreme treasure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zhu Fenxiang went into seclusion for bitter cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The stone chamber cut off the noise and temptations of the outside world. She locked herself within, stubbornly kowtowing to the statue, constantly offering up her savings, and sincerely chanting prayers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Amidst the curling smoke of incense, time passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The statue showed no reaction, lasting for several months.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zhu Fenxiang felt like a stubborn stone abandoned in a corner. She curled up in pain during the dead of night, questioning whether her persistence was foolish. Sometimes, despair would drown her like a tide, leaving her lost and unsure of the path ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Until one day, the statue emitted a warm, jade-like yellow light, pulling Zhu Fenxiang's soul into a Divine Domain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The body of the Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard was colossal, resembling a mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He sat high upon a divine throne, eyes closed, appearing to sleep, yet also seeming to look down upon Zhu Fenxiang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zhu Fenxiang knelt at His feet, her soul trembling slightly due to excitement and long-term overdraft from prayer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">She offered a devout prayer, knowing this was likely her only chance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">After the prayer, she curled up her soul body, listening with extreme nervousness, waiting for the True Lord's "judgment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard kept His eyes closed, giving no response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Not long after, Zhu Fenxiang's soul returned to her body. She wept with joy: "I succeeded! I succeeded in the Divine Summoning Art this time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"The Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard really responded to me!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Success the first time, establishing a connection between the cultivator and the God, was the most critical step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">With the first time, there would be a second and a third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">After dozens of times, Zhu Fenxiang, having almost exhausted her family assets, had her soul pulled into the Divine Domain once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">She knelt on the ground, praying sincerely once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The eyelids of the Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard moved slightly. He barely opened a slit, looked at the ant-like Zhu Fenxiang at His feet, and then slowly, cherishing his words like gold, spat out a single character: "Granted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">From then on, Zhu Fenxiang could summon the Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard to aid her in battle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">At this very moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">On the altar, Zhu Fenxiang’s heart was filled with a sense of disparity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The scenes from her memory formed a sharp contrast with the situation before her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard, always high and mighty, was now using an unprecedentedly kind expression and an admiring tone to actively invite a peer cultivator to let Him serve as his Guardian God!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The young man reacted with god-like speed, agreeing on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"I don't agree!" Zhu Fenxiang almost shouted out loud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">How could inviting a Great God be so casual?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But ultimately, she dared not shout the true voice of her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">She then heard the statue laugh loudly: "Hahaha, good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">But Ning Zhuo continued: "But how do I summon the God? I have never cultivated the Divine Summoning Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The True Lord felt genuinely happy about Ning Zhuo's straightforwardness. He directly ordered Zhu Fenxiang: "Zhu Fenxiang, you have done well in this matter. Considering your sincerity, teach Ning Zhuo now and pass on the Divine Summoning Art to him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhu Fenxiang: "Ah?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">True Lord: "Act quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zhu Fenxiang fell into hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The True Lord said to Ning Zhuo: "The Divine Summoning Art is very easy to cultivate. Ning Zhuo, you can master it right here on the spot. Once mastered, with just a thought, you can establish contact with this God."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo nodded: "I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He looked at Zhu Fenxiang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The statue also looked at Zhu Fenxiang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhu Fenxiang dared not hesitate any longer. Gritting her teeth, she immediately began teaching: "This is the incantation. First, Fellow Daoist Ning, memorize it firmly, then I will teach you the essential meaning within!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Saying so, she began to chant: "The Divine Path is faint and subtle, inaccessible without sincerity; the Zhu lineage inherits from the Heavens, using incense as a boat. Burning dragon marrow to pierce the Nine Hells, igniting the heart's flame to knock upon the God's slumber. With a blood contract as the guide, communicating with ten thousand spirits in a square inch; using the Ancestor's taboos as a vessel, crossing the waves of tribulation in vain requests..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo listened carefully, his expression gradually becoming somewhat amazed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He could hear that this was not the ordinary, basic Divine Summoning Art circulating in the market, but the Zhu family's exclusive Divine Summoning Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Why is Zhu Fenxiang teaching me her family's Divine Summoning Art?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard was also listening. The statue clone looked down at Zhu Fenxiang, its gaze playful: "The Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art is being passed to an outsider just like that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"It seems Zhu Fenxiang and Ning Zhuo have a deep relationship. Very good, very good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Thinking back to just a moment ago, when He cast the Divine Art Silent Observation of Mortal Ties, and the scene He observed, He immediately understood more: "No wonder I saw many female cultivators fighting each other over Ning Zhuo. Zhu Fenxiang was among them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Oh, and her mother too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The True Lord did not collect believers casually.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Zhu Fenxiang was quite important to Him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Therefore, He also had a deep understanding of the Zhu family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Once Zhu Fenxiang finished chanting, the statue clone nodded repeatedly: "Very good, Zhu Fenxiang, you have done very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhu Fenxiang hurriedly kowtowed, acting humble and not daring to claim credit, merely obeying the God's command.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo’s expression was somewhat complex: "I didn't expect that coming here this time would cause Fellow Daoist Zhu to pay such a price..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zhu Fenxiang turned slightly to look at Ning Zhuo, smiling, showing no sign of the disparity in her heart: "Fellow Daoist Ning, as the saying goes, the Law is not passed down lightly. I did indeed use my only authority to teach you my clan's Divine Summoning Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Later, when people from my family arrive, I ask for your cooperation in explaining the specific reasons."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"My clan's Divine Summoning Art has more than just this layer; naturally, there is deeper content. However, if you wish to exchange for it in the future, you will have to pay a price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Hearing that he could obtain even more, Ning Zhuo immediately revealed a look of joy and cupped his hands in thanks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He didn't fear the price; he feared not having the channel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo said sincerely: "Fellow Daoist Zhu shows such deep affection; I will engrave it in my heart and will surely repay it in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Zhu Fenxiang smiled and nodded slightly, saying nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">During her hesitation just now, she had already overcome her sense of disparity and thought things through very clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo himself was worth befriending!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He was a genius and had passed the three questions of the heart at the Demon Subjugation Hall. Dealing with such an upright character was reassuring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo had rejected Ban Jie's heavy reconciliation gift and continued to make things difficult for Ban Ji. This time, winning the minor trial in the Profound Armor Cave and eliminating Ban Ji not only indirectly showed his powerful background and lack of fear toward the Ban family, but also revealed his upright and unyielding fighting spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">If such a person were to stand with Situ Xing, it would be terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Now, by poaching him to her side to deal with Situ Xing together, this business transaction was simply a massive profit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Moreover, I can't see it, but the God seems to have seen through some of Ning Zhuo's details. He didn't hesitate to lower his status and actively requested to be Ning Zhuo's Guardian God!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"With the God behaving like this, am I a fool?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"I must strike hard and do my utmost to befriend Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"As for teaching the Zhu family's internal Divine Summoning Art..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"This treatment is usually for a husband. I indeed have the authority!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"It's just that the current situation is special and peculiar. When I report back to the family afterwards, I'll explain it first. The family will certainly understand! This is just a small matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After this train of thought, Zhu Fenxiang took action immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought, quickly comprehending the Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">His perception was superior to others, and with various means to assist his learning, he gained insights immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">While results appeared constantly, new questions also arose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">A moment later, Ning Zhuo asked Zhu Fenxiang three key questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Upon hearing them, Zhu Fenxiang's face showed a strange expression. She scrutinized Ning Zhuo deeply, marveling that this person had grasped the core essence of the Divine Summoning Art so quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">However, she immediately thought of Ning Zhuo's exaggerated performance in the Profound Armor Cave, learning while practicing and finally taking first place, and felt that such performance was normal for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard, transmitting divine power across the Yin and Yang realms to maintain the clone, was originally impatient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">But seeing Ning Zhuo's performance, He held back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Zhu Fenxiang explained the answers to Ning Zhuo in detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">After listening, Ning Zhuo thought for a while and asked another question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zhu Fenxiang's heart shook, and she shook her head slightly: "Fellow Daoist Ning, this question involves a deeper level of the Divine Summoning Art, and I have no way to answer you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo hurriedly expressed his thanks again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Alright, cast the Divine Summoning Art now," the statue clone urged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo attempted it for the first time, but since it was his first time casting the Divine Summoning Art, he failed midway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Zhu Fenxiang's heart shook again. The progress of Ning Zhuo's first attempt greatly exceeded the upper limit she had expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Therefore, Zhu Fenxiang looked even more favorably upon Ning Zhuo's upcoming performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">But the clone of the True Lord waved his hand: "Alright, alright, no need to try again, it's enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Saying so, He took the initiative to act and responded actively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The next moment, a mysterious connection was established between Ning Zhuo and Him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Zhu Fenxiang: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Although she had figured out her attitude and strategy toward Ning Zhuo, at this moment, the corners of her eyes still couldn't help twitching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Is this right?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">She thought of her own past hardships, the countless repetitions of the Divine Summoning Art just to intermittently advance her relationship with the God, eventually collapsing from exhaustion before achieving her wish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Now, she saw with her own eyes the True Lord actively cooperating, not caring at all that it was an incomplete Divine Summoning Art, "impatiently" establishing the connection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"The Divine Summoning Art isn't cast like this!" Zhu Fenxiang was heartbroken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">With the god summoning successful, the True Lord's statue clone laughed loudly, waved his small hand, and said carelessly: "You all step back. I will use my full strength to rescue this mechanical puppet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The statue clone's eyes burst with divine light, firmly locking onto Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He extended a small hand and grabbed at Meng Yehu from a distance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Sasha sasha...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The dim yellow sand mist enveloping Meng Yehu boiled instantly, its appearance changing drastically as it transformed into billions of grains of Earth Garrison Divine Sand!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Divine Sand shot out continuously, gathering into a ball on the side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The dim yellow sand mist on Meng Yehu’s body kept emerging, seeming endless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Under the means of the True Lord's clone, the newly emerged sand mist was immediately converted into Earth Garrison Divine Sand and separated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo understood: "The True Lord didn't use brute force against brute force, but converted the sand mist into Divine Sand under his control. The solution is quite gentle and skillful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The dim yellow sand mist on Meng Yehu’s body was just water without a source; it emerged more and more sparsely until it dissipated completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Meng Yehu was no longer shackled and fully regained his freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">However, he remained motionless, as if in a comatose state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The True Lord's statue clone revealed a look of realization: "So this mechanical puppet already possesses spirituality. No wonder you, Ning Zhuo, tried every possible way to rescue him from his predicament."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Aside, Zhu Fenxiang's pupils shook.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">She hadn't noticed this secret before. After being pointed out by the True Lord, she looked at Ning Zhuo and said sincerely: "Mechanical constructs possessing spirituality are extremely rare! If it grows in the future, it will definitely be of the Spirit Treasure level! Fellow Daoist Ning, congratulations!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo smiled: "I ask Fellow Daoist Zhu to keep this a secret for me as much as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Zhu Fenxiang nodded: "Easily, easily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The stronger Ning Zhuo was, the happier she was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">After all, their relationship was now different from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Ning Zhuo inspected Meng Yehu and stored him in his storage belt : "This mechanism's spirituality is dim; it will need to recuperate for a long time. I'm afraid it won't be of use in this Flying Cloud Assembly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Zhu Fenxiang nodded: "Methods concerning spirituality are rare in the world. However, I know that within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, there is a method that fits this case exactly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo was overjoyed and hurriedly asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Zhu Fenxiang was straightforward by nature and said directly: "Xuanhuang Mother Qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Years ago, a mass of Mystic Heaven Yellow Cloud was born in the depths of the Myriad Manifestations Cloud Sea. A mighty figure of the Myriad Manifestations Sect detected it accidentally and spent ten years successfully capturing it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Afterward, the mighty figure cut off a part of the Mystic Heaven Yellow Cloud and refined it to obtain wisps of Xuanhuang Mother Qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"This item is extremely precious and is currently held by Danxia Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Perhaps, Fellow Daoist Ning can seek out connections and obtain it through trade."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
