<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">After thinking it through, Ning Zhuo started his plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He spent large sums of money for the capture of wild monkeys, then hired a demonic cultivator to poison the Monkey Head Gang’s monkey pets, and finally staged a failed assassination attempt on Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Under this pressure, Yuan Er and Yuan Dasheng focused wholly on defending themselves, allowing Ning Zhuo’s first step to succeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Riding the momentum, Ning Zhuo played the villain in front of Fei Si and led the man to misjudge the situation. Ning Zhuo then voluntarily gave up forty percent of his profits to obtain the corpses of the Monkey Head Gang’s monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He gathered and refined their essence blood, extracting blood energy of the same origin as Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He then deliberately participated in the rush job at Flying Disk Workshop and personally crafted a large number of low-quality explosive fire monkeys, secretly using the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique to embed the extracted blood energy into the mechanical monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">On the day of the Fire Persimmon Festival, Ning Zhuo was stationed midway up the mountain and hidden by the formation. He took the risk of using his heart seal to control the mechanical monkeys and incited a riot, deliberately sending them to attack Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The mechanical monkeys were destroyed by Fei Si activating the formation, but the lurking blood energy had already attached itself to Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Frightened by the attack, Yuan Er regrouped with Yuan Dasheng, leading to Yuan Dasheng being polluted by the blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo’s gamble paid off!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sure enough, Yuan Dasheng’s perception wasn’t sharp enough, or maybe it was too worried about Yuan Er. In any case, it failed to notice that a tiny amount of blood energy from the same origin had entered its body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Though this blood energy was minimal in quantity, it managed to affect Yuan Dasheng’s fingers at the critical moment and caused the “mistake”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest exploded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo’s trap was so exquisitely designed that even Zhu Xuanji’s Golden Pupils failed to detect the blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Right under his nose, Ning Zhuo’s scheme succeeded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">However, the fact that Zhu Xuanji saved Yuan Dasheng momentarily disrupted Ning Zhuo’s mental state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He almost thought he’d been exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Yuan Dasheng survived, clinging to a sliver of life. What worried Ning Zhuo even more was that Yuan Dasheng’s body was still intact, not blown to pieces as he had expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Most importantly, Yuan Dasheng’s two hands remained unharmed, with all ten fingers still intact. This made Ning Zhuo realize he had left a flaw behind!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">At the time, Zhu Xuanji was focused on saving Yuan Dasheng and didn’t care about minor details. The blood energy of the same origin was perfectly hidden, so he didn’t notice anything suspicious in the fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">But if he conducted a follow-up examination and looked more closely, would he really miss it?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo didn’t dare to take that risk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">So Ning Zhuo had to eliminate Yuan Dasheng quickly and erase the flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo couldn’t act under his own name. He was merely at the Qi Refining stage and couldn’t bear the possible backlash from Zhu Xuanji if discovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“I can act under Sir Fei Si’s name. That way, Zhu Xuanji would hesitate to act against Fei Si and assume I was only the executor, not the mastermind!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo threw himself into the fray, disregarding his safety to successfully persuade Yuan Er. In the end, he won!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Just as he predicted, once Zhu Xuanji learned of the incident, he assumed Fei Si was the mastermind. Even better, Fei Si himself believed that he was the mastermind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“In the end, I pulled it off!” Inside the Flying Disk Workshop, Ning Zhuo sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Regaining his composure, his breathing became much steadier and his emotions eased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zhu Xuanji and the others didn’t know that they had been just a hair’s breadth away from discovering the key clue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">But that hair’s breadth was enough to bury the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">A tiny mistake led to an error of a thousand li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“For now, I can still stay hidden.” Ning Zhuo wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and let out a light breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">It really hadn’t been easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">No fighting occurred during the whole process, but it was like walking a tightrope along the edge of a cliff. There were multiple moments when Ning Zhuo almost lost control of his mental state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He stood up. “Old Chen, I’d like to handle Yuan Dasheng’s corpse personally. This is a task that Sir Fei Si assigned to me. I want to show more initiative.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Even though the essence blood had already been extracted and the flaw had been erased, Ning Zhuo remained cautious. He didn’t want Yuan Dasheng’s body to fall into someone else’s hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“You…” Chen Cha sighed deeply. “Fine. I’ll pack it up for you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Get some rest. The preprocessing of the corpse is complete, and preserving it for a long time won’t be an issue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“There’s no need to rush. It’s not worth working yourself to exhaustion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo bowed in gratitude. “Thank you, Old Chen!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Fei Si and Zhu Xuanji’s trio returned to Fire Persimmon Forest and continued digging the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">They dug far deeper than just three chi, going down as much as three zhang. At the same time, several Golden Core cultivators took turns using all kinds of spells and magic artifacts to investigate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Nothing happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Fei Si’s face was gloomy. He had a feeling that the black shadow demonic cultivator had indeed escaped and wouldn’t return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Since it had come to this, he had to keep digging. Even if it meant turning the mountain upside down, he wouldn’t hesitate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The logic was simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Since he had failed his mission, he had to at least give the appearance of working hard to tell the City Lord that he had put in the effort even if he hadn’t gotten results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“This time, I also managed to pay back Zhu Xuanji and make him look bad, so it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Fei Si reflected on his current situation and naturally thought of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">His eyes narrowed slightly, and he felt somewhat conflicted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">From today’s events, he had seen Ning Zhuo’s talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The boy was only at the Qi Refining stage, but still dared to storm into the Monkey Head Gang’s headquarters and coerce a Foundation Establishment cultivator like Yuan Er into abandoning Yuan Dasheng. From this, it was clear that Ning Zhuo had both ability and courage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Fei Si also knew very well that Ning Zhuo actions were motivated by personal gains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But he didn’t mind. In fact, this made him feel that he understood Ning Zhuo better and could control him. It gave him a sense of safety and confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">These feelings made him appreciate this youth from the Ning Clan even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“He really reminds me of myself when I was young.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“And he’s got sharp instincts too!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“I’m just not sure if he was the one who caused the mechanical monkeys to go out of control and attack Yuan Er during the Fire Persimmon Festival…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Fei Si was no fool. He had always kept this suspicion in mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In his eyes, Ning Zhuo had a strong motive!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Of course, he had also listened to Ning Zhuo and Chen Cha’s explanation regarding the incident. When he first received the report from his attendants, he indeed found it reasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">But his suspicion never completely disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“I’m not learned in mechanical arts. There might be some method that would allow Ning Zhuo to control the mechanical monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Even if there isn’t, isn’t there Chen Cha as well? He’s at the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“If Chen Cha wasn’t the accomplice, then Ning Zhuo could have also offered a high price to hire a demonic cultivator…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">As an experienced official, Fei Si was naturally suspicious of everything regardless of evidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Of course, he was more inclined to believe that the mechanical monkeys had been secretly controlled by the black shadow demonic cultivator, and that the latter had successfully escaped that very day right in front of countless onlookers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The reason he preferred this explanation was simple — it worked best in his favor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Yes, the black shadow demonic cultivator had fooled all the Golden Core cultivators and was overwhelmingly mighty!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">If that was the case, Fei Si’s failure would be much easier for the City Lord to accept.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Just look! Even Zhu Xuanji with his Golden Pupils failed to uncover the black shadow demonic cultivator. I, Fei Si, was simply powerless against such an opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Fei Si began racking his brain for ways to reinforce this theory and how to report it to the City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">As for what the actual truth was, he didn’t care in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">After managing Fire Persimmon Immortal City’s affairs for so many years, had he not already handled enough wrongful and mistaken cases?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"I am an official, not someone from the Divine Investigation Bureau!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Seeking the truth was Zhu Xuanji’s goal and responsibility. Fei Si only wanted to preserve the existing order of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, obey City Lord Meng Kui’s commands, and protect his own authority and interests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
