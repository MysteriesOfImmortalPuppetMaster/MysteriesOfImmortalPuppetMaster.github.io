<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 309: Golden Mountain and Jade Pillar</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In another battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu staggered, both letting out muffled groans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Their attempt to use the Void Traversing Technique had failed, and they suffered a backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The culprit was none other than Zhu Xuanji standing before them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Zhu Xuanji, clad in a black-edged red robe, his square face expressionless, eyes flickering with strands of golden light: "This time, I have prepared in advance. Don't think you can easily escape from my grasp as before." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"I don't believe it!" Sun Lingtong tried repeatedly, spitting blood each time, failing again and again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Any technique involving the void seemed to crash into a mountain wall, unable to succeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Stop trying, this must be the Official Technique—Sealed Barrier!" Yang Chanyu's face was stern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly: "Since you recognize it, you should know that this time, the only option for us is to fight!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In the current world of cultivation, resources are abundant, and spiritual energy is plentiful. Through the research of sages over generations, the arts of cultivation have flourished with a hundred schools of thought contending.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ancient techniques have now been divided into many refined categories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">For instance, Sun Lingtong's self-created blade technique, the Void Sect's thieving arts, Ning Zhuo's mechanical techniques, and the ghost-summoning technique once used by Qi Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Officials in the cultivation nation, holding official positions, with their fate energy integrated with the nation, might be able to command Official Techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Sealed Barrier is one such Official Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Unlike previous encounters, Zhu Xuanji knew he would face Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong, so he prepared in advance, invoking the king's decree, bowing three times and kowtowing nine times, to trigger the Official Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">For this Official Technique, he did not hesitate to consume a second king's decree, paying a great price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu lost their ability to escape and could only engage Zhu Xuanji in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong wielded a dagger, directly activating his blade technique—Butterfly Wing Blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The blade light flickered incessantly, like a butterfly flapping its wings, dancing out. The butterfly-like blade light was dazzling and exquisite, enveloping Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Once he decided to act, Sun Lingtong immediately displayed the powerful means of a major sect disciple of the demonic path and a firm fighting spirit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Yang Chanyu was not idle either, holding a mechanical crossbow, continuously firing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">In the span of two breaths, she had already shot out over a dozen arrows, each tipped with a potent purple poison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Facing the sharp offensive of the Void Sect, Zhu Xuanji seemed foolish, standing still, unmoving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He merely clenched his fists, expressionless, enduring the assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The razor-sharp blade light and the dozen poisonous arrows all fell in the face of the golden light, sinking into the sand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zhu Xuanji's entire body was bathed in golden light, within which a mountain could be vaguely seen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Golden Mountain Stance?!" Yang Chanyu exclaimed in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong's expression also changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Martial Divine Ability—Golden Mountain Stance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Alongside it, there was another, called Jade Pillar Body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">These two divine abilities are the ultimate pursuits of martial generals in the world. Obtaining one would make one a fine general, able to traverse the battlefield with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Zhu Xuanji actually mastered this divine ability?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Isn't he supposed to be cultivating the Origin Tracing Technique?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The two from the Void Sect quickly exchanged glances, suddenly realizing they had severely underestimated Zhu Xuanji—they had greatly misjudged this person!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"It's my turn to attack now." Zhu Xuanji slowly spoke, striding towards Sun and Yang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Yang Chanyu immediately vanished, disappearing from sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth, encouraging himself: "We're all in the Foundation Establishment stage..." He charged at Zhu Xuanji, engaging in combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The once sharp dagger, whether slicing or stabbing, was ineffective against the pervasive Golden Mountain Stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In contrast, Zhu Xuanji's fists and feet stirred the air, bringing forth howling winds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Sun Lingtong moved with agility, like a lone boat struggling to survive in a tsunami.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">His nerves were taut to the utmost, knowing that if he were hit by a punch, he would suffer severe injuries!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Blade Technique—Swallow Tail Blade Return!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lingtong was forced into his best combat state, blade light swirling around him. With each thrust, the blade light followed, slashing at Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhu Xuanji, however, acted as if the blade light did not exist, continuing to pressure Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Golden Mountain Stance suddenly expanded, ensnaring Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sun Lingtong did not expect the Golden Mountain Stance to have this change, causing his movements to pause, and Zhu Xuanji, who had been waiting for this moment, seized the opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Zhu Xuanji slapped his waist, retrieving a fiery ruler.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Magical Artifact—Fiery Iron Ruler!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He raised the fiery ruler high, aiming at Sun Lingtong's head, and struck down heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">If truly struck, Sun Lingtong's head would surely shatter like a watermelon hitting the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">In the moment of crisis, Yang Chanyu could no longer hold back, hurriedly revealing herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">She wielded the Soul-Stealing Light Blade, exerting her full power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ancient Cicada Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In an instant, the sound of cicadas suddenly rang out, like the scorching sun of midsummer shining down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Soul-Stealing Light Blade successfully pierced through the Golden Mountain Stance, striking Zhu Xuanji's back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">A crisp sound echoed, the blade of the Soul-Stealing Light Blade pierced through Zhu Xuanji's clothing but could not penetrate his skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">His skin was like green jade, emitting a pure light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Martial Divine Ability—Jade Pillar Body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yang Chanyu's attack was in vain, her face showing astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">What was happening?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zhu Xuanji actually possessed both the Golden Mountain Stance and the Jade Pillar Body, these two martial divine abilities?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ordinary martial generals obtaining one would be a fine general in the world. To gather both, complementing each other, would make one a fierce general, traversing the battlefield with ease!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Yang Chanyu's assault had no effect, and Zhu Xuanji didn't even bother to turn his head to observe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He understood well the battlefield principle of injuring one finger rather than ten, continuing to strike hard at Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Sun Lingtong's heart rang with alarm, his pupils shrinking to pinpoints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">In the critical moment of life and death, he used his divine sense to activate his storage bracelet, releasing a mechanical beast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This mechanical beast was mighty and robust, its fur fiery red, with a body of golden bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">It was the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng raised its arms high, forcefully blocking Zhu Xuanji's iron ruler.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The two clashed, a loud bang resounded, and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng's feet were driven into the ground by the impact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong quickly rolled away, escaping with his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"That was intense!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Thanks to Ning Zhuo, for lending me the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, saving my life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">His heart raced, his face flushed. The intense scent of death made him excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">With the barrier weakened, no one knew if a fatal blow would still be protected by the Lava Immortal Palace, merely eliminating them rather than costing their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng exerted its arms, pushing away the Fiery Iron Ruler. It clenched its fists, striking forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Zhu Xuanji retreated a step, entangled in combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">For a moment, it seemed like dragons and tigers clashed, the heavens and earth cracked, fists and rulers moved, startling the gods. The red ape fought with martial prowess, thunder and wind roared, the golden general wielded the ruler, lightning boomed. The battle reached its peak, the world darkened, the universe reversed, blood light shone red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">One side was a demon ape with celestial talent, a martial arts master in life. The other was a divine constable of the Southern Kingdom, a Golden Core representative of the royal family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The two sides fought for over a dozen rounds, the fiery ruler cleaving the air, thunderous strings startling, the righteous bones firm as gold, fighting to the death without retreat. Sun and Yang wanted to intervene, but found no gaps or opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Close combat is like this, the offense and defense switch rapidly, the frequency extremely high. Long-range spellcasting is often more leisurely, usually able to observe the enemy's spellcasting before casting one's own to counter and intercept.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"What a pity." Zhu Xuanji sighed, using an Iron Mountain Lean to knock the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng rolled with the momentum, creating distance, just about to rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Zhu Xuanji took a big step forward, already upon it again. The iron ruler, like a blade, struck down heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng raised its right arm to block, its left arm reaching forward, performing its ultimate technique in life—Sun Shattering Hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">However, Yuan Dasheng's left fist was caught by the Golden Mountain Stance, unable to touch anything tangible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Fiery Iron Ruler fell, splitting the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng's head open, then flames spewed, exploding into countless fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Much of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng's materials had been replaced by Ning Zhuo, elevating it to Foundation Establishment level. Thus, Dasheng was a solid Foundation Establishment level combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Although Zhu Xuanji was also constrained at the Foundation Establishment stage, with two divine abilities, he far surpassed the celestial talent and righteous bones, thus after a brief stalemate, he completely gained the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng became a headless ape!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">When Ning Zhuo opened the door, this was the scene he saw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">His pupils contracted sharply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Though Dasheng was a mechanical construct, such severe damage also diminished its spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The headless ape staggered, retreating several steps, then stood firm with difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Facing Zhu Xuanji, it still showed intent to fight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Come back!" Seeing this, Sun Lingtong quickly used his storage bracelet to absorb the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, releasing the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">As soon as Qi Bai appeared, he waved his twin bamboo sticks, releasing a large number of ghost souls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The ghost souls filled the Secret Pavilion, exuding a strong yin energy, chilling to the core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ghosts clung to him, yet Zhu Xuanji remained unmoved. His entire body was protected by the golden light like a mountain, while the ghosts were continuously worn down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zhu Xuanji looked towards the door at Ning Zhuo: "Ning Zhuo, you came just in time! Now is the best opportunity for you to prove yourself to the world. Capture them, and atone for your crimes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Understood!" Ning Zhuo shouted, joining the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He released a large number of Mechanical Fire Monkeys and Fire Bamboo Snakes, entangling with the ghost souls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu exchanged a glance, coordinating with the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai, launching a fierce assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The two sides engaged in a chaotic battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Sun and Yang were already no match for Zhu Xuanji, even with Qi Bai, they could only hold the line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Now, with Ning Zhuo assisting Zhu Xuanji, the situation became even more dire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Sun and Yang were at a disadvantage, struggling to hold on, until they finally saw Ning Zhuo behind Zhu Xuanji, casting a powerful spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Five Qi Torrent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The torrent struck Zhu Xuanji's back, instantly engulfing him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Rudie Niang, follow me, attack together!" Ning Zhuo called out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The next moment, hidden from view, the mechanical Rudie Niang, released early by Ning Zhuo, flapped her wings, creating a multitude of seven-colored glass shards, piercing through the Five Qi Torrent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">This was Ning Zhuo's trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Don't underestimate Rudie Niang, this mechanical construct was only made of Foundation Establishment materials, but her design was extremely intricate, especially her formation techniques were astonishing, allowing her to unleash a near-Golden Core level assault!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
