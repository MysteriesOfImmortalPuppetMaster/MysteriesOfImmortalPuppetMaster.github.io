<paragraph index="1">"Su Mo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Visiting so late, are you here to spar with me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Must be an assassin!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Not seeing him!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo received the message from the Foundation Establishment guard and immediately shook his head, "Send him away." Ning Zhuo's attitude was straightforward and resolute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Foundation Establishment guard hesitated, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, if you do this, I'm afraid..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Afraid of what?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The guard continued, "I'm afraid it will harm your reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"This Su Mo claims to be a low-level cultivator. If you don't respond to such a challenger, what will people think of you when they hear about it?" Ning Zhuo sneered, "Do you think I don't know that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"The other party must have heard the rumors and came to probe me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"There must be someone behind him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Maybe this isn't just probing, but an assassination attempt."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Reputation is important, but my life is more important."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"I climbed up from the bottom. Look, others disdain the dirty business of the black market, but I don't! I'm very pragmatic." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Saying this, Ning Zhuo continued, "However, your reminder is not without merit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Alright, invite Su Mo to the courtyard, treat him with good food and wine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Tell him that the current situation is tense, with strange rumors and slander against me. I will remember this challenge and spar with him when I have time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"For now, I will stay reclusive and not act rashly. The situation is not right, not right at all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Someone might come to assassinate me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Do you think I'm a fool?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Hahaha, I won't easily give assassins a chance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Tomorrow, I'll move back to the clan's territory."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo let out a cold laugh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Understood, I will handle it," the Foundation Establishment guard retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo's explanation convinced him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">However, Ning Zhuo's words were not mainly for the guard, but for someone else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan frowned slightly after hearing Ning Zhuo's plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">They wanted Ning Zhuo to act as bait to lure the City Lord's Mansion into making a mistake by attempting an assassination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">But Ning Zhuo himself had sensed the danger and wanted to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"This won't do!" Zhu Xuanji thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Jiufan frowned, "Moving into the clan's territory won't prevent an assassination? Naive!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He didn't want to see Ning Zhuo take such action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Although moving into the clan's territory would indeed be safer for Ning Zhuo, it wouldn't stop the City Lord's Mansion from sending assassins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">If Ning Zhuo moved into the clan's territory, it would increase casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">After an assassination attempt, other clan members might also suffer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zhu Xuanji directly transmitted his voice to Ning Jiufan, "Brother Ning, please make arrangements. Ning Zhuo is a member of your clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Such matters were not suitable for Zhu Xuanji to handle directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">It was most appropriate for Ning Jiufan to persuade Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">So, Ning Jiufan transmitted his voice to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Ancestor, Ancestor!" Ning Zhuo was overjoyed upon hearing this and quickly called out, "Ancestor, you have come to save me! I will never forget your life-saving grace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Jiufan told Ning Zhuo not to be afraid, that he had come nearby to protect Ning Zhuo and urged Ning Zhuo to bravely accept the challenge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Even if Su Mo is an assassin, I will ensure your safety," Ning Jiufan said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo shrank back, "Ancestor, I... I don't want to."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He touched his big head and suddenly seemed to realize something.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Wait, could it be..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Ancestor, could it be you who spread the rumors, saying I obtained the Demonic Dao Scripture?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"You protect me in secret and want me to accept the challenge, isn't this clearly using me as bait?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Who are you trying to deal with?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Jiufan coughed, "You don't need to know who."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">If he told Ning Zhuo they were targeting the City Lord's Mansion, wouldn't Ning Zhuo be scared out of his wits?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">So, Ning Jiufan didn't respond directly but deflected the question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo was not stupid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"I won't do it, I won't do it!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"This job is too dangerous. One mistake, and my life is at risk, Ancestor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"My small arms and legs can't handle it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Seeing Ning Zhuo's lack of cooperation, Ning Jiufan couldn't help but snort coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Unexpectedly, this cold snort didn't scare Ning Zhuo but instead triggered his "rebellion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Ancestor, you can't do this, Ancestor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Although I'm from a branch family, I'm still part of the Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"You can't treat me differently, Ancestor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"If you do this, it will break my heart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Jiufan felt like a biased elder, very confused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Jiufan said coldly, "Stop shouting. Even if the main family's patriarch were in your position, he would have to do the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"This is for the greater good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"You are in this position, and the situation demands it. You must consider the greater good, child."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo's neck stiffened, "No, I won't do it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Ancestor, don't force me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"How can an ancestor force a junior to die?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"If you keep forcing me, I'll kneel in the ancestral hall, holding your father's and grandfather's tablets and cry!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"I'll complain! I'll move into the ancestral hall, eat, drink, and live there."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Jiufan: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">For a moment, he was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Honestly, he had never seen such a junior in the family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This was too disrespectful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He was about to teach Ning Zhuo a lesson but was stopped by Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Zhu Xuanji said, "Right now, we still need this child to cooperate with us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"For the greater good, it's best to stabilize him for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Jiufan frowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zhu Xuanji continued, "Don't you know your own junior?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Let me remind you a bit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"He is from a branch family, treated harshly since childhood. Although he attended school and received training, his mechanical skills were always accumulating without showing any talent. This means he wasn't highly regarded in school."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"It wasn't until the recent emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace that his mechanical skills reached a breakthrough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Only recently did he discover his talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Such a youth, neglected by both sides, grew up wild for sixteen years. Don't expect him to respect the elders and high-ranking members of the Ning family from the bottom of his heart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Don't forget, he recently pulled down your clan's young patriarch. Your former young patriarch is still locked up in the family's private prison, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Jiufan's frown deepened, "So, according to Lord Zhu's meaning..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Zhu Xuanji just smiled without answering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Jiufan felt unhappy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">What?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He, a dignified Golden Core stage elder of the Ning family, had to accommodate a junior?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">This was outrageous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">But Zhu Xuanji was right; everything had to consider the greater good.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">What was the current greater good?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">It was to lure the City Lord's Mansion into making a mistake by sending assassins after Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Only by catching the City Lord's Mansion's mistake could they prove and expose the City Lord's Mansion's crimes of sending Shadow Demon Cultivators, bombing the Immortal Palace, and raising bandits for personal gain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Once these crimes were confirmed, the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family could openly intervene and overturn the entire situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">At that time, Zhu Xuanji wouldn't need to do anything and could directly become the master of the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Jiufan fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">If Ning Zhuo backed out now and stopped pretending, Fei Si would easily notice something was wrong and become wary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">How could they talk about assassination then?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">So, Zhu Xuanji was right; they had to stabilize Ning Zhuo and persuade him to cooperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Of course, the Golden Core elders had other means, such as spells to control Ning Zhuo like a puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">But that wouldn't be good.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">On one hand, they were righteous cultivators and needed to maintain their integrity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Six dignified elders bullying a Qi Refining stage junior was unacceptable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Especially Ning Jiufan, as an elder of the Ning family, should protect the younger clan members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Instead, he was colluding with five other Golden Core elders to bully and control his junior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">That was disgraceful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">On the other hand, Ning Zhuo needed to act normally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Only if he willingly cooperated could they deceive Fei Si to the greatest extent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The elders' forceful control methods would easily leave traces or signs that Fei Si could detect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Ancestor, Ancestor, are you still there?" Ning Zhuo called softly when Ning Jiufan didn't respond for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"I'm here." Ning Jiufan was amused, "You brat, you're asking for a beating."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"I'll tell you clearly, you can't escape. Stay here and wait for the assassination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"With me here, you won't die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"The emperor doesn't mistreat hungry soldiers. Tell me what you want. I'll see if I can reward you. I won't let you take risks for nothing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly and sat down heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">His face looked terrible, "Can't I really run, Ancestor?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Jiufan's voice was deep, "No."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Alright. Quickly state your demands."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Jiufan was getting impatient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">As a Golden Core stage elder, he was already showing great patience with a mere Qi Refining stage junior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Alright." Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, "Ancestor, I want to inherit the entire family. I want to be the clan leader!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Jiufan: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Ancestor? Ancestor?" Ning Zhuo called again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Jiufan laughed in anger, "You, a mere Qi Refining stage cultivator, have such ambition to aim for the clan leader's position?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo quickly said, "Ancestor, being the clan leader is prestigious. I just want it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Especially now, the main family always looks down on us branch families, constantly suppressing us in every way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Our branch family's life is tough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Otherwise, I wouldn't have led a group to make a living in the black market, Ancestor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Jiufan fell silent again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">He wasn't unaware of the Ning family's situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">He knew Ning Zhuo was right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">But it was difficult for Ning Jiufan to act against the main family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The main family was also part of the Ning bloodline, direct descendants of another Ning family elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Jiufan had promised his friend to take care of his descendants.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
