<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Su Mo?"<br/>
<br/>
"Visiting so late, are you here to spar with me?"<br/>
<br/>
"Must be an assassin!"<br/>
<br/>
"Not seeing him!!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo received the message from the Foundation Establishment guard and immediately shook his head, "Send him away." Ning Zhuo's attitude was straightforward and resolute.<br/>
<br/>
The Foundation Establishment guard hesitated, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, if you do this, I'm afraid..."<br/>
<br/>
"Afraid of what?"<br/>
<br/>
The guard continued, "I'm afraid it will harm your reputation."<br/>
<br/>
"This Su Mo claims to be a low-level cultivator. If you don't respond to such a challenger, what will people think of you when they hear about it?" Ning Zhuo sneered, "Do you think I don't know that?"<br/>
<br/>
"The other party must have heard the rumors and came to probe me."<br/>
<br/>
"There must be someone behind him!"<br/>
<br/>
"Maybe this isn't just probing, but an assassination attempt."<br/>
<br/>
"Reputation is important, but my life is more important."<br/>
<br/>
"I climbed up from the bottom. Look, others disdain the dirty business of the black market, but I don't! I'm very pragmatic." <br/>
<br/>
Saying this, Ning Zhuo continued, "However, your reminder is not without merit."<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, invite Su Mo to the courtyard, treat him with good food and wine."<br/>
<br/>
"Tell him that the current situation is tense, with strange rumors and slander against me. I will remember this challenge and spar with him when I have time."<br/>
<br/>
"For now, I will stay reclusive and not act rashly. The situation is not right, not right at all."<br/>
<br/>
"Someone might come to assassinate me!"<br/>
<br/>
"Do you think I'm a fool?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha, I won't easily give assassins a chance."<br/>
<br/>
"Tomorrow, I'll move back to the clan's territory."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out a cold laugh.<br/>
<br/>
"Understood, I will handle it," the Foundation Establishment guard retreated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's explanation convinced him.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo's words were not mainly for the guard, but for someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan frowned slightly after hearing Ning Zhuo's plan.<br/>
<br/>
They wanted Ning Zhuo to act as bait to lure the City Lord's Mansion into making a mistake by attempting an assassination.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo himself had sensed the danger and wanted to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
"This won't do!" Zhu Xuanji thought.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan frowned, "Moving into the clan's territory won't prevent an assassination? Naive!"<br/>
<br/>
He didn't want to see Ning Zhuo take such action.<br/>
<br/>
Although moving into the clan's territory would indeed be safer for Ning Zhuo, it wouldn't stop the City Lord's Mansion from sending assassins.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo moved into the clan's territory, it would increase casualties.<br/>
<br/>
After an assassination attempt, other clan members might also suffer.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji directly transmitted his voice to Ning Jiufan, "Brother Ning, please make arrangements. Ning Zhuo is a member of your clan."<br/>
<br/>
Such matters were not suitable for Zhu Xuanji to handle directly.<br/>
<br/>
It was most appropriate for Ning Jiufan to persuade Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
So, Ning Jiufan transmitted his voice to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Ancestor, Ancestor!" Ning Zhuo was overjoyed upon hearing this and quickly called out, "Ancestor, you have come to save me! I will never forget your life-saving grace."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan told Ning Zhuo not to be afraid, that he had come nearby to protect Ning Zhuo and urged Ning Zhuo to bravely accept the challenge!<br/>
<br/>
"Even if Su Mo is an assassin, I will ensure your safety," Ning Jiufan said.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shrank back, "Ancestor, I... I don't want to."<br/>
<br/>
He touched his big head and suddenly seemed to realize something.<br/>
<br/>
"Wait, could it be..."<br/>
<br/>
"Ancestor, could it be you who spread the rumors, saying I obtained the Demonic Dao Scripture?"<br/>
<br/>
"You protect me in secret and want me to accept the challenge, isn't this clearly using me as bait?"<br/>
<br/>
"Who are you trying to deal with?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan coughed, "You don't need to know who."<br/>
<br/>
If he told Ning Zhuo they were targeting the City Lord's Mansion, wouldn't Ning Zhuo be scared out of his wits?<br/>
<br/>
So, Ning Jiufan didn't respond directly but deflected the question.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was not stupid.<br/>
<br/>
"I won't do it, I won't do it!!"<br/>
<br/>
"This job is too dangerous. One mistake, and my life is at risk, Ancestor."<br/>
<br/>
"My small arms and legs can't handle it."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo's lack of cooperation, Ning Jiufan couldn't help but snort coldly.<br/>
<br/>
Unexpectedly, this cold snort didn't scare Ning Zhuo but instead triggered his "rebellion."<br/>
<br/>
"Ancestor, you can't do this, Ancestor!"<br/>
<br/>
"Although I'm from a branch family, I'm still part of the Ning family."<br/>
<br/>
"You can't treat me differently, Ancestor."<br/>
<br/>
"If you do this, it will break my heart."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan felt like a biased elder, very confused.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan said coldly, "Stop shouting. Even if the main family's patriarch were in your position, he would have to do the same."<br/>
<br/>
"This is for the greater good."<br/>
<br/>
"You are in this position, and the situation demands it. You must consider the greater good, child."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's neck stiffened, "No, I won't do it!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ancestor, don't force me."<br/>
<br/>
"How can an ancestor force a junior to die?"<br/>
<br/>
"If you keep forcing me, I'll kneel in the ancestral hall, holding your father's and grandfather's tablets and cry!"<br/>
<br/>
"I'll complain! I'll move into the ancestral hall, eat, drink, and live there."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan: ?!<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, he was stunned.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, he had never seen such a junior in the family!<br/>
<br/>
This was too disrespectful.<br/>
<br/>
He was about to teach Ning Zhuo a lesson but was stopped by Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said, "Right now, we still need this child to cooperate with us."<br/>
<br/>
"For the greater good, it's best to stabilize him for now."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan frowned.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji continued, "Don't you know your own junior?"<br/>
<br/>
"Let me remind you a bit."<br/>
<br/>
"He is from a branch family, treated harshly since childhood. Although he attended school and received training, his mechanical skills were always accumulating without showing any talent. This means he wasn't highly regarded in school."<br/>
<br/>
"It wasn't until the recent emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace that his mechanical skills reached a breakthrough."<br/>
<br/>
"Only recently did he discover his talent."<br/>
<br/>
"Such a youth, neglected by both sides, grew up wild for sixteen years. Don't expect him to respect the elders and high-ranking members of the Ning family from the bottom of his heart."<br/>
<br/>
"Don't forget, he recently pulled down your clan's young patriarch. Your former young patriarch is still locked up in the family's private prison, right?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's frown deepened, "So, according to Lord Zhu's meaning..."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji just smiled without answering.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan felt unhappy!<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
He, a dignified Golden Core stage elder of the Ning family, had to accommodate a junior?<br/>
<br/>
This was outrageous!<br/>
<br/>
But Zhu Xuanji was right; everything had to consider the greater good.<br/>
<br/>
What was the current greater good?<br/>
<br/>
It was to lure the City Lord's Mansion into making a mistake by sending assassins after Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Only by catching the City Lord's Mansion's mistake could they prove and expose the City Lord's Mansion's crimes of sending Shadow Demon Cultivators, bombing the Immortal Palace, and raising bandits for personal gain!<br/>
<br/>
Once these crimes were confirmed, the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family could openly intervene and overturn the entire situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, Zhu Xuanji wouldn't need to do anything and could directly become the master of the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo backed out now and stopped pretending, Fei Si would easily notice something was wrong and become wary.<br/>
<br/>
How could they talk about assassination then?<br/>
<br/>
So, Zhu Xuanji was right; they had to stabilize Ning Zhuo and persuade him to cooperate.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the Golden Core elders had other means, such as spells to control Ning Zhuo like a puppet.<br/>
<br/>
But that wouldn't be good.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, they were righteous cultivators and needed to maintain their integrity.<br/>
<br/>
Six dignified elders bullying a Qi Refining stage junior was unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
Especially Ning Jiufan, as an elder of the Ning family, should protect the younger clan members.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, he was colluding with five other Golden Core elders to bully and control his junior.<br/>
<br/>
That was disgraceful.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Ning Zhuo needed to act normally.<br/>
<br/>
Only if he willingly cooperated could they deceive Fei Si to the greatest extent.<br/>
<br/>
The elders' forceful control methods would easily leave traces or signs that Fei Si could detect.<br/>
<br/>
"Ancestor, Ancestor, are you still there?" Ning Zhuo called softly when Ning Jiufan didn't respond for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm here." Ning Jiufan was amused, "You brat, you're asking for a beating."<br/>
<br/>
"I'll tell you clearly, you can't escape. Stay here and wait for the assassination."<br/>
<br/>
"With me here, you won't die!"<br/>
<br/>
"The emperor doesn't mistreat hungry soldiers. Tell me what you want. I'll see if I can reward you. I won't let you take risks for nothing."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly and sat down heavily.<br/>
<br/>
His face looked terrible, "Can't I really run, Ancestor?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's voice was deep, "No."<br/>
<br/>
"Alright. Quickly state your demands."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was getting impatient.<br/>
<br/>
As a Golden Core stage elder, he was already showing great patience with a mere Qi Refining stage junior.<br/>
<br/>
"Alright." Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, "Ancestor, I want to inherit the entire family. I want to be the clan leader!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan: ...<br/>
<br/>
"Ancestor? Ancestor?" Ning Zhuo called again.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan laughed in anger, "You, a mere Qi Refining stage cultivator, have such ambition to aim for the clan leader's position?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly said, "Ancestor, being the clan leader is prestigious. I just want it."<br/>
<br/>
"Especially now, the main family always looks down on us branch families, constantly suppressing us in every way."<br/>
<br/>
"Our branch family's life is tough."<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, I wouldn't have led a group to make a living in the black market, Ancestor."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan fell silent again.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn't unaware of the Ning family's situation.<br/>
<br/>
He knew Ning Zhuo was right.<br/>
<br/>
But it was difficult for Ning Jiufan to act against the main family.<br/>
<br/>
The main family was also part of the Ning bloodline, direct descendants of another Ning family elder.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan had promised his friend to take care of his descendants.</div>
