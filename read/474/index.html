<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on the dharma implement meditation cushion, surrounded by drifting clouds, chewing spiritual food in his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He was cultivating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Demonic Blood Vein Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Within the Blood Earth Demon Vein dantian, the earth was layered with blood veins. Inside these blood veins, the blood energy was chilling, flowing unceasingly. Accompanied by each beat of Ning Zhuo’s heart, it naturally surged and ebbed like a tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Five Elements Qi Regulation Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Within the Five Qi Heavenly Pivot dantian, a five-colored vortex resembled a heavenly tornado pillar, propping up heaven and trampling the earth. Sometimes the five elemental qi were clearly distinct, and sometimes they blended into one, switching freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Mirror Platform Spirit-Communing Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Within the Bright Mirror Spiritual Light dantian there were no clouds for ten thousand miles. The upper and lower sides of the dantian were smooth and level, like two giant mirrors serving as the heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Between these giant mirrors of heaven and earth, countless small mirror divine senses quietly hovered, too numerous to count.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo’s face was first suffused with red demonic light, blood energy overflowing. Then five-colored splendor twined around him, infiltrating the inner drifting clouds. Finally, his aura converged, and a Buddhist nature rose, making him appear full of compassion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a mouthful of turbid breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">His vital blood, spiritual energy, and divine sense were all at their current peak, causing his eyes to shine with a keen light, vigorous as a dragon or tiger, brimming with energy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He looked around and pondered inwardly: “Now that I have ample wealth, it is time to set up a formation array inside the cultivation cabin to assist my training.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“With my Five Elements realm, laying down a Five Qi Returning to Origin Formation should be within my capabilities.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“Setting aside rare treasures like the national power bricks, having an auxiliary cultivation formation in the long run will accumulate benefits and definitely be advantageous!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo was hiding inside the Ten-thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ever since Liu Er stated that he would openly pursue Mu Lan, Ning Zhuo had anticipated that the Three General Camp would suffer a fierce attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Therefore, he disappeared beforehand, hiding within the Ten-thousand Li Traversing Dragon to guard against a possible assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Of course, the Ten-thousand Li Traversing Dragon did not directly leave the Three General Camp; it still lay concealed in a corner of the military camp. Moreover, at intervals, under Sun Lingtong’s control, it would shift to another location and would not remain long in one place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo finished this round of cultivation, opened the cabin door, and stepped out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Arriving at the dragon’s head cabin, Sun Lingtong said to him, “Little Zhuo, you guessed correctly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Zhang Hei was captured, Guan Hong was wounded, and as for Liu Er, he’s likely temporarily entangled in the City Lord’s Mansion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Sun Lingtong showed Ning Zhuo the images of Guan Hong being ambushed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After watching, Ning Zhuo’s mood was heavy: “This Golden Core-level assassin’s strength is very formidable. If I were Guan Hong, I fear he would have already taken my head.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Sun Gan and Shuang Jing’s reactions are so intense, which means they also want to settle things quickly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“The struggle revolving around Mu Lan, Red Flower Camp, and the Grand Marshal’s Residence likely won’t last long.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Precisely because of this judgment, Ning Zhuo still endured and did not use his three national power bricks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong asked, “Little Zhuo, what should we do next?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo said, “No one knows our true intentions, which is our advantage. Let’s hold our ground for now and see how Liu Er and Sun Gan, Shuang Jing measure up against each other.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“I’m growing more and more curious about what trump card Liu Er is hiding.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo patiently waited for Liu Er to return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Liu Er could not hide his agitation and hurried back to camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He never expected the counterattack to be so fierce and ferocious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“It’s possible that Sun Gan and Shuang Jing have already joined forces!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Sigh!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Liu Er was in a very grim mood. After returning to the military camp, he rushed straight into Guan Hong’s tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Second Brother, where are you injured? Let your elder brother have a look!” Liu Er called out with genuine emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Guan Hong felt warmth in his heart and shook his head at Liu Er: “Elder Brother, do not worry too much, your Second Brother still lives, and the injury is not severe.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“This isn’t severe?!” After examining the wound on Guan Hong’s arm, Liu Er’s eyes reddened as he grasped Guan Hong’s arm. “I have implicated both my second and third brothers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Elder Brother, as men roaming the world, how can we cherish our bodies too much? A wound like this is nothing. After some recovery, it will heal,” Guan Hong displayed his masculine spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Liu Er sighed: “Your right arm was already injured, and now it’s hurt again. Perhaps we can ask Zhang Chongyi to treat it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“With our current relations with the Red Flower Camp, inviting Zhang Chongyi should not be difficult.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Guan Hong nodded: “Elder Brother, my injury is not the real issue. What truly matters is how we rescue Third Brother.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Just then, Ning Zhuo suddenly appeared: “Two generals, General Zhang Hei is the recently appointed captured-prisoner general of the Two Note Nation, and he will not be in mortal danger.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Military Advisor!” Seeing Ning Zhuo safe and sound, Liu Er and Guan Hong’s eyes gleamed, obviously relieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">In the current situation, Ning Zhuo was the Three General Camp’s purse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">If he were assassinated, the Three General Camp would not last much longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">For the Three General Camp, Ning Zhuo was extremely important!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands and apologized for hiding and not standing with General Guan Hong to fight the enemy and share the pressure, feeling deeply ashamed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Liu Er and Guan Hong both stated that Ning Zhuo was only at the Foundation Establishment realm, and being able to protect himself was already not easy. Facing formidable enemies was naturally something that they three Golden Core cultivators should undertake. The fact that Ning Zhuo could keep himself safe had already saved them a lot of effort, and his performance was outstanding enough!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo then suggested to Liu Er that to rescue General Zhang Hei, he could make use of Mu Lan’s connections. Since she was the successor of the Grand Marshal’s Residence, she would definitely not be without allies in the court, and she should have some remaining connections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Having been delayed at the Green Forest Immortal City’s City Lord, causing his second brother to be ambushed and his third brother to be captured, Liu Er had completely seen through the City Lord’s true nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Following the plan, he went to the Red Flower Camp to visit Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Mu Lan had already learned the news and immediately met with Liu Er, stating that she had already sent a letter to the Royal Capital to activate her connections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">At the same time, she told Liu Er that she had no feelings for him. The two sides could be allies, fighting together against the enemy. She also promised Liu Er that if he was willing, after Mu Lan took charge of the Grand Marshal’s Seal, she could bring him into her official residence as a subordinate, thereby to some extent breaking through the upper limit of his human-demon mixed blood status and becoming one of the high-level figures of Two Note Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Liu Er stated that he truly held sincere feelings for Mu Lan, and that this time extending a helping hand was driven by personal emotion, not by the pursuit of benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Returning to the Three General Camp, Liu Er, rarely seen, crushed a cup in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">His heart was filled with rage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">No matter whether it was Shuang Jing, Sun Gan, or Mu Lan, none looked favorably upon him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The fierce response from the first two meant that Liu Er competing for Mu Lan in their eyes was an insult!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">As for the latter, even in such hardship, having received such critical aid from Liu Er, she still would not lower her stance, being utterly direct and without even the slightest pretense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“How hard it is for someone like me to establish meritorious deeds!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Liu Er’s heart was incomparably bitter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">His human-demon mixed blood status truly was not welcomed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“I listened to my Benevolent Master’s words, openly revealing my admiration for Mu Lan. This is the key reason for attracting suppression.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“And this is only the first day.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“From here on, I’m afraid...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">As Liu Er thought of this, his expression grew extremely grave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">That very night, the Three General Camp caught fire, burning a lot of supplies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In the following days, members of the Three General Camp inexplicably disappeared every day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Shuang Jing put forth his full effort, offering high prices to attack the Three General Camp in secret, madly poaching its people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The soldiers of the Three General Camp were already discontent. Previously, in the ambush, they had expended effort without gaining much. Even if merits were achieved, the main beneficiaries were the three generals and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Therefore, more and more soldiers voluntarily left the Three General Camp and joined the White Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Liu Er sought out Ning Zhuo, hoping Ning Zhuo would invest more resources to stabilize morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo, however, shook his head: “Our financial resources are shallow. If we do this, we will be entering into a bidding war with Shuang Jing, which is most unwise.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“Actually, this is not necessarily a bad thing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“The cultivators who harbor disloyalty leave voluntarily. Those who remain are naturally more reliable, are they not?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Although Ning Zhuo was now rich, he was not willing to burn money on this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He was certain that this issue with Mu Lan would not last long, and that the outcome would be revealed soon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“In this struggle, I am not the key.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Even if Liu Er fails and is driven out, the struggle between Shuang Jing and Sun Gan will still be a fierce battle between dragons and tigers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Seeing Ning Zhuo refuse, Liu Er could only suppress his dissatisfaction, sighing deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Elder Brother! Look at what I have here?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Suddenly, the tent flap was lifted, and Guan Hong charged in, covered in blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He tossed a human head onto the ground, killing intent rolling off him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Liu Er and Ning Zhuo both showed shocked delight, discovering that this leader was none other than the assassin who had ambushed Guan Hong that day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Second Brother, how did you manage it?” Liu Er asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Guan Hong stroked his beard, proudly saying: “That day I was heavily wounded, but I used my blade art to strike the assassin, leaving a tracking sense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“I did not act immediately, letting him sneak into our army several times to assassinate soldiers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“The more times he tried, the more careless he became.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Today I sensed him come again, so I struck suddenly and slew him on the spot!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo immediately praised: “General Guan Hong, divine might!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Liu Er also clapped his hands in admiration: “With this head, our army’s morale will surely soar! Second Brother, you have done excellently.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The assassin’s head was hung on the flagpole in the morning, but by the afternoon it mysteriously disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The morale of the Three General Camp rose in the morning, but fell in the afternoon, and by night dropped another notch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">All because news suddenly spread throughout the Immortal City and the major military camps that Mu Lan in the Red Flower Camp was injured and unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Liu Er and the others rushed into the camp to investigate the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Mu Lan indeed had a face like golden paper, lying on the bed, unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“Hearing that General Mu Lan was training troops and suddenly coughed up blood and fainted, what is going on?” Liu Er anxiously inquired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Zhang Chongyi sighed: “Gathering all the clues after the fact, it seems someone secretly employed the ‘Defeated Troops Overthrowing Generals Technique!’”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“Previously, our Red Flower Camp suffered defeat in the ambush, thus became defeated troops.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“While Mu Lan General was painstakingly drilling the troops, she was suddenly struck by this military technique. Military qi surged violently to achieve the purpose of overthrowing the general. She vomited blood and fainted on the spot. Although her life is not in danger, it will likely take three days for her to awaken.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This was devastating news, leaving Liu Er and Ning Zhuo staring at each other in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Zhang Chongyi cupped his hands: “I ask that General Liu and Young Master Ning Zhuo lend assistance to guard General Mu Lan, to prevent any stealth attacks.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Liu Er immediately agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo then pondered: “Sun Gan and Shuang Jing want to seize the Grand Marshal’s Seal. They must spare Mu Lan’s life.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“They surely have a subsequent move!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“That subsequent move is what we must guard against most.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">But what was that subsequent move? After discussing, they lacked information and reached no conclusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The gates of the Red Flower Camp were hurriedly opened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Zhang Chongyi, Liu Er, Ning Zhuo, and the others went out to greet the newcomer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The envoy from the Royal Capital held his head high, carrying an imperial decree in his hands, and dismounted from the carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“Where is General Mu Lan?” the envoy asked, looking down at them with a hostile expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo and Liu Er’s gazes met briefly, both feeling a strong sense of foreboding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">This subsequent move carried far more weight than they had imagined!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
