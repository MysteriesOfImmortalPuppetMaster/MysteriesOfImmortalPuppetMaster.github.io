<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on the dharma implement meditation cushion, surrounded by drifting clouds, chewing spiritual food in his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
He was cultivating.<br/>
<br/>
Demonic Blood Vein Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Within the Blood Earth Demon Vein dantian, the earth was layered with blood veins. Inside these blood veins, the blood energy was chilling, flowing unceasingly. Accompanied by each beat of Ning Zhuo’s heart, it naturally surged and ebbed like a tide.<br/>
<br/>
Five Elements Qi Regulation Art!<br/>
<br/>
Within the Five Qi Heavenly Pivot dantian, a five-colored vortex resembled a heavenly tornado pillar, propping up heaven and trampling the earth. Sometimes the five elemental qi were clearly distinct, and sometimes they blended into one, switching freely.<br/>
<br/>
Mirror Platform Spirit-Communing Art!<br/>
<br/>
Within the Bright Mirror Spiritual Light dantian there were no clouds for ten thousand miles. The upper and lower sides of the dantian were smooth and level, like two giant mirrors serving as the heaven and earth.<br/>
<br/>
Between these giant mirrors of heaven and earth, countless small mirror divine senses quietly hovered, too numerous to count.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s face was first suffused with red demonic light, blood energy overflowing. Then five-colored splendor twined around him, infiltrating the inner drifting clouds. Finally, his aura converged, and a Buddhist nature rose, making him appear full of compassion.<br/>
<br/>
He slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a mouthful of turbid breath.<br/>
<br/>
His vital blood, spiritual energy, and divine sense were all at their current peak, causing his eyes to shine with a keen light, vigorous as a dragon or tiger, brimming with energy!<br/>
<br/>
He looked around and pondered inwardly: “Now that I have ample wealth, it is time to set up a formation array inside the cultivation cabin to assist my training.”<br/>
<br/>
“With my Five Elements realm, laying down a Five Qi Returning to Origin Formation should be within my capabilities.”<br/>
<br/>
“Setting aside rare treasures like the national power bricks, having an auxiliary cultivation formation in the long run will accumulate benefits and definitely be advantageous!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was hiding inside the Ten-thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since Liu Er stated that he would openly pursue Mulan, Ning Zhuo had anticipated that the Three General Camp would suffer a fierce attack.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, he disappeared beforehand, hiding within the Ten-thousand Li Traversing Dragon to guard against a possible assault.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the Ten-thousand Li Traversing Dragon did not directly leave the Three General Camp; it still lay concealed in a corner of the military camp. Moreover, at intervals, under Sun Lingtong’s control, it would shift to another location and would not remain long in one place.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo finished this round of cultivation, opened the cabin door, and stepped out.<br/>
<br/>
Arriving at the dragon’s head cabin, Sun Lingtong said to him, “Little Zhuo, you guessed correctly.”<br/>
<br/>
“Zhang Hei was captured, Guan Hong was wounded, and as for Liu Er, he’s likely temporarily entangled in the City Lord’s Mansion.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong showed Ning Zhuo the images of Guan Hong being ambushed.<br/>
<br/>
After watching, Ning Zhuo’s mood was heavy: “This Golden Core-level assassin’s strength is very formidable. If I were Guan Hong, I fear he would have already taken my head.”<br/>
<br/>
“Sun Gan and Shuang Jing’s reactions are so intense, which means they also want to settle things quickly.”<br/>
<br/>
“The struggle revolving around Mulan, Red Flower Camp, and the Grand Marshal’s Residence likely won’t last long.”<br/>
<br/>
Precisely because of this judgment, Ning Zhuo still endured and did not use his three national power bricks.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong asked, “Little Zhuo, what should we do next?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, “No one knows our true intentions, which is our advantage. Let’s hold our ground for now and see how Liu Er and Sun Gan, Shuang Jing measure up against each other.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m growing more and more curious about what trump card Liu Er is hiding.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo patiently waited for Liu Er to return.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er could not hide his agitation and hurried back to camp.<br/>
<br/>
He never expected the counterattack to be so fierce and ferocious.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s possible that Sun Gan and Shuang Jing have already joined forces!”<br/>
<br/>
“Sigh!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was in a very grim mood. After returning to the military camp, he rushed straight into Guan Hong’s tent.<br/>
<br/>
“Second Brother, where are you injured? Let your elder brother have a look!” Liu Er called out with genuine emotion.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong felt warmth in his heart and shook his head at Liu Er: “Elder Brother, do not worry too much, your Second Brother still lives, and the injury is not severe.”<br/>
<br/>
“This isn’t severe?!” After examining the wound on Guan Hong’s arm, Liu Er’s eyes reddened as he grasped Guan Hong’s arm. “I have implicated both my second and third brothers.”<br/>
<br/>
“Elder Brother, as men roaming the world, how can we cherish our bodies too much? A wound like this is nothing. After some recovery, it will heal,” Guan Hong displayed his masculine spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er sighed: “Your right arm was already injured, and now it’s hurt again. Perhaps we can ask Zhang Chongyi to treat it.”<br/>
<br/>
“With our current relations with the Red Flower Camp, inviting Zhang Chongyi should not be difficult.”<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong nodded: “Elder Brother, my injury is not the real issue. What truly matters is how we rescue Third Brother.”<br/>
<br/>
Just then, Ning Zhuo suddenly appeared: “Two generals, General Zhang Hei is the recently appointed captured-prisoner general of the Two Note Nation, and he will not be in mortal danger.”<br/>
<br/>
“Military Advisor!” Seeing Ning Zhuo safe and sound, Liu Er and Guan Hong’s eyes gleamed, obviously relieved.<br/>
<br/>
In the current situation, Ning Zhuo was the Three General Camp’s purse.<br/>
<br/>
If he were assassinated, the Three General Camp would not last much longer.<br/>
<br/>
For the Three General Camp, Ning Zhuo was extremely important!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cupped his hands and apologized for hiding and not standing with General Guan Hong to fight the enemy and share the pressure, feeling deeply ashamed.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and Guan Hong both stated that Ning Zhuo was only at the Foundation Establishment realm, and being able to protect himself was already not easy. Facing formidable enemies was naturally something that they three Golden Core cultivators should undertake. The fact that Ning Zhuo could keep himself safe had already saved them a lot of effort, and his performance was outstanding enough!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then suggested to Liu Er that to rescue General Zhang Hei, he could make use of Mulan’s connections. Since she was the successor of the Grand Marshal’s Residence, she would definitely not be without allies in the court, and she should have some remaining connections.<br/>
<br/>
Having been delayed at the Green Forest Immortal City’s City Lord, causing his second brother to be ambushed and his third brother to be captured, Liu Er had completely seen through the City Lord’s true nature.<br/>
<br/>
Following the plan, he went to the Red Flower Camp to visit Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan had already learned the news and immediately met with Liu Er, stating that she had already sent a letter to the Royal Capital to activate her connections.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, she told Liu Er that she had no feelings for him. The two sides could be allies, fighting together against the enemy. She also promised Liu Er that if he was willing, after Mulan took charge of the Grand Marshal’s Seal, she could bring him into her official residence as a subordinate, thereby to some extent breaking through the upper limit of his human-demon mixed blood status and becoming one of the high-level figures of Two Note Nation.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er stated that he truly held sincere feelings for Mulan, and that this time extending a helping hand was driven by personal emotion, not by the pursuit of benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the Three General Camp, Liu Er, rarely seen, crushed a cup in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
His heart was filled with rage!<br/>
<br/>
No matter whether it was Shuang Jing, Sun Gan, or Mulan, none looked favorably upon him.<br/>
<br/>
The fierce response from the first two meant that Liu Er competing for Mulan in their eyes was an insult!<br/>
<br/>
As for the latter, even in such hardship, having received such critical aid from Liu Er, she still would not lower her stance, being utterly direct and without even the slightest pretense.<br/>
<br/>
“How hard it is for someone like me to establish meritorious deeds!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s heart was incomparably bitter.<br/>
<br/>
His human-demon mixed blood status truly was not welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
“I listened to my Benevolent Master’s words, openly revealing my admiration for Mulan. This is the key reason for attracting suppression.”<br/>
<br/>
“And this is only the first day.”<br/>
<br/>
“From here on, I’m afraid...”<br/>
<br/>
As Liu Er thought of this, his expression grew extremely grave.<br/>
<br/>
That very night, the Three General Camp caught fire, burning a lot of supplies.<br/>
<br/>
In the following days, members of the Three General Camp inexplicably disappeared every day.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing put forth his full effort, offering high prices to attack the Three General Camp in secret, madly poaching its people.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers of the Three General Camp were already discontent. Previously, in the ambush, they had expended effort without gaining much. Even if merits were achieved, the main beneficiaries were the three generals and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, more and more soldiers voluntarily left the Three General Camp and joined the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er sought out Ning Zhuo, hoping Ning Zhuo would invest more resources to stabilize morale.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, shook his head: “Our financial resources are shallow. If we do this, we will be entering into a bidding war with Shuang Jing, which is most unwise.”<br/>
<br/>
“Actually, this is not necessarily a bad thing.”<br/>
<br/>
“The cultivators who harbor disloyalty leave voluntarily. Those who remain are naturally more reliable, are they not?”<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo was now rich, he was not willing to burn money on this matter.<br/>
<br/>
He was certain that this issue with Mulan would not last long, and that the outcome would be revealed soon.<br/>
<br/>
“In this struggle, I am not the key.”<br/>
<br/>
“Even if Liu Er fails and is driven out, the struggle between Shuang Jing and Sun Gan will still be a fierce battle between dragons and tigers.”<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo refuse, Liu Er could only suppress his dissatisfaction, sighing deeply.<br/>
<br/>
“Elder Brother! Look at what I have here?”<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the tent flap was lifted, and Guan Hong charged in, covered in blood energy.<br/>
<br/>
He tossed a human head onto the ground, killing intent rolling off him.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and Ning Zhuo both showed shocked delight, discovering that this leader was none other than the assassin who had ambushed Guan Hong that day.<br/>
<br/>
“Second Brother, how did you manage it?” Liu Er asked.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong stroked his beard, proudly saying: “That day I was heavily wounded, but I used my blade art to strike the assassin, leaving a tracking sense.”<br/>
<br/>
“I did not act immediately, letting him sneak into our army several times to assassinate soldiers.”<br/>
<br/>
“The more times he tried, the more careless he became.”<br/>
<br/>
“Today I sensed him come again, so I struck suddenly and slew him on the spot!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately praised: “General Guan Hong, divine might!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er also clapped his hands in admiration: “With this head, our army’s morale will surely soar! Second Brother, you have done excellently.”<br/>
<br/>
The assassin’s head was hung on the flagpole in the morning, but by the afternoon it mysteriously disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
The morale of the Three General Camp rose in the morning, but fell in the afternoon, and by night dropped another notch.<br/>
<br/>
All because news suddenly spread throughout the Immortal City and the major military camps that Mulan in the Red Flower Camp was injured and unconscious.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and the others rushed into the camp to investigate the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan indeed had a face like golden paper, lying on the bed, unconscious.<br/>
<br/>
“Hearing that General Mulan was training troops and suddenly coughed up blood and fainted, what is going on?” Liu Er anxiously inquired.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi sighed: “Gathering all the clues after the fact, it seems someone secretly employed the ‘Defeated Troops Overthrowing Generals Technique!’”<br/>
<br/>
“Previously, our Red Flower Camp suffered defeat in the ambush, thus became defeated troops.”<br/>
<br/>
“While Mulan General was painstakingly drilling the troops, she was suddenly struck by this military technique. Military qi surged violently to achieve the purpose of overthrowing the general. She vomited blood and fainted on the spot. Although her life is not in danger, it will likely take three days for her to awaken.”<br/>
<br/>
This was devastating news, leaving Liu Er and Ning Zhuo staring at each other in shock.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi cupped his hands: “I ask that General Liu and Young Master Ning Zhuo lend assistance to guard General Mulan, to prevent any stealth attacks.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er immediately agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then pondered: “Sun Gan and Shuang Jing want to seize the Grand Marshal’s Seal. They must spare Mulan’s life.”<br/>
<br/>
“They surely have a subsequent move!”<br/>
<br/>
“That subsequent move is what we must guard against most.”<br/>
<br/>
But what was that subsequent move? After discussing, they lacked information and reached no conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
The next day.<br/>
<br/>
The gates of the Red Flower Camp were hurriedly opened.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi, Liu Er, Ning Zhuo, and the others went out to greet the newcomer.<br/>
<br/>
The envoy from the Royal Capital held his head high, carrying an imperial decree in his hands, and dismounted from the carriage.<br/>
<br/>
“Where is General Mulan?” the envoy asked, looking down at them with a hostile expression.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Liu Er’s gazes met briefly, both feeling a strong sense of foreboding.<br/>
<br/>
This subsequent move carried far more weight than they had imagined!</div>
