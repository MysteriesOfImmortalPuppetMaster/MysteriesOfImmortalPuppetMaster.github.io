<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged, eyes gently closed, fully immersed in cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He had now advanced to the third stage of Foundation Establishment: Dantian Birthing Radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Among his three dantians and three supreme techniques, he first cultivated his lower dantian’s Essence Sea using the Demonic Blood Vein Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Vital blood surged vigorously, flowing unceasingly within his lower dantian, transforming into a vast pool of blood. Surrounding this crimson pool was land webbed with densely intertwined blood tendons like a colossal net.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Thanks to the explosive growth in his dantian’s space, the blood pool and the net were initially confined to their second-stage scale, occupying less than thirty percent of the available area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">As Ning Zhuo activated the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, the blood pool surged fiercely, rapidly expanding, with the blood net similarly stretching and covering the pool’s bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">A deep sense of satisfaction blossomed in Ning Zhuo’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Previously, he'd been stalled at the Medicine Gathering Stage, his dantian reaching its limit and unable to advance his cultivation further, forcing him instead to resort to alternate methods of accumulation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Now, with a profound qualitative breakthrough, his dantian surged in capacity, granting him ample space for progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The rate of improvement was remarkably rapid, the blood pool and net expanding visibly, yielding immediate results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Yet, this swift progress came with intense hunger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Sensing this, Ning Zhuo decisively halted his cultivation, realizing time had swiftly passed, a full incense stick’s duration vanishing in a blink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Growling loudly, his stomach felt profoundly empty, yet his physical appearance remained unchanged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"In the past, I'd be skin-and-bones by now," he mused, astonished. "My appearance is remarkably preserved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He quickly understood it was due to the deeper foundation forged by his physical cultivation, bolstered by the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The spirit foods from Hidden Yang Villa primarily benefited the soul rather than the body. His own supply was long exhausted, but thankfully, he had many medicinal pills at hand, swiftly consuming them to replenish his physical strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Temporarily setting aside the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, he shifted to cultivating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Within his Qi Sea Dantian, the five-element hurricane pillars expanded dramatically, soaring once again from earth to sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The efficiency of this cultivation was multiple times greater than his blood technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"This is all due to my profound mastery of the Five Elements," he thought, gratified. "With such deep insights, cultivating this technique is naturally swift and effortless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Finally, he turned his attention to the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Mirror after mirror emerged rapidly, covering his entire upper dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Never have I encountered bottlenecks in cultivating this Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique. Its cultivation speed far exceeds even that of my middle and lower dantians," he pondered, amused. "Perhaps my true talents lie within the Buddhist Path, proving my fundamentally kind and righteous nature."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Meanwhile, Sun Lingtong was busy at the well's edge, employing his theft art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He drew a stream from the surging Yin energy, channeling it entirely into the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The three-foot-tall kettle blazed fiercely, crafted from fiery gold and night-hued crystal. Two Flood Dragons, one violet and one azure, coiled around the pot, their heads meeting at the top, mouths slightly agape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The violet dragon inhaled strongly, drawing in the Yin energy and cycling it within the pot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Then, the violet dragon sealed its mouth, while the azure dragon opened its maw, exhaling waves of pure Yang energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Excellent! Wonderful! Perfect!" Sun Lingtong danced with joy, repeating his praise thrice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Attempting to direct the Yang energy back into the well, Sun Lingtong saw it quickly devoured by the overpowering Yin energy. Still, his housing token recorded his efforts, acknowledging his contribution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo! Great news!" Sun Lingtong hurried over excitedly during Ning Zhuo’s break.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Hearing the details, Ning Zhuo exclaimed, "Who would’ve imagined General Liu Er’s treasure, initially meant for Mu Lan, would become so crucial here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After brief contemplation, he instructed, "Don’t inject all the generated Yang energy into the Yin surge - only about ten percent. Keep the rest stored safely within the pot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">After another thoughtful pause, he added, "Also, make sure the Yang energy contains some impurities. It shouldn’t be too pure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Sun Lingtong's eyes lit with understanding, "Got it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">They had previously agreed not to stand out excessively. With internal and external threats looming over White Paper City, the large group of male consorts was undoubtedly mixed, harboring spies and potential threats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Anyone openly aiding the White Paper City Lord's healing would surely become a target of the city's enemies. The destruction of the southern paper idol demonstrated clearly the depth of enemy infiltration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Even though Ning Zhuo attracted attention due to Qing Yan’s favor, granting him the prime residence, this alone wasn’t substantial enough to incite immediate hostility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Thus, Sun Lingtong converted Yin to Yang diligently while safeguarding Ning Zhuo, who continued to cultivate vigorously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">All three dantians were brimming with energy, yet further advancement remained possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">As Ning Zhuo continued cultivating the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, countless mirrors within his spirit sea began cracking slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sharp, icy pains accompanied the cracks, followed by faint glimmers escaping through the fractures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"So this is the Dantian Birthing Radiance stage," Ning Zhuo realized profoundly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The faint glow gradually brightened, lengthening bit by bit, seemingly alive as it stretched over an inch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">At this moment, the Spiritual Mirror surface could no longer withstand it, cracks spider webbing across its face before it shattered completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">However, the inch-long radiant light did not dissipate. Instead, it hovered in place, making the area noticeably brighter compared to its surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">With each mirror's collapse, the brilliance at the location intensified slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Continuing to channel the Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique, Ning Zhuo formed another mirror anew. He persisted, repeatedly collapsing mirrors, each time producing an inch-sized cluster of brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"From inch to foot, and then yard upon yard, until the entire Spiritual Sea is illuminated magnificently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Once the radiance spills forth abundantly, the Dantian Birthing Radiance stage can be considered truly complete."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Understanding this clearly, Ning Zhuo began cultivating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique and the Demonic Blood-Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Within his Qi Sea appeared a vibrant, multicolored glow, while in his Essence Sea arose a blood-red brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Having just begun, the radiant Qi and Essence measured merely over an inch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"The Dantian Birthing Radiance stage is truly a long and challenging journey!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This stage marked another painstaking effort, requiring cultivators to consistently accumulate and temper their three dantians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Normally, this stage took approximately thirty years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Cultivators who used supplementary techniques - such as consuming pills, absorbing spirit stones, or employing cultivation formations - could shorten this period.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">However, Ning Zhuo practiced three top-tier cultivation techniques simultaneously, tripling the time required. This would extend his cultivation period to ninety years!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Yet, thanks to his efficiency in cultivating his Spiritual and Qi Seas, the total time required would inevitably be less than ninety years even without external assistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Unconcerned about calculating precisely, Ning Zhuo took out a National Power Brick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">These bricks, painstakingly accumulated from the Two Notes Kingdom, were precisely meant for this crucial moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">As the National Power Brick rotated and shrank in Ning Zhuo's hand, the brilliance within his three dantians surged dramatically - from slightly over an inch directly to over a foot, then exceeding a yard, increasing a hundredfold instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The first brick dissipated without regret. Ning Zhuo decisively took out a second brick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Brick after brick, Ning Zhuo continued until radiant light overflowed from all three dantians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Dantian Birthing Radiance - completely cultivated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo had saved at least fifty years of arduous effort, and since he used National Power Bricks, there wasn't the slightest instability in his foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"All this comes from my past accumulation, simply manifesting today."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Next is the Wondrous Visions Sowing Talismans stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Continuing forward with great vigor, Ning Zhuo advanced directly to the next stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Radiant lights overflowed from his three dantians. Within the Spiritual Sea, vague rune shadows began to emerge, as was the case in the Qi Sea, though the Essence Sea remained purely blood-red, unchanged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Wondrous Visions Sowing Talismans stage involved cultivating these peculiar rune patterns, gradually forming them into complete symbols.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Each primary cultivation technique only produced a single complete rune symbol, forming the core of the cultivator's signature technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This signature technique varied depending on the method cultivated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Now, Ning Zhuo's advantage in cultivating three methods simultaneously became evident - others had only one signature technique, but he possessed three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Most cultivators practiced ordinary or mid-tier methods, resulting in correspondingly ordinary signature techniques. Yet Ning Zhuo's were all exceptional, derived from the Spiritual Mirror, Five Elements Qi Regulation, and the Demonic Blood-Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Strange!" Ning Zhuo was astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">As he formally entered the Wondrous Visions Sowing Talismans stage, his Spiritual Sea suddenly transformed, revealing a towering mirror platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The mirror platform gradually shrank, condensing into a complete rune symbol!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Why?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Could it be that my mysterious innate talent is closely related to Buddhism?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo was bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">In his Essence Sea, phenomena were minimal, just beginning, which was perfectly normal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Within his Qi Sea, however, a swirling five-colored torrent occasionally twisted into a spiral, occasionally separated clearly. The rune seed was already halfway formed - an anomaly due to Ning Zhuo's profound mastery over the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Thus, the cultivation within his Qi Sea had already reached the mid-stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"But why did the Spiritual Mirror's signature rune in my Spiritual Sea complete itself so swiftly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo found it unbelievable, yet the reality compelled him to accept it, filling him with doubt: "Am I truly destined for Buddhism?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The unexpectedly completed Spiritual Sea cultivation left Ning Zhuo both stunned and joyful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Unable to find an immediate reason, he quickly focused on comprehending the Five Elements Qi Regulation and the Demonic Blood-Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">At this cultivation stage, the primary emphasis shifted towards comprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Two days passed, during which Ning Zhuo made significant progress in understanding the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, while progress in the Blood-Vein Technique was moderate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">A paper servant appeared once more, bringing information and guiding Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong toward the garden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">In the garden, the silver-robed steward appeared once again, declaring loudly to the gathered group, "You've been here for four or five days now. Today, I've summoned you to distribute cultivation methods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"This is also part of our White Paper City's welfare. It concerns your further evaluation, so everyone better listen up!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The steward’s sudden shout startled some into alertness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Sun and Ning followed the crowd and soon reached the Scripture Repository. Guided by the silver-robed steward, they entered in an orderly fashion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Fetal Light Nether Fire Scripture" – Enables a cultivator to temper their Fetal Light soul and control Netherworld Ghost Fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Hidden Arrow Soul-Slayer Spear" – Allows a cultivator to transform their spine into a spear bone, unleashing soul-piercing screams during attacks, devastating to ghosts and souls alike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Red Beauty Withered Bones Curse" – Accelerates physical decay, almost exclusively suitable for women.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Ghost Embryo Concealing Art" – Allows cultivators (regardless of gender) to conceive and nurture a ghost embryo within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Soul Aroma Technique" – Enables cultivators to infuse their soul with a unique fragrance capable of penetrating deep into bones and souls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo had previously studied numerous texts on ghostly and soul techniques, thanks greatly to Tian Shuang, who provided many scriptures along with his personal cultivation insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning understood clearly: though the soul seemed unified, it comprised multiple distinct parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Typically, a complete soul was composed of three hun souls - Fetal Light, Refreshing Spirit, Hidden Essence - and seven po souls-Corpse Dog, Hidden Arrow, Sparrow Shade, Thief Swallower, Non-poisonous, Filth Remover, and Smelly Lung.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Unless extraordinarily gifted or practicing peculiar techniques, a soul would usually have no variations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Upon self-inspection, Ning Zhuo noticed his soul possessed an extra axe-like soul artifact, created from cultivating a special technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Observing the choices of others, Sun and Ning exchanged puzzled looks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Why is everyone picking 'Ghost Embryo Concealing Art' and 'Soul Aroma Technique'?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">To Sun and Ning, these were undoubtedly the most useless techniques presented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Curious about this anomaly, they soon discovered the reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">It turned out that the Hidden Yang Manor was merely a recruitment ground. All the male consorts would soon face an evaluation. Passing this test meant they could remain, and the exceptional ones might advance to the Vigoros Yang Manor, Radiant Sun Court, or Yin-Yang Court.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The conditions in these three courts far surpassed the Hidden Yang Manor, providing better prospects for cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">To enter Radiant Yang Court or Yin-Yang Court, cultivators needed to practice either "Soul Aroma Technique" or "Ghost Embryo Concealing Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Powerful practitioners could produce soul fragrances to please the White Paper City Lord, while the latter method allowed practitioners to harness Yin essence to bear ghostly offspring for the City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Naturally, these offspring weren't human but members of the ghost race!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo had yet to thoroughly cultivate his Three Supreme Methods, so he lacked interest in these new techniques, merely pretending to select one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Sun Lingtong was merely accompanying him and lacked the qualifications to choose a method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Jiao Ma, wait a moment, I have something to discuss," called a familiar male consort from their village, Yang Weida.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Weren't you taken away by Master Wen?" Ning asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"He dragged me around the outskirts of the city but found nothing. After returning, he just dumped me here to fend for myself!" Yang Weida replied bitterly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"What do you want?" Ning Zhuo asked, eager to resume cultivating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Yang Weida pulled Ning aside into a shadowy corner and whispered, "I noticed you didn't choose either of those two techniques, clearly aiming for the Vigoros Yang Manor. That's my goal as well!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Right now, I have an incredibly potent Virility Elixir - just a dab and you'll see instant results. Tempting, isn't it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"It's affordable, extremely reasonable - just this price..."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
