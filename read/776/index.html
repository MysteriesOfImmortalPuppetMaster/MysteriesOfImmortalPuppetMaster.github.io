<paragraph index="1">Where there are people, there are rivers and lakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">If Ning Zhuo were to go to Zhu Fenxiang for help, he would very likely offend Situ Xing, which would interfere with a previously arranged plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This plan involved leveraging the power of the group consisting of Shen Xi, Lin Jinglong, and Situ Xing to help him successfully complete more tasks during the Rising Cloud Assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Rising Cloud Minor Trial was merely for showing promise; the subsequent Rising Cloud Assembly was the true stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">When that time came, although one could succeed relying solely on oneself, leveraging the strength of others through mutual assistance would undoubtedly raise the ceiling of success much higher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"This decision requires caution." Ning Zhuo’s expression was serious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Although Meng Yehu's spirituality was on the verge of collapse and required an urgent solution, Ning Zhuo remained calm. He did not let panic distort his actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He immediately sent a Flying Letter to Chen San, instructing him to collect relevant intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">With ample funding and Chen San going all out, Ning Zhuo quickly gained a relatively clear understanding of the cultivators and forces within and outside the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s main mountain gate that were related to the Divine Summoning Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After understanding the situation, Ning Zhuo discovered that Zhu Fenxiang’s value was even greater than he thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"In that case, there is no need to cling to the Situ Xing line."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo rubbed the space between his eyebrows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He hadn’t intended to offend Situ Xing, but previously, because of Shen Xi, he had kept his distance from Situ Xing. Now, because of Meng Yehu, seeking out Zhu Fenxiang would make his relationship with Situ Xing even more tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"I might even be kicked out of that group."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Even so, Ning Zhuo had to make contact with Zhu Fenxiang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"I am an outsider."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Once in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, I am naturally neutral and can establish connections with any outsider or faction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Although Situ Xing and the Situ Clan are powerful, they aren't enough to make me overly apprehensive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">If he were truly apprehensive, Ning Zhuo wouldn't have adopted such an attitude toward Pi Fujie and Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The line of Situ Xing and Shen Xi was merely one of Ning Zhuo’s entry points. There were several similar entry points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">For example, the Demon Subjugation Hall, the Confucian cultivator community, or the reliable friends explicitly mentioned by Meng Yaoyin in her letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo had not deeply engaged with any of these yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"There’s no need!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Now is not the time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"I should remain flexible and adaptable, going with the flow of the situation before finally making a decision."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Before that, I need to wait patiently for the time to mature."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">It was far from the time for Ning Zhuo to truly place his bets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He maintained a flexible mindset, doing his utmost to increase his own value so that it would be easier to place his bets in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">When Ning Zhuo sought out Zhu Fenxiang, she was in the midst of healing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The quiet room was filled with a heavy scent of medicine and the smoke of offering incense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Zhu Fenxiang sat cross-legged on a prayer mat, her body steaming with a fog of spiritual energy that resembled incense smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Within the meridians of her body, specks of starlight remained. Each speck of starlight was like a miniature, icy sword edge, bringing a stinging pain and chill deep into Zhu Fenxiang's bone marrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">From her right chest to her shoulder, she was wrapped in thick white bandages. Bloodstains seeped intermittently through the surface of the bandages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Ning Zhuo?" She opened her eyes, a trace of confusion flashing through them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">A maidservant respectfully handed over Ning Zhuo’s visiting card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">She naturally knew of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhu Fenxiang had actively challenged Situ Xing this time, so she had investigated intelligence on him quite clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Therefore, she was also aware that Ning Zhuo and Shen Xi had a significant relationship, and that both were within Situ Xing’s small circle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"What is his intention in visiting at this moment?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Fenxiang’s fingertips unconsciously rubbed the edge of the visiting card as she made a decision: "Invite him in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Moments later, the door to the quiet room opened, and Ning Zhuo stepped inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhu Fenxiang’s probing gaze fell upon Ning Zhuo. Although she had long known Ning Zhuo’s appearance from intelligence reports, this was her first time meeting him in person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">She saw Ning Zhuo dressed in spotless plain white clothes, his gaze calm, his steps steady. His head was slightly large, and his entire being radiated confidence and youthful vigor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo also sized up Zhu Fenxiang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Zhu Fenxiang sat quietly cross-legged. Due to blood loss and other factors, her face was pale and her eyes dim. However, the lingering fighting spirit constantly demonstrated this person’s tenacity and composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Young Master Ning Zhuo." Zhu Fenxiang spoke first, her voice carrying a hint of raspiness due to her injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"You and Situ Xing are in the same group. Seeking me out at this moment - did he issue you an order, or do you have some advice of your own?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo immediately felt Zhu Fenxiang’s sharpness. She categorized Ning Zhuo as an enemy right from the start, revealing the domineering side of her nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He was not in a hurry to disassociate himself from Situ Xing; doing so would only make him look guilty and be detrimental to the upcoming negotiation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Miss Zhu Fenxiang, I have already heard of your heroic bearing in battle from Brother Shen Xi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Your thunderous methods this time, suppressing Situ Xing and breaking his Cycle of Heaven Starry Grand Formation - such a battle record is truly admirable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He cupped his hands slightly, his posture composed: "I have come to offer congratulations to Senior Sister."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"However, while victory is victory, the price Senior Sister paid is, like Situ Xing's, extremely heavy. It can be called a pyrrhic victory."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Speaking to this point, his gaze swept over Zhu Fenxiang’s bloodstained bandages and pale face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo’s voice suddenly rose a bit: "I have come because I wish to lend Miss Zhu Fenxiang a hand, to expand the fruits of this victory and turn a pyrrhic victory into a great victory!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Oh?" Zhu Fenxiang immediately became more interested. "Please elaborate, Young Master Ning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo nodded and pointed a finger at himself: "Miss Zhu Fenxiang, try to imagine this. If, at this moment, I publicly announce that I am leaving Situ Xing’s group to join forces with you, what would outsiders think?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Zhu Fenxiang raised her brows slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">She certainly knew the impact would be massive!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">On one hand, she had defeated Situ Xing and gained the momentum of victory. But she was also heavily injured, so the blow to the prestige of Situ Xing and the Situ Clan was not as huge as originally planned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">On the other hand, if Ning Zhuo broke away from Situ Xing to ally with Zhu Fenxiang... Given Ning Zhuo’s current reputation, where the outside world recognized him as a genius on the same level as Situ Xing, the public would undoubtedly look doubly favorably upon Zhu Fenxiang. They would also believe that Situ Xing’s defeat had caused him to lose the hearts of his people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Thirdly, Zhu Fenxiang had also secretly had a headache - Situ Xing’s group was too powerful. Just on paper, the top-tier geniuses included Situ Xing and Ning Zhuo, while Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong had also long been famous throughout the country, second only to the tier of Ning Zhuo and Situ Xing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Now, if Ning Zhuo joined her side, the enemy would painfully lose a strong ally. One out, one in - she would gain double.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhu Fenxiang fell silent for a moment, then looked at Ning Zhuo: "What does Young Master Ning want me to do for you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">By now, Ning Zhuo’s value was worlds apart from when he had first entered the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s mountain gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He smiled faintly: "I wouldn't visit without a reason. I would like to ask Miss Zhu to examine a mechanical construct. If you can resolve its predicament, I will certainly honor the agreement and form a united front with Miss Zhu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After speaking, Ning Zhuo slapped his storage belt and directly released a mechanical puppet - it was precisely the Shadow Blade Night Tiger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhu Fenxiang’s pupils constricted slightly as she looked Meng Yehu up and down, secretly surprised by its design and aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Although she did not practice mechanics, she could assess the value of the Shadow Blade Night Tiger from its appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">She also saw that Meng Yehu's body was constantly shrouded in a mass of mist-like yellow sand, which was constantly eroding and infiltrating this mechanism. Furthermore, it was self-contained and radiated the majesty of a god.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo asked with concern: "Miss Zhu, can it be solved?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Zhu Fenxiang: "I need to cast a spell to understand more. I will not make casual promises at this moment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly: "Since that is the case, let us first establish a Divine Contract."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">To use magic to investigate Meng Yehu, the internal situation of the mechanism would naturally be revealed. This represented both a loss and a risk, so means were naturally needed to enforce restraint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Zhu Fenxiang understood this naturally and immediately signed a Divine Contract with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Upon activating her Dharma Body to investigate, Zhu Fenxiang’s eyes suddenly widened, her expression changing instantly to one filled with shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">In that moment, she forgot to breathe as she looked at Ning Zhuo: "This rank... it is actually a Soul Formation method!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo’s face remained calm: "I am ashamed. I have not been cultivating for long, and my methods are weak. I found it difficult to resolve this Divine Power seal. I also know very little about its intricacies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Miss Zhu, can it be solved?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zhu Fenxiang continued to stare intently at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">She had not expected Ning Zhuo’s difficulty to involve something at the Soul Formation level. This was something she absolutely had not anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"A Soul Formation-level existence made a move against him? No, he is like me, only at the Foundation Establishment stage. More accurately, he is only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, whereas I am at the peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"With such a cultivation base, could he provoke a Soul Formation cultivator?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Even if he can leverage battle strength to fight a Golden Core cultivator, Soul Formation is..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Thoughts surged within Zhu Fenxiang’s divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"So, did he obtain some kind of opportunity?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Zhu Fenxiang thought of herself. Top-tier geniuses like her naturally had high Qi Luck and had encountered quite a few opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Zhu Fenxiang shook her head slightly and answered Ning Zhuo’s question first: "Since it concerns the Soul Formation level, I still need to investigate deeper. Please wait a moment, Young Master Ning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After a full ten minutes, during which Zhu Fenxiang cast spells continuously and switched between more than a dozen investigation methods...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Zhu Fenxiang made a judgment: "It can be solved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo secretly breathed a sigh of relief. With the Divine Contract binding her, he didn't worry about Zhu Fenxiang lying to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Before coming here, he had examined a lot of relevant intelligence. He discovered that although the Myriad Manifestations Sect was large and full of elites, under the current circumstances, Zhu Fenxiang really was the most suitable choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Within the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, there were naturally people with higher attainments in the Divine Summoning Art. There were also other cultivators with rich past battle records proving they could solve problems related to Divine Arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">But Ning Zhuo could not expose himself right now, nor could he rashly contact those people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Those capable of solving Meng Yehu's problem were definitely strong experts. Who knew what relationship these experts had with the higher-ups of the Myriad Manifestations Sect?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Because the higher-ups of the Myriad Manifestations Sect were currently engaging in a fierce contest and intense gambling surrounding the benefits of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Under these circumstances, the Meng Yehu that Ning Zhuo took out carried the Divine Power of the Lord of Forgetful River. This would too easily cause people to make connections!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">A super sect like the Myriad Manifestations Sect could easily obtain information regarding the aura of the Lord of Forgetful River's Divine Power. This level of intelligence was too low-grade for them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo did not want to expose himself prematurely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He had long understood that his true crisis would be the exposure of the secret of White Paper Immortal City. When that happened, he would be completely placed in the center of a massive vortex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">His current showing off and garnering of reputation was all to do his best to display himself and establish connections everywhere, making it easier for him to cope with that crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He needed to suppress the danger to the minimum and firmly grasp the opportunities!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Zhu Fenxiang said: "Relying on myself alone, it is absolutely impossible. But I can perform a summoning to invite True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard. He is a Great God! There will be absolutely no problem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"It's just that holding the ritual and asking the God to take action comes at a price..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo revealed a confident smile that said "I don't lack money": "That is easy to discuss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">To prove his financial power, Ning Zhuo grabbed a handful of Ghost Path Golden Cores and stuffed them directly into Zhu Fenxiang’s hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Zhu Fenxiang stared at the Golden Cores in her hand, completely dumbfounded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Young Master Ning, you! This, this, this..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">In this moment, Ning Zhuo was no longer just mysterious in her impression, but became unfathomable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Handsome, wealthy, and strong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Even though Zhu Fenxiang came from a prestigious family, she felt small in front of Ning Zhuo at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">This only increased her determination to win Ning Zhuo over from Situ Xing’s side to her own!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">With heavy gold clearing the way, the power was naturally extraordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">To show her sincerity in cooperation, Zhu Fenxiang disregarded her injuries and took the initiative to make preparations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">In just over two hours, she had prepared enough offerings and built a small sacrificial altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Zhu Fenxiang led Ning Zhuo out of the quiet room and into the depths of the cave dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">A divine altar was arranged here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Zhu Fenxiang stepped forward and placed a flawless god statue in the center of the divine altar. The statue was lifelike, depicting precisely the appearance of True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Earth Vein Dragon Marrow Incense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Zhu Fenxiang lit nine sticks in a row and inserted them into the dark gold incense burner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">This offering incense was as thick as a child's arm and the color of dark gold ore. Once lit, it produced no smoke but emitted light. The earth-yellow radiance condensed into a tangible substance, spiraling upward. Within the halo, the phantom of a dragon-shaped earth vein appeared faintly, emitting an aura that stabilized mountains and returned earth energy to its source.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Zhu Fenxiang, dressed in plain white ritual robes, stepped barefoot onto the edge of the divine altar, her face solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The divine markings on her brow lit up, emitting a scorching orange-yellow brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">She began to dance the sacrificial dance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">With every step her feet landed, dark gold ripples of light burst from her soles. Her waist twisted, her arms moved as if embracing the earth's core, her ten fingers formed hand seals, and the wide sleeves of her ritual robes fluttered, creating trails of golden light like flowing sand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The runes engraved on the divine altar lit up one after another, and the halos of the nine sticks of Dragon Marrow Incense surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Zhu Fenxiang chanted a prayer softly: "Dark and Yellow heavens as armor, suppressing and locking the great chiliocosm! The Nine Hells bow their heads, sins become the abyss! Believer Fenxiang uses her heart as a torch, her blood as stairs, respectfully inviting the True Lord, respectfully inviting the True Lord..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">An indifferent divine thought sensed the call from this place and swept over lightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">It was precisely True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The God's gaze fell upon the dancing Zhu Fenxiang, and He thought: "Rebellious servant, how dare you call my name again?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">During the previous battle with Situ Xing, Zhu Fenxiang had summoned a clone of True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard to descend. However, during the combat, the two sides had disagreed, creating a flaw that Situ Xing seized upon, nearly dragging Zhu Fenxiang down to defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Now, True Lord Shutu was very dissatisfied with Zhu Fenxiang. At a critical moment, she had committed an act of defiance against the God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"Why would this True Lord easily agree to your call?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">True Lord Shutu watched coldly from the sidelines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">He saw the offerings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">A handful of Nine Nether Soil, held in a Black Jade Box. The soil was a mix of black and gray, appearing as if the wailing of ten thousand ghosts was sealed within, yet with specks of starlight-like true meaning of reincarnation constantly flickering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">White Hua Warm Jade Marrow, shaped like droplets of molten gold. Each drop contained a giant earth vein, symbolizing the origin accumulated over ten years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">A section of a thick, giant spine, entirely like black jade, its surface covered with divine locking patterns. This was a Legacy Treasure from a Molted God!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">In the next moment, His Divine Power descended upon the god statue, forming a clone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Instantly, dark yellow divine light shot into the sky. The statue turned into a living entity, its divine might suppressing the prison and enveloping the surroundings of the divine altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Amidst the divine light, True Lord Shutu of the Prison Guard took a deep breath. The scent of this Earth Vein Dragon Marrow Incense - it was true fragrance!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
