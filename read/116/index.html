<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">With the final soft thud, the Buddha Gate disappeared, replaced by a seamless wall that blended perfectly with its surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"I did it!" Ning Zhuo was overjoyed, barely able to contain his laughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: ????</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">It was stunned, frozen like a statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">It took a moment for its gaping mouth to twitch and close slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Then, it threw its head back and roared furiously, spewing a massive column of fire from its throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo pressed on, managing to seal the Demon Gate as well, leaving no trace on the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit went berserk, bouncing around the main hall, slamming its head into pillars and floor tiles, making the entire Lava Immortal City shake violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At the mountain's peak, fire and lava erupted together, wildly out of control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Meng Kui sighed and activated the grand formation, exerting all his strength to subdue the raging Lava Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This was the most intense eruption in the city's history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Meng Kui guarded the formation for a full day and night before the city finally calmed down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">So exhausted! Even with his Nascent Soul cultivation, Meng Kui struggled to withstand the Lava Immortal City's repeated outbursts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After this ordeal, his face showed signs of weariness, with dark circles under his eyes and a much paler complexion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Soon, thick smoke covered him, obscuring his appearance and figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">After his soul returned to his body, Ning Zhuo took a Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pill and fell into a deep sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">While Meng Kui was laboriously suppressing the city's turmoil, Ning Zhuo slept soundly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After a day and night, Ning Zhuo woke up feeling refreshed, with most of his soul power restored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pill proved to be highly effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Xiao Ren came to visit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo, lying in bed, tried to get up, but Ning Xiao Ren stopped him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">With a look of guilt, Ning Zhuo said, "Uncle Xiao Ren, I have let you down. I am deeply ashamed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Xiao Ren gently reassured him, "This was unexpected. Who could have known the city had such mechanisms? It’s not your fault."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo nodded, "This incident made me realize my shortcomings. I want to read more books, especially those related to spirituality. Uncle Xiao Ren, you are a good friend of my father; you will help me, won't you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Uh..." Ning Xiao Ren was momentarily taken aback, inwardly cursing but outwardly maintaining a warm smile, "I'll see what I can find for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Rest in bed for a few days, don't overexert yourself and hinder your recovery."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Yes, Uncle Xiao Ren." Ning Zhuo bowed and then asked, "When will the books be delivered?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Xiao Ren coughed a couple of times and said, "I'll expedite the process and select the books for you as soon as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Lying in bed, Ning Zhuo also met with Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others, thanking them for their visits and gifts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Due to his previous efforts in supporting his peers, Ning Zhuo was quite popular within the reform team, especially among his classmates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Of course, this was Ning Zhuo's intentional effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">While they stood by his bedside talking to him, Ning Zhuo secretly used his embryonic divine power to connect each of them with a life thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This recent exploration of the Immortal Palace had significantly enhanced his life thread divine power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He had absorbed nine Illusory True Lotus seeds, causing the lotus joint to grow two new segments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Additionally, a fingernail-sized leaf had sprouted at the top of the lotus joint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">As soon as Ning Zhuo sensed the embryonic form of his divine power, he realized many things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"The life thread divine power has greatly improved; connecting my classmates with the life thread is now effortless! The qualitative change is that I can now add life threads to mechanical constructs with sufficient spirituality."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">All things have spirituality, but not all are fully spiritual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The first thing Ning Zhuo thought of was Yuan Dasheng! It was now in the active spirit stage, with full spirituality at tenfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">That night, after sleeping for most of the day, Ning Zhuo got up and went to his uncle Ning Ze's cultivation chamber to practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The guards immediately adjusted their positions, surrounding him protectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Amidst the floating clouds around him, Ning Zhuo summoned back the Golden Blood Battle Monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Within the clouds, he used his embryonic divine power on Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After some time, a nearly transparent life thread appeared above Yuan Dasheng's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"I did it!" Ning Zhuo was thrilled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Suddenly, he had a moment of enlightenment and gently tugged on the life thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The next moment, the life thread shook and lifted, its end holding a round, crimson spiritual essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The crimson essence was radiant, sometimes smooth and glossy, other times forming the cute, chattering head of a baby monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"I've pulled Yuan Dasheng's spiritual essence out!" The instigator, Ning Zhuo, was astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Just as the life thread pulled his soul from his body into the Immortal Palace, he had now achieved something similar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Yuan Dasheng had no soul, so Ning Zhuo had completely extracted its spiritual essence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Wait a moment!" Ning Zhuo took out another mechanical monkey from his storage bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This monkey automaton was crafted in collaboration with Zheng Jian, using the facilities of the Zheng family's forging room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Compared to the Golden Blood Battle Monkey, the materials used were of a much higher grade, generally two to three levels superior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This was because many things in the Lava Immortal Palace had restrictions based on the level of the challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Following his instincts, Ning Zhuo guided the life thread to connect with the new monkey automaton.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The spiritual essence attached to the life thread smoothly infused into the new mechanical monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The next moment, the monkey automaton opened its eyes, revealing two green lights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Tree Martial Battle Monkey • Dasheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The monkey automaton had a yellow and green color scheme, primarily made from steel vine tree, blazing wind wood, black tortoise star iron, and golden emperor quartz.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The monkey stood eight feet tall, with a slender build, long arms that extended past its knees, and a dignified, martial demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">To fully exhibit its combat prowess, Ning Zhuo designed the Tree Martial Battle Monkey • Dasheng with a jointed skeleton.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">It utilized life-rich wood for the body, which could be quickly repaired using grafting techniques even if damaged in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The most critical feature was the array of talisman slots Ning Zhuo had created, totaling six.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Currently, they were occupied by: Strength Talisman, Swift Wind Talisman, Growth Talisman, Black Tortoise Talisman, Diamond Talisman, and Sharp Blade Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo initially designed and crafted the Tree Martial Battle Monkey with the intent of training himself and gradually finding a body that closely matched Yuan Dasheng’s combat prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">To his surprise, the process went smoother than expected—he directly transferred Yuan Dasheng's spiritual essence into the Tree Martial Battle Monkey!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Without needing Ning Zhuo's command, the calmed spirit of Yuan Dasheng began to control the new body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">It moved continuously, starting with small actions like stretching its fingers, gradually transitioning to walking, and eventually dancing energetically, causing the floating clouds to churn violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Before it could create a bigger disturbance, Ning Zhuo promptly stopped it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"With this, I can keep Yuan Dasheng by my side," Ning Zhuo thought, delighted by this unexpected turn of events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But the surprises didn’t end there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Among the books sent by Ning Xiao Ren, Ning Zhuo discovered secrets about the active spirit stage!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
