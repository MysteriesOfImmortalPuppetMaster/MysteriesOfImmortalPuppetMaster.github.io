<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
With the final soft thud, the Buddha Gate disappeared, replaced by a seamless wall that blended perfectly with its surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
"I did it!" Ning Zhuo was overjoyed, barely able to contain his laughter.<br/>
<br/>
Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: ????<br/>
<br/>
It was stunned, frozen like a statue.<br/>
<br/>
It took a moment for its gaping mouth to twitch and close slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Then, it threw its head back and roared furiously, spewing a massive column of fire from its throat.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pressed on, managing to seal the Demon Gate as well, leaving no trace on the surface.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit went berserk, bouncing around the main hall, slamming its head into pillars and floor tiles, making the entire Lava Immortal City shake violently.<br/>
<br/>
At the mountain's peak, fire and lava erupted together, wildly out of control.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui sighed and activated the grand formation, exerting all his strength to subdue the raging Lava Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
This was the most intense eruption in the city's history.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui guarded the formation for a full day and night before the city finally calmed down.<br/>
<br/>
So exhausted! Even with his Nascent Soul cultivation, Meng Kui struggled to withstand the Lava Immortal City's repeated outbursts.<br/>
<br/>
After this ordeal, his face showed signs of weariness, with dark circles under his eyes and a much paler complexion.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, thick smoke covered him, obscuring his appearance and figure.<br/>
<br/>
After his soul returned to his body, Ning Zhuo took a Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pill and fell into a deep sleep.<br/>
<br/>
While Meng Kui was laboriously suppressing the city's turmoil, Ning Zhuo slept soundly.<br/>
<br/>
After a day and night, Ning Zhuo woke up feeling refreshed, with most of his soul power restored.<br/>
<br/>
The Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pill proved to be highly effective.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiao Ren came to visit.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, lying in bed, tried to get up, but Ning Xiao Ren stopped him.<br/>
<br/>
With a look of guilt, Ning Zhuo said, "Uncle Xiao Ren, I have let you down. I am deeply ashamed."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiao Ren gently reassured him, "This was unexpected. Who could have known the city had such mechanisms? It’s not your fault."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, "This incident made me realize my shortcomings. I want to read more books, especially those related to spirituality. Uncle Xiao Ren, you are a good friend of my father; you will help me, won't you?"<br/>
<br/>
"Uh..." Ning Xiao Ren was momentarily taken aback, inwardly cursing but outwardly maintaining a warm smile, "I'll see what I can find for you."<br/>
<br/>
"Rest in bed for a few days, don't overexert yourself and hinder your recovery."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, Uncle Xiao Ren." Ning Zhuo bowed and then asked, "When will the books be delivered?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiao Ren coughed a couple of times and said, "I'll expedite the process and select the books for you as soon as possible."<br/>
<br/>
Lying in bed, Ning Zhuo also met with Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others, thanking them for their visits and gifts.<br/>
<br/>
Due to his previous efforts in supporting his peers, Ning Zhuo was quite popular within the reform team, especially among his classmates.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this was Ning Zhuo's intentional effort.<br/>
<br/>
While they stood by his bedside talking to him, Ning Zhuo secretly used his embryonic divine power to connect each of them with a life thread.<br/>
<br/>
This recent exploration of the Immortal Palace had significantly enhanced his life thread divine power.<br/>
<br/>
He had absorbed nine Illusory True Lotus seeds, causing the lotus joint to grow two new segments.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, a fingernail-sized leaf had sprouted at the top of the lotus joint.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Ning Zhuo sensed the embryonic form of his divine power, he realized many things.<br/>
<br/>
"The life thread divine power has greatly improved; connecting my classmates with the life thread is now effortless! The qualitative change is that I can now add life threads to mechanical constructs with sufficient spirituality."<br/>
<br/>
All things have spirituality, but not all are fully spiritual.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing Ning Zhuo thought of was Yuan Dasheng! It was now in the active spirit stage, with full spirituality at tenfold.<br/>
<br/>
That night, after sleeping for most of the day, Ning Zhuo got up and went to his uncle Ning Ze's cultivation chamber to practice.<br/>
<br/>
The guards immediately adjusted their positions, surrounding him protectively.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the floating clouds around him, Ning Zhuo summoned back the Golden Blood Battle Monkey.<br/>
<br/>
Within the clouds, he used his embryonic divine power on Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
After some time, a nearly transparent life thread appeared above Yuan Dasheng's head.<br/>
<br/>
"I did it!" Ning Zhuo was thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he had a moment of enlightenment and gently tugged on the life thread.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, the life thread shook and lifted, its end holding a round, crimson spiritual essence.<br/>
<br/>
The crimson essence was radiant, sometimes smooth and glossy, other times forming the cute, chattering head of a baby monkey.<br/>
<br/>
"I've pulled Yuan Dasheng's spiritual essence out!" The instigator, Ning Zhuo, was astonished.<br/>
<br/>
Just as the life thread pulled his soul from his body into the Immortal Palace, he had now achieved something similar.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng had no soul, so Ning Zhuo had completely extracted its spiritual essence!<br/>
<br/>
"Wait a moment!" Ning Zhuo took out another mechanical monkey from his storage bag.<br/>
<br/>
This monkey automaton was crafted in collaboration with Zheng Jian, using the facilities of the Zheng family's forging room.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the Golden Blood Battle Monkey, the materials used were of a much higher grade, generally two to three levels superior.<br/>
<br/>
This was because many things in the Lava Immortal Palace had restrictions based on the level of the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Following his instincts, Ning Zhuo guided the life thread to connect with the new monkey automaton.<br/>
<br/>
The spiritual essence attached to the life thread smoothly infused into the new mechanical monkey.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, the monkey automaton opened its eyes, revealing two green lights.<br/>
<br/>
Tree Martial Battle Monkey • Dasheng!<br/>
<br/>
The monkey automaton had a yellow and green color scheme, primarily made from steel vine tree, blazing wind wood, black tortoise star iron, and golden emperor quartz.<br/>
<br/>
The monkey stood eight feet tall, with a slender build, long arms that extended past its knees, and a dignified, martial demeanor.<br/>
<br/>
To fully exhibit its combat prowess, Ning Zhuo designed the Tree Martial Battle Monkey • Dasheng with a jointed skeleton.<br/>
<br/>
It utilized life-rich wood for the body, which could be quickly repaired using grafting techniques even if damaged in battle.<br/>
<br/>
The most critical feature was the array of talisman slots Ning Zhuo had created, totaling six.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, they were occupied by: Strength Talisman, Swift Wind Talisman, Growth Talisman, Black Tortoise Talisman, Diamond Talisman, and Sharp Blade Talisman.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo initially designed and crafted the Tree Martial Battle Monkey with the intent of training himself and gradually finding a body that closely matched Yuan Dasheng’s combat prowess.<br/>
<br/>
To his surprise, the process went smoother than expected—he directly transferred Yuan Dasheng's spiritual essence into the Tree Martial Battle Monkey!<br/>
<br/>
Without needing Ning Zhuo's command, the calmed spirit of Yuan Dasheng began to control the new body.<br/>
<br/>
It moved continuously, starting with small actions like stretching its fingers, gradually transitioning to walking, and eventually dancing energetically, causing the floating clouds to churn violently.<br/>
<br/>
Before it could create a bigger disturbance, Ning Zhuo promptly stopped it.<br/>
<br/>
"With this, I can keep Yuan Dasheng by my side," Ning Zhuo thought, delighted by this unexpected turn of events.<br/>
<br/>
But the surprises didn’t end there.<br/>
<br/>
Among the books sent by Ning Xiao Ren, Ning Zhuo discovered secrets about the active spirit stage!</div>
