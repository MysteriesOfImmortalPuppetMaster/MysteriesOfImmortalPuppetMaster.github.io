<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“I killed Wulan!” Ning Zhuo’s spirits surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, yet on the battlefield he had still managed to powerfully kill a Golden Core–level cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In terms of combat strength, Wulan was no ordinary Golden Core. He was definitely among the stronger Golden Core cultivators!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Cultivation across a hundred arts is like a lever —it can continuously magnify the original source of power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“By means of mechanisms and battle formations, I gathered the army’s strength and bestowed it upon myself. Slaying a Golden Core–level expert isn’t all that surprising.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo quickly calmed down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“How many merits does killing a single Golden Core expert count for?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“No big deal.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“What I need to think about is how to kill more Golden Core cultivators, or even Nascent Soul–level enemies!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Tu Ming, who had just been here, had already fled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This high priest of the Hundred Poison Tribe had fled in the last ambush, and now he’d done it again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“I wonder if Shen Qinghe can catch him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Shen Qinghe is a well-known Nascent Soul cultivator of the Embroidery Kingdom. She mainly cultivates the Green Spirit Toxin-Purification Scripture, which specifically counters poison cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“But Tu Ming is a local here, familiar with the terrain, and he may have prearranged a teleportation array. It’s not impossible for him to escape.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, then immediately reined in his wandering thoughts. The fighting spirit in his eyes shifted toward the purple-black poisonous mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Inside that poisonous mist, Diao Ye felt a chill all over!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">They had come on this trip with three people total. Now the strongest, Tu Ming, had run away. Wulan, who was of the same cultivation realm, was reduced to a corpse, leaving only Diao Ye alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He was truly alone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Run!” Diao Ye shouted, frantically activating his spiritual power. Hundreds of poisonous-mist clones condensed and scattered in different directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Each of these poisonous clones was dark purple. To hide his real form, Diao Ye also wrapped himself in a layer of purple-black poisonous fog.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Where do you think you’re going!” Zhang Hei bellowed, brandishing his Black Snake Spear. Spiritual power and military force surged into the spear simultaneously. Once again he unleashed his art of war —Overwhelming Army Advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">A vast tide of soldiers rushed forward, drowning more than half of the poisonous clones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Innate Talent —Purple-Whisker Soaring Rainbow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Guan Hong also employed his innate talent, immobilizing a small portion of the poisonous clones. The blade light of the Blood Dragon Blade followed immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Diao Ye was hidden among them; his disguise of purple-black poisonous mist was shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Liu Er, sword in hand, attacked at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Diao Ye’s eyes widened in fury. The intent to fight to the death was fully ignited: “If you want my life, at least one of you will accompany me to the grave!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Poison Art —Nether Toxin Mutual Destruction!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Diao Ye turned entirely purple, transforming into a purple poisonous being. He turned back around, charging straight toward Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Startled, Liu Er quickly retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">But Diao Ye’s speed was incredibly fast, rapidly closing the distance. He was about to strike Liu Er right in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">At the critical moment, Guan Hong rushed over to assist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“You will not harm my brother!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Guan Hong thrust out his right arm in a forceful palm strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Martial Technique —Right Block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">A profound light erupted from his right arm, like a shield intercepting Diao Ye’s desperate counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The next moment, Diao Ye exploded in a thunderous blast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Amid the explosion, waves of purple-black air blasted in all directions. A toxic spear shot out from within, only palm-sized but incredibly sharp. It pierced right through the profound light, stabbing into the bone of Guan Hong’s right arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Even someone as tough as Guan Hong, under such intense pain, let out a low roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Second Brother!” Liu Er rushed over, casting a healing spell onto Guan Hong’s wounded right arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">In the span of just a few breaths, the poison had corroded the flesh of the wound, leaving behind only bare bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Under Liu Er’s spell, the bone was barely preserved and did not rot into two pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Guan Hong put away his Blood Dragon Blade, grasped his right forearm with his left hand, and staggered back into the army formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">This made Ning Zhuo’s heart jolt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“War is perilous!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“I still have to be cautious.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Even someone like Guan Hong was injured. If I end up in a similar situation, I’ll be in a much tougher spot.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“After all, my physical cultivation foundation is far inferior to that of Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">By now Ning Zhuo had also realized that in a large-scale battle like this, a cultivator with some physical-cultivation background held a considerable advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">According to the three supreme methods he practiced, Ning Zhuo supposedly had no weak points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">But so far, Ning Zhuo was ultimately more proficient in spell-casting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">It wasn’t that he was slacking in cultivation or that his techniques weren’t comprehensive, but that he simply hadn’t had enough time to train.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">At present, Ning Zhuo was only sixteen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Previously in Medicine Valley, he greatly boosted his close-range combat abilities. However, this improvement was only major compared to his older self. Compared to elite Golden Core experts like Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei, it still fell far short.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Cleaning up the battlefield wasn’t difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Because this time, the Three-Generals Camp’s opponents were only three people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo collected Wulan’s corpse. As for Diao Ye, who had self-destructed, even his Golden Core had been blown to bits —no remains at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The main work for the Three-Generals Camp was to gather their own fallen comrades’ remains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">For ordinary cultivators, even that was not easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Corpses left behind after being poisoned could poison anyone who came too close without proper, complete protective measures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ultimately, the Three-Generals Camp was not so well-equipped. After Ning Zhuo sacrificed a dozen or so puppet constructs and Liu Er personally took action, they managed to temporarily handle their comrades’ remains and collect them one by one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In the world of cultivation, there were many demonic methods adept at using corpses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Therefore, bodies on the battlefield were usually reclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">They would be transported back home, most of them buried in their families’ ancestral lands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Not only did this signify returning to one’s roots, it also helped the souls of the deceased reunite quickly with the ancestors in the underworld, preventing them from turning into wandering ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">After busying themselves for more than an hour, the Three-Generals Camp finally saw Shen Qinghe return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Shen Qinghe’s robe was stained with blood and poison, but her expression remained cold and indifferent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Seeing Shen Qinghe come back empty-handed, Liu Er’s heart sank. He gave a cupped-fist salute to inquire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Shen Qinghe’s eyes were clear as water. She discerned Liu Er’s intent the moment he opened his mouth and interrupted him directly: “Tu Ming escaped.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Liu Er, Guan Hong, Zhang Hei, and Ning Zhuo practically sighed at the same time in their hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Tu Ming was a Nascent Soul–level True Lord as well as the High Priest of the Hundred Poison Tribe. Whether in combat strength or status, he was extraordinary. If they could have taken him down, the Three-Generals Camp would have scored enormous merit this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">But Shen Qinghe had come up empty-handed. All the Three-Generals Camp had were the lives of two Golden Core–level cultivators, Wulan and Diao Ye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">At once, Liu Er hurried to console her, expressing his sincere gratitude for her timely aid and showing concern for her as a senior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Not long after, Shen Qinghe stated calmly, “You don’t need to linger here any longer. Head back.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Liu Er could hardly believe his ears, until Shen Qinghe took out a jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Shen Qinghe shook her head slightly. “It’s Du Tiechuan’s arrangement.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“He dispatched four separate armies and predicted what Thousand Peaks Forest would do.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“As of now, his predictions have been quite accurate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“All right, after this battle, you can return to your base.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">She did not elaborate further but simply repeated the message in the jade slip. Du Tiechuan’s seal was verified without issue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Du Tiechuan ordered the Three-Generals Camp to pull back, because by this point, the probe into Thousand Peaks Forest’s defenses had yielded a clear result.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He requested that the Three-Generals Camp quicken their pace to reach a specified location and join the grand assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Furthermore, his letter warned that if the Three-Generals Camp delayed or hesitated, there would be a thorough reckoning after the war.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Liu Er’s expression grew complicated, and he could not help seeing Du Tiechuan in a new light. He sighed quietly, “Marshal Du...indeed he was sent here by the Two Note Kingdom as the commanding general.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">But Ning Zhuo’s mind was not on that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He was silently using his divine sense to discuss matters with Sun Lingtong: “Boss, from the looks of this, Du Tiechuan must have arranged reinforcements for the other three detachments as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Sun Lingtong wholeheartedly agreed: “Little Zhuo, I think so too. You won’t have many more opportunities to earn merit in the Three-Generals Camp, so why not go to the other detachments and give it a try? Maybe you’ll bag more achievements!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong truly was Ning Zhuo’s closest brother. Before Ning Zhuo could fully voice his idea, Sun Lingtong had already said it first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo nodded. “If that’s the case, I’ll go to the Red Flower Camp first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The other three detachments were the Red Flower Camp, the Barbarian Demon Camp, and the Golden Halberd Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He had no good relationship with Sun Gan of the Golden Halberd Army, and that was an elite imperial unit. Ning Zhuo felt that if he showed up there, he’d probably be sidelined as someone trying to poach credit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He barely knew Xu Dali of the Barbarian Demon Camp, and that man was very rigid. Ning Zhuo found the thought of dealing with him a bit troublesome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">His real first choice was the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Mu Lan was the commander of the Red Flower Camp. She and Ning Zhuo had quite a history —so far that they were once husband and wife.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Most crucially, Mu Lan had given Ning Zhuo a talisman before departing from Wooden Wheel Town, telling him: in a crisis, he could crush it and teleport to the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">If he were too far away for a direct teleport, it would still bring him halfway, to the correct route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">With this in mind, Ning Zhuo requested leave from Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Upon hearing this, Zhang Hei immediately shouted, “Great idea, Advisor! If you’re heading out to another front to grab some merits, take me with you. Fighting these three poison-users, I never got a satisfying battle!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Even Guan Hong, despite his injuries, stroked his beard and showed some interest. Yet in the next moment, a slight frown appeared; the sharp pain in his injured right arm reminded him that what he truly needed now was rest and healing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">When Liu Er heard that Ning Zhuo wanted to leave for the Red Flower Camp, a sense of distaste and displeasure rose in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He suppressed these emotions and spoke words of concern: “That might not be appropriate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Advisor, you just experienced a fierce battle, and lost many of your puppet constructs. Moreover, you’re still only a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and we’re deep in enemy territory where dangers lurk everywhere. If you leave the army on your own, it’s too risky.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly at that. “General Liu, you may not know, but before I left Wooden Wheel Town, General Mu Lan secretly gave me a protective talisman...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo gave a brief explanation of the talisman’s powers to the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Despite the pain, Guan Hong’s face was steady, and he nodded calmly. “If the Advisor has that kind of method, indeed it will reduce many hazards and be quite safe.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Zhang Hei lamented, “Which means I can’t go with you, Advisor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">After saying that, he was still unwilling to give up. He looked at Liu Er. “Eldest Brother, how about I operate alone? Let the Advisor go on ahead, and later on I’ll hurry to catch up to the Red Flower Camp to assist our allies!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">At Liu Er’s glare, Zhang Hei backed down. “Third Brother, stop your nonsense!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He intended to continue persuading Ning Zhuo otherwise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">But how could Ning Zhuo be swayed by a few words? He simply cupped his hands. “Three Generals, we shall seek a chance to reunite in the future. I will take my leave now and strive to go and return quickly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo swiftly left the Three-Generals Camp and went to a secluded spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">First, he released many puppet constructs, purposely destroying them and gathering their power to strengthen himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">He raised his level to that of a Golden Core, then took out the talisman Mu Lan had given him, crushing it without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">In the next moment, ripples formed in the air, violently shaking the space as it swallowed Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Moon Hook Giantwood Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Beneath the dark night sky, the crescent moon overhead now had three red flowers attached to it in a shimmering vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The entire Red Flower Camp was huddled together, exhausted from defending.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Their opponent was a rain of arrows descending from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Each arrow was made of moonlight, brilliant yet harboring deadly menace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Meanwhile, Di Lu, a Nascent Soul–level barbaric cultivator adept at close combat, was clashing with Mu Lan. For now, neither side could gain the upper hand, and the battle was growing more intense by the moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“Damn it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“We can’t form the Red Flower Aspect. Our entire force is in real danger.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Red Flower Camp’s mainstay technique was the Red Flower Battle Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">In such dire straits, only the Red Flower Battle Formation could stabilize their footing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Mu Lan was an experienced warrior. She knew this perfectly well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Because of that, she spared no expense in soldiers and resources, attempting a third time to form the array, but it still failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Di Lu gave a cold snort. “Mu Lan, don’t bother struggling. This place is going to be your grave!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">While Mu Lan and the Red Flower Camp fought bitterly, a Nascent Soul cultivator observed from a distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">On his shoulder stood a parrot-like myna bird.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Strangely, the myna bird also emanated a Nascent Soul–level aura. At the moment, it spoke via divine sense: “Master, if we don’t intervene soon, this unit is really going to suffer heavy losses.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The Nascent Soul cultivator gave a faint nod. “Indeed, the Red Flower Camp is a fine army. It would be a shame to lose them. But the orders I received were to delay. Even if the entire Red Flower Camp were wiped out, it would still be acceptable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">“So long as Mu Lan stays alive in the end, that’s enough.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The myna was taken aback. “Another round of those court power struggles! Ugh, what a killjoy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The man and bird both fell silent, quietly watching the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Barring any surprises, the fight would unfold exactly the way they anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">But reality is wonderful precisely because accidents happen without warning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Mu Lan sensed something and hesitated. “Ning Zhuo used the protective talisman I gave him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">She gritted her teeth and chose to expend a huge amount of military force to guide Ning Zhuo’s arrival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The space suddenly shook, and at the heart of the battlefield, a person appeared out of thin air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">He wore white clothes, had the face of a youth, and a slightly large head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Who else could it be but Ning Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“Who is that?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">“A mere Golden Core?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">“No, he’s not even Golden Core —only Foundation Establishment!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The Cangyue Ancient God presiding over the battlefield was startled at first, but then relaxed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">However, Di Lu messaged him via divine sense, telling him to be wary of Ning Zhuo, who performed very well in the previous ambush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">“No matter how strong he is, he’s only at Golden Core,” the Cangyue Ancient God thought. Elevated to deityhood for so long, he still did not regard Ning Zhuo as a threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Ning Zhuo glanced around at the battlefield, suppressing his curiosity about the night sky. He spoke, “So it’s another domain, huh?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">“Heh, we have one as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">“Old Dice, come on out!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">“Yes, Master.” The next moment, the Dice-Bone Demon God manifested in its original form, appearing ferociously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Dice-Bone Domain swiftly spread out, eroding a section of space and standing in opposition to the Cangyue Domain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">The Cangyue Ancient God’s expression changed abruptly, and he cried out, “Dice-Bone Demon God! What are you doing here?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Dice-Bone Demon God replied, “Cangyue God, if you switch allegiances now, it’s still not too late.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">The Cangyue Ancient God bristled. “I... you...”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
