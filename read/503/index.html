<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
“I killed Wulan!” Ning Zhuo’s spirits surged.<br/>
<br/>
He was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, yet on the battlefield he had still managed to powerfully kill a Golden Core–level cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of combat strength, Wulan was no ordinary Golden Core. He was definitely among the stronger Golden Core cultivators!<br/>
<br/>
“Cultivation across a hundred arts is like a lever —it can continuously magnify the original source of power.”<br/>
<br/>
“By means of mechanisms and battle formations, I gathered the army’s strength and bestowed it upon myself. Slaying a Golden Core–level expert isn’t all that surprising.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly calmed down.<br/>
<br/>
“How many merits does killing a single Golden Core expert count for?”<br/>
<br/>
“No big deal.”<br/>
<br/>
“What I need to think about is how to kill more Golden Core cultivators, or even Nascent Soul–level enemies!”<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming, who had just been here, had already fled.<br/>
<br/>
This high priest of the Hundred Poison Tribe had fled in the last ambush, and now he’d done it again.<br/>
<br/>
“I wonder if Shen Qinghe can catch him?”<br/>
<br/>
“Shen Qinghe is a well-known Nascent Soul cultivator of the Embroidery Kingdom. She mainly cultivates the Green Spirit Toxin-Purification Scripture, which specifically counters poison cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
“But Tu Ming is a local here, familiar with the terrain, and he may have prearranged a teleportation array. It’s not impossible for him to escape.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, then immediately reined in his wandering thoughts. The fighting spirit in his eyes shifted toward the purple-black poisonous mist.<br/>
<br/>
Inside that poisonous mist, Diao Ye felt a chill all over!<br/>
<br/>
They had come on this trip with three people total. Now the strongest, Tu Ming, had run away. Wulan, who was of the same cultivation realm, was reduced to a corpse, leaving only Diao Ye alone.<br/>
<br/>
He was truly alone!<br/>
<br/>
“Run!” Diao Ye shouted, frantically activating his spiritual power. Hundreds of poisonous-mist clones condensed and scattered in different directions.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these poisonous clones was dark purple. To hide his real form, Diao Ye also wrapped himself in a layer of purple-black poisonous fog.<br/>
<br/>
“Where do you think you’re going!” Zhang Hei bellowed, brandishing his Black Snake Spear. Spiritual power and military force surged into the spear simultaneously. Once again he unleashed his art of war —Overwhelming Army Advance.<br/>
<br/>
A vast tide of soldiers rushed forward, drowning more than half of the poisonous clones.<br/>
<br/>
Innate Talent —Purple-Whisker Soaring Rainbow!<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong also employed his innate talent, immobilizing a small portion of the poisonous clones. The blade light of the Blood Dragon Blade followed immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Diao Ye was hidden among them; his disguise of purple-black poisonous mist was shattered.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, sword in hand, attacked at once.<br/>
<br/>
Diao Ye’s eyes widened in fury. The intent to fight to the death was fully ignited: “If you want my life, at least one of you will accompany me to the grave!”<br/>
<br/>
Poison Art —Nether Toxin Mutual Destruction!<br/>
<br/>
Diao Ye turned entirely purple, transforming into a purple poisonous being. He turned back around, charging straight toward Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
Startled, Liu Er quickly retreated.<br/>
<br/>
But Diao Ye’s speed was incredibly fast, rapidly closing the distance. He was about to strike Liu Er right in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
At the critical moment, Guan Hong rushed over to assist.<br/>
<br/>
“You will not harm my brother!”<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong thrust out his right arm in a forceful palm strike.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Technique —Right Block.<br/>
<br/>
A profound light erupted from his right arm, like a shield intercepting Diao Ye’s desperate counterattack.<br/>
<br/>
Boom.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Diao Ye exploded in a thunderous blast.<br/>
<br/>
Amid the explosion, waves of purple-black air blasted in all directions. A toxic spear shot out from within, only palm-sized but incredibly sharp. It pierced right through the profound light, stabbing into the bone of Guan Hong’s right arm.<br/>
<br/>
Even someone as tough as Guan Hong, under such intense pain, let out a low roar.<br/>
<br/>
“Second Brother!” Liu Er rushed over, casting a healing spell onto Guan Hong’s wounded right arm.<br/>
<br/>
In the span of just a few breaths, the poison had corroded the flesh of the wound, leaving behind only bare bone.<br/>
<br/>
Under Liu Er’s spell, the bone was barely preserved and did not rot into two pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong put away his Blood Dragon Blade, grasped his right forearm with his left hand, and staggered back into the army formation.<br/>
<br/>
This made Ning Zhuo’s heart jolt.<br/>
<br/>
“War is perilous!”<br/>
<br/>
“I still have to be cautious.”<br/>
<br/>
“Even someone like Guan Hong was injured. If I end up in a similar situation, I’ll be in a much tougher spot.”<br/>
<br/>
“After all, my physical cultivation foundation is far inferior to that of Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei.”<br/>
<br/>
By now Ning Zhuo had also realized that in a large-scale battle like this, a cultivator with some physical-cultivation background held a considerable advantage.<br/>
<br/>
According to the three supreme methods he practiced, Ning Zhuo supposedly had no weak points.<br/>
<br/>
But so far, Ning Zhuo was ultimately more proficient in spell-casting.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn’t that he was slacking in cultivation or that his techniques weren’t comprehensive, but that he simply hadn’t had enough time to train.<br/>
<br/>
At present, Ning Zhuo was only sixteen.<br/>
<br/>
Previously in Medicine Valley, he greatly boosted his close-range combat abilities. However, this improvement was only major compared to his older self. Compared to elite Golden Core experts like Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei, it still fell far short.<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning up the battlefield wasn’t difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Because this time, the Three-Generals Camp’s opponents were only three people.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo collected Wulan’s corpse. As for Diao Ye, who had self-destructed, even his Golden Core had been blown to bits —no remains at all.<br/>
<br/>
The main work for the Three-Generals Camp was to gather their own fallen comrades’ remains.<br/>
<br/>
For ordinary cultivators, even that was not easy.<br/>
<br/>
Corpses left behind after being poisoned could poison anyone who came too close without proper, complete protective measures.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, the Three-Generals Camp was not so well-equipped. After Ning Zhuo sacrificed a dozen or so puppet constructs and Liu Er personally took action, they managed to temporarily handle their comrades’ remains and collect them one by one.<br/>
<br/>
In the world of cultivation, there were many demonic methods adept at using corpses.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, bodies on the battlefield were usually reclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
They would be transported back home, most of them buried in their families’ ancestral lands.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did this signify returning to one’s roots, it also helped the souls of the deceased reunite quickly with the ancestors in the underworld, preventing them from turning into wandering ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
After busying themselves for more than an hour, the Three-Generals Camp finally saw Shen Qinghe return.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Qinghe’s robe was stained with blood and poison, but her expression remained cold and indifferent.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Shen Qinghe come back empty-handed, Liu Er’s heart sank. He gave a cupped-fist salute to inquire.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Qinghe’s eyes were clear as water. She discerned Liu Er’s intent the moment he opened his mouth and interrupted him directly: “Tu Ming escaped.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, Guan Hong, Zhang Hei, and Ning Zhuo practically sighed at the same time in their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming was a Nascent Soul–level True Lord as well as the High Priest of the Hundred Poison Tribe. Whether in combat strength or status, he was extraordinary. If they could have taken him down, the Three-Generals Camp would have scored enormous merit this time.<br/>
<br/>
But Shen Qinghe had come up empty-handed. All the Three-Generals Camp had were the lives of two Golden Core–level cultivators, Wulan and Diao Ye.<br/>
<br/>
At once, Liu Er hurried to console her, expressing his sincere gratitude for her timely aid and showing concern for her as a senior.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after, Shen Qinghe stated calmly, “You don’t need to linger here any longer. Head back.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er could hardly believe his ears, until Shen Qinghe took out a jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Qinghe shook her head slightly. “It’s Du Tiechuan’s arrangement.”<br/>
<br/>
“He dispatched four separate armies and predicted what Thousand Peaks Forest would do.”<br/>
<br/>
“As of now, his predictions have been quite accurate.”<br/>
<br/>
“All right, after this battle, you can return to your base.”<br/>
<br/>
She did not elaborate further but simply repeated the message in the jade slip. Du Tiechuan’s seal was verified without issue.<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan ordered the Three-Generals Camp to pull back, because by this point, the probe into Thousand Peaks Forest’s defenses had yielded a clear result.<br/>
<br/>
He requested that the Three-Generals Camp quicken their pace to reach a specified location and join the grand assault.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, his letter warned that if the Three-Generals Camp delayed or hesitated, there would be a thorough reckoning after the war.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s expression grew complicated, and he could not help seeing Du Tiechuan in a new light. He sighed quietly, “Marshal Du...indeed he was sent here by the Twin Rivers Kingdom as the commanding general.”<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo’s mind was not on that.<br/>
<br/>
He was silently using his divine sense to discuss matters with Sun Lingtong: “Boss, from the looks of this, Du Tiechuan must have arranged reinforcements for the other three detachments as well.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong wholeheartedly agreed: “Little Zhuo, I think so too. You won’t have many more opportunities to earn merit in the Three-Generals Camp, so why not go to the other detachments and give it a try? Maybe you’ll bag more achievements!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong truly was Ning Zhuo’s closest brother. Before Ning Zhuo could fully voice his idea, Sun Lingtong had already said it first.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. “If that’s the case, I’ll go to the Red Flower Camp first.”<br/>
<br/>
The other three detachments were the Red Flower Camp, the Barbarian Demon Camp, and the Golden Halberd Army.<br/>
<br/>
He had no good relationship with Sun Gan of the Golden Halberd Army, and that was an elite imperial unit. Ning Zhuo felt that if he showed up there, he’d probably be sidelined as someone trying to poach credit.<br/>
<br/>
He barely knew Xu Dali of the Barbarian Demon Camp, and that man was very rigid. Ning Zhuo found the thought of dealing with him a bit troublesome.<br/>
<br/>
His real first choice was the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan was the commander of the Red Flower Camp. She and Ning Zhuo had quite a history —so far that they were once husband and wife.<br/>
<br/>
Most crucially, Mu Lan had given Ning Zhuo a talisman before departing from Wooden Wheel Town, telling him: in a crisis, he could crush it and teleport to the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
If he were too far away for a direct teleport, it would still bring him halfway, to the correct route.<br/>
<br/>
With this in mind, Ning Zhuo requested leave from Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei.<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing this, Zhang Hei immediately shouted, “Great idea, Advisor! If you’re heading out to another front to grab some merits, take me with you. Fighting these three poison-users, I never got a satisfying battle!”<br/>
<br/>
Even Guan Hong, despite his injuries, stroked his beard and showed some interest. Yet in the next moment, a slight frown appeared; the sharp pain in his injured right arm reminded him that what he truly needed now was rest and healing.<br/>
<br/>
When Liu Er heard that Ning Zhuo wanted to leave for the Red Flower Camp, a sense of distaste and displeasure rose in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
He suppressed these emotions and spoke words of concern: “That might not be appropriate.”<br/>
<br/>
“Advisor, you just experienced a fierce battle, and lost many of your puppet constructs. Moreover, you’re still only a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and we’re deep in enemy territory where dangers lurk everywhere. If you leave the army on your own, it’s too risky.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled slightly at that. “General Liu, you may not know, but before I left Wooden Wheel Town, General Mu Lan secretly gave me a protective talisman...”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gave a brief explanation of the talisman’s powers to the others.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the pain, Guan Hong’s face was steady, and he nodded calmly. “If the Advisor has that kind of method, indeed it will reduce many hazards and be quite safe.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei lamented, “Which means I can’t go with you, Advisor.”<br/>
<br/>
After saying that, he was still unwilling to give up. He looked at Liu Er. “Eldest Brother, how about I operate alone? Let the Advisor go on ahead, and later on I’ll hurry to catch up to the Red Flower Camp to assist our allies!”<br/>
<br/>
At Liu Er’s glare, Zhang Hei backed down. “Third Brother, stop your nonsense!”<br/>
<br/>
He intended to continue persuading Ning Zhuo otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
But how could Ning Zhuo be swayed by a few words? He simply cupped his hands. “Three Generals, we shall seek a chance to reunite in the future. I will take my leave now and strive to go and return quickly.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo swiftly left the Three-Generals Camp and went to a secluded spot.<br/>
<br/>
First, he released many puppet constructs, purposely destroying them and gathering their power to strengthen himself.<br/>
<br/>
He raised his level to that of a Golden Core, then took out the talisman Mu Lan had given him, crushing it without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, ripples formed in the air, violently shaking the space as it swallowed Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Moon Hook Giantwood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Beneath the dark night sky, the crescent moon overhead now had three red flowers attached to it in a shimmering vision.<br/>
<br/>
The entire Red Flower Camp was huddled together, exhausted from defending.<br/>
<br/>
Their opponent was a rain of arrows descending from the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Each arrow was made of moonlight, brilliant yet harboring deadly menace.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Di Lu, a Nascent Soul–level barbaric cultivator adept at close combat, was clashing with Mu Lan. For now, neither side could gain the upper hand, and the battle was growing more intense by the moment.<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it!”<br/>
<br/>
“We can’t form the Red Flower Aspect. Our entire force is in real danger.”<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Camp’s mainstay technique was the Red Flower Battle Formation.<br/>
<br/>
In such dire straits, only the Red Flower Battle Formation could stabilize their footing.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan was an experienced warrior. She knew this perfectly well.<br/>
<br/>
Because of that, she spared no expense in soldiers and resources, attempting a third time to form the array, but it still failed.<br/>
<br/>
Di Lu gave a cold snort. “Mu Lan, don’t bother struggling. This place is going to be your grave!”<br/>
<br/>
While Mu Lan and the Red Flower Camp fought bitterly, a Nascent Soul cultivator observed from a distance.<br/>
<br/>
On his shoulder stood a parrot-like myna bird.<br/>
<br/>
Strangely, the myna bird also emanated a Nascent Soul–level aura. At the moment, it spoke via divine sense: “Master, if we don’t intervene soon, this unit is really going to suffer heavy losses.”<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul cultivator gave a faint nod. “Indeed, the Red Flower Camp is a fine army. It would be a shame to lose them. But the orders I received were to delay. Even if the entire Red Flower Camp were wiped out, it would still be acceptable.”<br/>
<br/>
“So long as Mu Lan stays alive in the end, that’s enough.”<br/>
<br/>
The myna was taken aback. “Another round of those court power struggles! Ugh, what a killjoy.”<br/>
<br/>
The man and bird both fell silent, quietly watching the battle.<br/>
<br/>
Barring any surprises, the fight would unfold exactly the way they anticipated.<br/>
<br/>
But reality is wonderful precisely because accidents happen without warning.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan sensed something and hesitated. “Ning Zhuo used the protective talisman I gave him?”<br/>
<br/>
She gritted her teeth and chose to expend a huge amount of military force to guide Ning Zhuo’s arrival.<br/>
<br/>
The space suddenly shook, and at the heart of the battlefield, a person appeared out of thin air.<br/>
<br/>
He wore white clothes, had the face of a youth, and a slightly large head.<br/>
<br/>
Who else could it be but Ning Zhuo?<br/>
<br/>
“Who is that?!”<br/>
<br/>
“A mere Golden Core?”<br/>
<br/>
“No, he’s not even Golden Core —only Foundation Establishment!”<br/>
<br/>
The Cangyue Ancient God presiding over the battlefield was startled at first, but then relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
However, Di Lu messaged him via divine sense, telling him to be wary of Ning Zhuo, who performed very well in the previous ambush.<br/>
<br/>
“No matter how strong he is, he’s only at Golden Core,” the Cangyue Ancient God thought. Elevated to deityhood for so long, he still did not regard Ning Zhuo as a threat.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo glanced around at the battlefield, suppressing his curiosity about the night sky. He spoke, “So it’s another domain, huh?”<br/>
<br/>
“Heh, we have one as well.”<br/>
<br/>
“Old Dice, come on out!”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, Master.” The next moment, the Dice-Bone Demon God manifested in its original form, appearing ferociously.<br/>
<br/>
Dice-Bone Domain swiftly spread out, eroding a section of space and standing in opposition to the Cangyue Domain.<br/>
<br/>
The Cangyue Ancient God’s expression changed abruptly, and he cried out, “Dice-Bone Demon God! What are you doing here?!”<br/>
<br/>
Dice-Bone Demon God replied, “Cangyue God, if you switch allegiances now, it’s still not too late.”<br/>
<br/>
The Cangyue Ancient God bristled. “I... you...”</div>
