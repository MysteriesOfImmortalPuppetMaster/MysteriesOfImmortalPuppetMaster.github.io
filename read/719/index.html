<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Rounding the corner, a Mystic Iron Puppet materialized before Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Without hesitation, he charged forward, unleashing a relentless assault that quickly reduced the puppet to a useless heap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This was the fifth time he had done this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Now that the competition was truly underway, he had no intention of sharing Jade Slips as he had before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Strange, why have I only encountered Mystic Iron Puppets? Where are the other cultivators? Ning Zhuo wondered inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Che Zhuzi grew increasingly silent as he watched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo's initial lead widened with each step, leaving the second-place cultivator far behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The unlucky cultivators trailing behind Ning Zhuo fared even worse. After struggling through the maze, they found only disabled Mystic Iron Puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Damn it! Another broken one!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Which heartless bastard is doing this?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"If I find him, I'll kill him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The situation was infuriating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The maze was incredibly complex, requiring cultivators to constantly expend their divine sense and spiritual energy to maneuver through it with Suspended Silk - an already exhausting task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After hours of grueling effort, just when hope seemed within reach, it turned to bitter disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Damn it, damn it! You useless fools!" Lady Spiderweb instinctively clenched her fists, wishing she could step onto the field herself and block Ning Zhuo's path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">At this rate, Ning Zhuo would reach the maze's center, the final battleground, completely unscathed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In stark contrast to his effortless progress, the other cultivators would frequently clash midway, engaging in fierce battles that would drain their resources, with some even ending in mutual destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">By conserving his strength and waiting for the opportune moment, Ning Zhuo would undoubtedly gain a significant advantage in the final showdown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This was precisely what Lady Spiderweb wanted to prevent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">She gritted her teeth, thinking, "I can't let Ning Zhuo have it too easy. The more he struggles, the greater my chances of success."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">With this thought, she swayed her hips and glided gracefully to Che Zhuzi's side, wrapping her arms around his muscular arm and pressing it against her chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Brother Chariot," she purred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"This isn't fun at all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"He's practically guaranteed first place. There's no excitement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"I want to see him fight with all his might, to see him in a desperate state. Otherwise, how will your Rising Cloud Trial seem challenging?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"If that big-headed brat actually clears the trial and starts bragging about how easy it was, where will you put your face, Brother?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Lady Spiderweb's eyes shimmered with seductive allure as she coaxed in a soft, coquettish voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Che Zhuzi immediately adopted a submissive posture, patting the back of Lady Spiderweb's hand. "Alright, alright, if you want to enjoy the show more, Brother will grant your wish."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">With a sweeping gesture, he dramatically altered the maze. Countless walls began shifting, forcing Ning Zhuo to frantically maneuver his Mystic Iron Puppet to avoid collisions. For a moment, he was in complete disarray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The other participants fared even worse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Some were locked in combat, their Mystic Iron Puppets severely disrupted, completely overturning the battle dynamics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The maze's transformation quickly ceased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The new layout differed drastically from the previous one. Ning Zhuo, who had been closest to the center, now found the maze's central point had shifted entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">As a result, over a dozen cultivators now stood roughly the same distance from the center as Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Moreover, numerous cultivators piloting Mystic Iron Puppets were groping their way through the paths near Ning Zhuo, searching for openings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Thus, Ning Zhuo encountered his first, second, and third opponents...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Finally, some living targets!" he thought, his focus sharpening as he threw himself into battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Relying solely on a single Void Suspension Silk severely limited his control capabilities, preventing him from fully utilizing his combat skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">This resulted in both sides having nearly equal control, turning skirmishes into drawn-out battles of attrition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">After defeating his third opponent, the surface of Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Puppet was already riddled with dents and scratches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"This won't do!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"The Mystic Iron Puppet is practically a single piece. Since I'm not inside the maze, I can't disassemble other puppets using just the Suspended Silk and my own puppet. That means I can't add, remove, or replace any parts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Wait a minute..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">A flash of insight sparked in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he finally understood Che Zhuzi's true objective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">During his confrontation with his fourth opponent, Ning Zhuo initially engaged in straightforward combat, his movements rigid and predictable, leaving clear openings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Now's my chance!" Ning Zhuo mentally roared, seizing the opportunity he had been patiently waiting for. He commanded the Mystic Iron Puppet to execute a sliding tackle, positioning it behind the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The puppet's hand shot out, grabbing the opponent's Suspended Silk at its back and snapping it clean off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Without control, the enemy puppet immediately exposed a massive vulnerability. It was pummeled with several brutal punches, leaving its entire back riddled with fist-shaped dents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">But almost immediately, the opponent's Suspended Silk snaked around Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Puppet and reconnected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo immediately attacked the Suspended Silk again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">This time, however, his opponent was prepared. As the attack approached, they abruptly shifted the corresponding strand of spider silk into the Void, causing it to vanish from reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo's strike landed on empty air, but he showed no sign of discouragement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He continued his assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After changing his tactical focus, his path seemed to clear before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">His opponent, now forced to strictly protect their spider silk, gradually found themselves stretched thin, focusing more on defense than offense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Che Zhuzi, who had been observing Ning Zhuo closely, mused, "Both of them are novices with Void Spider Silk, but it's clear that the younger one possesses superior comprehension. His application of Void Spider Silk demonstrates greater spiritual energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Lady Spiderweb, who had been watching Ning Zhuo intently, grew increasingly pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"At his current rate, he won't last long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Unless he manages to acquire a fully intact Mystic Iron Puppet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Hahaha, excellent! The last undamaged puppet has already been claimed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Ning Zhuo, you're destined for a grueling battle. You'll never make it into the top ten!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The worse Ning Zhuo's situation became, the more delighted Lady Spiderweb grew. This meant her chances of success were increasing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Suddenly, Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Puppet crouched low and unleashed a powerful kick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Caught completely off guard, the Mystic Iron Puppet's right knee joint buckled outward from the force of the kick, sending the entire puppet crashing to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"It's over!" The controlling cultivator felt his heart sink into despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yet Ning Zhuo didn't deliver the finishing blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The cultivator hastily braced himself on his left leg, struggling to his feet, only to see Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Puppet retreating several steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Is this guy an idiot? Is he letting me go? The absurd thought flashed through the cultivator's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">But the next moment, Ning Zhuo attacked again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After several rounds of offense and defense, the cultivator was once more knocked to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"It's over!" He gritted his teeth, bracing himself for the bitter taste of defeat, but Ning Zhuo's attack never came.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The cultivator maneuvered his Mystic Iron Puppet back to its feet, only to see his opponent retreating again, calmly watching him rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Could he be trying to break my spirit and make me join forces with him? The thought struck the cultivator. He frantically waved his hands, gesturing to show he understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"I'll join you! I'll join forces with you!" he declared wildly, only to be met with another relentless assault from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Crash...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Down, struggle up, fight again, down, struggle up, fight again...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"What do you want?!" The cultivator was driven to the brink of madness by the torment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He felt utterly humiliated and wanted to retreat, but he couldn't bear to abandon the resources he had already invested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Buying Void Spider Silk had been an enormous expense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"This guy..." Che Zhuzi and Lady Spiderweb, observing the entire battlefield, understood Ning Zhuo's motives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Their gazes at Ning Zhuo were filled with astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo's hair was tied with hemp rope, constantly being pulled upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The wooden awl in his hand repeatedly pierced his own thigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Head suspended from the rafters, awl piercing the thigh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Real combat was excellent material for learning!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo had deliberately spared his opponent, using him as a practice dummy to continuously hone his control over the Void Spider Silk and his mastery of the Mystic Iron Puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">His progress was visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"This junior has a method," Che Zhuzi sighed in admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Lady Spiderweb, her expression grave, echoed the sentiment: "No wonder Ban Ji wants to eliminate him. With such resolve and such a clear understanding of the situation... if he's allowed to develop further, the consequences will be unpredictable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Fortunately, you have no future left."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The thought of Ning Zhuo soon falling into her hands, trapped between life and death, sent Lady Spiderweb's face flushing with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The more impressive Ning Zhuo's performance, the greater her sense of accomplishment would be upon capturing him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"I surrender! Isn't that enough?!" Ning Zhuo's opponent finally broke, abandoning the Mystic Iron Puppet and retreating rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Having gained valuable experience, Ning Zhuo moved on to find his next opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">After repeating this method several times, Ning Zhuo finally withdrew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">His brow furrowed, his expression grave as he focused all his energy on controlling the Void Suspension Silk. Anyone who saw his face could tell he was in a precarious situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Using this for practice and learning has advanced my mastery of the Void Spider Silk by at least two levels. But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"The Mystic Iron Puppet's condition has deteriorated significantly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo realized he couldn't continue like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The further one progresses in learning, the less noticeable the gains become. This is easily understood: improving from zero to sixty points is relatively easy, but advancing from eighty to ninety points requires far greater effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Moreover, Ning Zhuo's understanding came entirely from practical combat, limiting his potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">With no need for rest, Ning Zhuo pressed deeper into the maze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">In the end, only six Mystic Iron Puppets reached the central area - not even enough to count to ten.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The maze's drastic transformation affected not only Ning Zhuo but also many others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The results of Ning Zhuo's deliberate practice and study finally manifested in the final stages!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">During the probing phase, his agile footwork, precise grasp of distance, and effective defenses against the Void Spider Silk were only briefly demonstrated, yet they immediately made it clear to everyone that Ning Zhuo was not to be trifled with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">As a result, during the chaotic battles, everyone instinctively avoided him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">This sound strategy allowed Ning Zhuo to conserve his strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">By the time only three combatants remained, the other two finally realized they needed to join forces and launch a coordinated attack against him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Bring it on!" Ning Zhuo faced the two opponents alone, inevitably plunging into a fierce struggle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">His two opponents were equally skilled in controlling their Mystic Iron Puppets, and their puppets were in a similar state of repair to Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo couldn't use words or divine sense to provoke them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Just as he was struggling to defend himself, Lady Spiderweb suddenly struck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Now!" she shrieked inwardly, unleashing her spell with ruthless force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">In an instant, both Ning Zhuo's divine sea and Essence Sea convulsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The hidden poison erupted, flushing his face crimson, swelling his head, and coarsening his breath. Bloodshot veins webbed his eyes. Simultaneously, countless thoughts surged within his divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">These thoughts connected like silken threads, intertwining and spreading rapidly, seeking to engulf the entire space of Ning Zhuo's divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Adore me! Submit to me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"I am your master now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Ning Zhuo, you are no longer yourself. Your heart belongs to me, filled with me. You are my dog!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The silken thoughts pulsed with overwhelming commands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Utter bewilderment flooded Lady Spiderweb's face. "H-how is this possible? Why isn't he succumbing to my enchantment?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"How is this possible?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Lady Spiderweb stared in disbelief, feeling like she was trapped in a nightmare. Her most cherished technique, the one she had honed to perfection, had utterly failed against Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">How could this be happening?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"I was ambushed! But why didn't the Mechanism Ring warn me? Oh, right - it posed no actual threat to me," Ning Zhuo realized, his understanding dawning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">He understood why the ambush had failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The essence of this enchantment lay in influencing the divine sea, altering a normal person's perception of him. But Ning Zhuo was immune.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Because - Innate Self!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">This Innate Talent granted him immunity to nearly all such techniques. Of course, the contest between offense and defense still hinged on sheer force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Suppress it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">With his divine sea unaffected, Ning Zhuo immediately activated his demonic art, directly suppressing all abnormal reactions in his physical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Lady Spiderweb sensed the shift in Ning Zhuo, her eyes widening as she roared inwardly, "He recovered just like that?! How did he do it?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">What was the greatest common characteristic of the Three Sects' Supreme Methods?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">That was control!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual excelled at communicating with and controlling sentient beings and objects. The Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art meticulously arranged the Five Elements. But the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art was the most profound, using blood and meridians to dominate every corner of the body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Moreover, Ning Zhuo's internal organs had been transformed, granting him an innate immunity to many techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Other demonic arts might not have yielded such immediate results. But Lady Spiderweb had the misfortune of encountering the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ning Zhuo resolved the crisis effortlessly. His gaze unconsciously shifted, as if piercing through space, to Lady Spiderweb hiding at the heart of the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"You can't escape," Lady Spiderweb vowed inwardly. "If you won't be my dog, then die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">She looked up at Che Zhuzi, her seductive smile returning. "Brother Chariot..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">She shook Che Zhuzi's shoulder, about to manipulate him again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Che Zhuzi's enthralled expression returned. He patted the back of Lady Spiderweb's hand and said gently, "You've already lost. Accept your defeat gracefully."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Lady Spiderweb: "Wait - ?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The next moment, her face paled with horror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">She found herself completely immobilized, unable to move a muscle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Her assailant was none other than Che Zhuzi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"Y-you... weren't you seduced by me?" Lady Spiderweb stammered, desperately clinging to her ability to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Che Zhuzi smiled. "You're at the Foundation Establishment stage, so you can indeed influence Golden Core-level cultivators. But no one knows I've already castrated myself. Heh heh heh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">As he said this, Che Zhuzi's face filled with pride.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">"You're not a Void Spider. You wouldn't understand that castration allows us to conserve our vital energy, increasing Void Spider Silk production by a full seventeen times!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Lady Spiderweb opened her mouth, but no words came out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
