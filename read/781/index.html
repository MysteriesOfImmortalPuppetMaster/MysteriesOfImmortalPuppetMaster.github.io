<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Surrounding the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain, the atmosphere among the Supreme Clan Elders had changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"It is not enough! The thickness of this child's Qi Luck foundation far exceeds our estimates!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Unimaginable! The Clan Destiny Pivot Chain is at the Soul Formation level, approaching the Void Refining tier, yet it is struggling to have any effect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"We have consistently failed to calculate the full picture of Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck... We cannot go on like this, Grand Supreme Clan Elder."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Grand Supreme Clan Elder looked grave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He had not expected that with their side exerting full force, Ning Zhuo could still resist to such a degree!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Ning Zhuo, just who is this child? Which power stands behind him?" Regarding intelligence on Ning Zhuo, the Ban family was even more proactive in their investigation than anyone else within the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ever since they determined that Ning Zhuo was Ban Ji's Royal Mandate, the Ban family had already begun taking action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">But intelligence gathering took time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Ban family was merely a prominent clan in the Flying Cloud Kingdom; conducting an investigation across several cultivation kingdoms was highly difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Just the journey alone took Ning Zhuo several months; for the Ban family to dispatch capable agents to the Southern Bean Kingdom, the travel alone would require a significant amount of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">However, once investigation results were obtained, transmitting the information was fast. As long as they spared no cost, the time required would be very short.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The teleportation techniques of the Cultivation World had actually long been capable of cross-border transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But such matters were strictly boycotted by every cultivation kingdom. This was because, historically, there had been many major incidents where ultra-long-distance teleportation was used to cause trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Teleportation of this magnitude would shake the very foundations of a kingdom, so the Ban family could not arrive in the Southern Bean Kingdom immediately. Similarly, Ning Zhuo had also traveled a long distance to reach the Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Now, a huge problem lay before the assembly of the Ban family's Supreme Clan Elders. If they could not calculate the full picture of Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck, they could not touch the foundation of his Qi Luck. If they could not grasp the foundation, how could they proceed with reducing his Qi Luck?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">If the foundation was healthy, shaving off the top layer of Qi Luck would only result in it growing back very quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">This was the characteristic of Qi Luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Grand Supreme Clan Elder could not estimate how long this stalemate would last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Although the Ban family had a great business and immense assets, they could not afford to drag this out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Exerting their full strength this time, in addition to consuming a massive amount of precious materials, was also consuming the Ban family's top-tier combat power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">This was not a simple consumption of spiritual energy or divine sense, but a matter of lifespan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Including the Grand Supreme Clan Elder, everyone present was continuously draining their own lifespans!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">For the sake of the clan, and for the sake of Ban Ji, the Ban family was paying a huge price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This was also a characteristic of the Dao of Divination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">To truly divine with full force, one inevitably had to expend lifespan. In other words, the resource of lifespan was the optimal fuel for divination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Heaven and Earth mandated this to strictly control the time limits of diviners. Mastering the Divination Method was barely permitted, but one could not do it for too long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Clan Destiny Pivot Chain was a heavy treasure of the Soul Formation level; the minimum cultivation requirement to activate it was the Nascent Soul stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The cultivation bases of the many Supreme Clan Elders were at least at the Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">And these people were undoubtedly the top-tier combat power of the Ban family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The lifespan they expended was far more expensive than that of other cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Grand Supreme Clan Elder had rich experience, but at this moment, he could not help but waver: "Do we continue according to the original plan, or..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">A rare look of hesitation appeared on his aged face, but eventually, he gritted his teeth and said: "Fine. Since it is difficult to reduce Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck, then let us give him a helping hand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Grand Supreme Clan Elder could not afford to gamble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">If Ning Zhuo managed to hold out until the end, executing the original plan would mean that almost all of the Ban family's top combat power would be buried along with it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Such a trade was obviously too much of a loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Hearing the Grand Supreme Clan Elder change the plan, the rest of the Clan Elders breathed a sigh of relief and immediately set to work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Clan Destiny Pivot Chain was like an old furnace that had suddenly been fed a lot of dry firewood; it rumbled loudly. The many runes on the mechanism also became more dazzling, flickering with various colored lights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Since they could not reduce it, they might as well assist Ning Zhuo, causing his Qi Luck to erupt violently in a short period of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">At this stage, Ban Ji was using the Hundred Refinements Golden Body Pill and was in a period of secluded cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">It was the perfect time to avoid the enemy's sharp edge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">During this time period, the Ban Clan let Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck burn like a raging fire, consuming itself intensely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Like adding oil to a fire, when things reach their extreme, they must reverse; when prosperity reaches its peak, decline must follow. By the time his Qi Luck declines, Ban Ji will emerge from seclusion to fight him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">To assist in this way, naturally, there was no need to calculate the full picture of the Qi Luck or grasp its foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">However, even so, after operating for a moment, the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain's speed dropped steeply again, as if it had encountered some invisible, massive obstacle. Cracks appeared, and mechanical parts shattered and disconnected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Is this the Human Tribulation arranged by Heaven for the Royal Mandate?!" The Grand Supreme Clan Elder's face was as dark as water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Everyone's lifespan was being consumed violently, but with things having progressed to this extent, if they stopped now, it would only be drawing water with a bamboo basket - all in vain. Their previous investments would all be lost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He could only grit his teeth and persist!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Myriad Manifestations Sect, Main Mountain Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Green Stone Cave Dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Inside the space of the martial arts training formation, Ning Zhuo's face was solemn. His brows were locked tight, his eyes were shut, and he sat motionless on a rush cushion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">His entire mind was immersed in his own Divine Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Buddha Heart Demon Seal had never oscillated with such amplitude before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"This is a Qi Luck heavy treasure, capable of protecting my Qi Luck, and even that of my Ning branch family. But for it to behave like this now, someone must be acting in secret, attempting to plot against my Qi Luck!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"The Ban family is the prime suspect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo was well-versed in intelligence, so naturally, he knew that the Ban family possessed a clan-suppressing mechanical heavy treasure - the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"I can't hold on much longer..." Ning Zhuo felt anxious and uneasy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He knew very well that once this protective umbrella was shaken open, his Qi Luck would inevitably suffer a tremendous impact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"I definitely cannot let the enemy have their way!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">However, relying solely on Ning Zhuo's own strength to assist was definitely not enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">His cultivation was too low, only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment; it was very difficult for him to help the Buddha Heart Demon Seal with anything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">But this was a golden age of cultivation, where the hundred arts of cultivation were prospering; naturally, Ning Zhuo had other methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In the next moment, he took out a mechanical component from his chest - the Five Elements Wheel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This was a new wheel, capable of accommodating three Golden Cores simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Currently, three Ghost Path Golden Cores were inlaid on the wheel, which Ning Zhuo used directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The wheel rotated slowly, extracting the power of the Golden Cores, gathering it into a stream, and pouring it into Ning Zhuo's Divine Sea, straight into the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Buddha Heart Demon Seal shook violently. Absorbing the power of the Golden Cores, its aura immediately surged, and it quickly stabilized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">At this moment, in the Ban family ancestral shrine, ten thousand li away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Bang bang bang...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">A series of muffled sounds rang out as a small portion of the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain's body exploded. Lines and tracks snapped in disarray, and several Supreme Clan Elders spurred blood on the spot, their auras withering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">At the critical juncture, the Grand Supreme Clan Elder gave a sharp shout. Disregarding the consumption of his own lifespan, he stepped forward to support it. Only then did he barely stabilize the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Grand Supreme Clan Elder's hair, originally half black and half white, was now turning white at a speed visible to the naked eye, as if covered by a layer of frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">However, even so, the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain seemed to be crushed by an invisible giant force. Mechanical parts continued to break, though the speed was much slower than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Supreme Clan Elders could not help but show panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">If this trend continued, not only would the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain be destroyed, but they would also suffer the implication of the backlash, resulting in either death or heavy injury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Myriad Manifestations Sect, Main Mountain Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Mechanism Cave Dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ban Ji, completely naked, floated in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He was mobilizing a Golden Core, rolling it all over his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Golden Core was the size of an adult's fist. As it rolled against Ban Ji's skin, it left a layer of faint gold powder wherever it passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Within a few breaths, the gold powder quickly merged into Ban Ji's body and vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ban Ji felt increasingly relaxed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The principles of the Strange Path, mechanical arts, and Demonic Sect contained within his body were like messy hair like straw, disorganized and chaotic. But under the effect of the gold powder, these principles combined with each other and became much more coordinated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Reflected in Ban Ji's person, aside from the physical burden being lifted, even his inner heart became much calmer and soothed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Just as he was controlling the pill, the jade pendant on his neck suddenly erupted with a ball of emerald light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The emerald light was incredibly dazzling, filling the entire cultivation chamber in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Almost simultaneously, in the Ban family ancestral shrine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">A certain component of the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain also surged with piercing emerald light. Once the emerald light shone, it immediately alleviated the pressure on the numerous Supreme Clan Elders. The entire Qi Luck mechanism began to rotate slowly once again, the stagnant state almost disappearing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"What is happening?!" Everyone was extremely astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The emerald light came fiercely and left just as quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Not good!" Seeing this trend, the Supreme Clan Elders immediately became anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">One of them suddenly looked up, his gaze incredibly firm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"For the Ban family!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He took a few steps forward, stood before the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain, and slammed his hands onto a key mechanical component.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Within the next three breaths, this Supreme Clan Elder aged rapidly. Wrinkles sprouted, his back hunched, and the aura of life quickly dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">At the critical moment, he sacrificed himself and exhausted his lifespan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">And what this exchange achieved was that the operation of the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain reached its terminus, completing the modification of Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Huff huff huff...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The group of Supreme Clan Elders panted heavily; all were drenched in sweat and in a wretched state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The light on the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain gradually extinguished. Only thirty percent of the entire machine body remained; the degree of damage broke historical records.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Gradually, everyone focused their gazes on the kinsman who had voluntarily sacrificed himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">In the solemn atmosphere, the crowd was silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">A Nascent Soul cultivator had been sacrificed! This was a loss they had not anticipated beforehand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Will there be such major sacrifices in the future?" A layer of haze shrouded everyone's hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Grand Supreme Clan Elder boosted morale, heavily rewarded the descendants of the sacrificed elder, and then singled out several people, ordering them to strictly investigate the cause of the abnormality in this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo was also covered in cold sweat, looking wretched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"It has finally settled down."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He looked at the Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his Divine Sea, which was gradually calming down, and could not help but feel lingering fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">During this period, he had consumed a full twenty or so Ghost Path Golden Cores, directly using up all their spiritual energy, rendering them of no further value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Fortunately, I prepared multiple sets of Golden Core Wheels, otherwise I really might have fallen in this calamity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"This is the price of standing out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"The Ban family is the biggest suspect, but whether it is really them remains to be investigated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">A tall tree catches the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">There was no helping it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo had anticipated this long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">With a guarded heart, he began to rest and recover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">After half a day, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal remained quiet, which made Ning Zhuo feel slightly more at ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He did not tell anyone about this shocking change, burying it deep in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo did not even plan to investigate, because there were absolutely no clues. Investigating rashly would inevitably consume a massive amount of time, energy, material resources, and manpower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">After deep contemplation, Ning Zhuo decided to hold back and take no action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Endure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">He had endured in Fire Persimmon Immortal City for over a dozen years and was quite familiar with this kind of action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Half a day later, Old Chef returned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">He had made contact with the cultivators of Danxia Peak, explained their identity, and expressed the intention to purchase Mysterious Yellow Mother Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The other party did not reject it directly but informed Old Chef of several Rising Cloud Minor Trials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Old Chef: "The other party's meaning is to let you, Young Master, choose one of these minor trials, participate with full effort, and preferably obtain the top rank."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"But after this, you are not to participate in any other minor trials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"He will secretly arrange for you to move into Danxia Peak and wait there until the stage of the Flying Cloud Assembly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">After listening, Ning Zhuo did not say a word, simply shaking his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Danxia Peak's meaning was very obvious: they wanted Ning Zhuo to join Danxia Peak directly through the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo had his eye on the Mysterious Yellow Mother Qi in their hands, while they had their eye on Ning Zhuo as a person and wanted to get a hold of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo's reputation as a genius had already spread. Because of his conflict with Ban Ji, his fame had spread even wider.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Although the Mysterious Yellow Mother Qi is precious, to give up other minor trials just for it is a loss that breaks the heavens!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"The problem with Meng Yehu has actually already been resolved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Because the spirituality is at ten percent, it has its own power of recovery. It's just that relying on it to recover on its own will take a long time, and it very likely won't catch up to the stage of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"It seems my weight is not heavy enough; let's suspend the trade revolving around the Mysterious Yellow Mother Qi for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo's perception of the situation was quite clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">When the other party learned of Ning Zhuo's trade proposal, they never explicitly agreed from beginning to end. They only asked Ning Zhuo to abandon other forces and join Danxia Peak completely first, to show his sincerity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">This arrogance was almost overflowing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">However, Ning Zhuo could also understand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Every session of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial sees the emergence of genius cultivators similar to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"And in the minor trials of this session, the first wave of outstanding people to emerge numbers as many as twenty or thirty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"Cultivators like Ban Ji possess sufficient strength themselves; they just had bad luck and didn't catch the first wave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"From Danxia Peak's perspective, there are many genius cultivators they can choose from. Among them, I am not particularly inconspicuous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Regarding the trade for the Mysterious Yellow Mother Qi, Ning Zhuo had known the difficulty from the start and did not have high expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Without expectations, naturally, there was less disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">What he was truly looking forward to now was another trade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">And the one moving quietly for this trade was none other than Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Sun Lingtong arrived at the black market and met the cultivator he had ordered goods from previously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"Where is the Demonic Path Confucian cultivator's soul I asked for?" Sun Lingtong cut straight to the chase and asked directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">The cultivator looked troubled and spread his hands: "Apologies, guest, I didn't manage to get it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Sun Lingtong was stunned for a moment; after all, when the cultivator had agreed before, he had been absolutely emphatic, exuding nothing but confidence from head to toe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">As a result, he now received a failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Sun Lingtong's tone immediately sank, and his expression turned unkind: "You made me wait for so many days, and this is the result? By deceiving me like this, what are you trying to do?!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
