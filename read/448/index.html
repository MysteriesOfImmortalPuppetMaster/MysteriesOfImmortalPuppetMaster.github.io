<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">A corner of the White Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A junior commander hurried to the scene of the incident: "What exactly happened?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The junior commander was very puzzled; he didn't see any casualties among his own soldiers. But a strange feeling was swirling in his heart —something very peculiar was going on!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Commander, something terrible has happened!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Our spirit energy pool —our spirit energy pool is gone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"A gray, unremarkable stone ball suddenly appeared and swallowed our spirit energy pool!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The soldiers hurriedly reported.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The junior commander widened his eyes sharply: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He looked at the empty place where the spirit energy pool was originally located.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"I was wondering why something felt off..." The junior commander cursed, "Can the spirit energy pool be stolen? Thieves from the Thousand Peaks Forest have sneaked in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"But it's okay; these military devices have already been refined. I will activate the spell to search for its location!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Protect me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After saying that, the junior commander began to perform his techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He was also very anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">This was the spirit energy pool, after all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It was one of the trump cards for the White Jade Camp to resist Lord Long and hold on. If it couldn't be retrieved and returned to its original place, the sustained combat capability of the White Jade Camp would be greatly weakened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">A layer of fine cold sweat oozed from the junior commander's forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Damn it, why can't I detect its location?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The spirit energy pool had been moved into the cabin of the Mechanical Flood Dragon!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This spirit energy pool was nearly a perfect circle, with a diameter of three zhang and five chi, and a depth of two zhang and three chi —about the size of a common pond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sun Lingtong stood in a horse stance, one hand forming a mudra, the other hand holding the wrist of the hand performing the mudra, fully maintaining a treasure-stealing technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Stealing Technique —Actually Copying Hands!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">It was precisely this stealing technique that shrank the spirit energy pool to the size of a round table and temporarily concealed it from the victim's search.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Sun Lingtong was only at the Foundation Establishment level and had not joined the Two Notes Kingdom, so he did not receive the blessing of national power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Little Zhuo, hurry up, hurry up!" Sun Lingtong urged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">His spirit energy and divine sense were being consumed rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">And this spirit energy pool was a magic treasure, a treasure qualified to be used only by Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo raced against time, performing techniques to quickly inspect this spirit energy pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"The main material of the pool wall is Azure Profound Jade. This jade is hard in texture and can absorb earth qi, converting it into earth-element spiritual energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"The pool water is hundred-year-old stalactite milk, milky white in color, capable of accumulating and storing massive amounts of earth-element spiritual power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"The entire spirit energy pool has three layers of formations: Seed Earth Formation, Land Sinking Return to Origin Formation, and Pure Spirit Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The Seed Earth Formation allows this spirit energy pool, by merely contacting the ground, to connect with the deep underground earth veins. If there are no earth veins formed in the area, it will absorb earth qi to the maximum extent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"The Land Sinking Return to Origin Formation can massively convert earth-element spiritual energy into earth-element spirit energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"It is worth mentioning that this formation was once extremely popular in history. Almost all cultivation forces used it, laying it in key places of sects and families to provide massive amounts of earth-element spirit energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"As a result, because too much earth-element spiritual energy was extracted worldwide, the entire continent began to sink."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Forcing the imperial dynasty at that time to urgently order all forces, large and small, to prohibit the use of the Land Sinking Return to Origin Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"As for the Pure Spirit Formation, it has the function of purifying spiritual energy. It can purify all spiritual energy, making its nature as uniform as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"After spiritual energy is purified, it is more efficient to use. Otherwise, if there are too many 'impurities,' the loss is too great, and the effect will be very poor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo's fingers moved, constantly activating techniques, stirring up the talismans in the spirit energy pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"There are more than three thousand talismans on the pool wall, forming a magical restriction together, which is... the 'Earth Mother Nourishing Milk Essential Art'!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In Ning Zhuo's divine sea, within his upper dantian, his divine thoughts surged; the mirror surfaces formed by divine thoughts shone brightly, and as his thinking deepened, pieces of mirror surfaces shattered and were consumed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I have a way now, boss, hold on!" Ning Zhuo cheered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lingtong immediately showed a look of joy; Ning Zhuo's cracking speed exceeded his imagination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo took out more than a dozen staff heads and then took out a wooden hammer, hammering them hard, forcibly driving the staff heads into the pool wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He then used mechanical arts to manipulate the staff heads, successfully interfering with the operation of the spirit energy pool, forcing the three formations to gradually come to a halt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The magical restriction of the 'Earth Mother Nourishing Milk Essential Art' was also propped open with many gaps and openings by the staff heads, allowing Ning Zhuo to peer into the core within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He infused his spirit energy with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This spirit energy followed the staff heads, accurately finding the core of the spirit energy pool, washing it like a flood!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">After a dozen breaths, Ning Zhuo had washed away most of the connection between the spirit energy pool and its original owner. The rest would require slow work and would take a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Having achieved this, Ning Zhuo had reached his goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He immediately stopped infusing spirit energy and withdrew his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Huff, huff...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo was gasping for breath, his face pale, his divine sense greatly consumed, and his spirit energy urgently needing replenishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Sun Lingtong was in an even worse state than him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sensing that the spirit energy pool was no longer shaking violently, he immediately revoked the stealing technique 'Real Copy Hand,' collapsing to the ground exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But he was very excited, his eyes shining, staring intently at the spirit energy pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo was doing the finishing work; he was circling the spirit energy pool, now the size of a small table, using various materials to set up a sealing formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong observed Ning Zhuo's techniques and nodded with satisfaction, immediately praising: "Little Zhuo, it wasn't in vain that I trained you since you were young. This set of methods to suppress treasures, although you haven't used it for a long time, you practiced it so many times before that you're already thoroughly proficient; it's practically ingrained in your bones! You did great!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Although Ning Zhuo was physically and mentally exhausted, seeing the spirit energy pool in front of him also brought a flush of joyous redness to his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"I have refined most of it and learned that this spirit energy pool is called the 'Earth Milk Pure Spirit Pool.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"According to estimation, the market price is four hundred and four hundred fifty high spirit stones!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"We've made a fortune, we're rich!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Earth Milk Pure Spirit Pool was of the magic treasure level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">And the price range of magic treasures was extremely large!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">A spirit energy pool at the magic treasure level was a heavy treasure; the cost of refining it was often a huge sum, qualified to be used only by medium and large forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Therefore, spirit energy pools at the magic treasure level were expensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Usually, a Golden Core-level force had an annual output value of about 1.5 million low-grade spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Note that this was the gross output value, not net profit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Such an Earth Milk Pure Spirit Pool would require a Golden Core-level force to not eat or drink for three consecutive years to afford it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">For an individual Golden Core cultivator, assuming he had a strong earning ability, working hard on his own, not eating or drinking and spending no money, only making money, it would take at least forty-seven years!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">When Sun Lingtong heard the quoted price from Ning Zhuo, he miraculously squeezed out a bit of strength from his exhausted body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He stood up: "Quick, Little Zhuo, this is a rare opportunity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"There are at least two more spirit energy pools in the White Jade Camp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo waved his hand: "Don't rush, boss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"We are not in good condition; we urgently need to meditate and restore our state!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Let's not take the spirit energy pools for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Overly weakening the White Jade Camp —if they can't resist Lord Long, how will we have the opportunity to continue acting?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun Lingtong gave Ning Zhuo a thumbs up, clicking his tongue in praise: "Little Zhuo, I said long ago —you have talent in our line of work!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo immediately coughed: "If it weren't for the divine decree upon us, forced by circumstances, plus Zhu Xuanji's previous instructions for us to weaken the Two Notes Kingdom, I, a dignified righteous person, how could I commit such acts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong extended his other hand, also giving a thumbs up: "Little Zhuo, your words have the style of the righteous path!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">******</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">TL Note:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">G.Z.R. Changed the math a while ago, so these are the current numbers</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">100 Low Grade Spirit Stones = 1 Medium Grade Spirit Stone</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">100 Medium Grade Spirit Stones = 1 High Grade Spirit Stone</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
