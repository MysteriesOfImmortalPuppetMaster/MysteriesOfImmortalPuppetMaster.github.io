<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 529: If Fate Brings You Harm</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The water waves surged, churning ceaselessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Golden rays shot forth, and soil and rocks flew everywhere. Occasionally, flames took shape and wooden strips danced in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Five Element Spells were alternately employed in Ning Zhuo’s hands, pressing the Golden Core cultivator Yan Jin so that he could not raise his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Damn it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Even with the treasure artifact big bell in hand, he could only end up at a disadvantage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“This kid -was he really only sixteen years old?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Yan Jin gritted his teeth and did his best to hold on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In the next moment, he widened his eyes in shock and discovered that the big bell before him had begun to crack all over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He could still hold on, but the treasure artifact big bell was nearing its limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After all, this big bell was never meant to be a weapon of assault; rather, it was an auxiliary tool specifically crafted for refining artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Oh, it’s about to give out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred, and he keenly noticed this scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He decisively reduced the force of his strikes and the frequency of his spellcasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Yan Jin immediately felt his pressure greatly eased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">A surge of sorrow and indignation arose in his heart: “I, a senior cultivator, have ended up as nothing more than a live target in the face of a sixteen‐year‐old boy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“This kid is not even a proper human, so I’ll rehearse his spells!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yan Jin felt deeply humiliated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo grew even more excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“So, could I really be this powerful?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“It was all because my physical foundation had grown far stronger, allowing me to receive further augmentations from the Hero's Return Technique and Martial Strategy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“The stronger my strength, the greater the might of my spells.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Now, my only weakness was my insufficient spiritual power. However, I also had military power available to expend in its stead.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Having experienced numerous wars firsthand, Ning Zhuo understood that an army’s military power functioned as a public pool of spiritual power -one whose capacity often far exceeded that of an individual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo’s mechanized army’s combat power, of course, was no match for the Red Flower Battalion or the Three Generals Battalion, but don’t forget-Ning Zhuo had built an army on his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The entire military power was at his disposal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Boss, speaking of which, you’re still the most formidable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Had it not been for you thinking of the proper usage of the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, I would never have advanced so greatly in such a short time!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, Sun Lingtong chuckled and said without any humility, “Of course!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo did not know that at that moment, Sun Lingtong’s mood was even happier than his.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Little Zhuo, I hadn’t seen your so cheerful a smile for such a long time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Sun Lingtong’s gaze, like drifting clouds and mist, seemed in a daze to see the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">When he first conversed with Ning Zhuo, the latter had burst into tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In order to save his mother, his tiny body had borne a heavy shackle. From as early as the age of two, he had begun plotting the Lava Immortal Palace; facing the City Lord’s Residence, the three major clans, and numerous Golden Core-level as well as even Nascent Soul-level cultivators, it was as if an ant were challenging a mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">What an enormous pressure that was!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">However, Sun Lingtong could not persuade Ning Zhuo to change his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Because he himself was of the same kind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">In order to rescue his own master, Sun Lingtong had, on numerous occasions, disregarded his own life and safety, risking death to infiltrate the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Time after time he was injured, narrowly escaped death, was disappointed repeatedly, and drew ever closer to despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Now, I have come out, but Little Zhuo has not yet!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo had never hidden his plan to save his mother from Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Relying solely on spiritual essence for resurrection?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong knew well that this plan was so impractical, with hope being extremely slim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Even if it were a matter of soul usurpation, there were enormous drawbacks -it would have the soul constantly pulled by the netherworld. On the day it fell into the netherworld, the soul would suffer even more excruciating punishment!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Resurrecting the dead, even within the path of demons, was a grave taboo. To succeed was extraordinarily difficult, and the price paid was often far greater than the rewards!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But Sun Lingtong could not persuade Ning Zhuo, because he himself had done the same before and had no such qualification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He once had devoted his heart entirely to retrieving his mentor -even at the risk of death, he had no hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">But gradually, a new worry arose in Sun Lingtong’s heart -if he died, what would become of Little Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">As he spent more and more time with Ning Zhuo, that worry increasingly dominated his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“My life, my destiny, was saved by you, Little Zhuo!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Therefore, no matter how difficult this path to save your mother might be, I would always accompany you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“It’s just that……”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Being experienced, Sun Lingtong sincerely did not wish for Ning Zhuo to go down a path alone into darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Therefore, even if Ning Zhuo only had the modest Foundation Establishment level, as long as he went out to travel, Sun Lingtong extended wholehearted welcome and support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Little Zhuo, the Fire Persimmon Immortal City was like a cage -a heavy shackle on your body and mind.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“The longer you stayed in the city, the more you schemed about the Lava Immortal Palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“You had lived in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City for too long; you had grown up there, enduring in silence for sixteen years -but endurance was by no means the main flavor of life, Little Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The experiences of venturing out allowed Ning Zhuo to see many different vistas and ways of life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">In the war of the two nations, Ning Zhuo felt both fear and excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Fierce battles and wars were the most ardent longing hidden within every male being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Your past self was like a suppressed volcano; your anger, your unwillingness, your schemes, your ambitions -all had to be forcefully restrained and hidden deep within your heart, until one day when they erupted, it was as if a stone broke the heavens.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“But now the heroic spirit of the battlefield had already infected you, Little Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ambush battles, scouting battles in the Thousand Peak Forest, and the grand battle of the Iron Flow across the Plain…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Liu, Guan, Zhang, Mu Lan, Shuang Jing, Gu Ya, Tu Ming…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">These battles and these people all had an imperceptible influence on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The onlooker sees things clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo believed that his strength had greatly improved, and he felt extremely delighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">However, Sun Lingtong knew that if it was the Ning Zhuo who had just left the Fire Persimmon Immortal City encountering such matters, he would only have a slight upturn of his lips, secretly pleased that such changes would help in resurrecting his mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">And there would never be such a cheerful smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“You are only sixteen; this is the smile a youth should have.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Just continue venturing on like this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Go and witness all the ugliness and beauty, go and experience all kinds of thrills and interesting things.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Life inherently has infinite possibilities, with countless different ways to live.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“Your life cannot consist solely of arduous and grand goals; it must also be fun, brilliant, and radiant!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">All along, Sun Lingtong had this concern -if in the future Ning Zhuo’s plan to resurrect his mother completely failed, what kind of heavy blow would he suffer?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Would he, like the former Sun Lingtong, become heartless and devoid of the joy of life?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Therefore, Sun Lingtong very much hoped that Ning Zhuo could experience the many beauties of life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He wanted to see Ning Zhuo interact with Lin Shanshan, and also wanted to see Ning Zhuo engage in dual cultivation with Mu Lan -not merely to watch the spectacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">And as Sun Lingtong accompanied Ning Zhuo on his journey, his motive was very simple and pure-</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“Little Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“If a cruel fate inflicted harm and hardship upon you, deprived you of happiness, and burdened you with heavy loads.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Then, let me make up for it all!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">This was a decision long made deep within Sun Lingtong’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Under Ning Zhuo’s increasingly fierce assault, the treasure artifact big bell finally reached its limit and collapsed with a tremendous roar, shattering into countless pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Having continuously propelled the big bell, Yan Jin -who was closely connected -was then counterattacked, spitting blood as he knelt on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“Little Zhuo, here’s a good opportunity.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Lingtong shouted, “Capture him alive!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Okay, Boss!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, formed hand seals with one hand to release deep green vines, and with the other hand took out a stack of talismans, directly activating them and launching them forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The vines quickly entwined, binding Yan Jin in a myriad of knots, restraining him in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The talismans consecutively struck him, adhering to every part of his body, firmly sealing him. Not only could he not mobilize his spiritual power, but even his divine sense could not be emitted -leaving him unable to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Hahaha. I did it; this is the first enemy I’ve captured alive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo rejoiced with a delighted laugh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Amidst the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, Sun Lingtong gave a thumbs up, sincerely happy for Ning Zhuo: “Little Zhuo, impressive! You only had Foundation Establishment cultivation, yet you captured a Golden Core!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo flew down, and without rashly approaching Yan Jin, he instead mobilized his divine sense to observe and also cast a detection spell for confirmation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">While casting spells, he secretly communicated with Sun Lingtong: “What a pity -the big bell shattered first; I haven’t yet measured my own limit of endurance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Sun Lingtong chuckled, “Little Zhuo, you fool. This actually doesn’t have much significance, does it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned, and then immediately understood the implication in Sun Lingtong’s words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Indeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Through the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, his corporeal cultivation would continuously soar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Now, so what if I measured my combat power limit?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">In a while, it would change again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo’s expression turned serious, and he gradually walked over to Yan Jin: “Boss, you are right.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“I did get a bit carried away.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“The progress and achievements I have attained now are nothing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“Capturing a Golden Core? I merely relied on military tactics and the Five Elements realm -the former being bestowed upon me by the soldiers’ shared helmet and Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings, and the latter taught by the Five Elements Divine Master.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“Even my corporeal realm was achieved thanks to you, thanks to the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat; my own efforts accounted for very little.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Thank you, Boss.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“You always manage to remind me in such a clever and tactful way!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Sun Lingtong scratched his head, “Little Zhuo, this…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">At another battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Liu, Guan, and Zhang took turns deploying military tactics, continuously bombarding the fire curtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Three layers of fire curtain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Flowing Flame Fairy furrowed her brows and exerted the full might of her grand array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Scorching heat waves rolled in, and many soldiers suddenly burst into flames -screaming as they were burned into human sticks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The three generals -Liu, Guan, and Zhang -were either solemn, calm, or roaring with anger, and they all continuously deployed military tactics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Flowing Flame Fairy was invigorated in her heart, “We can hold them off!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“The Three Generals Battalion had insufficient training, inadequate elite soldiers, and subpar equipment -so their military power was insufficient.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">“Their total military power simply could not support them in continuously launching three successive fierce tactical offensives.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">“Moreover, they had to reserve some military power to fortify themselves, in case they were completely incinerated by flames!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">However, in the next moment, Liu Er suddenly shouted, “At this very moment, launch a full-scale attack!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Guan and Zhang obeyed without question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Blade light split one layer of the fire curtain, the black spear pierced through the second layer, and sword light shredded the third layer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">“How is that possible? You actually saw through the key point of the fire curtain?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The Flowing Flame Fairy looked at Liu Er in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Guan and Zhang, with overwhelming momentum and power, had expended more than half of their military power -so breaking through the fire curtain was not surprising.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The key was that Liu Er’s sword light, though very weak and having barely utilized any military power, had nevertheless precisely pierced the key point of the fire curtain, using ingenious force to shatter the final layer of defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Liu Er did not reply, but continued to swing his sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The sword light flew, aiming directly at the Flowing Flame Fairy’s throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">“Don’t even think about it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The Flowing Flame Fairy shouted sharply, revealing her trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Suddenly, intricate talismans appeared on her body, the talismans glowing crimson and burning like flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">In an instant, the Flowing Flame Fairy transformed into a mass of humanoid flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Although the sword light struck the humanoid flame and directly severed its head, in the next moment the flames connected with one another and reformed into a complete humanoid shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">“If you think you can kill me, you’re still far off.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The Flowing Flame Fairy was about to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Talent -Purple-bearded Astonishing Hong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Guan Hong finally regained his composure, releasing his innate talent, and immobilized the Flowing Flame Fairy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">“Ahhhhh!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Zhang Hei leapt out of the battle formation, holding the Black Snake Spear high above his head, and fiercely stabbed down at the humanoid flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Martial Art -Black Python Strangulation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Military power, spiritual power, and vigor blended together, forming on the spear tip a thick, black serpent-like aura of battle energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The raging, jet-black battle energy, like a black python spiraling in a flying thrust, in an instant pierced the humanoid flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Guan Hong suddenly half-kneeled on the ground, gasping for breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The Purple-bearded Astonishing Hong was retracted, and in an instant the Flowing Flame Fairy regained her mobility-only to see that she had been pierced by the Black Snake Spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">“It’s useless, I am now the Fire Walking Magic Body, uh!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">In the next moment, the jet-black battle energy exploded forth like a black python opening its enormous jaws, directly devouring its prey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">The flames soared upward, erupting with dazzling brightness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">But it was nothing more than the Flowing Flame Fairy’s final, futile struggle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The jet-black battle energy strangled all the flames, and they dissipated entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Only a dim, broken Golden Core remained, drifting in midair before being snatched by Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Zhang Hei landed on the ground, grasped the Golden Core in his fist, and raised it high: “The enemy has been slain by me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Alas!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">The Three Generals Battalion erupted in enthusiastic cheers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">“Victory.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Guan Hong exhaled a mouthful of turbid breath and slowly straightened his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Liu Er then quickly scanned the entire army, estimated the losses, and immediately issued orders to clear the battlefield and take over the array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">“Beneath this ground, there is an empty chamber, within which is hidden the Vermilion Bird Incense Burner.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Following Liu Er’s instructions, the soldiers indeed unearthed this treasure that served as the core of the array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">“In this way, we would have control of the Ten Li Burning Forest grand array.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">Guan Hong smiled, feeling extremely gratified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Zhang Hei then curiously asked, “Big brother, how did you discover its hidden nature? This underground chamber is so well arranged that it can shield against divine sense scans.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Liu Er hesitated for a moment, but did not answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">It was his innate talent for Spirit Sound Probe at work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">This talent enabled Liu Er to have exceptional hearing, to listen to distant sounds, to trace the origins and developments, and to discern the underlying matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">The key was to trace the origins and developments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">Therefore, the investigative ability of the Spirit Sound Probe was weak, but its strength lay in getting to the root of things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">Not until the battle had reached this point did Liu Er slowly discern the origin of the fire curtain and the details of the array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Previously, it was in the same manner that the key points on the fire curtain were discovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">“No, we cannot control this Guardian Forest array for now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">The three generals tried for a while, but all ended in failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">“First, put away the Vermilion Bird Incense Burner and the like, and seal the grand array.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">Liu Er ordered, “We must immediately go to support the military strategist!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">Zhang Hei said boldly, “Rest assured, the sound of the bell has just ceased; the military strategist must have won!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="349">Guan Hong stroked his beard, “Precisely because of that, we should all the more go to support the military strategist.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="351">Zhang Hei: “Huh?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="353">Liu Er explained, “Just as we can no longer hear the bell, the military strategist would no longer be under attack from the fire curtain, and the fire in the Burning Forest would greatly subside. He would then realize that we had also defeated the Flowing Flame Fairy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="355">“What do you think he would do?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="357">Zhang Hei said, “We found this place under your guidance, big brother. The military strategist, not knowing our location, would either return to the original separation point, or… directly strike at the central Fire Crown Divine Fir?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="359">Liu Er nodded, “That’s right. Up until now, Luo Chen has not appeared; he must have encountered some change or mishap.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="361">“Given the military strategist’s capability, it’s highly likely that he would rush there to investigate the military situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="363">Recalling how previously Ning Zhuo had faced Du Tiechuan’s summons without fear, while he himself had worried about being punished for slaying the Iron Eagle, Zhang Hei wholeheartedly agreed, “The military strategist really has guts! Then let us immediately head to the Fire Crown Divine Fir and join forces with the military strategist, hahaha!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
