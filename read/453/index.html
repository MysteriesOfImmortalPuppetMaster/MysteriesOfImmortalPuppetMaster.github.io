<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Charge, charge, charge!<br/>
<br/>
The stone sphere charged straight ahead through the sea of fire, forging onward without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
Wusheng Fire used life as its fuel, dominating and overcoming billions of living beings, but Old Monster Shi Zhong was already dead.<br/>
<br/>
The flames were burning Old Monster Shi Zhong’s corpse, so naturally they caused no harm whatsoever to the stone sphere.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten-Thousand-Li Traveling Dragon was also just a mechanical creation, utterly devoid of vitality.<br/>
<br/>
However, inside the mechanical traveling dragon, Sun and Ning, as well as the dragon turtle fire spirit and numerous spiritual plants, spiritual beasts, and so forth, all had life.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Ning Zhuo was currently exerting all his strength in casting spells.<br/>
<br/>
He released flames, using fire to control fire!<br/>
<br/>
Being at least at the grandmaster level of the Five Elements Realm allowed him to quickly comprehend the Wusheng Fire and compile a spell on the spot, maintaining his own safety for a short time.<br/>
<br/>
However, merely achieving that was still not enough.<br/>
<br/>
All because in this sea of fire, there was not only Wusheng Fire, but also the power of the Fierce Fire Attacking the Heart technique.<br/>
<br/>
When Sun and Ning approached Lord Long, they would also be affected by this technique, causing clusters of urgent flames to appear out of thin air within their spiritual seas.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s response to this was — the Western Pure Land!<br/>
<br/>
This was a supreme treasure of Earth Element meritorious virtue, one of the Buddhist supreme treasures. A poem attests:<br/>
<br/>
Bright earth gives birth to radiance, illuminating the mind,<br/>
When all thoughts are purified, the Buddha’s Dharma arises.<br/>
The Western Paradise is a pure land without defilement,<br/>
Washing away worldly troubles, returning to a pure realm.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo temporarily devised an Earth Element spell, using the Western Pure Land as the spellcasting material to invoke the Pure Land’s radiance.<br/>
<br/>
The radiance shrouded the dragon’s head cabin, refining and purifying all urgent fires, allowing Sun and Ning to remain calm and peaceful at heart.<br/>
<br/>
You have a fire-element sinful treasure, I will use an earth-element meritorious treasure!<br/>
<br/>
Above in the cloud-filled sky, Lu Chi saw the stone sphere advance as if it were entering an uninhabited territory, and his expression changed: “Old Monster Shi Zhong! Such skill, to be able to penetrate such a sea of fire.”<br/>
<br/>
The stone sphere rolled up beside Lord Long.<br/>
<br/>
At this time, Lord Long, who had been burned like firewood, had shriveled severely. He now stood only one zhang tall.<br/>
<br/>
“You stone sphere, what do you plan to do to us?!” Lord Long’s right shoulder armor suddenly issued a warning.<br/>
<br/>
This right shoulder armor was a proper spiritual treasure, possessing abundant spiritual intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
From the treasure spirit’s clear speech, brimming with anger and suspicion, Ning Zhuo could determine that this level of intelligence far surpassed that of Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the Ten-Thousand-Li Traveling Dragon, Sun Lingtong’s eyes lit up, and sparkling drool almost trickled from the corner of his mouth!<br/>
<br/>
“I really want to steal it.”<br/>
<br/>
“A spiritual treasure, this is a spiritual treasure!!”<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, he also knew this was impossible.<br/>
<br/>
The stronger a spiritual treasure’s intelligence, the more it could resist enemies’ attempts to seize or refine it.<br/>
<br/>
Conversely, if one obtained the approval of its intelligence, cultivators could refine a spiritual treasure very quickly, with very low difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, the treasure spirit was extremely wary of Old Monster Shi Zhong, making it absolutely impossible to forcibly steal it.<br/>
<br/>
If one tried by force, it might even trigger the treasure’s desperate counterattack.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning certainly did not wish to do battle with a spiritual treasure in this sea of fire.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Zhuo was multitasking, simultaneously employing Earth and Fire element spells to ensure his own safety, already exerting himself to the limit.<br/>
<br/>
After the treasure spirit scolded them, it continued to warn: “I’m telling you, don’t entertain any bad thoughts. If you anger me, you’ll suffer the consequences.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong grabbed his own hair and looked up, shouting: “Ah, I can’t stand it!”<br/>
<br/>
“Clearly this is the best opportunity to steal a spiritual treasure, but I’m not strong enough, not strong enough!”<br/>
<br/>
“Why, why am I only at the Foundation Establishment stage?!”<br/>
<br/>
The right shoulder armor was not like the “High Victory Legacy Writings.” The latter was incomplete and lacked intelligence, while the former possessed intelligence and could defend itself autonomously.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the treasure spirit was now also in a critical situation.<br/>
<br/>
Once it possessed intelligence, the treasure could be considered half a living entity, and thus it was also suppressed by the Wusheng Fire.<br/>
<br/>
The treasure spirit of the right shoulder armor hid in the deepest part of the spiritual treasure, not daring to emerge.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, Sun and Ning keenly noticed that the surface of this right shoulder armor already showed signs of melting!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gave a slight smile, and with one sentence dispelled all the treasure spirit’s wariness.<br/>
<br/>
He said, “This old man bears a divine decree, could I possibly harm you? Naturally, I have come to save you.”<br/>
<br/>
The treasure spirit: “Ah, then you are a good person. I misunderstood you, I’m sorry!”<br/>
<br/>
“However, if you want to save Little Long, that’s going to be troublesome.”<br/>
<br/>
“The biggest difficulty isn’t even this Wusheng Fire sea, but rather…”<br/>
<br/>
Before the treasure spirit could finish, Ning Zhuo interrupted: “I know, it’s the urgent fire.”<br/>
<br/>
The treasure spirit froze for a moment, then immediately grew happy: “Ah, you know, Old Monster! You’re so impressive!”<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, it saw the stone sphere emit an earthen-yellow radiance.<br/>
<br/>
The radiance was so peaceful, so reassuring.<br/>
<br/>
Under the shroud of this radiance, Lord Long abruptly opened his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
In just a short time, most of the urgent fire in his spiritual sea was dispersed by the earthen light.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long looked at the stone sphere: “Old Monster Shi Zhong, you… thank you!”<br/>
<br/>
He could not move, he was too anxious, so anxious he could hardly stand it, but that did not mean he had lost all perception of the outside world.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, he heard the conversation between Ning Zhuo and the treasure spirit very clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Originally, Lord Long was extremely displeased by Old Monster Shi Zhong’s manner of participating in the battle and his actions, secretly growing angry and planning to settle accounts later.<br/>
<br/>
But now…<br/>
<br/>
Old Monster Shi Zhong had become his savior!<br/>
<br/>
This…<br/>
<br/>
How could Lord Long possibly make a move against Old Monster Shi Zhong now?<br/>
<br/>
He was, after all, the esteemed temple attendant of the Dragon King, and very clear on the importance of reputation.<br/>
<br/>
If he could attack even his own savior, who would still hold him in high regard? Everyone would become wary of him, and even extend their wariness to the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long could not possibly attack Old Monster Shi Zhong. If he were to do so, even the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King, for the sake of its incense offerings, would deal with him!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s voice was hoarse: “Now is not the time to reminisce, let’s leave this place first.”<br/>
<br/>
He had held on until now and was about to reach his limit.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long nodded, raised his palm, brought his five fingers together like a hand blade and was about to sever most of his life force, like a gecko breaking its tail to escape.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo stopped him.<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t waste your energy, just come with me!”<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, Ning Zhuo mobilized the Nascent Soul-level spiritual power within the stone sphere and activated an Earth Element technique.<br/>
<br/>
This time, he took Lord Long and quickly sank into the depths of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
The earth was a lifeless thing, naturally isolating the Wusheng Fire.<br/>
<br/>
It was just that previously, when Lord Long invoked the deity’s presence, he had planted many ginseng-like whiskers underground in this battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, these whiskers were also burning, becoming the only obstruction.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo was getting more and more adept at using the Earth Element technique.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, the whiskers had traveled underground, rampaging constantly, yet could not block him. Now, though the whiskers were on fire and formed underground walls of flame, they were thus stationary.<br/>
<br/>
For Ning Zhuo, this posed even less of a problem.<br/>
<br/>
“No! No!!” Shuang Jing lost his composure and screamed.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, he had lost his helmet and his hair was in disarray, no longer possessing his former noble bearing.<br/>
<br/>
He ran instinctively towards the Wusheng Fire sea, extending his right arm with fingers spread wide, trying to stop Lord Long from escaping.<br/>
<br/>
But in the end, he was forced back by the heatwave, and could only watch helplessly as Old Monster Shi Zhong took Lord Long and burrowed into the ground together.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing suddenly raised his head and roared savagely at the sky: “Fire Cloud Battalion, what are you doing?!”<br/>
<br/>
“Why aren’t you taking action quickly? Are you just going to sit and watch the strong enemy escape?”<br/>
<br/>
Up in the clouds, Lu Chi looked at the precious mirror in his hand, his face full of bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
Of course he had thought of preventing all this from happening, but the fires of the Wusheng Fire sea were too intense. As the main commander, he knew very well that none of the methods he had at his disposal could take effect.<br/>
<br/>
Red Flower Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan’s body went limp, nearly collapsing once again.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi quickly reached out and supported her again.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi advised: “General Mu, do not lose heart. We can only say that Lord Long’s fate was not to end here!”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan shook her head and said through gritted teeth: “It’s Old Monster Shi Zhong! Everyone underestimated him. This Nascent Soul-level existence has an extremely deep foundation, far stronger than the descriptions in the intelligence reports.”<br/>
<br/>
“At least, according to the intelligence, Old Monster Shi Zhong could not have resisted the Wusheng Fire.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan took a deep breath and quickly stabilized her state of mind.<br/>
<br/>
“My father told me to be unyielding in the face of adversity!”<br/>
<br/>
“No matter how difficult the situation, we must do our utmost to contend for the greatest victory.”<br/>
<br/>
“Although Lord Long fled, he is heavily injured and unlikely to fight again. If we wipe out this group, we can still gain a generous amount of battle merits!”<br/>
<br/>
Even the leader of the Six Caves Sect, Lu Hongtu, now felt intense envy.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan cast her gaze straight upward.<br/>
<br/>
Within the Red Flower Dharma Image, Chi Tengyi and the others were clearly attacking more impatiently.<br/>
<br/>
The escape of Lord Long, this pillar of support, had dealt too heavy a blow to the morale of the various cultivators!<br/>
<br/>
In the distance.<br/>
<br/>
The lord of the Mysterious Abyss Cave, Lu Hongtu, wore a complicated expression.<br/>
<br/>
“This Old Monster Shi Zhong actually rendered meritorious service, and such a great contribution too!”<br/>
<br/>
He knew very well that Old Monster Shi Zhong, having saved Lord Long, would inevitably receive a huge reward. This was something the Thousand Peaks Forest side had to do!<br/>
<br/>
Even if the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King knew that Old Monster Shi Zhong was close to the Soul Formation Level, for the sake of the bigger picture, it would still bestow great and special rewards upon Old Monster Shi Zhong.<br/>
<br/>
“Enough, who can blame me for not having the means to withstand this Wusheng Fire sea.”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu immediately turned his gaze toward the Red Flower Dharma Image.<br/>
<br/>
“Rescuing Chi Tengyi and the others is also a great achievement. When we return, we’ll have an explanation for the Dragon King!”<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, Lu Hongtu led three Nascent Soul cave lords and suddenly charged out.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan hastened to meet the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu and the others, in excellent condition, inflicted heavy casualties on the Red Flower Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Dharma Image, attacked from inside and out, finally could not hold on and completely collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, the veterans and elite soldiers of the Red Flower Battalion suffered a backlash, causing hundreds of them to instantly collapse in a spray of blood and die.<br/>
<br/>
“Quick, go!” Lu Hongtu did not linger to fight, not even turning his head as he fled swiftly.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Tengyi and the others, seeing this, also fled for their lives.<br/>
<br/>
The Fire Cloud Battalion descended from the clouds and pursued all the way, but their speed could not match the Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators of Thousand Peaks Forest, and soon they had no choice but to give up helplessly.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Halberd Army arrived later and could only clean up the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan reorganized the whole army and tallied the casualties. The severity of the losses made her face as pale as paper.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing suffered even greater losses than she did.<br/>
<br/>
With the assistance of the Golden Halberd Army, Shuang Jing gathered his remaining troops and found fewer than a hundred men left, causing him to shed tears on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
In a certain mountain forest.<br/>
<br/>
“We should be safe now.” Old Monster Shi Zhong first stuck out the round shell, then rolled out the entire sphere.<br/>
<br/>
Behind him, under a yellow glow rising from the ground, Lord Long also emerged.<br/>
<br/>
“Let’s wait here for a moment.” Lord Long sighed, then immediately sat down cross-legged to urgently treat his injuries.<br/>
<br/>
As a temple attendant, he naturally lacked no top-grade pills. After taking a few, his complexion visibly improved, and his injuries recovered faster.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning did not wait long before the Mysterious Abyss Cave Lord, Chi Tengyi, and the others secretly gathered here.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu first asked after Lord Long’s condition, and upon learning that he was unharmed, he immediately cupped his fists and complimented: “We owe the victory in this battle to Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong.”</div>
