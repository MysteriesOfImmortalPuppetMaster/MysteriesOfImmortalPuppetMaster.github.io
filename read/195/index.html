<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 195: Ancient Cicada Technique</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Sun Lingtong, with the appearance of a young boy, his skin as smooth as jade, crossed through spatial ripples and arrived at the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">However, before his feet could touch the ground, his pupils contracted sharply as he sensed a vast magical power surrounding him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The power was filled with a chilling yin energy, like a cold tide invading, a great wave swallowing the shore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Enemy attack!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"I've been ambushed!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Instinctively, Sun Lingtong tried to activate his spell again to traverse back through the portal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">But Luo Shang had been waiting here for many days, well-prepared, and had already set up a half-formation around the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">As soon as Sun Lingtong appeared, Luo Shang immediately dispatched his ghost servants, who entered the formation, temporarily completing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The formation activated, and as Sun Lingtong retreated, no ripples appeared in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The battlefield environment changed abruptly, rendering his spell ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Kid, you're tired of living, daring to kill our Soul Devouring Sect's Golden Core!" "Speak!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Where is Cheng Bai's corpse? Hand it over."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"If you cooperate obediently and surrender, I can spare your life and wait for the Void Sect to ransom you." Luo Shang appeared, surrounded by a chilling wind and numerous ghostly shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Golden Core waste cultivator!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"You are Luo Shang, the true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In an instant, Sun Lingtong recognized Luo Shang's identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">His heart sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong had anticipated that the Soul Devouring Sect would seek revenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He just hadn't expected that their demonic cultivators had already infiltrated the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Luo Shang had laid in ambush for many days, waiting for his desired prey!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"I shouldn't have come back here!" Sun Lingtong regretted deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">But then he thought: the strategy of relocating every so often was still correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"If I had stayed in one underground base, I would have been discovered even sooner." "But how did he find me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Could it be because I took the risk of opening Cheng Bai's storage bag last time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong immediately thought of this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The clue was obviousâ€”he had dismantled Cheng Bai's storage bag here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"I clearly extinguished the smoke at that time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Wait, now is not the time to delve into these details." "The urgent task is to find a way out immediately!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Although the underground base was surrounded by Luo Shang's formation, making it impossible for Sun Lingtong to traverse directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He still had a slight chance of breaking through physically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Hehe." Sun Lingtong sneered, "Do you think you can catch me like this?" As he spoke, he took out a stack of talismans from his bosom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Illusion Body Talismans!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He scattered the talismans into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The talismans ignited mid-air, quickly transforming into replicas of Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Dozens of Sun Lingtongs fled in all directions, making it difficult for Luo Shang to distinguish the real one without specific measures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Sun and Ning had anticipated revenge and had prepared accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">These Illusion Body Talismans were mass-produced by Ning Zhuo's subordinates, specifically designed to confuse and were a great tool for escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Thanks to Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong blended in with the illusions, heading towards the outer wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Right, I need to alert Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Sun Lingtong used three different methods in succession, fearing the alarm wouldn't go off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">But after doing so, he immediately regretted it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"What am I doing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"If Ning Zhuo knows I'm in danger, he will definitely come to save me." "By then, if he gets caught, wouldn't I be harming him?" "After all, he no longer has the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Lingtong's expression changed frequently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Suddenly, he felt a chill, his hair standing on end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">In an instant, cold sweat broke out on his forehead as he realized: "Since entering this underground base, I've been plagued by chaotic thoughts." "I've been hit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Luo Shang practices the Soul-Dissolving Dark Technique, which is adept at stirring others' emotions, making their thoughts chaotic while he remains calm." Realizing this, Sun Lingtong immediately invoked the Void Emptiness Seal deep within his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He was exceptionally talented and perceptive, having improved in all aspects after reflecting on his battle with Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">His mastery of the Void Emptiness Seal had also advanced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong could now borrow the power of the Void Emptiness Seal far more effectively than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The seal's power cleared his mind, sweeping away all chaotic thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Sun Lingtong's eyes became calm, without any hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Luo Shang was secretly using a spell to identify which of the many "Sun Lingtongs" had the most emotional fluctuations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Just as he was about to succeed, the fluctuations suddenly vanished, like a fish slipping back into the water after being caught in a net.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Interesting." Luo Shang's eyes flashed sharply, his face expressionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">With a thought, ghost generals emerged from the surrounding ghostly mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The four ghost generals, all at the Foundation Establishment stage, silently attacked the Sun Lingtongs in the field.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Although the Illusion Body Talismans were realistic, they had no combat power and were easily destroyed by the ghost generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Sun Lingtong tried to break through the wall but was intercepted by the ghost generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The four ghost generals identified the real Sun Lingtong and surrounded him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong dodged left and right, moving swiftly and nimbly, making it difficult for the ghost generals to catch him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">However, this didn't last long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong couldn't sustain the power of the Void Emptiness Seal for long, as it drained his mental energy severely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He had to stop using it, causing his emotions to fluctuate again, making him susceptible to interference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">His movements became hesitant, his expression constantly changing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The ghost generals, being ghostly beings specially refined by Luo Shang, had minimal emotions and thoughts, making them less susceptible to interference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">As a result, Sun Lingtong soon found himself in a perilous situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Seeing this, Luo Shang seized the opportunity and commanded the four ghost generals to act together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Using the four ghost generals as the formation base, they formed a battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The formation created a light barrier that enveloped Sun Lingtong and began to shrink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Seeing himself about to be trapped, Sun Lingtong decided to fight with all his might!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">With a flick of his wrist, two daggers appeared in his small hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Using his divine sense, he retrieved a vial from his storage ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The vial fell, and Sun Lingtong shattered it with his dagger mid-air, causing the medicinal oil inside to spill out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong, who specialized in divine sense techniques, wrapped the medicinal oil around the daggers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The next moment, while dodging the ghost generals' attacks, he poured his mana into the daggers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The daggers began to glow with a blue light, sharp and clear like diamond reflections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Sun Lingtong's self-created dagger techniqueâ€”Meteor Fall!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">His face was filled with determination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Meteor Fall technique was designed for desperate situations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">It had great power but also severe side effects, making it a forbidden technique among Sun Lingtong's self-created dagger techniques!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Without the formation base, the light barrier dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Seizing the opportunity, Sun Lingtong charged towards the outer wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Luo Shang, expressionless, suddenly pointed a finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">A ghostly figure lurking in the shadows appeared, at the Foundation Establishment stage, blocking Sun Lingtong's escape route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Lingtong, already exhausted, saw the ghostly figure charging at him and had no time to change his move, so he could only clash head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Unexpectedly, the ghostly figure exploded upon contact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Boom!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The starlight around Sun Lingtong scattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">For a moment, ghostly energy and starlight intertwined, colliding and shooting in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Everything is under control." Luo Shang remained expressionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">At this moment, space suddenly fluctuated, and a crossbow bolt shot through the air, aiming at Luo Shang's back!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The tip of the bolt was coated with purple poison, giving a strong sense of deadly toxicity at first glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The bolt was silent but emitted a loud cicada chirp as it neared Luo Shang's back!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In an instant, the battlefield's atmosphere changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">It was like an old, gloomy, damp, and dark house filled with the stench of decay and mold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Suddenly, one side of the wall collapsed, letting in sunlight and fresh air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">It was the sunlight of hope!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Accompanied by rolling heat waves, an endless life force surged in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">To deal with Luo Shang, Yang Chanyu had specifically chosen this move, imbued with strong yang energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Luo Shang had set up an ambush for Sun Lingtong, and Yang Chanyu of the Void Sect had prepared just as long!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">She practiced the Ancient Cicada Technique, specializing in accumulating power for attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">When she cast her spell, her mana was extremely restrained, with no leakage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">When released, the spell erupted with cicada chirps, its power far exceeding normal, incredibly astonishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Yang Chanyu had accumulated power for this strike for as long as Luo Shang had been lying in ambush!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Thus, the crossbow bolt, carrying the power to pierce everything, struck Luo Shang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Luo Shang, already in combat, had activated his robe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">But the robe, like paper, was pierced by the bolt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Luo Shang's eyes widened, and in a life-or-death moment, he unleashed all his power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">An inner armor appeared, pierced through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">A long banner flew out, its pole broken, the banner falling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">A token appeared, shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Finally, a jar blocked the bolt, also shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Inside the jar was a sealed Foundation Establishment-level ghost general!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">She curled up into a ball, with four talismans attached to assist in suppression and sealing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The ghost general was pierced by the bolt, taking a heavy hit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Originally in a quiet slumber, she was suddenly attacked, and in her fury, she expanded into a nine-foot-tall female ghost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">She raised her head and let out a piercing scream, her ghostly voice echoing throughout the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Grandmother Qiushui, save me!" Luo Shang's divine sense called out to the female ghost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The female ghost ignored him, in her rage, she charged at Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Swoosh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">In the next moment, Luo Shang's body shuddered violently as the poisonous bolt pierced his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Despite his full effort to resist, Luo Shang ultimately failed, struck by Yang Chanyu's long-accumulated, powerful blow!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
