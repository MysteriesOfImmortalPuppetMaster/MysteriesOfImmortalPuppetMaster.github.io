<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 195: Ancient Cicada Technique</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Sun Lingtong, with the appearance of a young boy, his skin as smooth as jade, crossed through spatial ripples and arrived at the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
However, before his feet could touch the ground, his pupils contracted sharply as he sensed a vast magical power surrounding him.<br/>
<br/>
The power was filled with a chilling yin energy, like a cold tide invading, a great wave swallowing the shore.<br/>
<br/>
"Enemy attack!"<br/>
<br/>
"I've been ambushed!!"<br/>
<br/>
Instinctively, Sun Lingtong tried to activate his spell again to traverse back through the portal.<br/>
<br/>
But Luo Shang had been waiting here for many days, well-prepared, and had already set up a half-formation around the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Sun Lingtong appeared, Luo Shang immediately dispatched his ghost servants, who entered the formation, temporarily completing it.<br/>
<br/>
The formation activated, and as Sun Lingtong retreated, no ripples appeared in the air.<br/>
<br/>
The battlefield environment changed abruptly, rendering his spell ineffective.<br/>
<br/>
"Kid, you're tired of living, daring to kill our Soul Devouring Sect's Golden Core!" "Speak!"<br/>
<br/>
"Where is Cheng Bai's corpse? Hand it over."<br/>
<br/>
"If you cooperate obediently and surrender, I can spare your life and wait for the Void Sect to ransom you." Luo Shang appeared, surrounded by a chilling wind and numerous ghostly shadows.<br/>
<br/>
"Golden Core waste cultivator!"<br/>
<br/>
"You are Luo Shang, the true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect."<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Sun Lingtong recognized Luo Shang's identity.<br/>
<br/>
His heart sank.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had anticipated that the Soul Devouring Sect would seek revenge.<br/>
<br/>
He just hadn't expected that their demonic cultivators had already infiltrated the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang had laid in ambush for many days, waiting for his desired prey!<br/>
<br/>
"I shouldn't have come back here!" Sun Lingtong regretted deeply.<br/>
<br/>
But then he thought: the strategy of relocating every so often was still correct.<br/>
<br/>
"If I had stayed in one underground base, I would have been discovered even sooner." "But how did he find me?"<br/>
<br/>
"Could it be because I took the risk of opening Cheng Bai's storage bag last time?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong immediately thought of this.<br/>
<br/>
The clue was obvious‚Äîhe had dismantled Cheng Bai's storage bag here.<br/>
<br/>
"I clearly extinguished the smoke at that time."<br/>
<br/>
"Wait, now is not the time to delve into these details." "The urgent task is to find a way out immediately!"<br/>
<br/>
Although the underground base was surrounded by Luo Shang's formation, making it impossible for Sun Lingtong to traverse directly.<br/>
<br/>
He still had a slight chance of breaking through physically.<br/>
<br/>
"Hehe." Sun Lingtong sneered, "Do you think you can catch me like this?" As he spoke, he took out a stack of talismans from his bosom.<br/>
<br/>
Illusion Body Talismans!<br/>
<br/>
He scattered the talismans into the air.<br/>
<br/>
The talismans ignited mid-air, quickly transforming into replicas of Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Dozens of Sun Lingtongs fled in all directions, making it difficult for Luo Shang to distinguish the real one without specific measures.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning had anticipated revenge and had prepared accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
These Illusion Body Talismans were mass-produced by Ning Zhuo's subordinates, specifically designed to confuse and were a great tool for escape.<br/>
<br/>
"Thanks to Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong blended in with the illusions, heading towards the outer wall.<br/>
<br/>
"Right, I need to alert Ning Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong used three different methods in succession, fearing the alarm wouldn't go off.<br/>
<br/>
But after doing so, he immediately regretted it.<br/>
<br/>
"What am I doing?"<br/>
<br/>
"If Ning Zhuo knows I'm in danger, he will definitely come to save me." "By then, if he gets caught, wouldn't I be harming him?" "After all, he no longer has the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's expression changed frequently.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he felt a chill, his hair standing on end.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, cold sweat broke out on his forehead as he realized: "Since entering this underground base, I've been plagued by chaotic thoughts." "I've been hit!"<br/>
<br/>
"Luo Shang practices the Soul-Dissolving Dark Technique, which is adept at stirring others' emotions, making their thoughts chaotic while he remains calm." Realizing this, Sun Lingtong immediately invoked the Void Emptiness Seal deep within his soul.<br/>
<br/>
He was exceptionally talented and perceptive, having improved in all aspects after reflecting on his battle with Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
His mastery of the Void Emptiness Seal had also advanced.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong could now borrow the power of the Void Emptiness Seal far more effectively than before.<br/>
<br/>
The seal's power cleared his mind, sweeping away all chaotic thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes became calm, without any hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang was secretly using a spell to identify which of the many "Sun Lingtongs" had the most emotional fluctuations.<br/>
<br/>
Just as he was about to succeed, the fluctuations suddenly vanished, like a fish slipping back into the water after being caught in a net.<br/>
<br/>
"Interesting." Luo Shang's eyes flashed sharply, his face expressionless.<br/>
<br/>
With a thought, ghost generals emerged from the surrounding ghostly mist.<br/>
<br/>
The four ghost generals, all at the Foundation Establishment stage, silently attacked the Sun Lingtongs in the field.<br/>
<br/>
Although the Illusion Body Talismans were realistic, they had no combat power and were easily destroyed by the ghost generals.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong tried to break through the wall but was intercepted by the ghost generals.<br/>
<br/>
The four ghost generals identified the real Sun Lingtong and surrounded him.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong dodged left and right, moving swiftly and nimbly, making it difficult for the ghost generals to catch him.<br/>
<br/>
However, this didn't last long.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong couldn't sustain the power of the Void Emptiness Seal for long, as it drained his mental energy severely.<br/>
<br/>
He had to stop using it, causing his emotions to fluctuate again, making him susceptible to interference.<br/>
<br/>
His movements became hesitant, his expression constantly changing.<br/>
<br/>
The ghost generals, being ghostly beings specially refined by Luo Shang, had minimal emotions and thoughts, making them less susceptible to interference.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, Sun Lingtong soon found himself in a perilous situation.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Luo Shang seized the opportunity and commanded the four ghost generals to act together.<br/>
<br/>
Using the four ghost generals as the formation base, they formed a battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
The formation created a light barrier that enveloped Sun Lingtong and began to shrink.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing himself about to be trapped, Sun Lingtong decided to fight with all his might!<br/>
<br/>
With a flick of his wrist, two daggers appeared in his small hands.<br/>
<br/>
Using his divine sense, he retrieved a vial from his storage ring.<br/>
<br/>
The vial fell, and Sun Lingtong shattered it with his dagger mid-air, causing the medicinal oil inside to spill out.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, who specialized in divine sense techniques, wrapped the medicinal oil around the daggers.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, while dodging the ghost generals' attacks, he poured his mana into the daggers.<br/>
<br/>
The daggers began to glow with a blue light, sharp and clear like diamond reflections.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's self-created dagger technique‚ÄîMeteor Fall!<br/>
<br/>
His face was filled with determination.<br/>
<br/>
The Meteor Fall technique was designed for desperate situations.<br/>
<br/>
It had great power but also severe side effects, making it a forbidden technique among Sun Lingtong's self-created dagger techniques!<br/>
<br/>
Without the formation base, the light barrier dissipated.<br/>
<br/>
Seizing the opportunity, Sun Lingtong charged towards the outer wall.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang, expressionless, suddenly pointed a finger.<br/>
<br/>
A ghostly figure lurking in the shadows appeared, at the Foundation Establishment stage, blocking Sun Lingtong's escape route.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, already exhausted, saw the ghostly figure charging at him and had no time to change his move, so he could only clash head-on.<br/>
<br/>
Unexpectedly, the ghostly figure exploded upon contact.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!!<br/>
<br/>
The starlight around Sun Lingtong scattered.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, ghostly energy and starlight intertwined, colliding and shooting in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
"Everything is under control." Luo Shang remained expressionless.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, space suddenly fluctuated, and a crossbow bolt shot through the air, aiming at Luo Shang's back!<br/>
<br/>
The tip of the bolt was coated with purple poison, giving a strong sense of deadly toxicity at first glance.<br/>
<br/>
The bolt was silent but emitted a loud cicada chirp as it neared Luo Shang's back!<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the battlefield's atmosphere changed.<br/>
<br/>
It was like an old, gloomy, damp, and dark house filled with the stench of decay and mold.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, one side of the wall collapsed, letting in sunlight and fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
It was the sunlight of hope!<br/>
<br/>
Accompanied by rolling heat waves, an endless life force surged in.<br/>
<br/>
To deal with Luo Shang, Yang Chanyu had specifically chosen this move, imbued with strong yang energy.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang had set up an ambush for Sun Lingtong, and Yang Chanyu of the Void Sect had prepared just as long!<br/>
<br/>
She practiced the Ancient Cicada Technique, specializing in accumulating power for attacks.<br/>
<br/>
When she cast her spell, her mana was extremely restrained, with no leakage.<br/>
<br/>
When released, the spell erupted with cicada chirps, its power far exceeding normal, incredibly astonishing.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu had accumulated power for this strike for as long as Luo Shang had been lying in ambush!<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the crossbow bolt, carrying the power to pierce everything, struck Luo Shang.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang, already in combat, had activated his robe.<br/>
<br/>
But the robe, like paper, was pierced by the bolt.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang's eyes widened, and in a life-or-death moment, he unleashed all his power!<br/>
<br/>
An inner armor appeared, pierced through.<br/>
<br/>
A long banner flew out, its pole broken, the banner falling.<br/>
<br/>
A token appeared, shattered.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, a jar blocked the bolt, also shattered.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the jar was a sealed Foundation Establishment-level ghost general!<br/>
<br/>
She curled up into a ball, with four talismans attached to assist in suppression and sealing.<br/>
<br/>
The ghost general was pierced by the bolt, taking a heavy hit.<br/>
<br/>
Originally in a quiet slumber, she was suddenly attacked, and in her fury, she expanded into a nine-foot-tall female ghost.<br/>
<br/>
She raised her head and let out a piercing scream, her ghostly voice echoing throughout the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
"Grandmother Qiushui, save me!" Luo Shang's divine sense called out to the female ghost.<br/>
<br/>
The female ghost ignored him, in her rage, she charged at Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
Swoosh.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, Luo Shang's body shuddered violently as the poisonous bolt pierced his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Despite his full effort to resist, Luo Shang ultimately failed, struck by Yang Chanyu's long-accumulated, powerful blow!</div>
