<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Another early morning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Still no response from Boss Sun?" Ning Zhuo paced in the room, his face dark and brooding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"If his secret signal isn't changed today, it will be the third day." Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo had agreed on many methods of communication.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">In theory, as long as everything was normal, such secret signals would be changed once a day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Ever since the last public interrogation of Boss Sun, Zhu Xuanji hasn't appeared again. Could it be that he has secretly made a move against Boss Sun?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Through extensive information gathering, Ning Zhuo had probed into much black market intelligence: in the past two days, Sun Lingtong had appeared normally and even handled some minor disputes in the black market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Boss Sun is not acting of his own will; he's trapped in some kind of peril. The normalcy on the surface is just a facade. It might not even be him!" Ning Zhuo guessed the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sun Lingtong was being impersonated by Han Ming, who was commanding Sun's subordinates and rapidly infiltrating the entire black market organization, intending to convert it for his own use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">There were also some rumors circulating about Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Someone wants revenge and is targeting the Monkey Head Gang!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"The leader is named Bao Qiu, whose entire family was slaughtered by Yuan Yi. He narrowly escaped and, while keeping his surname, changed his given name. He has been diligently training and contacting those with deep grudges against the Monkey Head Gang. After the Fire Persimmon Festival, the Monkey Head Gang fell into decline. Bao Qiu rallied his forces, accumulated over the years, to seek vengeance!" Ning Zhuo was not surprised by this situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He had anticipated such events long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"If Bao Qiu really makes a move, I can use him. Let them strike first, then command Yuan Dasheng to protect Yuan Er." "However, the rumors about Bao Qiu are too widespread and noisy." Ning Zhuo felt a hint of peculiarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Over the years, he had never stopped collecting intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">As a result, he had developed a keen sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sometimes, just by relying on this sense, he could determine which pieces of information were false and which were true.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The intelligence about Bao Qiu didn't feel false but gave him a subtle sense of oddity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo pondered carefully and thought of a possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"If I were Bao Qiu, I would never be so ostentatious in seeking revenge!" "So, this is likely the work of the elders within the Monkey Head Gang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Bao Qiu has probably reached an agreement with one or more elders in the gang to increase the chances of successful revenge while reducing risks and losses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"They need to start with propaganda, letting the outside world know that Bao Qiu is targeting the Monkey Head Gang and Yuan Er."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"And only after Yuan Er is assassinated can they smoothly take over the entire Monkey Head Gang. Because by then, they would have already proven to the public that Bao Qiu is the real culprit!" Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo became even more certain that Bao Qiu and his people would take action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">And judging by the current rumors, the action would likely be in the next few days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"It seems we need to keep a closer eye on Yuan Er." Yuan Er cannot die just yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo still planned to rely on him to deepen his control over Yuan Dasheng and eliminate the hidden dangers of the Lingdong stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"There's trouble on Sun Laoda's side, but it's not the first time." "At this moment, we need more patience and calm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">In Ning Zhuo's memory, the first time Sun Lingtong was captured, he was eight years old.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Walking by the river often, how can one's shoes not get wet?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong always used theft to obtain resources for his daily cultivation, and it was only a matter of time before something went wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This time, he was captured by a local gang and thrown into a private prison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Sun Lingtong was beaten until his flesh was torn and bloodied, huddled in a corner of the cell, motionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Suddenly, two guards fell to the ground simultaneously, motionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong was startled by the noise, nervously approaching the cell door, and then saw Ning Zhuo's figure slowly appear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Little Sun Brother, I'm here to save you!" Ning Zhuo's face was full of tension, and he was very excited to see Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Little Zhuo, why did you come alone?!" Sun Lingtong was shocked, his face covered in frost, "Did you forget what I taught you? If I get caught, you should report it to the authorities. Let the city guards come and search, cause a commotion, and I can escape in the chaos."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"I did, I reported it to the authorities," Ning Zhuo hurriedly said, "but they were too slow. I was worried about you. You've been missing for three days. I was worried, I was worried about you..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Sun Lingtong waved his hand, "Alright, alright, stop talking and open the door quickly." "The situation is very dangerous now, don't waste any more time." "Whatever you have to say, we can talk about it outside."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"The key is on that big guard. Be careful when you search him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Don't worry!" Ning Zhuo ran to the big guard, using the technique Sun Lingtong taught him, and successfully found the cell key.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The key was inserted into the lock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo infused it with his qi, struggling to turn it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">A stream of light quickly spread from the keyhole, flowing over the lock, the chains, and most of the cell bars, revealing many formation patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo opened the door and helped Sun Lingtong out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">There were still patrolling cultivators outside the cell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The two of them utilized talismans and magical artifacts, fully exploiting shadows and blind spots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After a considerable effort, they finally escaped from the enemy gang's stronghold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Not long after they escaped, the stronghold erupted into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Someone has escaped!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"That little thief is gone!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Hurry, they haven't gotten far since it just happened."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Amidst the shouting, Sun Lingtong heard familiar voices—it was the two guards who had been watching over him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He glared at Ning Zhuo, eyes filled with fury. "You used the Tranquil Fragrance Twilight Cloud I gave you. Why didn't they die?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo, unable to meet Sun Lingtong's gaze, weakly replied, "I was afraid it might kill them, so I added some medicinal paste to cover the fragrance before lighting it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong's eyes flashed with anger. "We'll talk about this later when we get home!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">After a perilous chase, Sun Lingtong sustained several more injuries, his body drenched in blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">At great cost, he finally managed to bring Ning Zhuo to a safe place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"How are you? Are you hurt? Check yourself thoroughly!" Sun Lingtong's divine sense was so weak he could barely release it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo checked himself over and found only a few scrapes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"That's good." Sun Lingtong sighed in relief, then glared and flicked Ning Zhuo's forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"You idiot!" he scolded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Brother Sun, I saved you. Why are you hitting me?!" Ning Zhuo clutched his head, grimacing in pain and feeling aggrieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Why didn't you kill those two?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"If you had killed them, we would have had more time to escape calmly, instead of being chased and nearly hacked to death!" Ning Zhuo was at a loss for words under the rebuke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"It was my mistake!" Ning Zhuo took out pills and bandages from his storage pouch. "Brother Sun, calm down. Your wounds are still bleeding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">A moment later, Sun Lingtong sat while Ning Zhuo bent over, wrapping him up almost entirely in white bandages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Brother Sun, you should hide and recuperate for a while. It was my fault."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Actually, if we had followed our original plan and waited for the city guards to intervene, with your skills, Brother Sun, you would have definitely seized the opportunity to escape alone. My coming to save you only caused more trouble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Sun Lingtong exhaled a breath of frustration, his anger slightly abating. "Your biggest mistake was being soft-hearted when you should have killed! If you had to do it again, would you make the same mistake?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo hesitated, showing a conflicted expression. "I... I..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Sun Lingtong snorted coldly in anger and said no more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">In the tunnel, the torchlight cast their shadows on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun Lingtong let out a cold snort of anger and fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">In the tunnel, the torchlight cast the shadows of the two people onto the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong stared at the shadows on the ground, his eyes flickering with a cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He suddenly realized, "I've protected little Zhuo too well." "Thinking back, when I was six or seven, my master already had me killing people." "Actually, I was wrong..." "What does little Zhuo understand?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"He's already nine now. If it weren't for today's incident waking me up, I would have continued to make mistakes." Sun Lingtong asked himself why he had been so wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He thought of his master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">When he was six or seven, his master touched his head, a rare look of hesitation on his face, "Ah, little sleep, Master doesn't want you to go through this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"But Master knows you have to go through this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"You might feel pain and discomfort for a while, but when you grow up, you'll understand." Sun Lingtong collected his thoughts, his gaze fixed on Ning Zhuo's shadow, murmuring to himself in his heart, "Master, I understand now." Sun Lingtong devised a plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He falsely claimed he wanted to take revenge and acted together with Ning Zhuo to ambush and kill members of an enemy gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">During this process, he pretended to be overpowered and captured, creating the illusion that he was about to be killed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo fell for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In a moment of desperation, he killed the formidable enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">After a moment of bewilderment, Ning Zhuo looked at the enemy lying dead on the ground, his face pale, and suddenly bent over to vomit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Lingtong stayed by his side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Watching Ning Zhuo vomit continuously until only the acid from his stomach remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong teased, "Little Zhuo, you're far worse than I was back then. Hahaha." Ning Zhuo, exhausted from vomiting, sat on the ground, staring blankly at his blood-stained hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sun Lingtong cleaned up the battlefield and led him to a small river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Come, let me wash your hands."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo, like a puppet, obediently followed, allowing himself to be manipulated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Halfway through washing, he suddenly reacted, "Brother Sun, you were acting, weren't you? Actually, in the end, I had a big flaw, that enemy was easy to open."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"But at that time, his movements were stiff, like he was being controlled by a staff."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Sun Lingtong's movements paused, then he nodded and admitted frankly, "Yes, I was controlling him." "I also have to thank you for showing me the mechanism manual your mother left you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"You!" Ning Zhuo fumed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Sun Lingtong chuckled, "Do you want to scold me or hit me?" Ning Zhuo couldn't find the words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He gritted his teeth and pulled his hands back, sulking, "I'll wash myself!" But Sun Lingtong, unusually firm, grabbed his hands back and continued washing, "Don't move!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"For the first time, let me wash them for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"My master did the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Hearing Sun Lingtong mention his master, Ning Zhuo was slightly taken aback and stopped resisting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Under the moonlight, the two youths washed their hands by the small river in the Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Strangely, the younger one was taking care of the older one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The blood flowed quickly down the small river, soon diluted, and by the time it reached the stone bridge forty steps away, it was almost unnoticeable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Sun Lingtong suddenly spoke, "We are cultivators. Cultivators must fight for their fate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"People fight against each other, and people fight against the heavens. In this gamble, our basic stake is our lives!" "He was killed by you, he just lost the bet. His soul will reappear in this world in another form of life." "And we must continue to gamble... until the moment we lose our stake."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo's clean, white hands, his expression extremely serious and earnest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, "Brother Sun, I know you mean well for me, I've taken it to heart." But Sun Lingtong shook his head, "Taken it to heart?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Not enough!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Every time I go out to steal, I tell myself before the action that this time I might not come back, I might lose my life." "If this is the result of my life's gamble, I accept it." "I am always ready to accept my death, even if it's in the next second." "This is my resolve!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"What about your resolve?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo felt a deep unease in his heart, stunned and speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Never before had he felt such greatness from Sun Lingtong's small frame!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Sun Lingtong continued, "If one day, I die, don't be sad for me, Little Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"If one day, I fall into a more desperate situation than before, with no hope of rescue, don't save me, Little Zhuo!" "It's not worth risking a second life, do you understand?" Ning Zhuo opened his mouth, wanting to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">But the next moment, Sun Lingtong interrupted him, "If you fall into a desperate situation, I won't save you either." "Because I need to stay alive to continue gambling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Of course, if there's a chance, I will avenge you." "Right now, on this matter, I make a pact with you!" Sun Lingtong raised his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Under his intense gaze, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to raise his hand as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The silvery moonlight spilled over the river, creating shimmering ripples, like countless tiny diamonds dancing on the water's surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The leaves on both banks swayed gently in the night breeze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Clap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The two children standing by the river lightly clapped their hands together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo lowered his head, his lips tightly pressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Sun Lingtong's upturned face reflected the clear brilliance of the moonlit night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Only then did he grin, revealing his white teeth and a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">His voice was soft yet resolute: "Thus, the pact is made."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
