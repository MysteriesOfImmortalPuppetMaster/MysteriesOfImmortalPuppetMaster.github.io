<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Another early morning.<br/>
<br/>
"Still no response from Boss Sun?" Ning Zhuo paced in the room, his face dark and brooding.<br/>
<br/>
"If his secret signal isn't changed today, it will be the third day." Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo had agreed on many methods of communication.<br/>
<br/>
In theory, as long as everything was normal, such secret signals would be changed once a day.<br/>
<br/>
"Ever since the last public interrogation of Boss Sun, Zhu Xuanji hasn't appeared again. Could it be that he has secretly made a move against Boss Sun?"<br/>
<br/>
Through extensive information gathering, Ning Zhuo had probed into much black market intelligence: in the past two days, Sun Lingtong had appeared normally and even handled some minor disputes in the black market.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss Sun is not acting of his own will; he's trapped in some kind of peril. The normalcy on the surface is just a facade. It might not even be him!" Ning Zhuo guessed the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was being impersonated by Han Ming, who was commanding Sun's subordinates and rapidly infiltrating the entire black market organization, intending to convert it for his own use.<br/>
<br/>
There were also some rumors circulating about Yuan Er.<br/>
<br/>
"Someone wants revenge and is targeting the Monkey Head Gang!"<br/>
<br/>
"The leader is named Bao Qiu, whose entire family was slaughtered by Yuan Yi. He narrowly escaped and, while keeping his surname, changed his given name. He has been diligently training and contacting those with deep grudges against the Monkey Head Gang. After the Fire Persimmon Festival, the Monkey Head Gang fell into decline. Bao Qiu rallied his forces, accumulated over the years, to seek vengeance!" Ning Zhuo was not surprised by this situation.<br/>
<br/>
He had anticipated such events long ago.<br/>
<br/>
"If Bao Qiu really makes a move, I can use him. Let them strike first, then command Yuan Dasheng to protect Yuan Er." "However, the rumors about Bao Qiu are too widespread and noisy." Ning Zhuo felt a hint of peculiarity.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, he had never stopped collecting intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, he had developed a keen sense.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, just by relying on this sense, he could determine which pieces of information were false and which were true.<br/>
<br/>
The intelligence about Bao Qiu didn't feel false but gave him a subtle sense of oddity.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered carefully and thought of a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
"If I were Bao Qiu, I would never be so ostentatious in seeking revenge!" "So, this is likely the work of the elders within the Monkey Head Gang."<br/>
<br/>
"Bao Qiu has probably reached an agreement with one or more elders in the gang to increase the chances of successful revenge while reducing risks and losses."<br/>
<br/>
"They need to start with propaganda, letting the outside world know that Bao Qiu is targeting the Monkey Head Gang and Yuan Er."<br/>
<br/>
"And only after Yuan Er is assassinated can they smoothly take over the entire Monkey Head Gang. Because by then, they would have already proven to the public that Bao Qiu is the real culprit!" Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo became even more certain that Bao Qiu and his people would take action.<br/>
<br/>
And judging by the current rumors, the action would likely be in the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
"It seems we need to keep a closer eye on Yuan Er." Yuan Er cannot die just yet.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo still planned to rely on him to deepen his control over Yuan Dasheng and eliminate the hidden dangers of the Lingdong stage.<br/>
<br/>
"There's trouble on Sun Laoda's side, but it's not the first time." "At this moment, we need more patience and calm."<br/>
<br/>
In Ning Zhuo's memory, the first time Sun Lingtong was captured, he was eight years old.<br/>
<br/>
Walking by the river often, how can one's shoes not get wet?<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong always used theft to obtain resources for his daily cultivation, and it was only a matter of time before something went wrong.<br/>
<br/>
This time, he was captured by a local gang and thrown into a private prison.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was beaten until his flesh was torn and bloodied, huddled in a corner of the cell, motionless.<br/>
<br/>
Thud.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, two guards fell to the ground simultaneously, motionless.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was startled by the noise, nervously approaching the cell door, and then saw Ning Zhuo's figure slowly appear.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Sun Brother, I'm here to save you!" Ning Zhuo's face was full of tension, and he was very excited to see Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, why did you come alone?!" Sun Lingtong was shocked, his face covered in frost, "Did you forget what I taught you? If I get caught, you should report it to the authorities. Let the city guards come and search, cause a commotion, and I can escape in the chaos."<br/>
<br/>
"I did, I reported it to the authorities," Ning Zhuo hurriedly said, "but they were too slow. I was worried about you. You've been missing for three days. I was worried, I was worried about you..."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong waved his hand, "Alright, alright, stop talking and open the door quickly." "The situation is very dangerous now, don't waste any more time." "Whatever you have to say, we can talk about it outside."<br/>
<br/>
"The key is on that big guard. Be careful when you search him!"<br/>
<br/>
"Don't worry!" Ning Zhuo ran to the big guard, using the technique Sun Lingtong taught him, and successfully found the cell key.<br/>
<br/>
The key was inserted into the lock.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo infused it with his qi, struggling to turn it.<br/>
<br/>
A stream of light quickly spread from the keyhole, flowing over the lock, the chains, and most of the cell bars, revealing many formation patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo opened the door and helped Sun Lingtong out.<br/>
<br/>
There were still patrolling cultivators outside the cell.<br/>
<br/>
The two of them utilized talismans and magical artifacts, fully exploiting shadows and blind spots.<br/>
<br/>
After a considerable effort, they finally escaped from the enemy gang's stronghold.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after they escaped, the stronghold erupted into chaos.<br/>
<br/>
"Someone has escaped!"<br/>
<br/>
"That little thief is gone!!"<br/>
<br/>
"Hurry, they haven't gotten far since it just happened."<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the shouting, Sun Lingtong heard familiar voices‚Äîit was the two guards who had been watching over him.<br/>
<br/>
He glared at Ning Zhuo, eyes filled with fury. "You used the Tranquil Fragrance Twilight Cloud I gave you. Why didn't they die?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, unable to meet Sun Lingtong's gaze, weakly replied, "I was afraid it might kill them, so I added some medicinal paste to cover the fragrance before lighting it."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes flashed with anger. "We'll talk about this later when we get home!"<br/>
<br/>
After a perilous chase, Sun Lingtong sustained several more injuries, his body drenched in blood.<br/>
<br/>
At great cost, he finally managed to bring Ning Zhuo to a safe place.<br/>
<br/>
"How are you? Are you hurt? Check yourself thoroughly!" Sun Lingtong's divine sense was so weak he could barely release it.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo checked himself over and found only a few scrapes.<br/>
<br/>
"That's good." Sun Lingtong sighed in relief, then glared and flicked Ning Zhuo's forehead.<br/>
<br/>
"You idiot!" he scolded.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Sun, I saved you. Why are you hitting me?!" Ning Zhuo clutched his head, grimacing in pain and feeling aggrieved.<br/>
<br/>
"Why didn't you kill those two?"<br/>
<br/>
"If you had killed them, we would have had more time to escape calmly, instead of being chased and nearly hacked to death!" Ning Zhuo was at a loss for words under the rebuke.<br/>
<br/>
"It was my mistake!" Ning Zhuo took out pills and bandages from his storage pouch. "Brother Sun, calm down. Your wounds are still bleeding."<br/>
<br/>
A moment later, Sun Lingtong sat while Ning Zhuo bent over, wrapping him up almost entirely in white bandages.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Sun, you should hide and recuperate for a while. It was my fault."<br/>
<br/>
"Actually, if we had followed our original plan and waited for the city guards to intervene, with your skills, Brother Sun, you would have definitely seized the opportunity to escape alone. My coming to save you only caused more trouble."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong exhaled a breath of frustration, his anger slightly abating. "Your biggest mistake was being soft-hearted when you should have killed! If you had to do it again, would you make the same mistake?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hesitated, showing a conflicted expression. "I... I..."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong snorted coldly in anger and said no more.<br/>
<br/>
In the tunnel, the torchlight cast their shadows on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong let out a cold snort of anger and fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
In the tunnel, the torchlight cast the shadows of the two people onto the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong stared at the shadows on the ground, his eyes flickering with a cold light.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly realized, "I've protected little Zhuo too well." "Thinking back, when I was six or seven, my master already had me killing people." "Actually, I was wrong..." "What does little Zhuo understand?"<br/>
<br/>
"He's already nine now. If it weren't for today's incident waking me up, I would have continued to make mistakes." Sun Lingtong asked himself why he had been so wrong.<br/>
<br/>
He thought of his master.<br/>
<br/>
When he was six or seven, his master touched his head, a rare look of hesitation on his face, "Ah, little sleep, Master doesn't want you to go through this."<br/>
<br/>
"But Master knows you have to go through this."<br/>
<br/>
"You might feel pain and discomfort for a while, but when you grow up, you'll understand." Sun Lingtong collected his thoughts, his gaze fixed on Ning Zhuo's shadow, murmuring to himself in his heart, "Master, I understand now." Sun Lingtong devised a plan.<br/>
<br/>
He falsely claimed he wanted to take revenge and acted together with Ning Zhuo to ambush and kill members of an enemy gang.<br/>
<br/>
During this process, he pretended to be overpowered and captured, creating the illusion that he was about to be killed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo fell for it.<br/>
<br/>
In a moment of desperation, he killed the formidable enemy.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment of bewilderment, Ning Zhuo looked at the enemy lying dead on the ground, his face pale, and suddenly bent over to vomit.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong stayed by his side.<br/>
<br/>
Watching Ning Zhuo vomit continuously until only the acid from his stomach remained.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong teased, "Little Zhuo, you're far worse than I was back then. Hahaha." Ning Zhuo, exhausted from vomiting, sat on the ground, staring blankly at his blood-stained hands.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong cleaned up the battlefield and led him to a small river.<br/>
<br/>
"Come, let me wash your hands."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, like a puppet, obediently followed, allowing himself to be manipulated.<br/>
<br/>
Halfway through washing, he suddenly reacted, "Brother Sun, you were acting, weren't you? Actually, in the end, I had a big flaw, that enemy was easy to open."<br/>
<br/>
"But at that time, his movements were stiff, like he was being controlled by a staff."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's movements paused, then he nodded and admitted frankly, "Yes, I was controlling him." "I also have to thank you for showing me the mechanism manual your mother left you."<br/>
<br/>
"You!" Ning Zhuo fumed.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong chuckled, "Do you want to scold me or hit me?" Ning Zhuo couldn't find the words.<br/>
<br/>
He gritted his teeth and pulled his hands back, sulking, "I'll wash myself!" But Sun Lingtong, unusually firm, grabbed his hands back and continued washing, "Don't move!"<br/>
<br/>
"For the first time, let me wash them for you."<br/>
<br/>
"My master did the same."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Sun Lingtong mention his master, Ning Zhuo was slightly taken aback and stopped resisting.<br/>
<br/>
Under the moonlight, the two youths washed their hands by the small river in the Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Strangely, the younger one was taking care of the older one.<br/>
<br/>
The blood flowed quickly down the small river, soon diluted, and by the time it reached the stone bridge forty steps away, it was almost unnoticeable.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suddenly spoke, "We are cultivators. Cultivators must fight for their fate."<br/>
<br/>
"People fight against each other, and people fight against the heavens. In this gamble, our basic stake is our lives!" "He was killed by you, he just lost the bet. His soul will reappear in this world in another form of life." "And we must continue to gamble... until the moment we lose our stake."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo's clean, white hands, his expression extremely serious and earnest.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, "Brother Sun, I know you mean well for me, I've taken it to heart." But Sun Lingtong shook his head, "Taken it to heart?"<br/>
<br/>
"Not enough!"<br/>
<br/>
"Every time I go out to steal, I tell myself before the action that this time I might not come back, I might lose my life." "If this is the result of my life's gamble, I accept it." "I am always ready to accept my death, even if it's in the next second." "This is my resolve!"<br/>
<br/>
"What about your resolve?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt a deep unease in his heart, stunned and speechless.<br/>
<br/>
Never before had he felt such greatness from Sun Lingtong's small frame!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong continued, "If one day, I die, don't be sad for me, Little Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"If one day, I fall into a more desperate situation than before, with no hope of rescue, don't save me, Little Zhuo!" "It's not worth risking a second life, do you understand?" Ning Zhuo opened his mouth, wanting to speak.<br/>
<br/>
But the next moment, Sun Lingtong interrupted him, "If you fall into a desperate situation, I won't save you either." "Because I need to stay alive to continue gambling."<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, if there's a chance, I will avenge you." "Right now, on this matter, I make a pact with you!" Sun Lingtong raised his hand.<br/>
<br/>
Under his intense gaze, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to raise his hand as well.<br/>
<br/>
The silvery moonlight spilled over the river, creating shimmering ripples, like countless tiny diamonds dancing on the water's surface.<br/>
<br/>
The leaves on both banks swayed gently in the night breeze.<br/>
<br/>
Clap.<br/>
<br/>
The two children standing by the river lightly clapped their hands together.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo lowered his head, his lips tightly pressed.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's upturned face reflected the clear brilliance of the moonlit night.<br/>
<br/>
Only then did he grin, revealing his white teeth and a smile.<br/>
<br/>
His voice was soft yet resolute: "Thus, the pact is made."</div>
