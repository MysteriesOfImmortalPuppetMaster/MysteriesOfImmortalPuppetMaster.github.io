<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Jiufan exerted all his strength to rush over. Seeing Ning Zhuo with all his limbs intact, he finally let out a heavy sigh of relief. Ning Zhuo hurriedly ran to Ning Jiufan, his face still pale. "Ancestor, Yang Chanyu attacked us! Fortunately, with the Oil Slick Talisman, I barely escaped. But, but Zheng Jian he..." Just as he spoke, another golden core cultivator descended from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Zheng Jian!" he shouted, filled with deep sorrow. It was Zheng Danlian, one of the two ancestors of the Zheng family. His divine sense swept over Zheng Jian's body, confirming that the latter was beyond saving. His sorrowful expression was immediately replaced by anger and hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Who, who killed the genius of my clan?!" he roared, glaring fiercely at Ning Zhuo. Ning Zhuo quickly retreated behind Ning Jiufan, only sticking out his head to say, "It was Yang Chanyu from the Void Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Jiufan snorted coldly, stepping forward to shield Ning Zhuo from Zheng Danlian's oppressive aura. "Brother Zheng, the urgent matter now is to find the murderer and seek revenge. As a dignified golden core and elder of a great clan, how can you trouble a mere Qi Refining junior?" Zheng Danlian gritted his teeth, veins bulging on his forehead, as a surge of violent killing intent arose within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">At this moment, Zheng Shuangjun also arrived at the scene of the murder. He landed directly on the ground, crouching down to examine Zheng Jian's condition. "His soul is gone, only the body remains. The heart is shattered, and there's no sign of life!" Zheng Shuangjun shook his head slightly, letting out a long sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zheng Danlian shouted, "Ning Zhuo, quickly tell us what happened just now! Don't leave out any details, or I'll hold you accountable!" Ning Jiufan's mana surged. "Brother Zheng, I understand your grief. But didn't our Ning Xiaohui also fall recently? Our situations are the same!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Ning Zhuo is not the culprit. He survived this time only because of the talisman I gave him." Zheng Shuangjun interjected, speaking to Zheng Danlian, "Brother, calm your thunderous wrath. We and the Ning family are allies, not enemies." Zheng Danlian panted heavily, his eyes bloodshot, struggling to suppress his fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Only then did Ning Jiufan slightly step aside, turning gently to Ning Zhuo, speaking softly, "Go ahead, Little Zhuo, try not to miss any details." "Yes, Ancestor." Ning Zhuo quickly recounted the events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zheng Danlian frowned deeply, while Zheng Shuangjun remained expressionless. As the story neared its end, a rainbow light flew in from afar, landing here and transforming into a golden core cultivatorâ€”Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Lord Zhu, you finally arrived!" Zheng Danlian had sent a flying message earlier. Zheng Shuangjun added, "Divine Constable, our family's genius has fallen, and we need you to use your methods to capture the true culprit!" Zhu Xuanji quickly scanned the scene, responding to Zheng Danlian, then turned to Zheng Shuangjun, "I just came from another crime scene. Something happened at the Zhou family as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Sun Lingtong suddenly appeared and attacked Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen." Zheng Shuangjun: "Oh?" Zheng Danlian: "Did the two geniuses of the Zhou family also fall?" Zhu Xuanji shook his head, "I should say, the Lava Immortal Palace saved them. Although Sun Lingtong is at the Foundation Establishment stage, he was suppressed by the palace's environment. Zhou Zeshen was lightly injured, and Zhou Zhu was critically injured and near death. The situation was extremely dire at the time." Zheng Danlian snorted coldly, "The Zhou family had no casualties, but our Zheng family lost a talented junior!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Zhu Xuanji frowned slightly, understanding Zheng Danlian's grief and anger, thus his harsh tone. He ignored Zheng Danlian, surveying the surroundings, taking many steps around the scene. During this time, his eyes gleamed with golden light as he used the Origin Tracing Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In an instant, he saw the scene of Zheng Jian being pierced through the heart. The blood-stained blade became a close-up in Zhu Xuanji's vision. Zhu Xuanji sighed, "This should be Yang Chanyu's weaponâ€”the Soul-Stealing Light Blade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"When this blade is used, its aura is extremely restrained, and its power can continuously stack. Combined with Yang Chanyu's Ancient Cicada Technique, once accumulated for long enough, its power is immense! Those struck by the blade often have their souls torn and partially seized by the blade, extremely sinister. Zheng was only at the Qi Refining stage, and after being struck, his entire soul was invaded."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After this analysis, Zheng Danlian roared in anger, "Yang Chanyu! You, a dignified golden core, ambushed a Qi Refining junior, utterly shameless! I will kill you, kill you!" "Lord Zhu, quickly track her down, lead me to the murderer, and let me quench my scythe with the enemy's blood!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhu Xuanji shook his head, "The methods of the Void Sect are extraordinary. Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong acted swiftly, and once the time limit was reached, they retreated decisively, leaving no trace. How can I track them?" "Ah!" Zheng Danlian roared in frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zheng Shuangjun frowned deeply, sensing something amiss with Zheng Danlian's emotions, quickly moving to his side to calm him, "Brother, please remain calm!" "Even if Lord Zhu had a lead, it might be a deliberate trap left by the enemy to lure us in. The Void Sect is still a major evil sect, having hidden in our Fire Persimmon Immortal City for many years, not to be underestimated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">At this point, Zheng Shuangjun secretly transmitted, "Brother, if we confront Yang Chanyu, our Zheng family will simultaneously provoke two major sects. Please, you must remain calm, calm!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zheng Shuangjun's earnest persuasion finally made Zheng Danlian restrain his anger. Zheng Danlian looked at Zhu Xuanji, asking bitterly, "Lord Zhu, given the situation, will the royal family still not take action?" "I think our Zheng family, since forming an alliance, has loyally followed orders."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Previously, our Zheng family mistakenly killed a golden core true disciple of the Great Purity Palace. Now, our family's talented youth has tragically died at the hands of the Void Sect..." "Thinking back, that Shadow Demon Cultivator must also be from the Void Sect!" "How long will our Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family tolerate such evil and vicious people?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"If there's still no aid, our family might as well turn to Meng Kui and see how this city lord performs!" Zhu Xuanji's brows furrowed deeply, his expression turning stern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Brother!!" Zheng Shuangjun shouted, glaring at Zheng Danlian. Immediately, he bowed to Zhu Xuanji, explaining that Zheng Danlian was overwhelmed with anger and spoke out of turn, hoping for Zhu Xuanji's understanding and forgiveness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">After this outburst, Zheng Danlian realized his mistake, breaking out in cold sweat, and remained silent. As he stayed quiet, Ning Zhuo spoke up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo looked at Zhu Xuanji, "Lord Zhu, please, you must intervene and help us. The Void Sect is truly sinister and ruthless!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"I was lucky to escape with my life this time, relying on the Oil Slick Talisman from my ancestor. But this information has already been leaked."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"The Void Sect has the Art of Seizing Treasures. Next time they strike, they might seize the talisman first, then take my life!" "Even if they don't target me, they could easily target other members of the reformation team!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"In such a situation, how can we actively act to secure positions in the Immortal Palace?" "I believe the Void Sect is acting because they see our actions and don't want us to gain positions in the Lava Immortal Palace! Doing so would surely weaken their control over the palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo's words left the four golden core cultivators present with troubled expressions. From their perspective: City Lord Meng Kui initiated an open strategy, promising generous rewards for unchanged positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Under this strategy, cultivators must strive to secure positions, control the Immortal Palace, benefiting the overall situation. Moreover, this plan kills two birds with one stone, potentially splitting the three-family alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Previously, Zheng Jian's ultimatum to Ning Zhuo and the conflict between the Zheng and Ning families were the results of this open strategy. However, the Void Sect clearly did not want the Southern Bean Kingdom to control the Immortal Palace positions, so they immediately countered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Their countermeasure was simple: assassinate members of the reformation team. The reformation team members all held the status of trial disciples, competing for Immortal Palace positions with added benefits. Yet, these individuals were only at the Qi Refining stage, with weak combat power, making them easy targets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The reason the golden core cultivators felt troubled was their passive situation. If they protected the reformation team, they would be distracted. Even if they used the reformation team as bait, as long as the Void Sect didn't attack, they would still be tied up in manpower and resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">And if they let it be, how could the golden core cultivators explain to their clansmen? After all, they were righteous cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The golden core cultivators' dilemma did not hinder the collection of Zheng Jian's body. Not long after, Zheng Hua, the elder of the Zheng family, personally stepped forward to take charge and stabilize the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">His first action was to hold a simple memorial for Zheng Jian. The Zheng family's reformation team all participated in this memorial service.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Boss!" "Leader!!" Many looked at Zheng Jian's body, their eyes red, crying out in grief, as if this could bring Zheng Jian back to life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Ugh..." Some wanted to cry out loud but gritted their teeth to hold back. Zheng Hua stood by the coffin, his face dark and somber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">It was too tragic. The loss suffered by the Zheng family this time was devastating to Zheng Hua!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zheng Jian... This outstanding family junior not only possessed talent but also commendable character, leadership ability, and judgment of the situation, among other qualities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He was highly regarded, and in the eyes of the Zheng family's main lineage, Zheng Jian's future was at least that of a ruling elder! But he fell. He never got the chance to grow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The immense regret and pain filled Zheng Hua's heart. As a family elder, he had always held high hopes for Zheng Jian, looking forward to his future. But now, Zheng Jian, lying in the coffin, had no future!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Suddenly, a Zheng family cultivator stepped into the hall, reporting to Zheng Hua, "Sir, Ning Zhuo from the Ning family requests to see you. He says he also wants to pay his respects to Leader Zheng Jian." The reformation team members nearby erupted in noise upon hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"He still has the face to come?! If it weren't for discussing with him, how could Leader Zheng Jian have gone out?" "Why did that wretched Yang Chanyu only kill the leader and not him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"This guy once colluded with the Void Sect, and now he's gained Zhu Xuanji's forgiveness and successfully turned over a new leaf. What turning from darkness to light? Hmph, he might still be conspiring with the Void Sect. This time, he plotted against our Brother Zheng Jian!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
