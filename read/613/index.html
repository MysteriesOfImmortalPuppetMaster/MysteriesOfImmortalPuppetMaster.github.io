<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">After Qing Chi and Ning Zhuo left White Paper City Lord's mansion, they immediately gathered everyone together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Inside the room, Qing Chi proudly displayed the Military Seed to the group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Military Spirit, which was a cluster of azure light coalesced into a heart shape, had undergone a dramatic transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">It had become a seed the size of an adult's fist, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. From its pointed tip sprouted numerous delicate paper strips, resembling the rootlets of a germinating seed, fluttering in the slightest breeze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The entire seed was enveloped in layers of coarse paper money, some white and some yellow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Between the overlapping layers, a solemn human face could be faintly discerned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Is this the Military Seed? I've never seen one before," Jiao Ma's father exclaimed, his eyes wide with curiosity as he scrutinized it closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"You actually refined it! Well done, girl!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Faced with her father's praise, Qing Chi turned a burning gaze toward Ning Zhuo. "Actually, it's all thanks to Little Ma."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Qing Yan's brow furrowed slightly. He sensed that this refinement process had brought his daughter and Jiao Ma closer, marking a significant development in their relationship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Wen Ruanyu folded his arms, looking utterly unsurprised. "I told you, those two were destined to succeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Qing Yan sensed his words could be misinterpreted and quickly corrected, "The Military Seed has been successfully refined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"That's wonderful! Truly fantastic!" Jiao Ma's father exclaimed, beaming with delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo glanced at Qing Chi, from whom he had already withdrawn the Life Hanging by a Thread technique. He decided to reserve this divine ability for critical moments to avoid revealing its secrets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Now that the Military Seed is refined, let's test it out," he suggested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Everyone nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Soon, cultivators from the Qing Clan's Ghostman Race and the Jiao Clan's Human Race were summoned to the area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Qing Chi stepped forward to face the soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">She retrieved the Military Seed once more and channeled her spiritual energy into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The paper money Military Seed rapidly expanded like an inflating balloon. The outermost layer of paper unfurled, rising into the air without any wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Individual sheets of paper money began to fall, landing on the cultivators and swiftly adhering to their bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Within moments, countless paper bills enveloped the soldiers, transforming them into humanoid paper effigies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Qing Chi immediately felt a tremendous suction force emanating from the Military Seed in her hand, rapidly draining her spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Little Ma!" Qing Chi's expression shifted slightly as she instinctively called out to Ning Zhuo for help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Everyone had been watching intently. Qing Yan was about to intervene when Ning Zhuo stopped him with a word: "Don't move. I participated in the forging process, and the Military Seed recognizes my spiritual energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo acted swiftly, immediately placing his hand over the Military Seed and channeling his spiritual energy into it, greatly relieving Qing Chi's burden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Qing Chi exhaled a breath of relief. "Little Ma, thank goodness you're here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo's expression remained calm. "Qing Chi, focus. This is our first time using the Military Seed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Qing Chi nodded, savoring the word "our" and feeling a surge of sweetness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Qing Yan: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">However, Ning Zhuo's expression soon changed as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">His spiritual energy was also running low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">And this was just the beginning!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Fortunately, Ning Zhuo had a large supply of Spirit Stones and Medicinal Pills. He immediately replenished his reserves, maintaining his spiritual energy at a stable level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This situation persisted for half a day before finally subsiding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The paper money clinging to the cultivators began to fall, disintegrating mid-air into countless paper shreds that ultimately vanished completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The changes in the cultivators were visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">They became lean and wiry. The exposed skin of the Jiao Clan cultivators turned deathly pale, while the skin of the Qing Clan Ghostman Race became even darker and more profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Their bodies now contained a significant amount of yin energy, yet it coexisted harmoniously with their physical forms, showing no signs of rejection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Upon careful examination with their divine sense, Ning Zhuo and the others discovered that the cultivators' bodies, souls, and even their three dantians had undergone subtle transformations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Though the extent of these changes was minimal, the direction of their evolution was strikingly consistent across all individuals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I've also learned two new spells," one cultivator volunteered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Me too! It's like they were directly imprinted into my mind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Why did I only get one?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Differences between cultivators persisted. Even with identical cultivation methods, their results varied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Qing Chi inquired further and identified the two spells as the Paper Armor Technique and the Yin Crossing Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">As its name suggested, the Paper Armor Technique allowed cultivators to summon layers of talisman paper to envelop their bodies, enhancing their defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Yin Crossing Technique enabled soldiers to adapt and survive in environments saturated with yin energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"If we continue cultivating them with the Military Seed method, they should comprehend more techniques. This might even include methods for traversing the yin and yang realms," Ning Zhuo speculated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Little Ma, you're so clever! That must be it. But does every cultivation process require such a tremendous effort?" Qing Chi asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">This wasn't just about expending effort. To support this cultivation process, he had spent a considerable amount of Spirit Stones and Medicinal Pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Still," Ning Zhuo thought, observing the assembled cultivators, "having a Military Seed truly makes things far more convenient and advanced."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"This investment was absolutely worth it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo recalled the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei had to exhaust themselves training their subordinates, only to produce ordinary soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But with a Military Seed, the transformation was fundamentally different!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The cultivators' souls and bodies had undergone profound enhancements and alterations. In this regard, Military Seeds were similar to the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, the Underworld Punishment Codex, and other methods that strengthened a cultivator's foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Though focused on a single purpose, the Military Seed's effects were comprehensive, transforming both the physical body and the soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo's thoughts drifted to the Red Flower Camp. "Does the Red Flower Camp have a corresponding Military Seed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"If you want to avoid such strenuous effort, there's another way," Li Xiangshang interjected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Noticing everyone's attention, he continued, "This involves the subsequent steps. Once the Military Seed is successfully refined, the next step is Military Logistics!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"We need to invest substantial resources into the Military Seed to ensure its robust growth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Once the Military Seed has a solid foundation, it will no longer require us to constantly infuse it with spiritual energy. It will be able to cultivate itself through cycles of growth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"In fact, this is the most correct way to use it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Qing Chi asked, "What resources are needed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Li Xiangshang replied, "Basically, anything of value will do. Spirit Stones, for example."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Of course, there are also some special requirements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Since this Military Seed corresponds to Paper Money Spirit Envoys, it undoubtedly has unique military logistics needs. Meeting these needs will accelerate and enhance the growth of the Military Seed's foundation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Qing Chi frowned. "But I can't sense any specific logistics requirements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Li Xiangshang explained, "That's likely because the Military Seed has only just been refined and hasn't been cultivated to a certain level yet. That's why you can't sense them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Haha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"This is also my first time assisting in refining a Military Seed, so I'm not entirely clear on the details myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Even so, this was enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Li Xiangshang's words provided the group with a clear direction forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But that was precisely the problem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo and the others frowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">They had already scraped the bottom of the barrel to refine the Military Seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Even that had only been possible thanks to the joint support of the White Paper City Lord and General Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Now, they needed even more resources!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The difficulty of building an army was truly terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">To put it simply, it all came down to money.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">A substantial amount of cultivation resources was still needed to fully develop the Military Seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But Ning Zhuo had nearly exhausted his personal wealth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Where would the remaining funds come from?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Wen Ruanyu said, "Now that we've reached this point, I'll report back immediately. I hope the White Paper City Lord will generously provide support."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">After all, establishing a proper army would greatly benefit the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Li Xiangshang emphasized, "Cultivating the Military Seed isn't just about teaching spells; it's also about imparting experience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"All combat experience gained by the new army will be stored within the Military Seed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"When training new recruits in the future, we can directly instill this experience into them, rapidly transforming them into seasoned veterans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Oh, right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"During the Military Logistics phase, Qing Chi, you'll also need to study Military Manuals."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"The goal isn't to master every tactical detail, but to determine the optimal Military System for our forces."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Once your Military Strategist realm is sufficient, you can add new restrictions to the Military Seed. These restrictions, derived from the Military Manuals, form the bedrock of military construction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Military Logistics and Military Systems complement each other. It's best if both progress in tandem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Qing Chi groaned, clutching her head. "What? More books?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo turned to Li Xiangshang. "I participated in the Military Seed's creation and served as deputy commander. Can I add restrictions as well?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Li Xiangshang replied, "That should be possible, but it would likely require Qing Chi's approval and cooperation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">This condition was as good as no condition at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"The realm of a Military Strategist..." Ning Zhuo murmured, "It seems I need to study more Military Manuals."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Qing Chi nodded. "Little Ma, I'm counting on you for this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"No, you need to study them too," Ning Zhuo replied. "I'm ultimately just the deputy commander. You're the rightful commander."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Qing Chi looked distressed. "Then can I be the deputy commander and you take the lead, Little Ma?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Ahem! Ahem!" Qing Yan coughed violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo's expression turned solemn. "Qing Chi, stop joking. You're the one who forged the Military Heart. You're far more suited to be the commander than I am."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Qing Yan's tightly furrowed brow instantly relaxed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Inside the room, the Qing Clan Ghostman Race cultivators, who had been tense since Qing Chi's admission, began to relax.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">A moment later, they were about to unanimously reject the idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo's timely intervention eased the tension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Jiao Ma's father, however, secretly regretted the turn of events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo swept his gaze across the room before fixing it on Jiao Ma's father. "For the military logistics phase, how much can the Jiao Clan contribute?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Jiao Ma's father's heart skipped a beat. After a moment's hesitation, he named a figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "Not enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">He immediately quadrupled the figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Jiao Ma's father shook his head vehemently. "We can't afford that. Our family simply doesn't have that kind of wealth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Undeterred, Ning Zhuo pressed his case with logical arguments and relentless bargaining, until Jiao Ma's father, pale-faced and gritting his teeth, finally relented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The onlookers were stunned. Even Jiao Ma doesn't hold back when it comes to his own father, they thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Next, Ning Zhuo turned his attention to Qing Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Even Qing Yan, a Golden Core cultivator, felt his heart skip a beat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Our new army is primarily led by the Qing Clan," Ning Zhuo said. "I'm merely the deputy commander. Given the Jiao Clan's substantial contribution, it's only right that the Qing Clan should contribute even more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Qing Yan's expression turned grave. "The Qing Clan isn't as wealthy as the Jiao Clan..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">He gritted his teeth. "But you're right. Our clan should contribute more!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">In the end, Qing Yan also agreed to provide a significant sum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">However, even with both clans' contributions, the funds were woefully inadequate for the military logistics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">According to Li Xiangshang, the expenses for this phase would far exceed the cost of refining the Military Seeds themselves!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Fortunately, the White Paper City Lord, upon learning that the Military Seed project had been established, immediately allocated substantial funds with a grand wave of her hand. The scale of her support astonished everyone, and they couldn't help but secretly admire her vision and magnanimity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">With the Lord's unwavering backing, the Military Logistics phase finally gained the confidence to proceed. Without it, even ten percent of the initial costs couldn't have been covered by the Qing Clan and Jiao Clan alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo had already suspended his personal cultivation to focus entirely on nurturing the Military Seed. This rare opportunity proved immensely rewarding. In his spare time, he no longer cultivated his Soul but instead immersed himself in Military Manuals, striving to comprehend a viable Military System. He even drastically reduced his physical cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">This wasn't due to laziness on Ning Zhuo's part. He had lent the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat to Li Xiangshang. Despite Li Xiangshang's mediocre talent, his unique aptitude remained invaluable for nurturing the Military Seed. However, Li Xiangshang couldn't sustain this process alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">After a private discussion with Ning Zhuo, they discovered that activating this aptitude caused Li Xiangshang's body to begin rotting. Medicinal Pills offered minimal relief; his true lifeline lay in the inherent resilience of his physical constitution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">With this in mind, Ning Zhuo thought of the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat. By using this treasure to cultivate his physical body, Li Xiangshang could cleverly borrow the power of heaven and earth, allowing them to nourish him as if he were an infant. This would fundamentally enhance his physical foundation, making it perfectly suited for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Li Xiangshang's delight and endless gratitude to Ning Zhuo was a given.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">At the same time, Qing Chi, who under Ning Zhuo's guidance, had barely a moment to spare as she devoured the Military Manual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Firstly, the cultivation of Military Seeds was a matter of survival for both clans, and Qing Chi dared not neglect it. Secondly, studying the manual alongside Ning Zhuo, with whom she could discuss and debate, greatly motivated her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Jiao Ma, I think I've grasped a Military System," Qing Chi suddenly announced one day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">After discussing it with her, Ning Zhuo confirmed that she had indeed comprehended it, rather than merely memorizing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">This renewed his admiration for Qing Chi's talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">To be frank, Qing Chi's aptitude was astonishing. Despite her youth, she had already reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">More crucially, her combat prowess was extraordinary, rivaling that of Golden Core cultivators!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">While she lacked skill in artifact refining, her comprehension of military strategy far surpassed Ning Zhuo's own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ning Zhuo himself hadn't grasped it, but Qing Chi had already figured it out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"What kind of military system is it?" Ning Zhuo asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"Absolute obedience to orders!" Qing Chi declared triumphantly, pointing to a passage in the Military Manual. "I had an epiphany when I read this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ning Zhuo glanced at the passage, which read: "Soldiers who obey their commanders' orders without question shall be rewarded; those who disobey shall be executed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">He had read this passage before and understood the principle, but he hadn't realized it was the foundation of a military system.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">With ample military logistics and a well-defined military system, the cultivation of Military Seeds took a giant leap forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The most visible result was a dramatic transformation in the soldiers' morale and discipline. Combined with weapons and armor specially selected by the White Paper City Lord, the new army's outstanding performance in the city defense against the ghost tides completely astonished everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">By this point, news of White Paper Immortal City's impending military force could no longer be concealed. The news spread rapidly throughout the city, causing a massive sensation.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
