<paragraph index="1">Two days later, a flash of light illuminated the teleportation chamber as Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong materialized within the teleportation array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Little Zhuo, come on, follow me," Sun Lingtong said, striding forward to lead the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He pushed open the chamber door, and Ning Zhuo followed him into the Formation Core Chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Lingtong walked directly to the formation plate, a massive disc the size of a millstone. He placed his plump little hand on the plate and channeled spiritual energy into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The formation plate hummed to life, emitting a faint glow as it responded to Sun Lingtong's command.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sun Lingtong sighed in admiration. "The Luoshu is truly a divine artifact. Without its guidance, I could have spent a hundred days here and still not solved this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In just two days, Sun Lingtong had already cracked the Jade Cleansing Hall's Cave Estate Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo praised him sincerely. "When it comes to breaking formations, you're the real master, Boss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lingtong grinned smugly. "Little Zhuo, you have talent too. If we have time in the future, I'll teach you properly, and you could become as skilled as me. Maybe even surpass me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "Boss, your spatial perception is extraordinary, and you always pinpoint the correct solution. That kind of talent is perfect for formation deployment. I don't have that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Still, once I join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, I'll definitely delve into the Sect's scriptures, study diligently, and enrich my knowledge!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo was a voracious learner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He had once devoured every book in the Ning Clan's library.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But his pursuit of the Lava Immortal Palace and his travels abroad had left him no time for reading.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He was still young, barely in his teens, with so much to learn and grow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Time truly felt insufficient!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong waved him over. "Come, perform the sacrifice on the formation plate and leave your spiritual energy signature."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo complied, granting him free access to the Jade Cleansing Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The two companions set off to explore the Jade Cleansing Hall together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Though Ning Zhuo had experienced the entire adventure through Life Hanging by a Thread, as if he were physically present alongside Sun Lingtong, his True Form's arrival brought a completely different sensation, his emotions surging like turbulent waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sun Lingtong had already deciphered the Jade Cleansing Hall's layout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Originally a complete palace, the structure had been radically altered by Meng Yaoyin's modifications.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The central hub was the Formation Core Chamber, to which a small teleportation chamber had been added. This chamber's teleportation array connected to a hidden stone chamber within Vine-Clasping Cliff, serving as a secret entrance and exit route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Formation Core Chamber had six doors, each leading to the Paper Puppet Chamber, Fish Dance Pavilion, Storage Chamber, Jade Rinse Courtyard, Divination Chamber, and Living Quarters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">A connecting corridor, known as the Six-Bend Corridor, linked the Formation Core Chamber to these six chambers. This corridor was a marvel of Formation Void Construction, a technique that manipulated spatial voids to create artificial environments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">As Ning Zhuo walked through the corridor, its shimmering waters reflecting the light, he couldn't help but wonder what his mother's life had been like here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The iridescent shadows of Jade Lake's fish danced across his simple Daoist Robe, yet he had no time to admire them. His footsteps never faltered as he strode purposefully toward a particular chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo arrived at the Fish Dance Pavilion and paused by the spring, gazing intently at the water. On a whim, he retrieved some Spirit Food and tossed it into the spring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The red-scaled goldfish that lived here could absorb Qi from the water and feed on aquatic plants. Seeing the Spirit Food, they swarmed eagerly, as if craving a change in their diet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The fish became agitated, splashing and thrashing in the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but wonder, Did Mother ever come here to feed the fish when she was bored?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The goldfish swallowed the Spirit Food, then immediately spat it out. Some choked on the water, while others flipped belly-up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Uh..." Ning Zhuo stared in dismay, realizing he had fed the fish Dark Cuisine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He quickly cast a spell to save them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The goldfish came back to life, darting to the bottom of the pond, avoiding Ning Zhuo as if he were a plague.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo arrived at the Paper Puppet Chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He sat at the table, gently stroking its surface. "Mother must have often sat here, hunched over her work, crafting all sorts of paper puppets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He looked up, his gaze sweeping across the surrounding walls, where shadow puppets of the twelve zodiac animals hung. "Did Mother make all of these?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo then went to the Jade Rinse Courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">As he stared into the jade pit, he imagined Meng Yaoyin sitting alone on the edge, performing hand seals to extract the jade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Next, Ning Zhuo visited the Living Quarters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">A vision formed in his mind: Meng Yaoyin dragging her weary body back here. She lay alone on the massive clamshell bed, frowning as she drifted off to sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Three hundred and sixty Dreamwalking Pearls floated silently around her, emitting a soft, soothing light that calmed her Divine Soul, yet failed to dispel the weariness and hidden worries etched between her brows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Even in her dreams, Meng Yaoyin continued to train herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Finally, Ning Zhuo arrived at the Divination Chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He stood before the swirling water vortex, watching its ceaseless transformations. His gaze swept across the devastated room, half-destroyed, as if he could see Meng Yaoyin facing the Luoshu pages here, struggling to perform her divinations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The glow of the spell cast her figure into stark relief, making her appear even smaller and more isolated, like an ant exploring the vastness of the cosmos in search of answers to its own destiny.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Sun Lingtong sighed at the swirling vortex, "This puzzle is too complex, constantly shifting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"The formation in the corridor uses external cloud patterns as a reference for its random transformations. But this vortex calculates its movements based on the pages of the Luoshu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"To quickly obtain the Luoshu, we'll have to forcefully destroy the vortex. While the formation is intricate, its actual scale isn't massive. With proper preparation, we can directly obliterate it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"But doing so would create a massive disturbance. The entire Jade Cleansing Hall might even collapse!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Sun Lingtong sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">His personality made it unbearable to see treasure so close yet remain out of reach. The tantalizing prospect left him itching with anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo maintained his usual composure. "No need to rush, Boss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"I've already kept Niu Cheng occupied."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Let's move all the items from the Cave Estate into the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong nodded. "Let's go, let's do it together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Previously, he had hesitated to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Now, things were different. Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong controlled the entire Cave Estate Formation, allowing them to move the objects without triggering alarms or defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">After a laborious effort, virtually all the items had been transferred to the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Come," Ning Zhuo said, his composure gradually returning as he reviewed the inventory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">With this, he had successfully completed one of the tasks outlined in the Message Jade Slip left by the Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"As Mother instructed, I can burn these all to replenish her spiritual energy when the Great Serpent Scythe vibrates."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"I wonder... how much spiritual energy will burning down a Cave Estate like the Jade Cleansing Hall yield?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"And then there's the Cloud Talisman Flowing Formation Market. It has a Talisman Crafting Chamber where Mother used to spend much of her time. According to intelligence reports, she personally oversaw many of the market's construction projects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo had initially planned to include the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat in the burning, but Meng Yaoyin had specifically mentioned this Quasi-Spirit Treasure in her Jade Slip message, strictly forbidding him from destroying it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Being a dutiful son, Ning Zhuo naturally obeyed his mother's wishes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong finished moving the last item, clapping his hands to dust them off. "Little Zhuo, are you going to reclaim the Cloud Talisman Flowing Formation Market next?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"According to the intelligence, this won't be easy," Sun Ning said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Deputy Workshop Master Jinzi had long since taken control of the Talisman Crafting Workshop. He treated Meng Yaoyin with great respect, frequently mentioning her to outsiders and issuing missions to compel cultivators to search for her whereabouts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Although Meng Yaoyin's Soul Lamp had been extinguished within the Sect, and the Jade Cleansing Hall had been sealed, Jinzi maintained an air of disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Since assuming leadership of the workshop, he had worked diligently, showing no signs of negligence or carelessness. He managed every detail meticulously, operating the workshop with airtight efficiency and steadily increasing its prosperity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Despite their youth, Sun Ning and Sun Lingtong had experienced the harsh realities of the world and understood the complexities of human nature. They both recognized Jinzi's true intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">His relationship with Meng Yaoyin had never been close; he had merely been one of her subordinates recruited from outside the Sect. Yet he now acted as if he couldn't forget his former master, using minimal effort to win people's hearts and seize control of the entire Talisman Crafting Workshop under the guise of legitimacy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">His dedication to the workshop was evident, suggesting that he secretly regarded it as his personal property.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong concluded that if Ning Zhuo were to present the contract and demand control of the workshop immediately, he would likely fail and alert the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo smiled calmly. "No need to rush, no need to rush."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Now that he had obtained the inheritance, he truly felt no urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo had a plan. "Once Wen Ruanyu completes his report and my true identity is revealed and publicly acknowledged, claiming the Talisman Crafting Chamber will be far easier than it is now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong chuckled. "Looks like my worries were unfounded. Little Zhuo, as long as you understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">That very evening, Wen Ruanyu sent a flying message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">In his message, he updated Ning Zhuo on his progress: first, his extended stay in White Paper Immortal City had accumulated too many matters requiring reporting, causing delays. With the Flying Cloud Assembly approaching, most cultivators were preoccupied with this major event, leaving few available to question or record Wen Ruanyu's report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Second, the Myriad Manifestations Sect placed great importance on White Paper Immortal City. Given the recent significant incident, they intended to send high-ranking sect elders to personally oversee the matter. However, the selection of these elders remained undecided.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Wen Ruanyu had keenly sensed that the Myriad Manifestations Sect's upper echelons were already coveting the benefits of White Paper Immortal City. Various factions were secretly vying for power, each seeking to secure the position of chief administrator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">If any faction succeeded, they could directly interfere in the city's affairs through their appointed administrator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Wen Ruanyu had explicitly revealed this suspicion to Ning Zhuo in his letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He also mentioned that he hadn't yet informed the higher-ups about Ning Zhuo's situation, urging him to prepare as soon as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"The Ghostly Black Marshlands, located between the Flying Cloud Kingdom and the North Wind Kingdom, are a delicate strategic point that truly needs to be controlled."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Moreover, the region is exceptionally rich in cultivation resources for the Ghost Dao and Soul Dao. Even the two neighboring kingdoms lack such a treasure trove."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"In that case... this arrangement isn't bad at all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo needed time to adjust to his new environment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">His status as Meng Yaoyin's son was advantageous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">For one thing, the inheritance alone was substantial. As the legitimate heir of a Golden Core True Disciple, his lineage was impeccable, making him more readily accepted by his fellow sect members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">However, once this identity was revealed, Ning Zhuo would lose his covert advantage. Jin Zi, for example, would undoubtedly focus all his attention on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">This was precisely what Ning Zhuo had hoped to avoid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">For over a decade, Ning Zhuo had cultivated a habit of restraint and maintained a low profile. It was only after he began his travels that he gradually transformed, adopting a dignified demeanor and a fiercely competitive spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Staying in the shadows allows me to see things more clearly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"As the son of Meng Yaoyin, I hold a significant position within White Paper Immortal City. Moreover, I serve as the Vice City Lord. In the eyes of the higher echelons, I'm likely seen as a crucial pawn to be seized."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo had already anticipated that he would come under the scrutiny of the higher echelons, becoming a target of contention for various factions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">However, Wen Ruanyu's deliberate efforts to shield Ning Zhuo from official duties had indirectly granted him some freedom of action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Silently grateful, Ning Zhuo devoted himself to cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">As he reached the stage of comprehending the Three Sects' Supreme Methods, the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art continued to hinder his progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo's primary focus remained the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The original Golden Core Wheel could only accommodate a single Five Elements-aligned Golden Core. Through the Formation within the Wheel, one element would generate the other four, allowing the entire Wheel to provide Five Elements spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo designed a new Five Elements Wheel, slightly larger than the previous one, with a prominent triangular formation pattern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">At each of the three corners were circular slots, each capable of housing any three of the Five Elements Golden Cores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Yes, the new Five Elements Wheel could simultaneously accommodate three Five Elements Golden Cores. This tripled the spiritual energy output compared to the previous model, and the circulation of spiritual energy was also significantly accelerated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo retrieved three standard Golden Cores and tested the wheel. The results matched his design specifications perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Design successful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The inspiration came from Yu Heye's Reverse Five Elements Golden Core. Through experimentation, Ning Zhuo gained a deeper understanding of the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The greatest assistance came from the Luoshu scroll.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">It was through the Dao Artifact's computational power that Ning Zhuo could perform the extensive calculations necessary to derive the new Five Elements Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Five Elements Formation was engraved onto the formation plate and refined several times until the plate and formation became a unified whole. Only then was the project considered complete.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The art of array formation is widely applied in cultivation, as evidenced by the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel. Otherwise, it wouldn't be universally recognized as one of the Four Great Arts of Cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Upon successfully refining the wheel, Ning Zhuo eagerly showed it off to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Sun Lingtong was genuinely delighted for Ning Zhuo, his eyes shining with excitement. "With this, our Black Iron Han Armor will be even more formidable! Let me try it out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo smiled and handed him the Five Elements Wheel, explaining, "Boss, you should use it like this..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He was halfway through his explanation when his expression suddenly froze, and he stopped speaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Sun Lingtong was about to ask what was wrong when he noticed Ning Zhuo's expression and immediately fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">In that moment, Ning Zhuo was desperately trying to capture a fleeting spiritual light that had just flashed through his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He caught it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The moment he grasped the spiritual light, it felt as if he had pierced through a thin layer of paper. His understanding of the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual deepened more than twofold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo immediately sat cross-legged on the ground, closed his eyes, and focused all his energy on reviewing the manual's contents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Within his Qi Sea, his dantian glowed brilliantly, manifesting a phenomenon that condensed into a talisman seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">With this, Ning Zhuo's Qi Sea had reached the Phenomenon Seed Talisman stage!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
