<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo sighed, "Just the other day, I was discussing Yu Xiaoman and the Luoshu with Shen Xi. I never imagined we'd actually encounter it in reality."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Sun Lingtong's eyes burned as he stared at the swirling vortex. "The most valuable treasure in the Jade Cleansing Pavilion is the Luoshu Page. It's a Dao Artifact, even if it's incomplete."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"If I activate my Innate Talent and glimpse the page, its influence will grant me a tremendous boost in mathematics and logic!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Lingtong carefully relived his recent experience. Under the Luoshu's influence, he had become a mathematical genius.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The sensation was utterly addictive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"It's like the Spirit Hidden Willow... Boss, I understand how you feel," Ning Zhuo said, his voice tinged with empathy. He and Sun Lingtong shared a life-bond, making him acutely aware of the other's emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Luoshu Page did resemble the Spirit Hidden Willow in its specialized focus, but the similarities were superficial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The key difference lay in their nature. The Spirit Hidden Willow enhanced comprehension, while the Luoshu Page recorded the fundamental mathematical and logical principles of the universe, guaranteeing absolute accuracy. Thus, the Luoshu's insights inevitably led to correct understanding!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Spirit Hidden Willow's assistance might have yielded incorrect results, but its creativity was undeniable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Luoshu's creativity, on the other hand, was zero. It provided correct answers, but the extent to which cultivators could create and understand depended entirely on their own abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">There was no need to doubt Sun Lingtong's comprehension skills; in this regard, he even surpassed Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Little Zhuo, I'm going to continue probing the Luoshu. Try using Life Hanging by a Thread and focus all your senses at the same time!" Sun Lingtong suggested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Great idea!" Ning Zhuo immediately agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sun Lingtong activated his Innate Spirit Eyes again. As his gaze touched the Luoshu Page's true form, he was immediately affected by the Dao Artifact's influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"That's it!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed excitedly. "Little Zhuo, how do you feel?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">At Vine-Clasping Cliff, Ning Zhuo's eyes were tightly closed, his brow furrowed slightly, showing signs of strain. He transmitted mentally, "Elder Brother, I'm also being affected."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"This is absolutely fantastic!" Sun Lingtong replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Using the Luoshu Page, he began rapidly studying the swirling vortex before him. Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment before retrieving the Jade Slip given to him by Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The originally profound concepts gradually became easier to understand and more accessible to Ning Zhuo as he studied them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Sun Lingtong only sustained his Innate Talent for sixteen breaths before stopping, closing his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">This time, blood flowed not only from his nose but also from his ears, leaving him in a dazed state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sun Lingtong immediately sat cross-legged, took a Medicinal Pill, and began circulating his Cultivation Art to regulate his breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">It took him the time it takes to brew half a cup of tea to fully recover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo also adjusted his condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Again!" Sun Lingtong called out, activating his Spirit Eye Innate Talent once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo once again benefited from this process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After several repetitions, Sun Lingtong gained a deeper understanding of the water vortex before them. "This natural Formation doesn't just utilize the Magic Artifacts and magic treasures placed in the divination chamber. It also draws upon the Water Vein Spiritual Qi here, and even the surrounding Void!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo's expression turned serious, recognizing the gravity of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong sighed. "So, we can't forcibly take the Luoshu. It's the core of this Formation and the heart of the whirlpool. The Formation is unstable, constantly shifting, and it's precisely the Luoshu's principles that maintain its equilibrium."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"If we suddenly remove the Luoshu, the Formation will collapse without its computational core. The contained power and surrounding Void will erupt, annihilating everything around it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"At that point, not only would my body be obliterated, but the entire Cave Mansion would be destroyed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This was, of course, unacceptable to Ning Zhuo and Sun Ning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo had methods to rescue Sun Lingtong, but the whirlpool Formation's entanglement with the surrounding Void rendered those methods ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo would never risk Sun Lingtong's life for a mere Dao Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"How soon can we dismantle this Formation and retrieve the Luoshu Page?" Ning Zhuo asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Sun Lingtong forced a bitter smile. "It's hard to estimate. The challenge lies in it being a natural Formation, constantly evolving. If it were one of the Ten Grand Formations, we'd have a much easier time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Let me try to decipher the Formation. That would be equivalent to contending with this Dao Artifact. Unless my computational abilities surpass those of the Luoshu Page, I won't be able to calculate ahead of it and resolve the crisis in time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo assessed the situation and shook his head. "The risk is too great."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"There's no need to forcibly extract the Luoshu Page. We have plenty of time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Sun Lingtong nodded. "First, let me use the Luoshu to comprehend the Cave Mansion Formation within the Formation Core and gain control of this place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This task would be far less challenging than resolving the water vortex Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Though the Cave Mansion Formation was ever-changing, its fundamental principles remained constant, leaving traces to follow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo continued, "Once we control the Cave Mansion Formation, we'll evacuate everything here and temporarily relocate it to the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Sun Lingtong nodded. "That's feasible. But we still need to keep an eye on the outside world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo understood what he meant. "Don't worry, Boss. I've already sent people to investigate. We'll act immediately once we confirm the intelligence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sun Lingtong was referring to none other than Niu Cheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Niu Cheng's situation was dire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He was surrounded by a mob of furious cultivators demanding answers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Niu Cheng had a square jaw, a wide mouth, broad shoulders, a thick back, and skin tanned to a bronze hue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">His gaze lacked sharpness, and surrounded by the crowd of cultivators, his expression was one of panic and unease. He repeatedly bowed and clasped his hands in apology, stammering his excuses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He wore indigo coarse cloth short-sleeved robes, with the sleeves and pant legs rolled up to his elbows and knees, revealing sturdy forearms and calves. A worn, polished oxhide belt encircled his waist, from which a foot-long brass skewer hung diagonally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">His feet were shod in thousand-layered cloth shoes, their uppers and soles stained with fresh mud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"I... I never imagined it would turn out like this," he stammered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"I thought I'd get an Array Dao Magical Treasure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"It was truly unintentional!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Niu Cheng's apologies failed to appease the cultivators; instead, they grew even more relentless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Make way!" Yu Heye suddenly appeared, flying before the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He glared at Niu Cheng and roared, demanding to know what kind of mess he'd made, causing his pill refinement to fail and resulting in catastrophic losses!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">To convince the crowd, Yu Heye produced a handful of discarded materials, immediately eliciting gasps of shock and regret. The cultivators recognized Nascent Soul-level precious materials among the waste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Comparing their own losses to Yu Heye's, the cultivators' anger and resentment diminished significantly. Yu Heye's losses far surpassed their own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"He's the true victim here!" the cultivators unanimously concluded, unaware that Yu Heye had been ordered to stage this scene. The discarded pill refinement materials had been deliberately arranged before his arrival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Put all these losses on my account," Ning Zhuo declared magnanimously in his Flying Message to Yu Heye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Yu Heye, of course, refused. He insisted on taking full responsibility, personally paying to destroy Nascent Soul-level precious materials and staging a fake alchemy failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This elaborate deception granted him immense leverage the moment he stepped onto the scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Yu Heye confronted Niu Cheng: "Speak. How will you compensate me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Niu Cheng, ever honest, spread his hands, admitting he couldn't afford to pay but vowing to work tirelessly to make amends, no matter how long it took.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"What if you try to run?" Yu Heye pressed, feigning contemplation before declaring, "Fine, you'll stay on my mountain peak under my supervision!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"You want Xie Tang's Array Dao Magical Treasure? Go ahead. Maybe you'll impress Heavy Array Peak and use their reward to repay our debts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"What do you all think? Is this acceptable?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The cultivators exchanged glances, and after a moment of silence, they unanimously agreed to the proposal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Their losses were minimal compared to Yu Heye's. In truth, many didn't even require compensation; the amount was so trivial it was inconsequential to them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Some, however, genuinely needed restitution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Yu Heye had suffered the greatest losses, and none of them were willing to waste their time and energy guarding Niu Cheng, a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After a moment's consideration, they all agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Yu Heye, however, wasn't finished. He produced a contract and had all the aggrieved parties sign it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The cultivators examined the contract text thoroughly, found no issues, and signed their names.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Finally, Yu Heye handed the contract to Niu Cheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Under the intense scrutiny of countless eyes, Niu Cheng had no choice but to read it and sign.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Yu Heye then grabbed Niu Cheng by the collar and dragged him back to Vine-Clasping Cliff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"You'll stay in the front chamber and cultivate by my side for now," Yu Heye sternly instructed. "No wandering off."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Niu Cheng hung his head and mumbled his assent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Having settled the matter, Yu Heye immediately sent a Flying Message to Ning Zhuo to report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo received the message, nodded slightly, and dismissed Niu Cheng from his thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">This was the best course of action for now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">While Ning Zhuo certainly had the power to prevent Niu Cheng from seeking the Array Dao Magical Treasure, doing so would have several negative consequences. It would draw unwanted attention, be difficult to explain, and damage his reputation, making him appear like a bully who preyed on the weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">If he were to be labeled with such a reputation, it would severely damage his public image.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo operated through Yu Heye, ensuring no one suspected him as the mastermind pulling the strings from behind the scenes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Moreover, deliberately sacrificing a Nascent Soul-level treasure to coordinate the other victims and force Niu Cheng to submit was a profitable move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Now that Niu Cheng was under Yu Heye's watchful eye, Ning Zhuo could secretly control his progress in exploring the Nine Palaces Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">With just a few Flying Messages and a Nascent Soul-level treasure, Ning Zhuo had eliminated a potential future threat while successfully maintaining his reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Luoshu Page truly lived up to its extraordinary reputation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Leveraging the influence of the Dao Artifact's shadow cast upon Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo spent only two and a half days deciphering nearly half of Shen Xi's Jade Slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He gained a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the Mountain-Protecting Grand Formations of Vine-Clasping Cliff and Cloud-Scraping Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong also grasped the intricacies of the Formations within the Formation Cores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">But this wasn't enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">While Sun Lingtong studied the Formations using the Luoshu Page, Ning Zhuo quietly left Vine-Clasping Cliff and teleported to another mountain peak via a small teleportation array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">This was White Willow Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The entire mountain was planted with white willow trees, a spirit plant naturally capable of absorbing surrounding Cloud Qi, which clung to its leaves. As the Cloud Qi accumulated and blanketed the green foliage, the trees turned a pristine white, giving the peak its name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The summit of White Willow Peak had been carved into a smooth jade platform by cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Upon this jade platform stood a cluster of interconnected buildings, their layout meticulously arranged as integral components of the Cloud Talisman Flowing City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The Cloud Talisman Flowing City was an enterprise personally established by Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The entire workshop resembled a massive green jade paperweight, firmly anchored at the peak's center. All structures were constructed from iron pine wood, their overhanging eaves extending into the Void, while colorful light shimmered across the glazed tiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo surveyed the workshop from above.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">At the heart of the complex lay an open space, forming the Radiant Talisman Drying Field. The Material Intake Courtyard housed cultivators responsible for transporting, sorting, and performing preliminary processing of raw materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Two towering structures dominated the skyline. The Flowing Cloud Transformation Tower mass-produced Cloud Talismans, while the Thunder-Drawing Tower refined talismans through lightning tempering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Three pavilions stood nearby. The Firming Talisman Pavilion, shaped like a turtle shell, specialized in solidifying talismans. The Star-Pointing Terrace enhanced talisman quality, and the Sand-Melting Pavilion was dedicated to crafting high-grade and even top-grade talisman ink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The front courtyard was used for selling talismans, while the rear hall housed the Jade Slip containing the Cloud Talisman Heavenly Tome. Combined with the Grand Formation, this setup not only protected the entire workshop but also aided in the production of talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo descended from his cloud head, stepped through the workshop gate archway, and entered the front courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">A cacophony of voices surged toward him like a heatwave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Cultivators crowded around the talismans, haggling over prices. One vendor shouted, "Invisibility Talismans - minimum order of a hundred! Buy a thousand and get a hundred free!" Another cultivator tossed a bulging storage pouch onto the counter, declaring, "I'll take all the Cloud Soaring Talismans on the counter today!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">After a brief stroll, Ning Zhuo noticed that Cloud Talismans were the most prevalent and popular type.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">A quick calculation revealed that this place was practically minting gold daily!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Suddenly, a heated argument erupted nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"We agreed on the 'Cold Plum Welcoming Snow' discount - 20% off! Thirty Ice Armor Talismans at 720 Spirit Stones after the discount! Cash on delivery! Why are you backing out now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The cultivator behind the counter hastily retorted, "That promotion ended yesterday! Pay the remaining 180 Spirit Stones immediately!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The buyer sneered. "That's your mistake, not mine. I've already paid. You're obligated to deliver the goods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The argument drew the attention of many onlookers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo watched with keen interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">As the dispute escalated, a Golden Core cultivator entered the front courtyard, abacus in hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Along the way, numerous cultivators bowed respectfully, demonstrating his prestige.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">It was Deputy Pavilion Master Jin Zi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Jin Zi approached the quarreling pair, clarified the situation, and nodded amiably to the buyer. "Rest assured, customer. The mistake lies with us. The talismans will be delivered according to the agreed-upon price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Under his command, the selling cultivator reluctantly handed over the talismans to the buyer, though clearly unwilling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The buyer cupped his hands in a respectful bow, offered a flattering remark to Jin Zi, and strode away triumphantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Jin Zi turned to the selling cultivator. "These losses will be deducted from your salary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The cultivator's face paled, and he could only nod meekly in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Jin Zi cupped his hands in a greeting to the crowd, then departed the front courtyard, mounting a cloud to leave Cloud Talisman Flowing City. Clearly, his intervention had been a mere detour.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo watched his receding figure, his eyes flickering with contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
