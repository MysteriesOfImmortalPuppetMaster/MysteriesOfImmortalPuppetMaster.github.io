<paragraph index="1">Green Stone Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Young Master, you've returned," Old Chef greeted him. "Servant Sun hasn't returned yet. Qing Chi is practicing combat with your Mechanical Puppet in the Martial Training Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Old Chef gave a brief report. In his eyes, Sun Lingtong was merely Ning Zhuo's attendant, so he often referred to him as "Servant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo nodded. "Thank you, Old Chef. Please prepare a portion of Spirit Food for me - Dark Cuisine. Deliver it to the formation's Void space in half an hour."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo, with his Life Hanging by a Thread ability, was well aware of Sun Lingtong's movements; the latter was currently returning from Thousand Kitchen Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">But Qing Chi...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Her recent sparring sessions with Snow-Colored Maiden Hui have increased significantly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo entered the Martial Training Formation and observed Qing Chi and Snow-Colored Maiden Hui locked in fierce combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After watching for a moment, Ning Zhuo nodded in approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Though Qing Chi had lost her memories, her physical body remained intact, and her temperament remained unchanged. Consequently, many of her combat techniques flowed naturally, recapturing much of her former prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">However, she still couldn't defeat Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The latter was crafted from Golden Core-level materials, giving her a substantial advantage over Qing Chi, who was at the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"But if Qing Chi regains her innate talents and applies them to combat, the outcome would be far less certain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo had witnessed Qing Chi's overwhelming Innate Talent firsthand on multiple occasions, leaving a deep impression on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Even a Mechanical Puppet crafted from Golden Core-level materials would struggle to withstand the Azure Flame. However, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui also possesses Innate Talent, which might allow her to counter it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In Ning Zhuo's view, both sides had immense room for improvement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Ning Zhuo, you're back?" Qing Chi exclaimed with delight upon seeing Ning Zhuo enter the formation. She immediately abandoned her battle with Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, retreated a step to create distance, and rushed to stand before Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Ghost Clan Girl tilted her face upward, her expression brimming with affection for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Though she had lost her memories, her feelings for Ning Zhuo had only become purer. As time passed, this affection had grown even stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly at her and glanced at Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The latter crossed her arms, tilted her head slightly, and glared at Ning Zhuo through her nostrils, clearly maintaining her arrogance even toward her master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo waved his hand at Qing Chi. "You two withdraw for now. I'll handle things here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Understood, Young Master," Qing Chi replied obediently. Before leaving, she cast an expectant glance at Ning Zhuo and asked, "Young Master, when will we resume our studies of talisman crafting? I still have so many questions to ask you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The girl's enthusiasm for talisman crafting was almost overwhelming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">She had asked this question countless times, but ever since Ning Zhuo entered the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, he had been relentlessly busy, and she had always been refused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">This time was no different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"For talisman crafting, you should discuss and practice with Snow-Colored Maiden Hui," Ning Zhuo said with a wave of his hand. Though he knew entrusting Qing Chi to the Mechanical Puppet was unreliable, he genuinely had more pressing matters to attend to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Once he was alone within the array's spatial domain, he sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion and retrieved the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This small pagoda had been gifted to him by Elder Cai. As an unclaimed object, it was relatively easy to refine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo acted swiftly, employing three methods simultaneously!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He extended the five fingers of his left hand, pressing them toward the exquisite pagoda floating before him. Instantly, five-colored radiance flowed from his fingertips, and the Five Elements energy swirled around the entire Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The azure-gold lotus pedestal at the pagoda's base began to unfurl slightly, absorbing the pure Five Elements spiritual energy. The jade-colored light on the lotus petals accelerated its circulation, emitting a faint humming sound. Within the glazed pagoda's golden interior, the illusory figures of the Eight Hundred Arhats seemed to grow clearer, resonating with the influx of spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This was Method Refinement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">At the same moment, a faint glow appeared between Ning Zhuo's eyebrows. A Divine Sense, condensed into a tangible force, slammed violently into the core of the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Divine Refinement began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Within the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda, the intricate and profound networks of magical restrictions and circuits were vividly projected into Ning Zhuo's Sea of Consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">His divine sense rapidly expanded, penetrating deeply with an unwavering will to dominate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">As his divine sense probed and infiltrated, its progress slowed considerably. Ning Zhuo's mastery of Buddhist and Demonic Sect techniques remained limited. But at that moment, the Buddha-Heart Demon Seal suddenly radiated a brilliant light. Golden Chu script and profound demonic intent materialized on the Precious Seal, following his divine sense into the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In an instant, the pagoda's subtle resistance and rejection vanished, replaced by a welcoming force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The obstacles to the Divine Refinement vanished, and Ning Zhuo's divine sense imprint surged across the core magical restrictions at an unprecedented speed, rapidly stabilizing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Divine Refinement progressed swiftly. Ning Zhuo formed a sword-like gesture with his right hand, and a drop of vital essence blood emerged from his fingertip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Blood Refinement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The vital essence blood landed on the Buddhist Beads atop the pagoda and was instantly absorbed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Crimson light shimmered, forming intricate networks of Blood Meridians across the pagoda's surface. These living demonic tendrils, originating from the Dharani Pearl, surged wildly both inward and outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The scarlet Blood Meridians spread like a dense spiderweb, instantly filling the crystalline Glazed pagoda. They overlaid the emerging phantom images of the Eight Hundred Arhats, yet the refinement process remained slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Golden light and crimson radiance intertwined, creating a paradoxical yet earth-shattering spectacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">However, when the Blood Meridian reached a certain level within the pagoda, its speed surged dramatically, becoming even more efficient than Divine Refinement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Three Sects' Supreme Methods were activated simultaneously:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Divine Refinement, Method Refinement, and Blood Refinement, further enhanced by the triggered Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ordinary cultivators typically chose only one method for refining treasures, as most cultivation arts focused on a single dantian. With three Treasure Refinement methods available, they would prioritize the strongest, neglecting the other two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">But Ning Zhuo was different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Having cultivated all three dantians in tandem, he could utilize all three Treasure Refinement methods simultaneously, each complementing the others, resulting in astonishing efficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The pagoda resonated with continuous humming and tremors. Within moments, the vibrations reached their peak, culminating in a clear, resonant ha that seemed to cleanse the Divine Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Five Elements light encircling the pagoda abruptly contracted inward and vanished. The Blood Meridian, once violently surging, now flowed with gentle grace, its crimson patterns deeply imprinted within the Glazed glass and upon the Benevolent Leaf Lotus Throne, merging seamlessly with the pagoda's structure. Meanwhile, the divine sense permeating the core silently completed the imprinting of the core Method restrictions, achieving complete mastery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The humming ceased, and the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda fell utterly silent, its surface radiating a warm, subdued glow that perfectly harmonized with Ning Zhuo's Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">At Ning Zhuo's command, the pagoda transformed into a stream of light, merging into his Upper Dantian with perfect docility, like a newborn lamb returning to its mother's embrace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Upon entering the Upper Dantian, the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda immediately radiated golden light. Just as it began to expand, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal trembled slightly. The golden aura that had enveloped the pagoda instantly retracted, vanishing completely into its structure, undoubtedly suppressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo wasn't surprised by this outcome. "Although both the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda are magic treasures with the ability to suppress Luck, there's a vast difference in their capabilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"The primary material of the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda is at most Golden Core-level. In contrast, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal is a seamless entity, its core material's level impossible to determine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"The Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda's Luck suppression is limited to individuals, unable to extend its benefits to family or allies. The Buddha Heart Demon Seal, however, likely mirrors the True Form of the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda, capable of suppressing the Luck of entire organizations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Since the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda was "living comfortably" within the Upper Dantian's divine sea, Ning Zhuo used his Divine Sense to transfer it to the Middle Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">In the Middle Dantian's Qi Sea, the pagoda seemed to breathe through the Qi, its structure trembling slightly as it once again radiated golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">It attempted to establish itself at the center, but the Middle Dantian's core remained occupied by a swirling vortex of Five Elements spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">After a brief struggle, the pagoda conceded, settling into a corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo transferred the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda to the Lower Dantian's Essence Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">At the center of the Essence Sea, a blood pool still reigned supreme, leaving no space for the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The pagoda's continued presence there, with its Buddha's Golden Light, clashed sharply with the Essence Sea's environment, immediately causing Ning Zhuo a sense of unease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After three attempts, Ning Zhuo finally transferred the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda back to the Middle Dantian within his Qi Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">I've successfully refined this treasure using three different methods, allowing it to be stored in the Upper, Middle, and Lower Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But it's clear this magic treasure is best suited for the Middle Dantian. The Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art is inherently balanced and harmonious, while the Divine Sea and Essence Sea lean distinctly toward Buddhism and demonic forces, respectively!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Moreover, there's another reason - the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda possesses a unique characteristic: it's a composite artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Having fully refined the pagoda, Ning Zhuo now had complete mastery over it, with a clear understanding of its internal structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The pagoda consisted of three layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The first layer resembled an office, with a crimson crystal furnace at its center. Murky pupil-like lights flickered through the furnace walls, and within burned the Red Karmic Fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The second layer resembled a study. Wisps of purple Qi supported a jade desk, upon which lay a thread-bound book titled Book of Merit and Achievement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The large characters "Karma Manual" were prominently displayed on the cover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The third level resembled a temple. At its center stood a massive black stone throne, upon which rested a wooden statue of the Judge. Divine light flowed around the statue, clearly indicating that the deity had been successfully invoked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Culpability Fire, Sinful Flame, Resentful Venomous Flame, Blood Core Radiance, Crimson Shifting Spirit Glaze, and others are all lesser Fire Seeds derived from the Red Lotus Karma Fire. They possess certain characteristics of the Red Lotus Karma Fire, but their power and efficacy are significantly weaker at the same scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"The true form of the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda must contain the Red Karmic Fire. However, the pagoda awarded to the first-place winner is merely a substitute using a lesser Fire Seed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Even with just the Culpability Fire, Ning Zhuo felt immense joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">After all, this was a Fire Seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In all his travels, he had only obtained the Flame Within Wood once, and he had already used it up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Of course, in terms of value for Pill Refinement and Artifact Refinement, the Culpability Fire paled in comparison to the Flame Within Wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"The Book of Merit and Deeds..." Ning Zhuo was intimately familiar with this cultivation art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Though originating from Confucianism, this method had become so widespread that it was now widely practiced throughout the cultivation nations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The founder of the Book of Merit and Deeds was the great Confucian sage Duke Yiwen Ding Ming. Drawing upon the righteous Qi of heaven and earth and applying the principles of human morality, he created a method to measure merit and punish sin, evaluate achievements, and serve as the cornerstone of governance and the wellspring of wisdom for both civil and military affairs in the cultivation realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Legend has it that Duke Yiwen Ding Ming was deeply versed in the scriptures of the Confucian School. He established the "Nine Bestowals of Merit" based on the Book of Documents, adapted the "Six Methods of Performance Evaluation" from the Rites of Zhou, clarified loyalty, integrity, filial piety, and righteousness through the Classic of Filial Piety, and enabled the Spring and Autumn Annals to discern human affairs. During the creation of the Book of Merit and Deeds, he endured numerous natural disasters and calamities, ultimately nearly exhausting the vast literary vein of the Imperial Academy before finally achieving success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Divine Statue of the Judge on the third level of the pagoda was also essential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"The Book of Merit and Deeds alone is merely a human method. By successfully invoking the divine and harnessing the power of the Gods, one can tap into the forces of heaven and earth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"It is the combination of these two elements that forms the foundation for the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda's ability to discern merit and sinful karma."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"The true form of the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda consists of only six components."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"The Benevolent Leaf Lotus Throne at the base, the Formless Glazed Glass of the pagoda's body, and the Causal Dharani Pearl at the apex. As well as the Red Lotus Karma Fire on the first level, the Book of Merit and Deeds on the second level, and the Divine Statue of the Netherworld Judge on the third level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The second floor housed the Book of Merit and Deeds, while the third floor held a Divine Statue of the Netherworld Judge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">This one in my hand lacks the Red Karmic Fire, replaced by a common flame as a substitute for Talent. The materials used for the base, body, and peak of the pagoda are only at the Gold Moon level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"The True Form's Divine Statue and Book of Merit and Deeds must be of a far higher grade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This was the Harmonious Vessel Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Normal magic treasures and artifacts were crafted by refining various precious materials into a seamless, unified whole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">For example, Ning Zhuo's Buddha-Heart Demon Seal was so meticulously forged that he couldn't even discern the specific materials used.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda, however, was constructed with a basic framework, then filled with precious materials and treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The Benevolent Leaf Lotus Throne at the base, the Formless Glazed Glass of the body, and the Causal Dharani Pearl at the peak formed this foundational structure. The Red Lotus Karma Fire on the first floor was a precious material, while the second and third floors could be customized and replaced depending on the user.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This approach offered both practical advantages and aesthetic appeal. The most obvious benefit was the ability to combine magic treasures and materials to create new properties and effects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ingenious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Old Chef followed Ning Zhuo's instructions, carrying the prepared Spirit Food array. Sun Lingtong accompanied them into the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"These are the fresh ingredients Yu Heye and I purchased together," Sun Lingtong said, handing Ning Zhuo several gray ceramic jars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Old Chef's eyes lit up at the sight of the ingredients. He immediately asked if he could have some to create Dark Cuisine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "I need all of these."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">With that, he summoned the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda and activated the magic treasure before their eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Activating a magic treasure as a Foundation Establishment cultivator was naturally strenuous. The Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art wasn't known for its abundant reserves of energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">However, Ning Zhuo only needed to detect Qi Refining Stage souls - a task akin to using a cannon to swat a mosquito.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Within moments, the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda reacted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The pagoda trembled violently, its Causal Dharani Pearl at the apex flashing black and white in rapid succession. The Culpability Fire blazed fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Inside the second layer, the Book of Merit and Deeds flipped open automatically. Blood-red characters surged across the blank pages like algae, each entry detailing a heinous crime appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Kafan flipped over a beggar's rice bowl for amusement...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Falsely claimed a Spirit Grain shortage to withhold rations from households...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Slaughtered mortal villages to refine the Hundred Manifestations Banner...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Lured Fellow Daoists to Shi Mozuo Cai's death trap...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Stole his Master's Foundation Establishment Pill and framed his Junior Brother...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">A few lines of golden characters stood out:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Shared half a flatbread with a dying old woman...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Returned lost items to a weeping girl...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Finally, the Meritorious Karma Floating Pagoda ceased its tremors, its Buddhist beads at the summit turning pitch-black. Blood-red characters dripped across the Book of Merit and Deeds. The Divine Statue's halo gradually faded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo nodded, confirming the seller's honesty. At least these Qi Refining Stage souls were truly heinous, and Qianzhu's disciples were indeed irredeemable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The large-headed youth dismissed the Old Chef, leaving only Sun Lingtong behind, and began to perform the Dream Boat Soul Ferrying Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Though he could draw upon Soul Cloth for sustainable development, he still needed to use his full power once to accumulate valuable experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The soul ignited, emitting Jiang You's incomparably resentful cries amidst the flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo's soul detached from his body and plunged into the flames. His ignited soul transformed into a Soul Boat, which continued to burn fiercely, carrying his spiritual vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">After a few breaths, the Soul Boat dissipated. Ning Zhuo's soul had gained at least three taels of spiritual weight, allowing him to smoothly return to his physical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Opening his eyes, Ning Zhuo declared with righteous indignation, "Excellent! As the saying goes, 'Root out evil completely.' These criminals deserve far more than death. Eradicating them is a contribution to the Righteous Path of humanity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Sun Lingtong glanced around, puzzled. "There's no one else here - just the two of us. Why are you saying all this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Ahem, ahem," Ning Zhuo coughed twice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes. Having watched Ning Zhuo grow up, he knew him inside and out. "Just tell me what you gained this time," he urged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo truthfully recounted his experience, leaving Sun Lingtong speechless with wide eyes and gaping mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">After a long moment, Sun Lingtong finally reacted, shouting, "Little brother, you're about to soar!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
