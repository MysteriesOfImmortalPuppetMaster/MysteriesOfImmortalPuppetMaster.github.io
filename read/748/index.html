<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Mechanism Cave-Abode</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Cultivation Chamber</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The walls, cast from bronze, revealed a multitude of mechanical components: slowly rotating gears and levers working in perfect synchronization.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The chamber's heavy bronze door was sealed shut, leaving not the slightest gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The rhythmic whirring and clicking of the mechanisms filled the chamber, amplifying the oppressive, murderous atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ban Ji sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion at the center of the room, his face expressionless and eyes tightly closed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The high ridges of his cheekbones cast deep shadows across his face under the overhead light, while beads of sweat glistened on the tip of his aquiline nose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Suddenly, a faint whisper echoed from the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ban Ji's heart jolted. "It's here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">His body reacted instantly. His gaunt back arched sharply, and blue veins bulged on his neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The fragmented whispers scraped against his eardrums like grotesque, elongated fingernails scratching inside his skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Gritting his teeth, Ban Ji forced his eyes open. Blood vessels rapidly filled his irises, becoming visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The whispers coalesced into a continuous stream, growing louder and louder in his ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">His rationality steadily eroded. Then, without warning, an unbearable, piercing itch erupted in his right foot!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ban Ji curled his right leg and instinctively began scratching with his fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The itch was unbearable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He slipped steel hooks over his fingertips and tore into his waist, scratching frantically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Soon, his right foot was ripped to shreds, exposing the ghastly white bone beneath. Yet the agony felt to Ban Ji like a dying traveler in the desert finding a few precious drops of water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">But almost immediately, the whispering voices swelled like crashing cymbals, pounding relentlessly into his ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Shut up! Shut up!" He slammed his Demonic Light-infused palms against his ears, instantly shattering his eardrums. Yet even deafened, the whispers only diminished slightly, still reverberating within his skull, causing his temples to bulge and veins to bulge on his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">By now, Ban Ji lay writhing on the ground, his body contorting under the dual assault of excruciating pain and maddening itch, like a lone boat struggling against a raging storm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">His head throbbed as if about to split, while the unbearable itch on his right foot felt like a venomous snake coiling up his calf.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Instinctively, he began slamming his heel against the floor tiles, splattering blood and grinding flesh and bone into a pulpy mess that stuck to everything nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The once-white leg bone now pulsed with a turbid, brownish-yellow light, transforming into a series of intricate mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Immortal Talent - Ten Thousand Transformations Demonic Monstrosity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">This wasn't a side effect of Ban Ji's cultivation of the demonic art, the Greedy Mechanism Demonic Heart Art, but rather the activation of his Immortal Talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Cultivators possessing this talent would continuously receive enlightenment on the principles of Mechanism Art, the Demonic Sect, and the Strange Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Chaotic, disorganized runes began to flood Ban Ji's vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57"><p class="glitch-text">機械術ノ理ヲ悟リ続ケル者</p></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58"><p class="glitch-text">乱レタ符号ガ視界ヲ覆ウ</p></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">Ban Ji couldn't comprehend these symbols. He closed his eyes tightly, screaming in agony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">The darkness was only temporary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Soon, the runes, like living maggots, pierced through the darkness and reappeared in Ban Ji's vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">The flesh of his entire right calf had transformed into a translucent gel, while the leg bone, now a displeased mechanism, emitted a powerful suction force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Within the Cultivation Chamber stood several brass mechanical constructs. Drawn by the invisible force, they crashed into Ban Ji's mangled remains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">Clang! Clang! Clang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">Mechanisms crashed together, drawn by an irresistible force, and fused into a solid mass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">A yellowish-brown, oily sheen rapidly spread, dismantling and reassembling the mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">After a dozen breaths, Ban Ji's right calf was utterly disfigured. Gears were embedded in his leg bones, chainsaws pierced through his fascia, and gelatinous flesh, like living maggots, enveloped the foreign objects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Simultaneously, Ban Ji's spiritual energy wove through every corner of his right calf like countless threads forming a net.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">His entire right leg had swollen into a massive limb, requiring two adults to encircle it. The outermost skin had transformed into brass, while gears whirred within the leg bones. At the knee, a continuous mist of blood erupted outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Ban Ji's throat had grown hoarse from his screams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">His eyes were vacant, his pupils dilated from the torment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">At that moment, the jade pendant around his neck suddenly emitted a three-centimeter-long burst of azure light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">The light pierced his mind, instantly clearing Ban Ji's gradually clouding consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92"><p class="glitch-text">機術講話乱道界心夢影霊空音風花夜光魂理道界術心闇波夢幻流刻風霧声影零記想雲刻</p></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94"><p class="glitch-text">幻乱符号夜響光波霊夢刻</p></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96"><p class="glitch-text">魂響幻滅界風.......</p></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">He forced his eyes open, his vision nearly consumed by countless runes. Through the gaps between them, he saw his right leg, and gel was spreading upward from the knee, creeping along his thigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">"Sever it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">Ban Ji roared, his palm slashing down with savage force. Spiritual energy erupted like a blade, slicing through his right thigh and severing it completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Blood gushed from the severed limb, causing Ban Ji to gasp and clench his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">His gaze, sharp as a vulture's, fixed on the wound. To his dismay, he saw traces of gel still lingering, burrowing into the flesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">As gel intensified, the maddening itch returned, piercing his very soul!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">The severed lower leg, blasted away by his spiritual energy, crashed into a corner of the Cultivation Chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Now free from restraint, the mangled limb pulsed with a terrifying suction force, drawing the remaining mechanical constructs in the chamber toward it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">Gears ground together like a torrential downpour, levers hammered like iron mallets, and the lower leg began to swell rapidly once more, its chaotic Qi radiating outward with a growing sense of danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Ban Ji gasped for breath, drenched in sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">The whispers in his ears grew deafening, while the runes before his eyes tightened, threatening to engulf his entire vision. The remaining slivers of clarity were vanishing rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">In his final moment of clarity, Ban Ji formed a hand seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">Divine Art - Blind Fool!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Thick gray smoke materialized from thin air, descending upon Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">The smoke rapidly condensed into a bone-like, grayish-white lattice that pierced through his upper body. Two chains snaked from his eyes into his skull, then emerged through his ear canals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">The Divine Art took effect swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">The bizarre runes in Ban Ji's vision blurred as if smeared with a hundred layers of grime.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">The bloodshot veins in his eyes receded by more than half, his pupils dilated and turned gray-white, and drool mixed with blood trickled from his idiotic grin onto the floor tiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">The unbearable itching that had tormented him subsided like a receding tide, while the suppressed agony, though rising, remained beyond Ban Ji's perception in his altered state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">His wounds remained untreated, yet the bleeding had stopped, the flesh around them transforming into brass-like mechanical armor plates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Ban Ji lay in a pool of blood, his right leg missing from the knee down. He chuckled mindlessly, his fingers still digging into the floor tiles, fingernails torn and bent backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">Meanwhile, his severed leg continued to tremble, its form fluctuating like a bubble, expanding and contracting, its surface constantly shifting into grotesque shapes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">The severed leg had ultimately transformed into a colossal, carriage-sized monstrosity, its interior teeming with intricate mechanical components. These parts were jumbled together haphazardly, yet somehow functioned in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Thump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">A soft sound echoed as a humanoid mechanical hand suddenly extended from the side of this grotesque contraption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">The hand was still coated in a viscous, eerie gel. Its five fingers tapped against the floor tiles, probing the surroundings like a venomous snake sensing its prey. Abruptly, it shifted direction and lunged toward Ban Ji's True Form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">But its momentum halted abruptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">The massive mechanical cannon dragging behind it severely restricted its reach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">Undeterred, the hand persisted, driven by a primal, beast-like hunger rooted in its Origin. It strained against its massive body, desperately inching toward Ban Ji's True Form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">At first, it remained motionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">But soon, its body began to tremble slightly, shedding fragments of broken mechanical parts that adhered to the hand, gradually enlarging it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">As the hand gained strength, it managed to move bit by bit, drawing closer to Ban Ji's True Form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">The Blind Fool Divine Wood reached its limit. The solidified gray smoke crackled and dissolved back into wisps of smoke, dispersing into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">Ban Ji regained his senses, his mouth gaping as he gasped for breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">The agonizing pain struck his nerves like a sharp iron spike, but the absence of any itching sensation filled the experienced Ban Ji with wild joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">Enduring the torment, he swiftly examined himself and scanned his surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">A colossal, bizarre mechanical monster loomed over him, its palm as massive as a python, hovering just an arm's length away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">Yet it remained motionless, frozen in place, utterly devoid of any aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Ban Ji's heart skipped a beat, but a triumphant smile soon spread across his pale face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">The smile widened rapidly, erupting into a triumphant laugh of survival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">"This time, when my Immortal Talent activated, I successfully weathered it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Ten Thousand Transformations Demonic Monstrosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">This Immortal Talent had set Ban Ji apart from others since childhood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Initially, the activation intervals of the Ten Thousand Transformations Demonic Monstrosity's Innate Talent were long, and the insights it imparted to Ban Ji were minimal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">As a young child, Ban Ji dismissed these episodes as mere nightmares.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">But when he enrolled in school, his aptitude for Mechanism Art cultivation manifested as an almost intuitive understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">While Mechanism Art typically involved complex calculations, Ban Ji only needed a glance to instinctively grasp the correct outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Every time he performed the calculations, the results aligned perfectly with his intuition. In fact, his intuition often surpassed the calculations, which were prone to errors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">This exceptional performance immediately caught the attention of Ban Ji's parents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">As the Myriad Li Demon Beast's activation intervals shortened and the principles it imparted increased, Ban Ji began exhibiting symptoms of fainting and convulsions. After each "episode," his "intuition" for the Mechanism Art would surge dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">Ban Ji's parents, unable to resolve his "strange illness," turned to their clan for help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">The clan's in-depth investigation revealed the profound mysteries of this innate talent: it wasn't recorded as any known Innate Talent, yet it was extraordinary. Beyond the Mechanism Art, it also imparted knowledge of the Demonic Sect and Strange Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">This knowledge directly affected Ban Ji's body, rather than being infused into his divine sea, granting him an almost instinctive "comprehension."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Comprehension was merely the surface manifestation; in truth, Ban Ji's body itself understood the underlying principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">His fainting spells were also superficial; the reality was that Ban Ji's body couldn't withstand the influx of principles from these three domains. To protect itself, his body would spontaneously shut down, rendering him unconscious and halting the infusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">However, this protection wasn't absolute. As the Myriad Li Demon Beast activated more frequently, the force of the infusion grew increasingly violent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Upon realizing this, the Ban Clan began to prioritize Ban Ji completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Initially, everyone in the clan assumed it was a flaw in his Innate Talent, a lingering side effect. But after uncovering the truth, they were shocked to realize it wasn't a deficiency at all - Ban Ji simply couldn't keep up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">With his Innate Talent confirmed as Immortal Talent, the Ban Clan secretly tailored a Dao Path for him, revolving around his unique abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">The Greedy Mechanism Demonic Heart Art was meticulously chosen, and the Ban Clan paid a heavy price for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">This specialized technique focused on cultivating the divine sea, aiming to enhance Ban Ji's learning capacity. Rather than passively enduring the influx of knowledge through his body, he could now actively learn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">This proved to be a wise decision. Ban Ji quickly adapted, his strength surged steadily, and his mastery of Mechanism Art and Demonic Path cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">After Ban Ji achieved Foundation Establishment, his Immortal Talent underwent another dramatic enhancement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Ban Ji began to struggle to cope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">The Ban Clan, naturally unwilling to abandon their future hope - a child with Immortal Talent - had to assist with full strength. To alleviate his predicament, they provided assistance from every possible angle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">To completely resolve this flaw, they secretly sought external help while maintaining absolute secrecy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Through a stroke of chance, they encountered the Escaped One, a wandering immortal renowned throughout the world. This extraordinary figure, whose cultivation had reached the Void Refinement stage, was widely regarded as the most powerful Minor Calculation cultivator of their era.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">The Ban Clan's Supreme Elders reverently beseeched him to perform a divination for Ban Ji. The Escaped One's calculations revealed that Ban Ji's unique Immortal Talent was destined for a Royal Mandate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">"Throughout history, Innate Talent has always been a gift from Heaven," the Escaped One declared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">"The Way of Heaven seeks to balance excess and deficiency. Yet, throughout history, no king has ever emerged from the realms of Mechanism Art or the Strange Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">"Thus, Heaven has placed its wager here. Of course, this is not the only such instance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">"In the future, should Ban Ji succeed, he will become the King of Mechanisms and the Strange Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">"Your name for this Immortal Talent - the Ten Thousand Transformations Demonic Monstrosity - is fitting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">The Ban Clan's Supreme Elders remained puzzled. "If this is the case," one asked, "why is the Demonic Sect's influence being infused into him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">The Escaped One sighed deeply. "This is the great calamity that will strike centuries from now. As the demonic forces rise, the righteous path will wane - a cosmic tide between realms. Since the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the world has enjoyed prolonged peace, with righteousness overwhelming all and prosperity reaching its zenith. Yet, extreme prosperity breeds decline, just as tides rise and fall - such is the eternal cycle of Heaven and Earth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">The Supreme Elder asked again, "The golden age of cultivation has lasted nearly a thousand years. This great calamity will surely shake heaven and earth. Will a fourth emperor be born?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">The Escaped One replied, "The Heavenly Secrets are in chaos. How could we possibly calculate such things? But this time, even if it's just a king, he will be the most extraordinary ruler in history."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">This answer invigorated the Supreme Elders of the Ban Clan present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">What could be more extraordinary?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">A king who masters Mechanism Art and the Strange Path - isn't that the epitome of extraordinary?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">Does this mean our Ban Clan's Ban Ji possesses the Royal Mandate and might very well become the future ruler who unifies the world?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">Could our Ban Clan leap forward by centuries of development and instantly become one of the most powerful Royal Clans in the world?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">The Supreme Elder knelt on the ground, continuing to seek guidance from the Escaped One.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">But the Escaped One merely left behind a pile of precious materials. "Our karmic connection has ended. These materials may be used to power the clan's Divine Mechanism Chain and calculate Ban Ji's path to kingship. Simply follow the calculated results step by step, and you will fulfill the Royal Mandate. At the very least, you will achieve regional dominance."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
