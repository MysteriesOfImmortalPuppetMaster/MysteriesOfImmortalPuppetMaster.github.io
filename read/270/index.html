<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Main Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Ah!" The dragon turtle fire spirit suddenly screamed, waking up from a nightmare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Instinctively, it reached out to touch its head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Still here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">It relaxed, realizing it hadn’t been destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">It survived!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Beings like spirits inherently have no fatal weaknesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Thus, being decapitated or having limbs severed is almost the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The difference lies in the amount of spiritual essence remaining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">If too much spiritual essence is lost, reaching a limit, the remaining essence will collapse and dissipate unless supplemented externally during the countdown to its demise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">At this moment, the dragon turtle fire spirit’s body had shrunk by a third, leaving only about sixty to seventy percent of its original form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Moreover, its entire body glowed with firelight, much brighter than before, ironically proving its weakness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Previously, it had been profound and restrained, giving a sense of solidity and weight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Now, although its body shone brightly, it appeared light and ethereal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">At this time, a voice called out like distant smoke, drifting into the heart of the dragon turtle fire spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Dragon turtle fire spirit of the Immortal Palace, my heart’s desire, only you can ignite." "The fierce flames of the fire dragon, essence of heaven and earth, burn all things, transforming into spiritual light." "With a sincere heart and solemn thoughts, I call upon you. Respond, respond..." "Whatever you seek, we can discuss. I am a member of the Meng family, please heed my call, respond to my voice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">These were the cultivators of the Meng family, persistently trying to contact the dragon turtle fire spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Meanwhile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo’s voice also quietly came through, much more straightforward: "Dragon turtle fire spirit, dragon turtle fire spirit, dragon turtle fire spirit..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Ah!" The dragon turtle fire spirit shouted, shaking its head violently, "So annoying! So annoying!" It retreated its dragon head into its turtle shell on the throne’s armrest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">It roared in its heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"What Meng family, it doesn’t care. It only cares about Meng Chong!" "What Ning Zhuo, still a young master? Bah!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"The Historical Records Pavilion was destroyed because of me. What use are you?" "You only know how to act!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Once Zhu Xuanji targeted you, you became dispirited, useless!" "I’ve seen through it, you all—are useless!" "It still has to be me. I have to rely on myself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo couldn’t summon the dragon turtle fire spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He followed closely behind Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Jiufan, unaccustomed to being followed so closely, stopped and turned to look at him: "Hey kid, why are you sticking so close to me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands, his face pale: "Ancestor, ancestor, I’m scared."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">It turned out that after he confessed his crimes to the Golden Core cultivators, he was harshly reprimanded by Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">But it was just a reprimand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">After all, Zhu Xuanji had forgiven and accepted Ning Zhuo, allowing him to atone for his crimes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Golden Core cultivators of the three families couldn’t say much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The only exception was Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">According to the rules of the righteous path, Ning Jiufan, as the head of the Ning family, naturally had the authority to deal with Ning Zhuo, a member of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But Ning Jiufan only reprimanded him, not even hitting him, and although his tone was extremely severe, any slightly experienced righteous cultivator could hear the protective intent in Ning Jiufan’s words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">After Zhu Xuanji left, the Golden Core cultivators discussed for a while and decided to act separately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo followed closely behind Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo said, "Ancestor, I’m in great danger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"The death of Ning Xiaohui is right before us. She was a main branch of the family, secretly working for Lord Zhu Xuanji, and under the protection of many Golden Core cultivators..." "With such protection, she still perished!" "This Void Sect is too terrifying, too sinister."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Now that I’ve turned to the light, they’ve surely noticed. I don’t want to die, I beg you to have mercy, save me, save me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Jiufan snorted coldly: "You don’t understand the situation at that time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"The Historical Records Pavilion was the primary target, the demon beasts surged like a tide, and defense was difficult in haste." "But if not for the bombardment of the Five Elements Tower, we would have succeeded!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo spread his hands: "The Historical Records Pavilion is in ruins, my small body can’t withstand it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Jiufan, angered, curled his fingers and knocked on Ning Zhuo’s big head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Ouch." Ning Zhuo clutched his head, crying out in pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"When did our Ning family produce such a cowardly person? Where is the backbone of our northern family?" Ning Jiufan scolded, hating iron for not becoming steel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo looked at Ning Jiufan pitifully: "Ancestor, look at what you’re saying! If I weren’t cowardly, I might have been killed by the Void Sect’s evil cultivators long ago." "As for the northern backbone, what is that? When I was born, our Ning family had already migrated to the Southern Bean Kingdom. Wasn’t our family driven out of the Northern Wind Kingdom?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Jiufan immediately blew his beard and glared, continuously knocking on Ning Zhuo’s big head, muttering: "We voluntarily withdrew, voluntarily withdrew!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo retreated, avoiding Ning Jiufan’s knocks: "Ancestor, ancestor, stop knocking, if you keep knocking, I’ll become stupid."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Jiufan chuckled coldly: "You’re not stupid? You’re too cunning, hiding your crimes, and with a slight trick from Zhu Xuanji, you were so scared you surrendered." "You should become a bit stupid, it would do you good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"You’re called Ning Zhuo, where is your simplicity?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo exclaimed, as if realizing something: "Ancestor, are you saying that Zhu Xuanji was tricking me? He only suspected me, without any evidence?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Jiufan sneered: "What do you think? Did you see him produce any evidence?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo widened his eyes, with an incredulous expression, and whispered: "Then, this Lord Zhu is too cunning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Jiufan snorted again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo blinked repeatedly, looking at Ning Jiufan, rubbing his hands: "Actually, I’m mainly worried that if I’m exposed, it’s fine, but I’m most afraid of bringing shame to the Ning family, causing trouble for you, ancestor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Heh." Ning Jiufan’s mouth twitched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He couldn’t help but be amused by Ning Zhuo’s shamelessness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo colluding with the Void Sect’s evil cultivators was actually nothing in Ning Jiufan’s mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">You must know, a common trick of the righteous path is to hire demonic cultivators as black gloves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sometimes, they even play the role of demonic cultivators themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo’s situation was just that he was young and weak, secretly controlled by demonic cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Even if he participated in part of the plot to bomb the Immortal Palace, isn’t the Lava Immortal Palace still standing?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">No big deal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Now that Ning Zhuo has been exposed and freed from the Void Sect’s control, it’s a great thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo surrendering to Zhu Xuanji was unexpected for Ning Jiufan, indeed putting him in a passive position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But what can be said, one’s own child still needs to be protected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Even if they make mistakes, who doesn’t make mistakes when they’re young?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Close the door and educate them, educate them well, and when the door opens, Ning Zhuo is still a member of the Ning family, the future pillar of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Xiaohui is already dead, and now the only genius in the Qi Refining Stage left in the Ning family is Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">If Ning Zhuo also dies or joins the evil sect, then the Ning family will have a gap in this generation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This is unfavorable for the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Regarding Ning Xiaohui’s death, Ning Jiufan is deeply pained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ice Jade Hand...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">This pain further prompts Ning Jiufan to protect Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Zhu Xuanji returned earlier than everyone expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He gathered the Golden Core cultivators together again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"I have reached an alliance with City Lord Meng, and I am here to inform you of this good news." Saying this, Zhu Xuanji couldn’t help but fix his gaze on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">All present were Golden Core cultivators, making the Qi Refining Stage Ning Zhuo seem out of place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Seeing Zhu Xuanji looking at him, Ning Zhuo quickly bowed and saluted: "Greetings, Lord Zhu!" His expression was respectful, and his etiquette was impeccable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Jiufan spoke: "Now, Ning Zhuo has become the only genius among the younger generation of our Ning family. During this period, let him stay by Ning Jiufan’s side." "He has committed such a grave mistake, and I will enforce family law on him, punishing him severely!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly, allowing Ning Zhuo to remain present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The divine constable sighed inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">From Ning Jiufan</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">’s response, he heard the dissatisfaction of this Ning family Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Xiaohui is dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">She was working for Zhu Xuanji, to some extent used as bait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Jiufan’s pain led him to protect Ning Zhuo, which was understandable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">At this moment, Zhu Xuanji became more convinced that not searching Ning Zhuo’s soul was the right decision!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">If he had searched the soul, causing Ning Zhuo, this genius, to be ruined, wouldn’t Ning Jiufan have exploded in anger?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"The Ning family, after all, is different from the Zhou and Zheng families."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"They wandered from the Northern Wind Kingdom. It is said that the Ning family was dissatisfied with the Northern Wind’s rigid governance and left on their own, decisively cutting off benefits and connections. Such a fierce nature cannot be easily manipulated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With a flash of thought, Zhu Xuanji formally announced that the two sides would cooperate closely, and any Immortal Palace positions obtained by any family would be retained!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">This news brought joy to the three families’ Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo was secretly surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">After reporting Sun Lingtong, Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui would definitely join forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This was something Ning Zhuo could deduce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He didn’t expect Zhu and Meng to cooperate to this extent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"No!" Suddenly, Ning Zhuo understood, "This wasn’t Zhu Xuanji’s initiative." "He has already united the three families, there’s no need to offer future chips to win them over." "If it’s not him, then it’s Meng Kui." "Why would Meng Kui propose such a thing, to win over the three families?" "Interesting!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo’s eyes flashed with brilliance: "It’s possible that among the three families’ Golden Core cultivators present, someone has already secretly contacted Meng Kui." "Then, who could it be?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo first thought of the Zheng family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Previously, Zhu Xuanji united the three families, forming a tight alliance, which was a brilliant move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">But afterwards, the Demonic Dao Scripture scheme set by Ning Zhuo led to a Golden Core conflict, causing the Zheng family to kill a Great Purity Palace disciple, creating a rift between Zhu Xuanji and the Zheng family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"The Zheng family is thus facing immense pressure from the Great Purity Palace. And the royal family has yet to make a statement." "The Zheng family might desperately seek aid due to this pressure. Aligning with the Meng family is reasonable." "Besides, the Zhou family is also a possibility."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Previously, if the Meng family acquired the Lava Immortal Palace, the Zhou family would suffer the greatest loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Therefore, the Zhou family was the most steadfast in opposing Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">But what if Meng Kui took the initiative to compromise, privately expressing to the Zhou family a willingness to coexist?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Previously, it was impossible because Meng Kui looked down on the Zhou family, a mere Golden Core-level force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">But once the three families united, gathering around Zhu Xuanji, posing a threat to Meng Kui, they gained the value of being divided and won over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Zhu Xuanji used the three families, and the three families simultaneously used him to enhance their own value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The art of alliance and maneuvering, this is the subtlety of the righteous path’s game.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
