<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 557: Ning Zhuo, What Are You Doing?!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
At the Twin Rivers Kingdom's encampment.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the secret meditation chamber of the Supreme Commander's residence, Du Tiechuan sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, eyes wide open.<br/>
<br/>
Images and scenes of the battlefield continuously flashed through his pupils.<br/>
<br/>
Since the beginning of the Second Great Battle, Du Tiechuan had halted his healing, secretly observing the fierce battles outside.<br/>
<br/>
He had grown thinner than before, his sharply defined features becoming even more pronounced and gaunt.<br/>
<br/>
His complexion appeared unhealthy, pale and bloodless.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since his battle with the Ginseng Dragon King, Du Tiechuan's injuries had not fully recovered.<br/>
<br/>
Healing proved far more challenging than he initially anticipated.<br/>
<br/>
Intense clashes between Nascent Soul-level cultivators, fierce confrontations among armies, and countless soldiers dying - Du Tiechuan witnessed it all yet felt no ripple in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
His thoughts centered solely on one matter:<br/>
<br/>
Where was the Ginseng Dragon King?<br/>
<br/>
The crucial factor influencing the outcome of the battle at Thousand Peaks Forest was ultimately the clash between the Soul Formation cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Aware of his weakened state and worried that the Ginseng Dragon King might already be fully recovered, Du Tiechuan chose to endure silently, ignoring external conflicts, patiently awaiting any sign of weakness from his formidable adversary.<br/>
<br/>
"It's evenly matched," he muttered.<br/>
<br/>
"Our forces are well-trained and have the geographical advantage, but we still have significant gaps in high-level combat strength."<br/>
<br/>
"The Thousand Peaks Forest Coalition seized their opportunity wisely, effectively utilizing their strengths to offset their weaknesses this time."<br/>
<br/>
As one of the Twin Rivers Kingdom's highest-ranking generals, Du Tiechuan possessed extensive combat experience and deep strategic expertise.<br/>
<br/>
After closely analyzing the battlefield for some time, he reached a conclusion, "At this rate, both sides will continuously lose troops, ultimately resulting in mutual destruction and ending with Thousand Peaks Forest gradually withdrawing."<br/>
<br/>
"Hmm?"<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Du Tiechuan's expression shifted slightly as he noticed something peculiar on the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
His heart quickened with excitement, "The Three General's Battalion can actually withstand Xiang Yue?!"<br/>
<br/>
"If they can sustain this confrontation and keep Xiang Yue occupied, our odds of victory will drastically improve."<br/>
<br/>
Currently, both forces had fallen into a deadlock, each side draining the other.<br/>
<br/>
According to Du Tiechuan's assessment, if Ning Zhuo maintained control over this localized battle, the impact would gradually amplify, eventually tipping the scales heavily toward Twin Rivers Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
"This could become the turning point for the entire Second Great Battle!"<br/>
<br/>
A flash of brilliance sparked in Du Tiechuan’s eyes as he began closely observing the battle between Ning Zhuo and Xiang Yue.<br/>
<br/>
Boom! Boom! Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue's every attack remained devastatingly powerful, each blow carrying the immense force of collapsing mountains and roaring oceans.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo manipulated the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor, each defensive action requiring multiple arms simultaneously exerting strength just to barely maintain the current stalemate.<br/>
<br/>
Despite this, he was continuously forced backward during his clash with Xiang Yue.<br/>
<br/>
“Although Mechanical Arts are considered among the lowest ranks of the hundred cultivation arts, once mastered, their power is not to be underestimated.”<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue suddenly spoke, breaking the previous silence.<br/>
<br/>
“Little human genius, do you have any other new tricks left?”<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning instantly felt a chill run down their spines.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue's leisurely demeanor made them realize that he had been calm and fully at ease this entire time!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt as if an enormous stone pressed against his heart, experiencing immense pressure.<br/>
<br/>
"I must become faster and stronger!"<br/>
<br/>
He continuously urged himself on, squeezing out his full potential under the oppressive force from Xiang Yue, undergoing rapid transformation.<br/>
<br/>
The puppet army, originally clumsy and awkward in his control, was now visibly improving at incredible speed.<br/>
<br/>
Even Xiang Yue secretly sighed, "Humans truly are the spirits of all creation - there's genuine wisdom in these words. When will our Elephant Clan produce such a talented youth?"<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, Xiang Yue momentarily became distracted.<br/>
<br/>
"Now's my chance!" Ning Zhuo keenly sensed the opportunity and immediately seized it.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he fearlessly activated the strongest offensive technique he had developed with his Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor:<br/>
<br/>
Buddhist Art - Vajra Protection!<br/>
<br/>
Martial Array - Zen Wind Flying Fist Formation!<br/>
<br/>
Buddhist Art - Moonlight Universal Salvation Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Combined into one!<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical Art - Golden Moon Zen Wind Fist!<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, countless fist shadows filled the air!<br/>
<br/>
Eight golden arms, thick as pillars and fierce as dragons, created a storm of fists, densely packed and dazzling to the eye. Silver moonlight intertwined brilliantly, stunningly radiant!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo launched a tempestuous offensive, so powerful that Liu, Guan, and Zhang instinctively backed away, astonished.<br/>
<br/>
Countless fist shadows crashed into Xiang Yue, yet there was no heavy impact, only a series of rushing winds.<br/>
<br/>
Zen wind, Zen wind.<br/>
<br/>
Within the winds lingered a subtle Buddhist intent, penetrating continuously into Xiang Yue's body and mind.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue's body swayed, then took a step backward.<br/>
<br/>
It was merely one step, yet Liu, Guan, and Zhang stared in shock. Countless cultivators closely watching the battle were equally astounded.<br/>
<br/>
The Elephant King had retreated!<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue, the current Elephant King, had actually been forced backward in direct combat!<br/>
<br/>
Such a thing had not happened in many years.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, astonishingly, the one who achieved this feat was merely a young cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage!<br/>
<br/>
Truly inconceivable.<br/>
<br/>
If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, most people would never believe such a scene could actually happen.<br/>
<br/>
"There is hope - we still have hope of winning!" Zhao Xi, although unfamiliar with military strategy, recognized this scene as an opportunity for victory.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing's expression grew somewhat blank, quickly followed by intense regret.<br/>
<br/>
"If I'd known this kid possessed such martial talent, I wouldn't have antagonized him."<br/>
<br/>
Even the cunning Princess Shuang Ling nodded slightly upon witnessing this scene. "I never expected Ning Zhuo to be so capable. If we win this battle, he'll surely receive a generous reward!"<br/>
<br/>
There had been deep conflicts between Shuang Ling and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
But at this moment, she couldn't help but feel admiration towards Ning Zhuo and was even willing to show goodwill towards this promising junior.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, you truly deserve to be my... husband!" <br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan also saw the battle situation, her fighting spirit igniting further, striking down enemies with even greater ferocity.<br/>
<br/>
"Hehehehe." Xiang Yue's quiet laughter suddenly drifted through the wind.<br/>
<br/>
"It hurts a little," he continued. "Thank you; it's a sensation I haven't felt in a long time."<br/>
<br/>
"But - this ends here."<br/>
<br/>
Martial Art - Void-Clearing Palm!<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue's powerful figure trembled slightly as he thrust his palm forward forcefully.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s expression drastically changed. An unstoppable, overwhelming force surged toward him, as though an invisible mountain had slammed directly into his body.<br/>
<br/>
Puh!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo spat out a mouthful of blood, flying backward and crashing to the ground like a broken sack.<br/>
<br/>
Excruciating pain twisted his expression into a horrific grimace.<br/>
<br/>
Even with the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor protecting him, his body couldn't withstand it.<br/>
<br/>
Almost every bone in his body was fractured, and severe internal bleeding filled his organs - except for his Fire-element Heart Shrine, Metal-element Lung Shrine, and Earth-element Spleen Shrine.<br/>
<br/>
Even the three mechanical arms mounted on his back crumbled and snapped one after another from attempting to block Xiang Yue’s strike.<br/>
<br/>
In this single moment, Liu, Guan, Zhang, Sun, and Ning all realized clearly - the reason they had managed to sustain a stalemate thus far was simply that Xiang Yue hadn't yet exerted his full strength!<br/>
<br/>
Just as he'd disdained to participate in the encirclement of Shuang Ling earlier, even facing the joint assault of Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning, he had fought with indifference.<br/>
<br/>
He carried the pride of a true powerhouse - "None of you are worthy of my full power!"<br/>
<br/>
"Retreat," Ning Zhuo felt ice-cold despair in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
After this exchange, he fully understood that Xiang Yue, the contemporary Elephant King, was on par with figures like the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth. Among Nascent Soul-level fighters, their combat power was at the absolute pinnacle.<br/>
<br/>
His victory over the Twin Ghosts had been primarily due to luck and the unexpected advantages provided by his Buddha Heart-Demon Seal and other external factors.<br/>
<br/>
But now, in a genuine head-to-head clash with Xiang Yue, he deeply sensed the terrifying gap between them!<br/>
<br/>
"Even with the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor, openly aided by Liu, Guan, and Zhang, and secretly assisted by Elder Brother Sun…"<br/>
<br/>
“Even I’m no match for Xiang Yue!”<br/>
<br/>
Since that was the case, retreating was the wisest decision.<br/>
<br/>
Even Liu, Guan, and Zhang were beaten to the point of having no strength to resist, left flustered and embarrassed. After Ning Zhuo sent them a divine sense message, they immediately nodded in agreement.<br/>
<br/>
However, just as Ning Zhuo arranged for mechanical puppets to cover the retreat and made a show of withdrawing, he received a divine sense transmission from Shuang Ling:<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo, keep fighting! You cannot retreat!!”<br/>
<br/>
“You need to keep Xiang Yue occupied. Don’t let him wreak havoc on the other battlefronts.”<br/>
<br/>
“As long as you can do this, I represent the royal family in promising you a great reward.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo froze, then suddenly felt his fingers tighten - it was a warning from his mechanical ring!<br/>
<br/>
“Could it be that agreeing to Shuang Ling’s request and staying to fight would bring fatal consequences?” Ning Zhuo instantly understood.<br/>
<br/>
He guessed to himself:<br/>
<br/>
“That’s right.”<br/>
<br/>
“Xiang Yue wasn’t going all out earlier - partly because of his demeanor as a powerful cultivator, and partly because he found my mechanical techniques amusing, so he ‘played’ with me for a while.”<br/>
<br/>
“Now, his interest has clearly faded. Naturally, he’ll start fighting seriously and kill me outright, then move on to face opponents who can bring him something new!”<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo snapped back without any politeness:<br/>
<br/>
“Is a reward more important than my life?!”<br/>
<br/>
He and Liu, Guan, and Zhang resolutely retreated.<br/>
<br/>
“Stop right there!”<br/>
<br/>
“Deserting on the battlefield is a capital offense!!!” Shuang Ling was furious, sending a divine sense transmission to question them.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Sun Ning all ignored her completely.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn’t like they were truly fleeing the battle - they were just switching opponents. How was that a violation of military law?<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling was about to keep scolding, but in the next moment, Lord Long smashed her directly into the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, her true body wasn’t present - her Nascent Soul was merely parasitizing a puppet. Had her real body taken that blow, she would’ve been crippled if not killed.<br/>
<br/>
While controlling her Flexible-Bone Mystic Concubine to retreat quickly and evade Lord Long’s pursuit, Shuang Ling sent a divine sense message to Zhao Xi.<br/>
<br/>
“Zhao Xi!”<br/>
<br/>
“Liu, Guan, and Zhang are your men. They refused to restrain Xiang Yue - you are fully responsible!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi’s expression shifted slightly, his lips parting.<br/>
<br/>
Pfft.<br/>
<br/>
He spat out a mouthful of blood and cried out loudly,<br/>
<br/>
“Who ambushed me?!”<br/>
<br/>
Then fainted on the spot, immediately supported by his trusted aides and carried to the rear.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling:<br/>
<br/>
“I...”<br/>
<br/>
As a princess of a nation, even she was so angry she nearly started swearing.<br/>
<br/>
But Lord Long’s next wave of attacks left her scrambling to defend herself - how could she possibly spare any attention to deal with Zhao Xi now?<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling could only turn her pent-up frustration into battle power as she continued her bitter struggle against Lord Long.<br/>
<br/>
However, the crisis faced by Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Sun Ning was far from over.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Zhao Xi didn’t get involved in the matter, it didn’t affect how Xiang Yue thought.<br/>
<br/>
The Elephant King began to pursue Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical army Ning Zhuo left behind was like paper - completely incapable of hindering even the slightest step of the Elephant King.<br/>
<br/>
“What do we do, Strategist?!” Cold sweat beaded on Liu Er’s forehead.<br/>
<br/>
If Xiang Yue chased them all the way here, who could possibly stand against him?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes gleamed as a plan formed in his mind: “Since Xiang Yue insists on chasing us, then let him! We’re heading for the war camp!”<br/>
<br/>
This was the core of the battlefield, where the fighting was most intense. Here, Nascent Soul cultivators and elite armies were the true protagonists.<br/>
<br/>
Any cultivators or troops without sufficient strength would be caught in the terrifying residual forces of battle the moment they entered this zone and suffer heavy losses.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had no better options. The cards in his hand weren’t strong enough, so all he could do was redirect disaster - trying to draw Xiang Yue’s attention elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang trusted Ning Zhuo deeply. Upon hearing his plan, they moved at once.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the four of them rushed into the depths of the Twin Rivers Kingdom’s main camp.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, on this very battlefield, Shuang Ling was still locked in fierce combat with Lord Long. <br/>
<br/>
She happened to glance over - and saw Ning Zhuo luring Xiang Yue into the fray. Her eyebrows shot up in fury!<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo, what the hell are you doing?!”<br/>
<br/>
“You brought Xiang Yue here?!”<br/>
<br/>
“Leave! Get out, now!”<br/>
<br/>
“Are you trying to make my army collapse?!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo responded via divine sense:<br/>
<br/>
“Your Highness, in the current battle, you are our strongest warrior. Only you can handle Xiang Yue.”<br/>
<br/>
“You are the Twin Rivers Kingdom's Princess of Mechanics, after all!”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m merely assisting you - bringing you this opportunity to kill Xiang Yue!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling was so furious her mechanical body trembled slightly.<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo! Go to hell!!! <br/>
<br/>
Regardless of this battle’s outcome, I will hold you accountable!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly replied:<br/>
<br/>
“Your Highness, you misunderstand me. I risked my life to create this great opportunity for you to achieve glory!”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re the face of the Twin Rivers Kingdom’s Nascent Soul cultivators - Xiang Yue is no match for you!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s true goal was the mechanical carriage in Lin You’s possession.<br/>
<br/>
For now, he could only roll with the mistake - leading Xiang Yue into the core of the battlefield and looking for a chance to slip away.<br/>
<br/>
After clashing with Xiang Yue for some time, though few words were exchanged, Ning Zhuo could feel the man’s pride through his many combat decisions.<br/>
<br/>
As expected, when Xiang Yue spotted the other Nascent Soul cultivators, his attention shifted toward them.<br/>
<br/>
Each cultivator engaged in battle had to spare a portion of their focus for Xiang Yue-<br/>
<br/>
No one wanted to be the one he targeted.<br/>
<br/>
Even Shuang Ling felt this way!<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo, if we lose this battle, I swear your whole family will pay the price!” Shuang Ling was truly enraged. She sensed Xiang Yue had locked onto her and continued cursing Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Among the Twin Rivers Kingdom’s forces, Shuang Ling was undoubtedly the strongest.<br/>
<br/>
Once Xiang Yue arrived, he lost interest in Ning Zhuo. Instead, he observed the battles around him, not attacking immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Military strategy - Capture Alive!<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a large portion of the army shifted and gathered in the air, forming a massive net.<br/>
<br/>
The net enveloped Xiang Yue and immediately trapped him, transforming into a cage.<br/>
<br/>
Within the cage, Xiang Yue was tightly bound by layers of the net.<br/>
<br/>
His face was filled with rage as he roared and struggled with all his might-<br/>
<br/>
But all he could manage was to stretch the net by thirty percent.<br/>
<br/>
In that moment, the entire battlefield fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
To suppress Xiang Yue so swiftly-<br/>
<br/>
Only a Soul Formation–level cultivator could have done it.<br/>
<br/>
And within the Twin Rivers army, there was only one: Du Tiechuan!</div>
