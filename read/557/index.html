<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">At the Two Note Kingdom's encampment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Inside the secret meditation chamber of the Supreme Commander's residence, Du Tiechuan sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, eyes wide open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Images and scenes of the battlefield continuously flashed through his pupils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Since the beginning of the Second Great Battle, Du Tiechuan had halted his healing, secretly observing the fierce battles outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He had grown thinner than before, his sharply defined features becoming even more pronounced and gaunt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">His complexion appeared unhealthy, pale and bloodless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ever since his battle with the Ginseng Dragon King, Du Tiechuan's injuries had not fully recovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Healing proved far more challenging than he initially anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Intense clashes between Nascent Soul-level cultivators, fierce confrontations among armies, and countless soldiers dying - Du Tiechuan witnessed it all yet felt no ripple in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">His thoughts centered solely on one matter:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Where was the Ginseng Dragon King?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The crucial factor influencing the outcome of the battle at Thousand Peaks Forest was ultimately the clash between the Soul Formation cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Aware of his weakened state and worried that the Ginseng Dragon King might already be fully recovered, Du Tiechuan chose to endure silently, ignoring external conflicts, patiently awaiting any sign of weakness from his formidable adversary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"It's evenly matched," he muttered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Our forces are well-trained and have the geographical advantage, but we still have significant gaps in high-level combat strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"The Thousand Peaks Forest Coalition seized their opportunity wisely, effectively utilizing their strengths to offset their weaknesses this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">As one of the Two Note Kingdom's highest-ranking generals, Du Tiechuan possessed extensive combat experience and deep strategic expertise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After closely analyzing the battlefield for some time, he reached a conclusion, "At this rate, both sides will continuously lose troops, ultimately resulting in mutual destruction and ending with Thousand Peaks Forest gradually withdrawing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Hmm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Suddenly, Du Tiechuan's expression shifted slightly as he noticed something peculiar on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">His heart quickened with excitement, "The Three General's Battalion can actually withstand Xiang Yue?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"If they can sustain this confrontation and keep Xiang Yue occupied, our odds of victory will drastically improve."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Currently, both forces had fallen into a deadlock, each side draining the other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">According to Du Tiechuan's assessment, if Ning Zhuo maintained control over this localized battle, the impact would gradually amplify, eventually tipping the scales heavily toward Two Note Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"This could become the turning point for the entire Second Great Battle!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">A flash of brilliance sparked in Du Tiechuan’s eyes as he began closely observing the battle between Ning Zhuo and Xiang Yue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Xiang Yue's every attack remained devastatingly powerful, each blow carrying the immense force of collapsing mountains and roaring oceans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo manipulated the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor, each defensive action requiring multiple arms simultaneously exerting strength just to barely maintain the current stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Despite this, he was continuously forced backward during his clash with Xiang Yue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Although Mechanical Arts are considered among the lowest ranks of the hundred cultivation arts, once mastered, their power is not to be underestimated.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Xiang Yue suddenly spoke, breaking the previous silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Little human genius, do you have any other new tricks left?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning instantly felt a chill run down their spines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Xiang Yue's leisurely demeanor made them realize that he had been calm and fully at ease this entire time!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo felt as if an enormous stone pressed against his heart, experiencing immense pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"I must become faster and stronger!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He continuously urged himself on, squeezing out his full potential under the oppressive force from Xiang Yue, undergoing rapid transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The puppet army, originally clumsy and awkward in his control, was now visibly improving at incredible speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Even Xiang Yue secretly sighed, "Humans truly are the spirits of all creation - there's genuine wisdom in these words. When will our Elephant Clan produce such a talented youth?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Thinking of this, Xiang Yue momentarily became distracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Now's my chance!" Ning Zhuo keenly sensed the opportunity and immediately seized it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The next moment, he fearlessly activated the strongest offensive technique he had developed with his Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Buddhist Art - Vajra Protection!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Martial Array - Zen Wind Flying Fist Formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Buddhist Art - Moonlight Universal Salvation Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Combined into one!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Mechanical Art - Golden Moon Zen Wind Fist!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Instantly, countless fist shadows filled the air!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Eight golden arms, thick as pillars and fierce as dragons, created a storm of fists, densely packed and dazzling to the eye. Silver moonlight intertwined brilliantly, stunningly radiant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo launched a tempestuous offensive, so powerful that Liu, Guan, and Zhang instinctively backed away, astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Countless fist shadows crashed into Xiang Yue, yet there was no heavy impact, only a series of rushing winds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Zen wind, Zen wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Within the winds lingered a subtle Buddhist intent, penetrating continuously into Xiang Yue's body and mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Xiang Yue's body swayed, then took a step backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">It was merely one step, yet Liu, Guan, and Zhang stared in shock. Countless cultivators closely watching the battle were equally astounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Elephant King had retreated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Xiang Yue, the current Elephant King, had actually been forced backward in direct combat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Such a thing had not happened in many years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yet, astonishingly, the one who achieved this feat was merely a young cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Truly inconceivable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, most people would never believe such a scene could actually happen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"There is hope - we still have hope of winning!" Zhao Xi, although unfamiliar with military strategy, recognized this scene as an opportunity for victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Shuang Jing's expression grew somewhat blank, quickly followed by intense regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"If I'd known this kid possessed such martial talent, I wouldn't have antagonized him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Even the cunning Princess Shuang Ling nodded slightly upon witnessing this scene. "I never expected Ning Zhuo to be so capable. If we win this battle, he'll surely receive a generous reward!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">There had been deep conflicts between Shuang Ling and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But at this moment, she couldn't help but feel admiration towards Ning Zhuo and was even willing to show goodwill towards this promising junior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Ning Zhuo, you truly deserve to be my... husband!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Mu Lan also saw the battle situation, her fighting spirit igniting further, striking down enemies with even greater ferocity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Hehehehe." Xiang Yue's quiet laughter suddenly drifted through the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"It hurts a little," he continued. "Thank you; it's a sensation I haven't felt in a long time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"But - this ends here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Martial Art - Void-Clearing Palm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Xiang Yue's powerful figure trembled slightly as he thrust his palm forward forcefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo’s expression drastically changed. An unstoppable, overwhelming force surged toward him, as though an invisible mountain had slammed directly into his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Puh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo spat out a mouthful of blood, flying backward and crashing to the ground like a broken sack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Excruciating pain twisted his expression into a horrific grimace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Even with the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor protecting him, his body couldn't withstand it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Almost every bone in his body was fractured, and severe internal bleeding filled his organs - except for his Fire-element Heart Shrine, Metal-element Lung Shrine, and Earth-element Spleen Shrine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Even the three mechanical arms mounted on his back crumbled and snapped one after another from attempting to block Xiang Yue’s strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">In this single moment, Liu, Guan, Zhang, Sun, and Ning all realized clearly - the reason they had managed to sustain a stalemate thus far was simply that Xiang Yue hadn't yet exerted his full strength!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Just as he'd disdained to participate in the encirclement of Shuang Ling earlier, even facing the joint assault of Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning, he had fought with indifference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He carried the pride of a true powerhouse - "None of you are worthy of my full power!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Retreat," Ning Zhuo felt ice-cold despair in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">After this exchange, he fully understood that Xiang Yue, the contemporary Elephant King, was on par with figures like the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth. Among Nascent Soul-level fighters, their combat power was at the absolute pinnacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">His victory over the Twin Ghosts had been primarily due to luck and the unexpected advantages provided by his Buddha Heart-Demon Seal and other external factors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">But now, in a genuine head-to-head clash with Xiang Yue, he deeply sensed the terrifying gap between them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Even with the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor, openly aided by Liu, Guan, and Zhang, and secretly assisted by Elder Brother Sun…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Even I’m no match for Xiang Yue!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Since that was the case, retreating was the wisest decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Even Liu, Guan, and Zhang were beaten to the point of having no strength to resist, left flustered and embarrassed. After Ning Zhuo sent them a divine sense message, they immediately nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">However, just as Ning Zhuo arranged for mechanical puppets to cover the retreat and made a show of withdrawing, he received a divine sense transmission from Shuang Ling:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“Ning Zhuo, keep fighting! You cannot retreat!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“You need to keep Xiang Yue occupied. Don’t let him wreak havoc on the other battlefronts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“As long as you can do this, I represent the royal family in promising you a great reward.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo froze, then suddenly felt his fingers tighten - it was a warning from his mechanical ring!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“Could it be that agreeing to Shuang Ling’s request and staying to fight would bring fatal consequences?” Ning Zhuo instantly understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">He guessed to himself:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“That’s right.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Xiang Yue wasn’t going all out earlier - partly because of his demeanor as a powerful cultivator, and partly because he found my mechanical techniques amusing, so he ‘played’ with me for a while.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Now, his interest has clearly faded. Naturally, he’ll start fighting seriously and kill me outright, then move on to face opponents who can bring him something new!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo snapped back without any politeness:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“Is a reward more important than my life?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He and Liu, Guan, and Zhang resolutely retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“Stop right there!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Deserting on the battlefield is a capital offense!!!” Shuang Ling was furious, sending a divine sense transmission to question them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Sun Ning all ignored her completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">It wasn’t like they were truly fleeing the battle - they were just switching opponents. How was that a violation of military law?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Shuang Ling was about to keep scolding, but in the next moment, Lord Long smashed her directly into the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Luckily, her true body wasn’t present - her Nascent Soul was merely parasitizing a puppet. Had her real body taken that blow, she would’ve been crippled if not killed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">While controlling her Flexible-Bone Mystic Concubine to retreat quickly and evade Lord Long’s pursuit, Shuang Ling sent a divine sense message to Zhao Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“Zhao Xi!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“Liu, Guan, and Zhang are your men. They refused to restrain Xiang Yue - you are fully responsible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Zhao Xi’s expression shifted slightly, his lips parting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Pfft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He spat out a mouthful of blood and cried out loudly,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">“Who ambushed me?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Then fainted on the spot, immediately supported by his trusted aides and carried to the rear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Shuang Ling:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“I...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">As a princess of a nation, even she was so angry she nearly started swearing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">But Lord Long’s next wave of attacks left her scrambling to defend herself - how could she possibly spare any attention to deal with Zhao Xi now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Shuang Ling could only turn her pent-up frustration into battle power as she continued her bitter struggle against Lord Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">However, the crisis faced by Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Sun Ning was far from over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Even though Zhao Xi didn’t get involved in the matter, it didn’t affect how Xiang Yue thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The Elephant King began to pursue Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The mechanical army Ning Zhuo left behind was like paper - completely incapable of hindering even the slightest step of the Elephant King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">“What do we do, Strategist?!” Cold sweat beaded on Liu Er’s forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">If Xiang Yue chased them all the way here, who could possibly stand against him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo’s eyes gleamed as a plan formed in his mind: “Since Xiang Yue insists on chasing us, then let him! We’re heading for the war camp!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">This was the core of the battlefield, where the fighting was most intense. Here, Nascent Soul cultivators and elite armies were the true protagonists.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Any cultivators or troops without sufficient strength would be caught in the terrifying residual forces of battle the moment they entered this zone and suffer heavy losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Ning Zhuo had no better options. The cards in his hand weren’t strong enough, so all he could do was redirect disaster - trying to draw Xiang Yue’s attention elsewhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Liu, Guan, and Zhang trusted Ning Zhuo deeply. Upon hearing his plan, they moved at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Thus, the four of them rushed into the depths of the Two Note Kingdom’s main camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Meanwhile, on this very battlefield, Shuang Ling was still locked in fierce combat with Lord Long. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">She happened to glance over - and saw Ning Zhuo luring Xiang Yue into the fray. Her eyebrows shot up in fury!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">“Ning Zhuo, what the hell are you doing?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“You brought Xiang Yue here?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">“Leave! Get out, now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“Are you trying to make my army collapse?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ning Zhuo responded via divine sense:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">“Your Highness, in the current battle, you are our strongest warrior. Only you can handle Xiang Yue.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">“You are the Two Note Kingdom's Princess of Mechanics, after all!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">“I’m merely assisting you - bringing you this opportunity to kill Xiang Yue!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Shuang Ling was so furious her mechanical body trembled slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">“Ning Zhuo! Go to hell!!! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Regardless of this battle’s outcome, I will hold you accountable!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Ning Zhuo quickly replied:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">“Your Highness, you misunderstand me. I risked my life to create this great opportunity for you to achieve glory!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">“You’re the face of the Two Note Kingdom’s Nascent Soul cultivators - Xiang Yue is no match for you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Ning Zhuo’s true goal was the mechanical carriage in Lin You’s possession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">For now, he could only roll with the mistake - leading Xiang Yue into the core of the battlefield and looking for a chance to slip away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">After clashing with Xiang Yue for some time, though few words were exchanged, Ning Zhuo could feel the man’s pride through his many combat decisions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">As expected, when Xiang Yue spotted the other Nascent Soul cultivators, his attention shifted toward them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Each cultivator engaged in battle had to spare a portion of their focus for Xiang Yue-</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">No one wanted to be the one he targeted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Even Shuang Ling felt this way!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">“Ning Zhuo, if we lose this battle, I swear your whole family will pay the price!” Shuang Ling was truly enraged. She sensed Xiang Yue had locked onto her and continued cursing Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Among the Two Note Kingdom’s forces, Shuang Ling was undoubtedly the strongest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Once Xiang Yue arrived, he lost interest in Ning Zhuo. Instead, he observed the battles around him, not attacking immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">Military strategy - Capture Alive!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">Suddenly, a large portion of the army shifted and gathered in the air, forming a massive net.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">The net enveloped Xiang Yue and immediately trapped him, transforming into a cage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">Within the cage, Xiang Yue was tightly bound by layers of the net.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">His face was filled with rage as he roared and struggled with all his might-</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">But all he could manage was to stretch the net by thirty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">In that moment, the entire battlefield fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">To suppress Xiang Yue so swiftly-</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">Only a Soul Formation–level cultivator could have done it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">And within the Two Note army, there was only one: Du Tiechuan!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
