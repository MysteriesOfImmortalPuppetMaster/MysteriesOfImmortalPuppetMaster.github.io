<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 79: Theory of Numbered Breaths</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Han Ming said, “According to the book’s explanation, those with immortal talents are favored by heaven and earth. Once they overcome a challenge, it's like passing a tribulation, or refining gu poison[^1]. Climbing over one mountain opens up an entirely new landscape in life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“Sir, you should stay alert in the coming days. After a surge in fate energy, opportunities often come seeking you out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo grew more interested. “Are there any other ways to increase fate energy?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Han Ming said, “Cultivation is the main method. The stronger a cultivator becomes, the more their fate energy grows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“You can also borrow external force, but that has to be done cautiously. If you make a mistake, you could end up depleting your fate energy instead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“There are also certain special treasures. For example, super sects, super clans, and any cultivation kingdom possess at least great treasure that can anchor fate energy and regulate luck energy[^2].”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo nodded. “The Theory of Numbered Breaths, was it? Write it out from memory.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Yes, Sir.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo continued, “As for other books, as long as they don’t touch on your sect’s taboos, write those out as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Han Ming replied again, “Yes, Sir.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo then asked about the soul contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Han Ming explained that it was a spell from the Soul Devouring Sect. It allowed a contract to be formed using the soul and was extremely reliable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The key point was that Han Ming’s entire cultivation was based on her soul. Signing the soul contract would give maximum control over her, placing her life and death entirely in Ning Zhuo’s hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo studied the soul contract briefly but realized he couldn’t understand it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He decided to proceed with caution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Fortunately, the materials, talismans, and so forth required for forming the soul contract would take some time to gather, so there was no need to rush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“Though you’ve pledged loyalty to me, that loyalty must be proven over time. Behave well from now on.” Ning Zhuo’s voice carried a hint of warning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Han Ming lowered her head in obeisance and replied softly, “Yes, Sir.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment. Before leaving, he unwound the chains somewhat, extending Han Ming’s range of motion to half the prison cell as a reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He hadn’t expected such great gains from this meeting with Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Unexpectedly, Yuan Dasheng had possessed an immortal talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Detecting innate talents was a highly complicated matter. Three Golden Core cultivators had examined Yuan Dasheng’s corpse, but not one of them had detected its immortal talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“It was only because I had Han Ming try to devour its soul that this talent was exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Righteous Bone Golden Hardness. An excellent material for crafting mechanical constructs. Wonderful!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Furthermore, he had gained insights into the secrets of fate energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“The Theory of Numbered Breaths really is fascinating.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">And finally, he had subdued Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Of course, Ning Zhuo still harbored doubts about Han Ming’s submission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Right now, he dearly wished that he had Zhu Xuanji’s lie-detecting abilities. Unfortunately, Zhu Xuanji’s lie detection relied on a specific type of magical power, certain kinds of spells, and the Golden Pupils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo lacked all of these.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Since Yuan Dasheng had Righteous Bone Golden Hardness, its corpse would have to be dealt with later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In the meantime, Ning Zhuo needed to ensure that Yuan Dasheng’s soul remained weak, preventing it from entering the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In any case, Yuan Dasheng’s body was now dead and could no longer nourish its soul. Even if nobody intervened, the laws of nature dictated that the soul would gradually decay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">All Ning Zhuo needed to do was keep a careful watch and guard against unexpected developments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">What was the best kind of enemy?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">A completely dead one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Until Yuan Dasheng’s soul had been properly utilized, Ning Zhuo would keep a close eye on it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo closed his eyes and began reviewing the day’s events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His new knowledge of fate energy had deepened his understanding of himself, the immortal palace, and the wider world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">First, he thought of himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“If I really do have a super-grade innate talent and strong fate energy, that would explain a lot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“Despite lacking parental protection, I’ve still grown safely to the age of sixteen. More than that, I’ve flourished. My total accumulated wealth surpasses what my aunt and uncle have obtained throughout their entire lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“I’ve encountered danger again and again since I started exploring the immortal palace. But each time, even in the worst scenarios, there was always a sliver of hope.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">For example, his name hadn’t been discovered by others, leaving Ning Zhuo time to adjust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">There was also Yuan Dasheng’s unexpected appearance. It didn’t run into Meng Chong or the others, and thus the three major factions never noticed it. This gave Ning Zhuo space to maneuver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Then Ning Zhuo thought of Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Yuan Dasheng also had several chances at survival.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">If Ning Zhuo had failed to change his name, or if he had taken too long to do so, Yuan Dasheng would have realized its true situation. It would have immediately grown alert and responded to Ning Zhuo’s trap with much greater precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">If it hadn’t injured its soul to protect Yuan Er and instead continued exploring the immortal palace, it might have encountered the three factions. That would have been dangerous, but could have also turned things around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">If it hadn’t tried to regroup with Yuan Er when the mechanical monkeys attacked during the Fire Persimmon Festival, the ensuing chaos wouldn’t have happened, and Ning Zhuo’s scheme would have failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">If it hadn’t gone to help Yuan Er during the chain explosion and instead curled up to defend itself, even without using its demonic technique, its five elements magical power at the peak of the third level might have protected it. Even if it only barely managed to remain conscious after the explosion, that would have still made a world of difference. A conscious Yuan Dasheng and an unconscious one were two entirely different opponents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In the end, even after protecting Yuan Er and losing consciousness, it still had one last hope after Zhu Xuanji was moved by its loyalty and came to its aid. If it managed to hold on long enough to awaken, or if its soul entered the immortal palace, there would be a chance to survive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But unfortunately, Ning Zhuo acted promptly and rushed over without hesitation, and Yuan Er failed to protect his Uncle Monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Destiny gave it many opportunities, but it failed to seize them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“It was dragged down by Yuan Er.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly, gaining an even deeper understanding of some of the concepts from the Theory of Numbered Breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Thoughts whirled in his divine sea as he reviewed the entire sequence of events, and new insights continuously took shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Hmm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">One of his countless thoughts inadvertently brushed against the treasure seal in his divine sea, leading to an unexpected discovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Why has the Buddha Heart Demon Seal been activated so many times?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Because of Zhu Xuanji, Ning Zhuo had made sure to limit his use of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal during this operation. The most notable instance was when he used the heart seals to whip the mechanical monkeys into a frenzy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In the end, those monkeys had been destroyed by the formation and their remains were obliterated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Even if someone were to investigate, Ning Zhuo could explain away any connection as being because he personally crafted them. It was a flawless cover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After that, during all his interactions with Yuan Er, he had not used the treasure seal at all, carefully guarding against even the slightest mistake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">There were countless wondrous techniques in the world of cultivation, and Ning Zhuo always pursued absolute caution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">In Ning Zhuo’s eyes, no matter how valuable the Buddha Heart Demon Seal was, it was just a tool. And since it was a tool, its effectiveness depended on how it was used. Relying too much on any tool was a grave mistake; even if nothing happened right away, it would backfire eventually.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Thus, Ning Zhuo knew that he hadn’t used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal much recently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But now, upon touching the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, he was surprised to find that reality clashed with his own memory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"When did this happen? The Buddha Heart Demon Seal has been used not just once, but at least three or four times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo couldn’t help but be shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">What was going on?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This had never happened before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">[^1]: You might already know this, but gu is a concept where you dump a bunch of venomous bugs into a pot and have them fight to the death. The one that survives has super strong venom and is also imbued with curse powers or something.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">[^2]: The raw here is 气运, which is usually translated as “luck”. In this novel (and maybe general Chinese culture too, I ain’t Chinese so idk) it seems to be a counterpart to 气数, with the former describing everyday lucky events and the latter describing a general destination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
