<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 145: Mechanical Puppet Cheng Bai</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Lava Immortal Palace was under siege.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, driven to madness by the intense flames within, roared and spewed fire throughout the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Meng Kui struggled to suppress it, not daring to take a single step beyond the boundary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts had not been repelled and continued their relentless assault on the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The battle atop the mountain was complex and challenging, making Meng Kui's task even more arduous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">But there was no choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">As the current City Lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, it was his duty to ensure the Lava Immortal Palace remained secure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He could only endure the hardship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Meanwhile, within the trial grounds, all was calm and serene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo looked at Sun Lingtong's soul and tilted his wooden head slightly. "Does this count as a success?" he wondered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">On one hand, Sun Lingtong's soul had indeed been drawn in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">On the other hand, there were reasons to doubt it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Typically, when a trial disciple first entered Room One, their soul would reside within the initial wooden puppet torso.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">They would then use the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique to attract other mechanical components and assemble their puppet body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">However, Sun Lingtong's soul floated in mid-air, with no mechanical components responding to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">A red soul flame surrounded Sun Lingtong's soul, a result of the Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pill he had recently taken to heal his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The red soul fire flickered like a phoenix's tail feathers, containing profound mysteries of rebirth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Since you haven't been assigned the initial mechanical components, I'll try to arrange them for you," Ning Zhuo decided.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He selected mechanical body parts and limbs for Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He first had Sun Lingtong's soul reside in the mechanical torso, then guided and assisted him in assembling his own puppet body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"So this is what it feels like to become a mechanical puppet? It's really fascinating!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed, looking at his puppet hands, stomping his feet, and jumping around excitedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Let's go. Room One might soon have cultivators' souls entering the Immortal Palace for exploration. It's not very safe," Ning Zhuo urged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Understanding the gravity of the situation, he quickly walked several dozen steps to the first door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He touched the door but received no information, let alone the three rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo's heart sank slightly, knowing this was because Sun Lingtong had entered through unconventional means.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Since he hadn't cultivated the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, the trial did not recognize him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Let's try my Buddha Heart Demon Seal then," Ning Zhuo thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">In the next moment, his soul power rapidly depleted, and Sun Lingtong immediately received information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Three rewards, which one should I choose... uh," Sun Lingtong began, but the rewards disappeared before he could choose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo reassured him, "Don't worry, I just stopped using the Life Hanging by a Thread."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Of course, this was a lie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In reality, Ning Zhuo had used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He felt no guilt lying to Sun Lingtong because Sun Lingtong had told him when he was two or three years old that everyone might have secrets they keep to themselves and that it was important to respect others' privacy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Sun Lingtong, understanding Ning Zhuo's intentions, said, "Indeed, this needs to be tested."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The result of the test was that Ning Zhuo needed to use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal each time, combined with the Life Hanging by a Thread, to temporarily resolve Sun Lingtong's unregistered status, allowing him to receive the trial rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"That's fantastic!" Ning Zhuo praised. "This way, Brother Sun, you might not need to be listed on the leaderboard." He led the puppet Sun Lingtong through the trials, entering the preparation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Sure enough, the leaderboard only showed "Entry Standard" and "Meng Chong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong looked at "Entry Standard" and gave Ning Zhuo a thumbs up. "Well done, little brother, you really have a knack for this." Ning Zhuo, along with the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng, led Sun Lingtong through the trials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">They reached the first Buddhist trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the coffin room, Ning Zhuo fully activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared in anger and sorrow but was bound by its duty to relay the information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Yuan Dasheng was outside, suppressing the Immortal Palace, his breath heavy with exertion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Sun Lingtong shouted, "Alright, I received the information!" Following Ning Zhuo's previous steps, Sun Lingtong began to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Soon, his puppet body scattered on the ground, and his soul returned to his physical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">In the underground base, he reintegrated the divine sense, mana, and blood essence he had previously extracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Following the plan he had discussed with Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong placed the Netherworld Ghost God Seal, the Soul-Dispersing Rattle Drum, and the broken Golden Thread Robe back into their respective dantians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He even broke three leaves from the Ghost Gate Escape Grass and placed them in his lower dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Having completed this step, Sun Lingtong could only wait for Ning Zhuo to pull him back in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Soon, Ning Zhuo drew his soul back into the palace, placing Sun Lingtong back into his previous puppet body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">With this action, a teleportation circle appeared, bringing Cheng Bai forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"We did it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"We succeeded!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong celebrated, patting each other on the back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Lava Immortal Palace, I will use it to create mechanical constructs!" Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng dragged Cheng Bai to the portal, and Sun Lingtong shouted excitedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Standing behind him, Ning Zhuo was his staunchest supporter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">At this moment, Ning Zhuo fully activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and frantically urged the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Roar—!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit wailed in sorrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Meng Kui pressed his lips tightly, struggling to suppress it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo had used Yuan Dasheng before, who, despite having immortal potential, was essentially an elderly fire-melting demon ape at the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">This time was different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Cheng Bai was a legitimate Golden Core Stage cultivator, carrying two magic treasures and three Nascent Soul-level spiritual plant leaves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Lava Immortal Palace had bronze, iron, silver, and gold furnaces, each representing different levels of fire furnaces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">To refine immortal-grade materials, the gold furnace had to be used.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Moreover, once a gold furnace was used to refine immortal-grade materials, it could only be used once!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Cheng Bai's talent wasn't extraordinary enough to use the gold furnace, but using the silver furnace was a given.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The problem was that one silver furnace wasn't enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Cheng Bai had too many items on him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had no choice but to reluctantly refine the materials for Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This was one of the reasons it hated living in the Lava Immortal Palace so much—no freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">No matter how unwilling, it had to comply!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Boom, boom, boom...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">One silver furnace after another exploded, unable to withstand the strain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After twenty-one silver furnaces were destroyed, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit finally succeeded in refining a mechanical puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">During this time, it breathed a sigh of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The intense focus required for the refining process left it with less energy to cause trouble, reducing the turmoil within the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Finally, the mechanical puppet was completed! Despite its extreme reluctance, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit transmitted the mechanical puppet back, delivering it to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The envoy, Cheng Bai!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
