<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel a surge of delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"To actually encounter a Bronze Shield - this is quite fortunate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He was well-versed in the intelligence regarding the Rising Cloud Minor Trial within the Profound Armor Cave. He knew that Profound Armament Armor typically manifested as various weapons and armaments, making shields exceedingly rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Of course, even rarer than shields were large-scale siege weapons like ballistae and battering rams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo continued to survey his surroundings, noticing that the battle environment had also changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The previous three battles had taken place in spherical arenas, offering ample space for maneuverability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Now, however, the Profound Armor Cave's Grand Formation had condensed into a narrow alleyway, drastically restricting movement. The Bronze Shield before him occupied more than half of the passage's width.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Starting from the fourth battle, each encounter will have a specific environment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The alleyway was as deep as a throat, its damp brick walls covered in slick moss. The end of the passage vanished into an impenetrable darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Bronze Shield shifted from stillness to motion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">It launched the first attack, a clumsy charge that swept low across the ground, aiming to strike Ning Zhuo's lower body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Such speed!" Ning Zhuo's pupils narrowed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Bronze Shield moved so swiftly that it left a bronze afterimage in Ning Zhuo's vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo retreated hastily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The walls on either side seemed to close in as he backed away, adding to the pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">No room to maneuver!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But Ning Zhuo had known from the start that he only needed to buy time and establish his stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Left blade, right sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo let out a low growl, and his left blade and right sword struck almost simultaneously. The blade crashed down, striking the shield's surface. The sword, moving with blinding speed, left its own afterimage as it pierced the shield's edge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The next moment, a deafening clash of metal erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The blade's force momentarily halted the shield's forward momentum, but though the sword's tip pierced the edge, it failed to penetrate further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">A violent recoil surged through Ning Zhuo's right arm. His wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm, and shoulder immediately shifted to absorb and dissipate the shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo continued retreating, his left blade crashing down again while his right sword withdrew, regrouping for another strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Clang! Clang! Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Each strike sent sparks flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Through a series of slashes and thrusts, Ning Zhuo gradually neutralized the Bronze Shield's defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The blade and sword clashed violently, finally forcing the Bronze Shield back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo leaped back a step, glancing down at his weapons with a grim expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The bronze sword was severely worn, its blade riddled with fine cracks. The bronze knife's edge was chipped and curled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"The bronze sword has seen the most use."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The bronze knife, used against the shield, was at a disadvantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Weapons, due to their different designs and materials, naturally have inherent advantages and disadvantages against each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But Ning Zhuo knew the primary cause was wear and tear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Regular weapons wear down with frequent use. The Profound Armament Armor is no exception - in fact, it's even more susceptible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Profound Armament Armor could transform its shape, its materials inherently unstable. This flexibility also meant its components weren't rigidly fixed, making it less durable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"In my previous training sessions, I practiced and studied far more than others, using the blade and sword far more extensively."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"The swords can't be used much longer; they need repairs!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo tossed the swords behind him, letting them hover in his wake. He stretched out his arms, slightly splaying his fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The bronze gauntlets melted into two streams of molten copper, which poured directly into Ning Zhuo's hands before rapidly solidifying into a pair of bronze gauntlets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo swung the gauntlets, launching an aggressive assault against the Bronze Shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The shield was heavy and powerful, but Ning Zhuo moved more than twice as agilely as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">His fists were naturally more nimble and fluid than swords. After all, humans are born with hands and use them most frequently in daily life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Among the Demonic Cultivator techniques Ning Zhuo had acquired, martial arts involving fists and feet were the most abundant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo unleashed a flurry of punches, the bronze gauntlets blurring into motion as they relentlessly attacked the shield. His footwork was agile, allowing him to spring off the walls on either side, flipping and twisting to maintain momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He effortlessly gained the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This was different from before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">With his memories reactivated and his close-combat skills advancing by leaps and bounds, the gauntlets - a weapon almost instantly usable - made him like a tiger with wings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Even though his memories and physical body were mismatched, the gauntlets themselves possessed fundamental martial techniques that constantly calibrated Ning Zhuo's movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"In just a couple of hours, my martial arts prowess has at least tripled compared to before the Rising Cloud Minor Trial!" Ning Zhuo thought, his heart soaring with excitement. As the one experiencing this firsthand, he felt the transformation most profoundly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Previously, his close combat skills had been merely solid, no longer a glaring weakness. But as Ning Zhuo made significant breakthroughs in Five Elements Techniques and Mechanism Art, close combat had once again become a weak point - an undeniable truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Now, however, his close combat abilities were undergoing a massive leap forward!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo's double-fisted strike sent the Bronze Shield crashing to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Using the recoil, the shield floated upward, suddenly tilting skyward with an unnatural agility. It evaded Ning Zhuo's fists and hovered above the narrow alley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Not good!" Ning Zhuo looked up and saw the massive shield descending like the foreleg of a colossal beast, poised to crush him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He immediately retreated, dodging the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The shield shifted its trajectory mid-air, exploiting the alley's confined space to relentlessly corner Ning Zhuo against the wall, leaving him no escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Gritting his teeth, Ning Zhuo transformed his fists into palms, bracing himself to withstand the shield's impact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His arms buckled as if supporting a collapsing mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">An overwhelming, irresistible force slammed into Ning Zhuo, his knees buckling as he was forced into a half-kneeling position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The violent impact of his knees against the paving stones shattered the tiles, leaving shallow craters in the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Darkness swam before Ning Zhuo's eyes, and a metallic sweetness rose in his throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">With a guttural roar, Ning Zhuo channeled every ounce of strength into a counterattack. He sprang from his half-kneeling stance, his body coiling like a spring compressed to its limit before exploding outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Bronze Shield shifted a fraction of an inch under his assault!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Seizing the momentary opening, Ning Zhuo dodged aside and flipped into a counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">But the Bronze Shield moved with newfound agility, clearly having "adapted" to Ning Zhuo's shift from blades to gauntlets and developed countermeasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This didn't surprise Ning Zhuo. If the gauntlets possessed such martial mastery, the Bronze Shield - being even more powerful - would naturally possess similar capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Compared to the gauntlets, the shield makes even greater use of the environment!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo had already keenly observed the shield's superior advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">In this narrow alley, the gauntlets' inability to exploit the confined space would have been a disadvantage. But the shield pressed against walls, used its bulk to constrict Ning Zhuo's movements, and even leveraged its edges to ricochet between the walls, once again forcing Ning Zhuo onto the defensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo could only barely parry, sustaining a series of injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">His face, however, was flushed with excitement, his heart brimming with joy. "I've got it! I've got it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Previously, the pressure hadn't been sufficient. The gauntlets and his Physical Body were compatible, but Ning Zhuo himself was mentally drained, torn between countless choices from his memories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Now, the Bronze Shield's overwhelming pressure left him no time for hesitation. He had to rely on instinct, acting from the depths of his heart, unconsciously selecting techniques that resonated with his true nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Executing these techniques was akin to rigorous practice - grueling, relentless practice that yielded profound benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He felt himself gradually merging with the gauntlets, his movements growing smoother, almost effortless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">This sense of effortless mastery was something he had never experienced with swords or blades. After all, fists and feet were far more primal, closer to instinct than any weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Bronze Shield suddenly accelerated, tearing through the air as it hurtled toward Ning Zhuo's face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He dodged the initial strike, then kicked off the wall, spinning back to counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Channeling spiritual energy into his right arm, his muscles bulged as he swung the gauntlet in a powerful side strike against the shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The impact drove the shield into the wall, wedging it tightly between the bricks. In his haste, Ning Zhuo couldn't immediately dislodge it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"An opening!" Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed with opportunity as he pressed his attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Clang! Clang! Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A series of explosive strikes rang out, and the shield's energy rapidly weakened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Suddenly, one side of the shield melted into molten bronze, easily breaking free from the wall's grip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The shield whirred into a rapid spin, its body shrinking by a circle. The rim transformed into a dense series of jagged teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">As the serrated edge spun wildly, it radiated a chilling light, tearing through the air and slashing viciously toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">This unprecedented transformation caught Ning Zhuo completely off guard, leaving him on the defensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Bronze Shield's counterattack had been perfectly timed, exploiting the vulnerable moment when his old strength had been exhausted and his new strength had yet to surge. It was clear this had been meticulously planned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The shield crashing into the wall earlier was just a trap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo realized in an instant that he had fallen victim to a shield's cunning scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">With no time to dodge, he could only raise his hands, using his palms to resist the shield's relentless cutting edge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">A shower of sparks erupted as the ear-splitting screech of metal grinding against metal reverberated through the narrow alley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo's bronze gauntlets and the shield were made of the same material, so neither held a clear advantage, allowing him to temporarily block the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">But Ning Zhuo's strength couldn't match the shield's sheer mass. His arms were forced apart, exposing his abdomen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The serrated rim sliced into Ning Zhuo's abdomen, the cold metal sinking deep into his flesh. A wave of agony instantly overwhelmed him, blurring his vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">If this continued, Ning Zhuo would likely be sliced in half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Although cultivators from Profound Armor Cave were observing and could intervene to heal him, Ning Zhuo was undoubtedly on the verge of defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">One misstep had caused the situation to deteriorate rapidly, leaving him teetering on the precipice of failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The young man tried to evade, but the Bronze Shield had deliberately maneuvered him, forcing his back against the wall and trapping his waist against its serrated edge, leaving him no room to escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Some of the observing cultivators gasped at the sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Just as Ning Zhuo was about to lose, a memory suddenly surfaced with startling clarity in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">A Demonic Cultivator parried an opponent's blade strike with his sword. The sword's spine suddenly "sensed" the downward shift in the enemy's blade force, indicating an impending sweeping motion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">With a subtle twist of his wrist, the Demonic Cultivator tilted his sword, guiding the enemy's sweeping strike half an inch outward. The deflected blade left an opening, which the Demonic Cultivator exploited with a swift counterattack, piercing his opponent's heart with a single thrust!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Demonic Cultivator, give me back my wife and children's lives!" the enemy roared, his fist driving straight forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The Demonic Cultivator met the blow with his palm. The moment they connected, he sensed that the enemy's punch lacked follow-through and his center of gravity was slightly off-balance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Instantly shifting his stance, the Demonic Cultivator guided the enemy's fist backward like a swimming fish, simultaneously sidestepping to evade the line of force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The enemy's fist struck empty air, his momentum carrying him forward as his center of gravity was further destabilized. Seizing the opportunity, the Demonic Cultivator lowered his shoulder and delivered a brutal elbow strike, slamming into the vulnerable gap beneath the enemy's ribs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Thud!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The enemy collapsed, blood gushing from his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"I treated you like a brother, and this is how you repay me?! In this battle, only one of us will leave alive!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Demonic Cultivator's short halberd locked against his opponent's hooked claws, their weapons locked in a stalemate of brute force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Suddenly, the Demonic Cultivator sensed his opponent preparing to unleash his Force, aiming a knee strike at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Seizing the opportunity, the Demonic Cultivator abruptly relaxed his grip and withdrew his strength, simultaneously ducking low and sidestepping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The enemy's explosive knee strike missed its mark, throwing him off balance. The Demonic Cultivator seized the moment, freeing his halberd with a swift upward sweep that pierced through his opponent's jaw and into his skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The memories flooding Ning Zhuo's mind eerily mirrored his current predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Without hesitation, he acted on instinct, gripping the Bronze Shield's upper and lower edges, immediately sensing the shifting forces within it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Guide the momentum!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">A sharp glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he twisted his wrist, pressed his body against the wall, and flipped upside down like a windmill. Using the shield's rotational force to propel his own spin, he deflected the shield's trajectory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Bronze Shield slammed deep into the wall, freeing Ning Zhuo from his confinement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Danger averted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The watching cultivators exhaled in relief. None wanted Ning Zhuo eliminated so early; they eagerly anticipated his clash with Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Ning Zhuo's injuries are severe - his intestines are exposed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Even though he's free, he's still in grave danger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Many held their breath for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">His face was deathly pale from blood loss. He pressed one hand tightly against the gaping wound in his abdomen, trying to keep the flesh aligned, while raising his other hand to face the Bronze Shield's relentless assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Surrounded by peril, Ning Zhuo repeatedly rolled across the ground, retreating step by step, dodging and evading, completely on the defensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Yet his resilience shone through. Though the scene was desperate, he refused to fall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Hmm?" Gradually, some cultivators began to show surprise, their keen eyes detecting Ning Zhuo's sudden improvement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"He's breaking through in the heat of battle! He's suddenly grasped the essence of martial arts - the interplay between the real and the illusory!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Ning Zhuo can now sense the shifting forces within the Bronze Shield's feints, keenly detecting the subtle changes and predicting its next move!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"It's as if he had 'foresight' and prepared his defenses in advance. That's why, even with only one hand to defend, he managed to hold out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"Is this what it means to be a genius?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The crowd exchanged silent glances. Some had previously dismissed Ning Zhuo's last-minute training as futile, but now they witnessed his astonishing progress and remarkable achievements unfold before their very eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"I only gained enough experience in my sixties to 'sense' the shifts in force and feel truly one with my weapon!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"And how old is Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"His comprehension is terrifying! Just a while ago, his martial arts skills were still so rudimentary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Cultivator Hao, drawn by the spectacle, sighed sincerely, "Geniuses defy all conventional logic."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">His words struck a chord with the crowd, plunging them into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Bitterness, helplessness, resentment, and even envy... a complex mix of emotions stirred in the cultivators' hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">When they considered their own painstaking years of accumulation and then witnessed Ning Zhuo's performance, the comparison was enough to drive anyone mad with frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">A moment later,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Clang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Ning Zhuo slammed his fists down, smashing the Bronze Shield to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">He stomped his foot heavily, pinning the shield in place, and swiftly began refining it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Panting heavily, his robes stained with blood, Ning Zhuo's eyes shone with exhilaration, his spirit soaring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">"Having access to vast amounts of others' memories has spared me the long, arduous process of accumulation and practice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">"For me, this kind of real combat is the most valuable experience!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
