<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 200: Chanyu, Sister-in-law?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
At this point, Ning Zhuo was stuck.<br/>
<br/>
He was a diligent student with a habit of previewing his lessons, but reaching the eighth layer of the cultivation technique was his limit.<br/>
<br/>
He had utilized his time to the utmost.<br/>
<br/>
He had never thought of previewing the ninth layer.<br/>
<br/>
To him, it seemed like a huge waste!<br/>
<br/>
The future is truly hard to predict.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Ning Zhuo couldn't operate the ninth layer of the cultivation technique and was awkwardly stuck at the peak of the eighth layer.<br/>
<br/>
But the dual cultivation continued.<br/>
<br/>
The Yin-Yang Qi continuously transmitted to him, then rapidly dissolved in his three Dantians, transforming into the foundation of the Three Seas.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, thoughts surged in his Divine Sea, their number terrifyingly increasing; mana gathered in his Qi Sea, creating waves and myriad phenomena; his Essence Sea's blood essence swelled, transforming from a lake into a vast ocean!<br/>
<br/>
It was unbearable, extremely unbearable!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo only felt pain in his chest, his brow throbbing, his energy extremely vigorous, making him want to run at full speed for three days and nights without rest!<br/>
<br/>
His nostrils bled first, followed by the other six orifices, which also began to bleed.<br/>
<br/>
Just as he was inwardly cursing, Yang Chanyu finally woke up and regained her senses.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the Ming-Yang Qi Ball between herself and Sun Lingtong, Yang Chanyu showed a look of shock and immediately stopped the technique of extracting Yang to replenish Yin.<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Lingtong, what's going on with you? Are you practicing the Virgin Boy Technique? How can the Virgin Boy Technique emit so much Yang Qi?" Yang Chanyu asked in shame and anger, her gaze complicated.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Ning Zhuo's heart tightened, and he quickly focused his attention on Yuan Dasheng, feeling a surge of anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong replied, "Yang Chanyu, weren't you just crazily insisting on dual cultivation with me? Now that you've succeeded, you're still not satisfied?" Yang Chanyu snorted coldly, "I was tricked by the enemy, the power of a Nascent Soul level is hard to resist. The fact that I held on until now means I saved your life."<br/>
<br/>
"I volunteered to come here this time to discuss our marriage contract."<br/>
<br/>
"The marriage contract back then was decided by our masters. Now that neither of us is willing, canceling the contract is the right path."<br/>
<br/>
"But now, with this situation, dual cultivation has become a fact."<br/>
<br/>
"You must come back with me and explain everything to my master, and give me an explanation!" Ning Zhuo: "?!"<br/>
<br/>
He felt something was wrong: "Didn't Brother Sun say that dual cultivation involving Yang Qi and Yin Qi at this level is common? It doesn't involve Yuan Yang or Yuan Yin!" Ning Zhuo wanted to ask Sun Lingtong, but now was not the right time, so he had to hold back.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong raised his head and glared at Yang Chanyu, "I'm not going back! If I go back, I'll lose my life."<br/>
<br/>
"That marriage contract was just your master scheming to take advantage of my talent. Such a conspiracy is known to everyone!"<br/>
<br/>
"My master was tricked and lost a bet, so he had to agree to the marriage contract."<br/>
<br/>
"Why should I go back with you?"<br/>
<br/>
"My master hasn't even been found yet."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shook his head and decisively refused.<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, what explanation do I owe you?"<br/>
<br/>
"Why should I give you an explanation?"<br/>
<br/>
"You were the one crazily insisting on dual cultivation with me, what could I do?" Sun Lingtong's series of questions left Yang Chanyu speechless.<br/>
<br/>
"At that time, we were both under the influence of a bewitching ghost technique. I was fine, but you were affected."<br/>
<br/>
"You should thank me for saving your life!"<br/>
<br/>
"If I hadn't extracted your Yang Qi to balance your Yin and Yang, you would have been overwhelmed by the Yin Qi, and even if you didn't die, you would have been crippled. Now you're still talking to me like this?"<br/>
<br/>
"You know I practice the Virgin Boy Technique! Do you know the heavy price I paid by forcibly extracting Yang Qi, risking the dispersion of my cultivation?" Yang Chanyu opened her mouth to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong continued, "If you want to take me back, you'll have to take my corpse."<br/>
<br/>
"I'll even self-destruct my soul, I won't leave anything for you!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong showed a fierce and resolute side, making it seem like his previous desperate plea to Ning Zhuo for help was just an illusion.<br/>
<br/>
"Fine, fine. Sun Lingtong, you're so sharp-tongued!"<br/>
<br/>
"Just after dual cultivation with me, you turn your back on me."<br/>
<br/>
"Fine, very fine! Like master, like disciple." Yang Chanyu's face turned blue with anger.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong spread his hands, "You didn't lose your Yuan Yin, just some Yin Qi, what's there to fuss about?"<br/>
<br/>
"With your status and talent, who knows how many cultivators you've dual cultivated with!"<br/>
<br/>
"If you think you can use this to threaten me, do you think I'm a fool?" "You!!!" Yang Chanyu was furious.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sneered, "Do you want to fight? I just saved you, and now you want to repay kindness with enmity?"<br/>
<br/>
"I must remind you, we have a marriage contract."<br/>
<br/>
"If you attack me, beware of the contract's backlash!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong waggled his chubby little finger, his smiling face making people want to hit him.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu was speechless, her eyes flickering as she noticed the ghost fog rapidly dissipating.<br/>
<br/>
This place was no longer safe.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu took a deep breath, "Hmph, you took advantage of me and still want to act innocent and deny it?!"<br/>
<br/>
"Let me tell you, Sun Lingtong, this matter is not over!" With that, she cast a spell, traversing the void and disappearing from the spot.<br/>
<br/>
A talisman floated in mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
It was left by Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up, and he reached out to take it.<br/>
<br/>
The moment he touched the talisman, Yang Chanyu's voice echoed in his ear, "Sun Lingtong! This Void Traversing Talisman is for your protection."<br/>
<br/>
"Keep your little life, in the future, I will settle this score with you!" Sun Lingtong chuckled, indifferent, "Settle the score with me? Settle it with my little brother!"<br/>
<br/>
"I never dual cultivated with you."<br/>
<br/>
"No, that's not it!" Ning Zhuo quickly used the Life-Hanging Thread to send a message, "Brother Sun, what's going on?" Ning Zhuo's head was almost smoking.<br/>
<br/>
He only knew that Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu were enemies, but he didn't expect there to be more to the story, involving a marriage contract.<br/>
<br/>
"Is this Yang Chanyu, uh, Fairy Chanyu, my sister-in-law?" Ning Zhuo asked.<br/>
<br/>
"Bah!" Sun Lingtong immediately cursed.<br/>
<br/>
"I practice the Virgin Boy Technique, what sister-in-law? Don't mention it again!"<br/>
<br/>
"Her master has long coveted my Ling Tong talent, wanting to deplete me to help Yang Chanyu advance."<br/>
<br/>
"They called it a marriage contract, but if I fell for it, I'd lose my life!"<br/>
<br/>
"Fortunately, I accidentally took a Youth Retaining Pill back then, so I could only practice the Virgin Boy Technique, never losing my Yuan Yang, which delayed the marriage."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, my master took me wandering around, never returning to the sect, just to avoid this master-disciple pair."<br/>
<br/>
"These are old matters, let's not talk about them."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the ghost fog thinning significantly, Sun Lingtong put away Yuan Dasheng, traversed the void, and disappeared from the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, he arrived at another underground secret base and reunited with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Zhuo was sternly staring at Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong chuckled, "Little brother, thank you for saving me."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head, "Brother Sun, you schemed against me."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was usually very tough, but in this ghost fog, he had desperately sought Ning Zhuo's help, which was very unlike him!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had been extremely worried about Sun Lingtong at the time and hadn't noticed this flaw.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Sun Lingtong was safe, he finally realized it.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said in a deep voice, "Brother Sun, you deliberately made me dual cultivate with Yang Chanyu, creating a connection between us."<br/>
<br/>
"You previously advised me to seize the Immortal Palace and then run away. You always wanted me to join the Void Sect!"<br/>
<br/>
"Were you worried I'd get stuck here?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, caught in his scheme, showed no panic and directly gave Ning Zhuo a thumbs-up, "As expected of you, Little Zhuo, you saw through my plan so quickly."<br/>
<br/>
"Hehehe."<br/>
<br/>
"This wasn't a scheme against you, but paving the way for our future."<br/>
<br/>
"In the future, when you seize the Immortal Palace, we'll run back to the Void Sect."<br/>
<br/>
"You don't have my talent, but you have dual cultivation with Yang Chanyu and control of the Lava Immortal Palace, making you valuable. Her master can be your backer."<br/>
<br/>
"Having you as my brother turns a strong enemy into an ally, helps me escape the marriage contract, and preserves my Virgin Boy Technique cultivation. It's a win-win."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head and smiled bitterly.<br/>
<br/>
If it were anyone else, he would be furious.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had always been independent, and anyone making decisions for him was a severe offense, warranting retaliation.<br/>
<br/>
But this time, it was Sun Lingtong who schemed against him.<br/>
<br/>
That was a different matter.<br/>
<br/>
Without Sun Lingtong's care, Ning Zhuo would have struggled to grow.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, Sun Lingtong's guidance and daily companionship made him like a brother, teacher, and father to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's "scheme" was essentially for Ning Zhuo's benefit.<br/>
<br/>
But this kindness made Ning Zhuo, a small Qi Refining cultivator, directly provoke the Golden Core true disciple of the Void Sect, which was quite heavy.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong continued to explain, "The situation at that time was really dangerous."<br/>
<br/>
"It wasn't that I deliberately schemed against you, little brother."<br/>
<br/>
"I just went with the flow. Given the circumstances, this was the best way to handle it."<br/>
<br/>
"This opportunity was truly a rare one!"<br/>
<br/>
"You want to seize the Lava Immortal Palace but suffer from weak cultivation and long training time. Dual cultivation can speed things up, and your luck has arrived."<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of luck, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but think of the theory of fate energy.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong asked again, "Little brother, how much did your cultivation increase this time?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo told him the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly, laughing, "Very good, very good."<br/>
<br/>
"You didn't break through and are stuck at the peak of the eighth layer, which is actually a good thing. You can purify the Three Seas and solidify your foundation."<br/>
<br/>
"After that, you can operate the ninth layer of the cultivation technique and break through."<br/>
<br/>
"At that time, the breakthrough will be smooth and effortless. And because your Three Seas foundation is too deep, your cultivation will surely soar."<br/>
<br/>
"It's just a question of whether you'll reach the mid or late stage of the ninth layer."<br/>
<br/>
"Even reaching the peak of the ninth layer is not impossible."<br/>
<br/>
"If you reach the peak of the ninth layer... well."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong looked forward to the future, becoming more and more excited, "Little Zhuo, you can consider building your foundation then."<br/>
<br/>
Cultivation really depends on opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, a single immortal fate can make a mortal ascend to the heavens in one step!<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo was quite annoyed by Sun Lingtong's scheme, he had to admit that Sun Lingtong had indeed helped him a lot this time.<br/>
<br/>
The originally planned long cultivation time was suddenly shortened by eighty to ninety percent!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered, "Since Yin-Yang dual cultivation is so convenient, I can find another person to dual cultivate with."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong chuckled, "Little brother, you've got the hang of it!"<br/>
<br/>
"Dual cultivation is indeed convenient, otherwise, why are those flower houses in the Immortal City always so lively?"<br/>
<br/>
"However, dual cultivation also has its drawbacks!"<br/>
<br/>
"Frequent dual cultivation can lead to a mixed aura, which is very detrimental to future progress."<br/>
<br/>
"And the benefits of dual cultivation are not as you feel now."<br/>
<br/>
"Yang Chanyu has talent, and she's at the Golden Core stage, far above you, which is why you made such great progress."<br/>
<br/>
"In the short term, without a suitable partner, you shouldn't dual cultivate again. The low yield and mixed aura will affect your foundation building!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, "Understood, Brother Sun."<br/>
