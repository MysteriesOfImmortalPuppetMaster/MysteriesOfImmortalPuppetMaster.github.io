<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 232: Chaotic Battle of the Golden Core Stage</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The items were already in hand, and the True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace had no intention of lingering any longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He immediately wanted to retreat and escape from Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But in the next moment, Zheng Shuangjun descended from the sky, unleashing a torrent of blade qi, slashing fiercely at the True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Zhou Nongying emerged from the ground, raising a wave of dark shadows that completely cut off the True Inheritor's escape route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Zheng Danlian, from his left side, drew his bow and nocked an arrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The arrow shot through the air, firmly locking onto the True Inheritor's forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">At this moment, a Golden Core Stage disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion also appeared, pushing both palms forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">His spell, like a burst of brilliant fireworks, burned towards the True Inheritor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">It is worth mentioning that the Golden Core Stage disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion was also clad in black attire, identical to that of the Shadow Demon Cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"A third Shadow Demon Cultivator?!" Everyone was shocked in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace wanted to flee, but enemies surrounded him on all sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He narrowly dodged Zheng Shuangjun's attack and broke free from Zhou Nongying's shadow entanglement, but he couldn't avoid Zheng Danlian's arrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He took the arrow head-on and had to use his back to block the brilliant fireworks from the Purple Dawn Pavilion's True Inheritor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The numerous defensive magical artifacts he had activated with all his might shattered two of them directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Only the innermost layer of his undergarments, which were of magical artifact level, stubbornly protected his vital areas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace still wanted to persist, spitting blood while gritting his teeth, carrying the Demonic Dao Scripture, and continuing to flee for several hundred meters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">However, the attacks from all sides were relentless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">With his fists unable to fend off four hands, he had no choice but to throw the Demonic Dao Scripture away again to alleviate the pressure on himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Golden Core Stage cultivators who had been besieging the True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace immediately ceased their attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">They were worried that the text of the scripture would be destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Although the scripture could be circulated, under such destructive circumstances, the circulated scripture would also suffer content loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Golden Core Stage cultivators restrained their attacks and then reached out again to grab the scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The scene was chaotic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Golden and silver lights collided, blades and hooks danced wildly, and spells flew everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong plunged into this chaotic battle, and the situation became even more chaotic with the immediate involvement of Chi Han, who followed closely behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun Lingtong, with his agile movements, took the opportunity to escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Exciting, so exciting!" His big eyes sparkled, his spirit highly focused, and his face flushed with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He was both scared and thrilled, thoroughly enjoying this adventure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">If they were outside the city, someone like Sun Lingtong, who was only at the Foundation Establishment Stage, wouldn't stand a chance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But within the city, with the Immortal City Grand Formation providing full suppression, the power of the Golden Core Stage cultivators was greatly restricted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Moreover, Sun Lingtong had made ample preparations in advance, expending his foundation to sustain his performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He was not an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator, barely maintaining his disguise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The battlefield was chaotic, with various factions and many with ulterior motives, making the attacks and defenses switch rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong did not face a Golden Core Stage opponent directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Even among the Golden Core Stage cultivators, they were seriously entangled with each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Chi Han shouted, "Shadow Demon Cultivator, where are you running?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Then, he saw the Shadow Demon Cultivator, a True Inheritor of the Purple Dawn Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This Golden Core Stage True Inheritor was the closest to him, so Chi Han didn't hesitate and threw a punch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Golden Core Stage cultivator of the Purple Dawn Pavilion activated his defensive spell, but it was greatly suppressed by the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Chi Han's punch directly sent the Golden Core Stage cultivator of the Purple Dawn Pavilion crashing into the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">In such a battlefield, the advantage of body cultivators was evident from this punch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The two Golden Core Stage True Inheritors disguised as Shadow Demon Cultivators were in a difficult situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">They were adept at using spells, but their spells were heavily suppressed, forcing them to rely on less commonly used magical artifacts to hold their ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Because of their disguise, they couldn't use their usual methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Taking advantage of Chi Han being drawn away, Sun Lingtong, with a sense of gratitude towards the True Inheritor of the Purple Dawn Pavilion, burrowed underground, swiftly escaping through the gaps in the Immortal City Grand Formation via the sewers, completing his retreat without incident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Shadow Demon Cultivator, a True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace, once again charged towards the Demonic Dao Scripture, his face full of excitement, "It's still mine!" But in the next moment, a ghost general suddenly appeared, blocking him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Another ghost general immediately followed, grabbing the Demonic Dao Scripture and running towards its masterâ€”Luo Shang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Luo Shang reappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">But he revealed his true face, not disguised as a Shadow Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Luo Shang's face was still somewhat swollen, indicating that the residual poison in his body had not been cleared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The ghost general that snatched the Demonic Dao Scripture was evidently extremely fast, covering several hundred steps in the blink of an eye, arriving in front of Luo Shang and presenting the scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The moment Luo Shang received it, he felt the profound meaning of the scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Demonic Blood Vein Technique?!" Luo Shang showed a hint of joy, just about to speak when golden light suddenly flashed before his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhu Xuanji pounced in front of him, holding a large ruler, slashing down fiercely like wielding a sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Luo Shang hurriedly controlled a third Golden Core Stage ghost general to block Zhu Xuanji, while he took the opportunity to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"You can leave, but the scripture stays!" Ning Jiufan suddenly revealed himself, holding an Ice Jade Pot, casting an ice spell that directly froze Luo Shang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">But the frozen Luo Shang quickly changed his appearance, revealing his true formâ€”a strange ghost general with a skeletal face, still at the Golden Core Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The real Luo Shang was still hiding his true body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The ghost general was frozen, and the Demonic Dao Scripture suffered the same fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Jiufan reached into the giant ice block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Where his hand passed, the diamond-hard ice flowed like water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Jiufan obtained the Demonic Dao Scripture, his expression changing as he was also fooled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">But in the next moment, Luo Shang's counterattack arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Four Golden Core Stage ghost generals surrounded Ning Jiufan, launching a frenzied assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Jiufan, with formidable combat power, still managed to fend off the attacks, albeit in a rather disheveled state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Luo Shang's true strength was revealed at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He came from the Soul Devouring Sect, specializing in controlling ghostly entities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Under his command, there were many ghost generals with Golden Core Stage combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He alone was equivalent to a small sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Jiufan's situation immediately improved, thanks to the assistance of another Golden Core Stage ancestor from the Zhou family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The latter threw a formation disk from afar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The formation disk, at the level of a magical artifact, spun above Ning Jiufan's head, instantly setting up a formation that caused the ghost generals to lose their direction and make frequent mistakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Jiufan, while receiving the infusion of the scripture's profound meaning, left the formation disk behind and quickly escaped the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Support him!" Zheng Shuangjun shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">At this point in the battle, the combined advantage of the three cultivation families and Zhu Xuanji finally became apparent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Yang Chanyu, holding a mechanical bow, shot arrows that strongly interfered with Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The two Shadow Demon Cultivators, seeing the urgent situation, only exchanged a glance before immediately attacking Ning Jiufan with all their might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Jiufan displayed strong combat power, with ice spreading everywhere, holding on for quite a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">But in the end, he was struck by a flying dart from the True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace, breaking through his defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">If Ning Jiufan hadn't tilted his head in time, the dart, which only grazed his left ear, would have seriously injured him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Jiufan couldn't hold on any longer and threw the Demonic Dao Scripture to Zheng Shuangjun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Why make such a choice?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Jiufan's reason was very simpleâ€”Zheng Shuangjun was the closest ally to him at that moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"You go, I'll hold them off!" Zheng Danlian ran to the back of his clan's Golden Core Stage cultivator, blocking the enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Zheng Shuangjun also shouted, "Protect me, once we enter the clan territory, we'll be safe. The scripture's content will be shared with you all!" The profound meaning of the Demonic Dao Scripture gradually flowed into his heart, giving him extra motivation to protect the treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The two Golden Core Stage cultivators of the Zhou family exchanged a glance and attacked with all their might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Jiufan also frequently cast spells with his palms, intercepting other cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Indeed, the three Golden Core Stage cultivators had the numerical advantage, as this was their territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Seeing the scripture about to be taken away and being blocked themselves, someone became anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The True Inheritor of the Purple Dawn Pavilion formed hand seals, and lightning appeared in his palms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The purple lightning was incredibly fast, leaving only an afterimage in the eyes of the Golden Core Stage cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Before anyone could react, it accurately struck Zheng Shuangjun's back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Zheng Shuangjun spat out a mouthful of blood, stumbling forward, almost falling but managing to stabilize himself and continue running.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace snorted coldly, chanting incantations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The wind roared around him, forming a phantom of a green dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The dragon's roar echoed, and the green dragon phantom flew out, carrying a strong impact and tearing force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Wherever it went, the green wind was like a blade, with the power to tear everything apart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">So fierce that the Zhou family's Golden Core Stage cultivators didn't dare to confront it head-on and actively avoided it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Seeing the green dragon phantom about to hit Zheng Shuangjun, at the critical moment, his own Golden Core Stage cultivator was reliable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zheng Danlian blocked in front of the green dragon, wiping the surface of his storage belt at his waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Hiss!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">A mechanical black snake appeared, much smaller in size compared to the green dragon phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">But even so, the mechanical black snake was fearless, raising its head to collide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The green dragon phantom collapsed, and the green wind quickly dispersed and disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace's face changed dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He was well aware of the power of his move, but at this moment, it was shattered by an ordinary-looking mechanical black snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The mechanical black snake, gaining momentum, continued its attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace threw out a magical artifact, a set of bamboo flying swords, totaling forty-nine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The bamboo flying swords, like a torrential downpour, clanged as they pierced the mechanical black snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The mechanical black snake's momentum slowed slightly, but its ferocity remained, unstoppable, charging towards the True Inheritor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The True Inheritor felt a strong sense of crisis, hurriedly activating a protective magical artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The black snake opened its mouth and bit, directly breaking through the protective light and biting off the True Inheritor's left arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace screamed in pain, retreating rapidly, and began to treat his severed arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">However, the wound was constantly surrounded by black qi, hindering his healing methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The True Inheritor's face changed dramatically, exclaiming, "Night Rain Demon Weapon?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Everyone was shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The mechanical black snake rampaged, invincible for a time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Various spells hit it, as light as the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Even magical artifacts were broken or bitten by the black snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"This demon weapon is so ferocious!" Everyone was extremely astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Luo Shang, unwilling to accept this, sent ghost generals to attack the mechanical black snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">As a result, out of the four Golden Core Stage ghost generals, only two returned when Luo Shang urgently recalled them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Even though ghost generals' overall combat power often couldn't compare to cultivators of the same level, the mechanical black snake's power was still too overwhelming.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
