<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 170: Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo only brought ten people to explore the Lava Immortal Palace together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">They pushed open the first door, the second door, and the third door, all the way without any hindrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Soon, everyone arrived at the preparation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Many people's eyes were focused on the leaderboard on the five stone pillars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The names on the list were all from the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Meng Chong firmly occupied the second place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The first place was the unshakable "Entry Standard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Meng Chong is still first, truly worthy of being an immortal talent!" Ning Yong exclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Chen sighed, "With Meng Chong around, the reformation team of the City Lord's Mansion always dominates the leaderboard. I really want to know what kind of rewards they get from the Immortal Palace each time." Someone else added, "If it weren't for Meng Chong, we would definitely be on the list. In this case, Brother Zhou would surely be first!" Ning Zhuo smiled slightly in his heart, "I have always been, and still am, the first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"And the real second place is not Meng Chong, but Brother Sun. It's just that he didn't make it to the list." In this regard, Ning Zhuo hid it quite well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">To this day, no one has Diskovered the trick behind the "Entry Standard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Next, the Ning family cultivators Diskussed the entry standard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Everyone marveled at how the three sects' seniors, being great cultivators of the Void Refining Stage, had such high standards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Despite trying for so long, they still hadn't met the entry standard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Even someone as talented as Meng Chong was no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Some speculated about Meng Chong's actual progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He could firmly occupy the second place, but how far had he really advanced?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">With the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng as an insider, Ning Zhuo was naturally very clear about Meng Chong's real progressâ€”he was still at the first checkpoint of the Daoist Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This was a result of Ning Zhuo deliberately holding back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng did not frequently appear to intercept Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Although Meng Chong would shout and call for the mechanical apes every time he came in, wanting to fight Yuan Dasheng again to regain his honor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo needed Meng Chong to achieve results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo needed his cultivation to "progress." His publicly declared "Qi Refining Stage Level Three" cultivation was indeed a bit low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He needed a suitable reason to showcase a stronger Qi Refining Stage cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">And to get stronger, he had to expose the fourth to sixth layers of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo's plan was to let Meng Chong achieve such good results first, and then he would follow up, reaching the checkpoints that could obtain the subsequent techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Meng Chong had to do it first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">On one hand, it was for the leaderboard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">On the other hand, Ning Zhuo needed to maintain a secret cooperative relationship with the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Once Ning Zhuo's achievements surpassed Meng Chong's, the City Lord's Mansion would likely take action against him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">At that time, even if Fei Si admired Ning Zhuo, he wouldn't be able to go against the will of Meng Chong and Meng Kui, and would take action against Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo had regained control of the black market and didn't want Fei Si to drive him out so quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Anyway, I have already closed off the Buddhist Path and the Daoist Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The subsequent checkpoints of the Daoist Path have increased difficulty. With Meng Chong's strength, it won't be easy to surpass me." "Based on the layout style of the three sects' seniors, there is likely a third Daoist Path that requires the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique to be cultivated to the peak of the ninth layer to open."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Not to mention, Meng Chong's cultivation was genuinely at the Qi Refining Stage Level Three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">To open the second Daoist Path, he would need to cultivate to the peak of the sixth layer of the Qi Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">And until now, he hadn't even mastered the subsequent techniques from the fourth to the sixth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Room Four, Room Five, Room Six...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The wooden giant assembled by the group, under Ning Zhuo's control, rampaged all the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Brother Zhou, charge! Charge all the way through!" "Brother Zhou, you are stronger than before!" "Yes, I feel the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Yong and others were carried by Ning Zhuo all the way, shouting and cheering, very happy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">At this moment, their mindset towards Ning Zhuo was different from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo controlled the black market with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Especially those Foundation Establishment cultivators of the uncle generation, who worked in the night market, becoming Ning Zhuo's subordinates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">This deeply moved Ning Chen and Ning Yong, making them feel awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">If before, they were sincerely convinced by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Now, they worshipped Ning Zhuo as if he were a deity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo deeply felt their change in attitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Because he could see the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">These people's Life Hanging by a Threads were unprecedentedly tenacious and solid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"The eighth checkpoint is passed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Brother Zhou's strength has clearly increased, it's like a rebirth." "Use my thigh, Brother Zhou!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"No, use my arm to beat the enemy. Brother Zhou, I'm too idle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"The ninth checkpoint, the ninth checkpoint! Wow, this is my first time here, so this is what it looks like."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Ning Zhuo broke through the ninth checkpoint and arrived at the transfer hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Roar!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">At the right time and place, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">After a fierce battle, the giant wooden puppet disintegrated, leaving only Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo returned to his individual form and quickly led Yuan Dasheng forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He pushed open the second Daoist Path door and entered, pleasantly surprised to find: the Daoist Path checkpoint was indeed special!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo was infused with a spell called the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The principle of this technique was quite simple: the mutual generation (Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water, Water generates Wood) and mutual restraint (Wood restrains Earth, Earth restrains Water, Water restrains Fire, Fire restrains Metal, Metal restrains Wood) of the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">But when it came to execution, it was very complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">From the simplest perspective, this technique could be divided into ten smaller spells, corresponding to the aspects of mutual generation and mutual restraint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">On this basis, the spells could be interconnected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">For example, after Wood generates Fire, Fire then generates Earth, resulting in the final transformation of Wood elemental power into Earth elemental power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Not only generation but also the chain of restraint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">These spells combined to form a very complex relationship diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo tried it briefly and quickly Diskovered that this Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique had extraordinary significance for the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Before, to use the Embrace Ice Technique, I had to extract the Water element from the Five Elements power." "But now, I can transform the other four elements into Water element power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"In this way, I will have pure elemental powers of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, making it more convenient to use techniques like the Embrace Ice Technique, and the power will be more abundant, enhancing the technique's might!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">After obtaining the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique, Ning Zhuo faced another selection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">On the walls of the room, there were palm-sized Disks, some round, some oval, resembling formation plates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Each formation plate had the symbols of the Five Elements and intricate formation lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"These mechanisms are called Five Elements Transformation Disks. I must use the Five Elements power to unlock the puzzles on the Disks to take them for my own use." Clearly, the more complex the puzzles on the Five Elements Transformation Disks, the higher the difficulty and the better the quality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo's encounter this time was not as advantageous as the Buddhist Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">In the first checkpoint of the Buddhist Path, he had taken out Yuan Dasheng's corpse and obtained the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, gaining a significant advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But in the special checkpoint of the second Daoist Path, he could only rely on his understanding of the Five Elements techniques to try and solve the puzzles and obtain a Five Elements Transformation Disk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He was still too young and lacked time to practice spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The reason he often taught others the insights of spellcasting was mainly due to the leaderboard rewards, which had given him an abnormal accumulation of spellcasting experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">After trying for a while, Ning Zhuo voluntarily exited the Daoist Path and entered the Buddhist Path to attempt the checkpoint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">His Qi Sea cultivation was boosted to the Divine Sea cultivation by the Ice Jade Wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo was well aware that his greatest advantage still lay in the Divine Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Therefore, the Buddhist Path was the most suitable for him to focus on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The attempt still ended in failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">After his soul returned to his body, Ning Zhuo once again received the praise of the entire clan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He broke through the ninth checkpoint, entered the transfer hall, and saw the Daoist Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">This achievement was the best in the Ning family, breaking his previous record.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Amidst the numerous praises, Ning Zhuo remained calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">On one hand, it was due to Sun Lingtong's years of teaching; on the other hand, Ning Zhuo was very clear about the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">With the recruitment order issued, the situation had become more complicated than before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo had to ensure that on the path of soul entering the Immortal Palace, he always maintained a competitive advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">At the same time, he had to closely monitor the competition on the path of physically entering the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Zhu Xuanji was an outstanding figure on the latter path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">This made Ning Zhuo feel pressured but also relieved that Zhu Xuanji's focus had shifted from investigating cases to the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">On the platform of soul entering the Immortal Palace, Meng Chong, with his immortal talent, was the most formidable challenger to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">In the exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo also encountered a bottleneck, stuck at the first checkpoint of the second Buddhist Path and the second Daoist Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">What Ning Zhuo needed to do now was to fully advance his cultivation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">According to his understanding of the Lava Immortal Palace, the third Buddhist Path, Daoist Path, and Demonic Path were likely to appear next.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">At that time, he would need the corresponding cultivation to push open the doors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo was not like Meng Chong or Ning Xiaohui, who had family backing them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">They only needed to focus on one thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo had to navigate between various forces, finding opportunities to develop himself and striving to absorb external resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">For example, the Ice Jade Wine was something Ning Zhuo urgently needed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">With it, he saved several months of hard work, allowing his Qi Sea cultivation to soar to the peak of the sixth layer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo's exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace yielded another great achievement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Xiaohui heard this news and felt a bit anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Recently, Ning Zhuo had undoubtedly been the most prominent figure in the Ning family! He had pulled down the young clan leader Ning Xiaoren and quickly unified the black market, becoming its new master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Then, Ning Zhuo gathered most of the reformation team members and achieved success in another exploration, reaching the transfer hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Xiaohui felt immense pressure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Every time Ning Zhuo succeeded in exploring the Immortal Palace, Ning Xiaohui felt an invisible slap on her face, making her feel ashamed and angry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Xiaohui knew well that she bore the heavy responsibility of the main lineage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"I must explore the Immortal Palace and achieve greater success than Ning Zhuo to be considered capable!" "If I explore alone, that mechanical ape won't find me so quickly, right?" "Lava Immortal Palace, here I come!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Xiaohui opened her eyes and pushed open the first door in her puppet form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Yuan Dasheng had been waiting, grinning at Ning Xiaohui with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Xiaohui felt as if she had fallen into an ice cave.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
