<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo only brought ten people to explore the Lava Immortal Palace together.<br/>
<br/>
They pushed open the first door, the second door, and the third door, all the way without any hindrance.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, everyone arrived at the preparation room.<br/>
<br/>
Many people's eyes were focused on the leaderboard on the five stone pillars.<br/>
<br/>
The names on the list were all from the City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong firmly occupied the second place.<br/>
<br/>
The first place was the unshakable "Entry Standard."<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Chong is still first, truly worthy of being an immortal talent!" Ning Yong exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen sighed, "With Meng Chong around, the reformation team of the City Lord's Mansion always dominates the leaderboard. I really want to know what kind of rewards they get from the Immortal Palace each time." Someone else added, "If it weren't for Meng Chong, we would definitely be on the list. In this case, Brother Zhou would surely be first!" Ning Zhuo smiled slightly in his heart, "I have always been, and still am, the first."<br/>
<br/>
"And the real second place is not Meng Chong, but Brother Sun. It's just that he didn't make it to the list." In this regard, Ning Zhuo hid it quite well.<br/>
<br/>
To this day, no one has Diskovered the trick behind the "Entry Standard."<br/>
<br/>
Next, the Ning family cultivators Diskussed the entry standard.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone marveled at how the three sects' seniors, being great cultivators of the Void Refining Stage, had such high standards.<br/>
<br/>
Despite trying for so long, they still hadn't met the entry standard.<br/>
<br/>
Even someone as talented as Meng Chong was no exception.<br/>
<br/>
Some speculated about Meng Chong's actual progress.<br/>
<br/>
He could firmly occupy the second place, but how far had he really advanced?<br/>
<br/>
With the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng as an insider, Ning Zhuo was naturally very clear about Meng Chong's real progress‚Äîhe was still at the first checkpoint of the Daoist Path.<br/>
<br/>
This was a result of Ning Zhuo deliberately holding back.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng did not frequently appear to intercept Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
Although Meng Chong would shout and call for the mechanical apes every time he came in, wanting to fight Yuan Dasheng again to regain his honor.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo needed Meng Chong to achieve results.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo needed his cultivation to "progress." His publicly declared "Qi Refining Stage Level Three" cultivation was indeed a bit low.<br/>
<br/>
He needed a suitable reason to showcase a stronger Qi Refining Stage cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
And to get stronger, he had to expose the fourth to sixth layers of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's plan was to let Meng Chong achieve such good results first, and then he would follow up, reaching the checkpoints that could obtain the subsequent techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong had to do it first.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, it was for the leaderboard.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Ning Zhuo needed to maintain a secret cooperative relationship with the City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Once Ning Zhuo's achievements surpassed Meng Chong's, the City Lord's Mansion would likely take action against him.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, even if Fei Si admired Ning Zhuo, he wouldn't be able to go against the will of Meng Chong and Meng Kui, and would take action against Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had regained control of the black market and didn't want Fei Si to drive him out so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
"Anyway, I have already closed off the Buddhist Path and the Daoist Path."<br/>
<br/>
"The subsequent checkpoints of the Daoist Path have increased difficulty. With Meng Chong's strength, it won't be easy to surpass me." "Based on the layout style of the three sects' seniors, there is likely a third Daoist Path that requires the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique to be cultivated to the peak of the ninth layer to open."<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention, Meng Chong's cultivation was genuinely at the Qi Refining Stage Level Three.<br/>
<br/>
To open the second Daoist Path, he would need to cultivate to the peak of the sixth layer of the Qi Sea.<br/>
<br/>
And until now, he hadn't even mastered the subsequent techniques from the fourth to the sixth layer.<br/>
<br/>
Room Four, Room Five, Room Six...<br/>
<br/>
The wooden giant assembled by the group, under Ning Zhuo's control, rampaged all the way.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Zhou, charge! Charge all the way through!" "Brother Zhou, you are stronger than before!" "Yes, I feel the same."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong and others were carried by Ning Zhuo all the way, shouting and cheering, very happy.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, their mindset towards Ning Zhuo was different from before.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo controlled the black market with ease.<br/>
<br/>
Especially those Foundation Establishment cultivators of the uncle generation, who worked in the night market, becoming Ning Zhuo's subordinates.<br/>
<br/>
This deeply moved Ning Chen and Ning Yong, making them feel awe.<br/>
<br/>
If before, they were sincerely convinced by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Now, they worshipped Ning Zhuo as if he were a deity.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo deeply felt their change in attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Because he could see the Life-Hanging Thread.<br/>
<br/>
These people's Life-Hanging Threads were unprecedentedly tenacious and solid.<br/>
<br/>
"The eighth checkpoint is passed!"<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Zhou's strength has clearly increased, it's like a rebirth." "Use my thigh, Brother Zhou!"<br/>
<br/>
"No, use my arm to beat the enemy. Brother Zhou, I'm too idle."<br/>
<br/>
"The ninth checkpoint, the ninth checkpoint! Wow, this is my first time here, so this is what it looks like."<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Ning Zhuo broke through the ninth checkpoint and arrived at the transfer hall.<br/>
<br/>
"Roar!"<br/>
<br/>
At the right time and place, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng appeared.<br/>
<br/>
After a fierce battle, the giant wooden puppet disintegrated, leaving only Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo returned to his individual form and quickly led Yuan Dasheng forward.<br/>
<br/>
He pushed open the second Daoist Path door and entered, pleasantly surprised to find: the Daoist Path checkpoint was indeed special!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was infused with a spell called the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique.<br/>
<br/>
The principle of this technique was quite simple: the mutual generation (Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water, Water generates Wood) and mutual restraint (Wood restrains Earth, Earth restrains Water, Water restrains Fire, Fire restrains Metal, Metal restrains Wood) of the Five Elements.<br/>
<br/>
But when it came to execution, it was very complex.<br/>
<br/>
From the simplest perspective, this technique could be divided into ten smaller spells, corresponding to the aspects of mutual generation and mutual restraint.<br/>
<br/>
On this basis, the spells could be interconnected.<br/>
<br/>
For example, after Wood generates Fire, Fire then generates Earth, resulting in the final transformation of Wood elemental power into Earth elemental power.<br/>
<br/>
Not only generation but also the chain of restraint.<br/>
<br/>
These spells combined to form a very complex relationship diagram.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo tried it briefly and quickly Diskovered that this Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique had extraordinary significance for the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
"Before, to use the Embrace Ice Technique, I had to extract the Water element from the Five Elements power." "But now, I can transform the other four elements into Water element power."<br/>
<br/>
"In this way, I will have pure elemental powers of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, making it more convenient to use techniques like the Embrace Ice Technique, and the power will be more abundant, enhancing the technique's might!"<br/>
<br/>
After obtaining the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique, Ning Zhuo faced another selection.<br/>
<br/>
On the walls of the room, there were palm-sized Disks, some round, some oval, resembling formation plates.<br/>
<br/>
Each formation plate had the symbols of the Five Elements and intricate formation lines.<br/>
<br/>
"These mechanisms are called Five Elements Transformation Disks. I must use the Five Elements power to unlock the puzzles on the Disks to take them for my own use." Clearly, the more complex the puzzles on the Five Elements Transformation Disks, the higher the difficulty and the better the quality.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's encounter this time was not as advantageous as the Buddhist Path.<br/>
<br/>
In the first checkpoint of the Buddhist Path, he had taken out Yuan Dasheng's corpse and obtained the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, gaining a significant advantage.<br/>
<br/>
But in the special checkpoint of the second Daoist Path, he could only rely on his understanding of the Five Elements techniques to try and solve the puzzles and obtain a Five Elements Transformation Disk.<br/>
<br/>
He was still too young and lacked time to practice spells.<br/>
<br/>
The reason he often taught others the insights of spellcasting was mainly due to the leaderboard rewards, which had given him an abnormal accumulation of spellcasting experience.<br/>
<br/>
After trying for a while, Ning Zhuo voluntarily exited the Daoist Path and entered the Buddhist Path to attempt the checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
His Qi Sea cultivation was boosted to the Divine Sea cultivation by the Ice Jade Wine.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was well aware that his greatest advantage still lay in the Divine Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the Buddhist Path was the most suitable for him to focus on.<br/>
<br/>
The attempt still ended in failure.<br/>
<br/>
After his soul returned to his body, Ning Zhuo once again received the praise of the entire clan!<br/>
<br/>
He broke through the ninth checkpoint, entered the transfer hall, and saw the Daoist Path.<br/>
<br/>
This achievement was the best in the Ning family, breaking his previous record.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the numerous praises, Ning Zhuo remained calm.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, it was due to Sun Lingtong's years of teaching; on the other hand, Ning Zhuo was very clear about the situation.<br/>
<br/>
With the recruitment order issued, the situation had become more complicated than before!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had to ensure that on the path of soul entering the Immortal Palace, he always maintained a competitive advantage.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he had to closely monitor the competition on the path of physically entering the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was an outstanding figure on the latter path.<br/>
<br/>
This made Ning Zhuo feel pressured but also relieved that Zhu Xuanji's focus had shifted from investigating cases to the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
On the platform of soul entering the Immortal Palace, Meng Chong, with his immortal talent, was the most formidable challenger to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
In the exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo also encountered a bottleneck, stuck at the first checkpoint of the second Buddhist Path and the second Daoist Path.<br/>
<br/>
What Ning Zhuo needed to do now was to fully advance his cultivation!<br/>
<br/>
According to his understanding of the Lava Immortal Palace, the third Buddhist Path, Daoist Path, and Demonic Path were likely to appear next.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, he would need the corresponding cultivation to push open the doors.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was not like Meng Chong or Ning Xiaohui, who had family backing them.<br/>
<br/>
They only needed to focus on one thing.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had to navigate between various forces, finding opportunities to develop himself and striving to absorb external resources.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the Ice Jade Wine was something Ning Zhuo urgently needed.<br/>
<br/>
With it, he saved several months of hard work, allowing his Qi Sea cultivation to soar to the peak of the sixth layer!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace yielded another great achievement!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui heard this news and felt a bit anxious.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, Ning Zhuo had undoubtedly been the most prominent figure in the Ning family! He had pulled down the young clan leader Ning Xiaoren and quickly unified the black market, becoming its new master.<br/>
<br/>
Then, Ning Zhuo gathered most of the reformation team members and achieved success in another exploration, reaching the transfer hall.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui felt immense pressure!<br/>
<br/>
Every time Ning Zhuo succeeded in exploring the Immortal Palace, Ning Xiaohui felt an invisible slap on her face, making her feel ashamed and angry.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui knew well that she bore the heavy responsibility of the main lineage!<br/>
<br/>
"I must explore the Immortal Palace and achieve greater success than Ning Zhuo to be considered capable!" "If I explore alone, that mechanical ape won't find me so quickly, right?" "Lava Immortal Palace, here I come!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui opened her eyes and pushed open the first door in her puppet form.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng had been waiting, grinning at Ning Xiaohui with a smile.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui felt as if she had fallen into an ice cave.</div>
