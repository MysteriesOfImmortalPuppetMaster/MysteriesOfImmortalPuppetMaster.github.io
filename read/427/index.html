<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 427: Transmission of the Bitter Cold Scripture</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Jade steel mountain stood tall, with wind-carved cliffs so steep that the colors seemed about to drip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The mountain soil was rich with jade-infused steel, entirely displaying a jade-blue color. From a distance, it resembled a giant wearing a jade coat, magnificent and grand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Mountain streams meandered, like a gentle guqin being softly plucked, creating a melodious sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Mountain stones were hard and crystal-clear, sparkling with radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The mountain's exposed mineral beds were layered, with veins crisscrossing, incredibly rich. The mine tunnels were deep and complex, extending like a massive network into the mountain's depths, with mine lights flickering like scattered stars. Miners worked like ants, digging tirelessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Halfway up the mountain was the Jade Steel Mountain Town, with high city walls and watchtowers standing everywhere. Since the defeat of Meng Zizhong's heavy troops at the Misty Mountain, the landscape here had undergone earth-shattering changes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Now, many cultivators patrolled day and night, taking turns on guard, with defenses much stricter than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">At this moment, Han Zhou was in a small courtyard in the mountain town, gazing at the billowing smoke in the half-sky, produced by the furnaces operating non-stop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The furnace fires blazed, burning ceaselessly through the night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Master Han Zhou, everyone has arrived," an elderly man pushed open the courtyard door and walked in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Han Zhou nodded: "Please everyone come in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Instantly, a large group of Ning family branch members surged into the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Han Zhou swept his gaze across them, seeing about twenty to thirty Ning family members, all at the Qi Refinement stage. Some were young, some were elderly, but regardless of age, their eyes all contained a certain light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Han Zhou, who had experienced many hardships, had seen cultivators of various levels, and he particularly liked the light in everyone's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Because he knew this light represented hope for the future, an anticipation of happiness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He sat cross-legged directly on the grass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Ning family members looked at each other, and soon they all imitated Han Zhou, sitting cross-legged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Han Zhou: "Next, I will transmit the Bitter Cold Scripture to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He was quite direct, getting straight to the point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">These Ning family members immediately listened attentively, fully concentrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">After Han Zhou finished transmitting the scripture, most remained silent, with some closing their eyes, wracking their brains, trying to comprehend fully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning You Fu, standing to the side, watched the entire process with a slight smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Han Zhou transmitted the cultivation method directly, covering the Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment stages, very straightforwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning You Fu, although not intending to cultivate it himself, understood that this Bitter Cold Scripture was extremely sophisticated, no less than the Ning family's main branch's top-tier Ice Heart Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">In the main family, branch members would have to dedicate most of their lives to accumulate merits to practice the Ice Heart Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">But here in the branch family, they had obtained such high-level treatment so easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Ning Zhuo, the clan leader, truly has methods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"This time, he actually sent such a powerful expert specifically to teach scripture to our Ning family members."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Moreover, this time Ning Jiu's ancestor has actually come to Jade Steel Mountain and is receiving enthusiastic hospitality from the town leader daily. With his endorsement, our Ning family branch's reputation in Jade Steel Mountain will surge dramatically, making many things much easier."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning You Fu felt extremely excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo's move this time exceeded his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In fact, ever since becoming the branch family's clan leader, Ning Zhuo had repeatedly brought shocking developments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Originally, Ning You Fu was worried when Ning Zhuo left Fire Persimmon Immortal City to travel the world. Now it seemed that true talents couldn't be measured by conventional standards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"I was blind. How remarkable our clan leader is," Ning You Fu gazed at the azure sky, involuntarily imagining the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"With such a heaven-sent genius with extraordinary skills as our young clan leader, how could our family not prosper?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"I never expected that in my twilight years, I could follow such a person and have such a life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Young Master Ning Zhuo's advice was truly excellent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Sometimes, choice is more important than effort."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"This time, transmitting the scripture was so effortless, teaching twenty to thirty people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"According to our agreement, with Young Master Ning Zhuo's support, I will teach even more in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Thinking of Ning Zhuo, Han Zhou immediately felt admiration and a subtle sense of gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"No, that won't do."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Young Master Ning Zhuo's breadth of mind far exceeds ordinary people, truly noble and upright. I cannot just think of myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Theoretically, the Bitter Cold Scripture is very suitable for miners. But to be safe, I must go to the mine site and personally verify its effectiveness before I can truly feel at ease."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">With this thought, Han Zhou proposed this request to Ning You Fu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">In the letter to Ning You Fu, Ning Zhuo had explained that Han Zhou was a Foundation Establishment cultivator who came to transmit techniques and help establish reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Unexpectedly, Han Zhou was so proactive, wanting to verify the Bitter Cold Scripture's mining utility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning You Fu immediately expressed thanks and advised Han Zhou to rest after today's scripture transmission, suggesting they could go tomorrow. After all, Han Zhou would be staying here for quite some time and there was no rush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Han Zhou firmly shook his head: "Master Ning, I'm from a peasant background. Before entering the cultivation path, I was even a beggar."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"The noble Young Master Ning Zhuo treats me as a bosom friend, never looking down on my background. From our first few meetings, he directly lent me the comprehension diagram to understand frost magic."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Please don't be too courteous with me. Transmitting scriptures is not tiring at all. If it is convenient for Master Ning, then let's go right now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Han Zhou was so straightforward that Ning You Fu couldn't close his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Han Zhou's temperament and character truly pleased Ning You Fu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning You Fu said: "Before Master Han Zhou, I'm not some elder. Just call me fellow cultivator. Since you're interested, let's go to the mine right now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The mine was not far from the mountain town. More precisely, a large number of mines were within the town's jurisdiction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The guarding cultivators, seeing Ning You Fu's token, immediately let them pass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Unlike the first time when Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong entered the mine, they had to pay a fee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Now, the Ning family branch controlled part of the mining rights and could be considered half-owners.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Han Zhou entered the mine tunnel, gradually going deeper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He activated the Bitter Cold Scripture to try mining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Soon, he abandoned mining tools and started digging with his bare hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">With the support of the suffering body technique, the more exhausted and injured he became, the more his physical abilities and strength were enhanced, and his movements became increasingly faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning You Fu, watching from the side, exclaimed excitedly: "What a great technique, what a great technique!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Our clan members generally lack magical tools and have low magical power. Practicing this technique not only helps with mining but also enhances cultivationâ€”killing two birds with one stone, truly marvelous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Han Zhou said: "Using magical tools for mining would be much more efficient than my bare-handed digging. However, when calculating costs, using magical tools would significantly increase magical power consumption."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Cultivators would need to draw from spirit stones mid-process to replenish magical power to continue."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Moreover, mining magical tools will suffer wear and tear, requiring periodic repairs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Calculating all this, my Bitter Cold Scripture is indeed quite suitable for mining."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Realizing this, Han Zhou relaxed and sighed: "It seems I have not let down Young Master Ning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">While speaking, he did not stop his movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Suddenly, there was a crisp cracking sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The stone wall he was digging suddenly cracked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The cracks spread instantly, causing a large section of the wall to shatter into pieces, revealing an opening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Han Zhou and Ning You Fu had already retreated more than ten steps, their hearts racing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Such changes could hide many dangers, and in serious cases, could even trigger a collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">As the dust settled, the mine tunnel remained stable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Han Zhou and Ning You Fu exhaled in relief, calming themselves before carefully exploring the opening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">A cultivator's divine sense was significantly hindered in mine tunnels, primarily because the precious materials scattered about blocked divine sense penetration, unlike ordinary soil that was easily permeated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">After their divine sense swept through the tunnel momentarily, both Han Zhou and Ning You Fu revealed joyful expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">After confirming safety, they descended through the opening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Soon, their vision widened as they entered an underground cavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Inside the cavern, many vines and weeds grew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The vines were thick and entirely yellow-brown. The weeds were sharp like swords, radiating a keen edge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"These Living Earth Vines and breaking stone grass," Ning You Fu said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Han Zhou, unfamiliar with these, asked for explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning You Fu explained that living earth vines buried deep in the ground could soften stone layers during growth, transforming them into soil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Breaking stone grass often grew alongside living earth vines, with grass blades so sharp they could split rocks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Because of this, ordinary mountain stones cannot exist here. Only minerals resistant to living earth vines and breaking stone grass can remain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">This did not require Ning You Fu's explanation, as Han Zhou could see for himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">This expansive underground cavern - its walls, top, bottom, left and right - was entirely composed of jade-infused steel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Moreover, the quality of these jade-infused steels was far superior to other locations, almost all in top-tier condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning You Fu's face showed immense joy as he looked at Han Zhou: "Fellow cultivator Han Zhou, you've arrived and immediately encountered such an opportunity. Veteran miners call such caverns 'treasure caves'. By my divine sense estimation, these jade-infused steels are at least a zhang thick, with a market value of at least 30 million low-grade spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Han Zhou couldn't help but be moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">By his understanding, a small Foundation Establishment cultivation sect (possessing one to three Foundation Establishment cultivators) would only earn about 4-8 million low-grade spirit stones annually.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The value of this mine cave exceeded half a year's profit of an ordinary Foundation Establishment sect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Mining is truly excellent," Han Zhou sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning You Fu continued detecting with his divine sense while laughing: "According to our branch family's rules, Fellow Cultivator Han Zhou, since you discovered this, you will receive a one-third share."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"10 million low-grade spirit stones?!" Han Zhou's eyes immediately widened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">His heart was stirred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Then, in his dantian's divine sea, the Cold Suffering true intent melted like snow under sunlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Han Zhou's expression immediately changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He firmly shook his head, a bitter smile on his face: "These are external objects. I do not need them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">At first, Ning You Fu thought Han Zhou was being polite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">After a few exchanges, Ning You Fu confirmed that Han Zhou truly did not want the reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">This elder of the Ning family branch couldn't help but take a deep breath, becoming even more impressed with Ning Zhuo's methods: "Oh my heavens, where did the clan leader find such a person. He's so perfect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"The Bitter Cold Scripture is so well-suited to mining. We can foresee that many clan members will give up mining rewards to improve their own cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"How amazing, this is truly amazing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Han Zhou suddenly turned his head, looking toward the southeastern wall of the cave: "Master Ning, there seems to be a different type of jade-infused steel one zhang and eight feet beyond here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Oh?" Ning You Fu's divine sense could only penetrate a limited area, and the latter half was quite blurry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning You Fu immediately used a magical tool, disregarding the significant magical power consumption, and dug a deep hole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">After a moment, he extracted a metal ore from the deep hole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The ore was a deep blue, with a slight bluish tinge, and its surface carried a faint silver-white light, like moonlight falling on a lake, with rippling brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The ore's surface was smooth as a mirror, cold to the touch, dispersing traces of a moon-like cool and clear atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning You Fu became excited: "This is Blue Moon Essence Steel, the essence of jade-infused steel, formed by the combination of jade-infused steel and moonlight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"It must be formed during perfectly clear nights without clouds, where light penetrates the cold air and seeps into the ore veins, accumulating and gradually taking shape over hundreds or thousands of years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"This is a Golden Core level mineral!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning You Fu looked at Han Zhou: "Fellow Cultivator Han Zhou, are you sure you don't want a share?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Han Zhou's expression became even more bitter, and he shook his head with difficulty: "No need, really no need."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning You Fu bowed respectfully, solemnly saying: "Fellow Cultivator, your noble character is rare in this world!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Please help me seal this location."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"We need to further detect the Blue Moon Essence Steel's reserves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"If the reserves are too large, it could cause significant complications and potential future troubles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Fortunately, our family's ancestor is here. I must report this immediately."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Han Zhou said: "Please go ahead, I'll keep watch here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning You Fu quickly left the mine cave, heading to the town center's mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Jiufan was currently drinking with the current town leader, Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Jiufan raised his wine cup to Zhu Xuanji again: "This time in my misfortune, thanks to Master Zhu's assistance in saving my life, I will forever remember this kindness!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Jiufan had previously been ambushed. Although he fought impressively, he knew in his heart that continuing to fight would be extremely dangerous. The opponents were well-prepared and might be specifically targeting him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Zhu Xuanji and Shen Ling Shu stood in the clouds, observing. Seeing that Ning Jiufan's techniques were exhausted and he was about to be overwhelmed, they decisively intervened. Not only did they break the formation and rescue him, but Zhu Xuanji also displayed shocking combat power, decisively killing three cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">His stunning battle prowess left Ning Jiufan deeply shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Zhu Xuanji, equally bold, was about to speak after emptying his wine cup when a attendant came to report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning You Fu entered the mansion, immediately saluting Zhu Xuanji and the current town leader, indicating he wanted to report something privately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Ning Jiufan led him to a side room, learned of the good news, and immediately rewarded Ning You Fu with two talismans, telling him to bring one to Han Zhou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Returning to the wine table, Ning Jiufan frankly shared the discovery of a mineral deposit containing Blue Moon Essence Steel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The current town leader and Zhu Xuanji were quite satisfied with the Ning family's transparency and lack of concealment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The atmosphere at the wine table became even more harmonious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">They exchanged cups, thoroughly enjoying themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">After the banquet, Zhu Xuanji came to see Shen Ling Shu, informing him about the unexpected mineral discovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Senior, if Ning Zhuo has established a life-thread connection with Han Zhou, with their qi intertwined, could this explain such good fortune?" Zhu Xuanji inquired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Shen Ling Shu took out the mysterious qi absorption bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The bag was bulging, filled with qi absorbed from Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Shen Ling Shu pondered: "I observe secretly every day. Ning Jiufan's qi has suffered significant loss, but still maintains a high level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"If there is indeed a life-thread connection, this would be the expected phenomenon!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
