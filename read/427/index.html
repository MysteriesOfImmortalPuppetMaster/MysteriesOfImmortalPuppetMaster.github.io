<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 427: Transmission of the Bitter Cold Scripture</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Jade steel mountain stood tall, with wind-carved cliffs so steep that the colors seemed about to drip.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain soil was rich with jade-infused steel, entirely displaying a jade-blue color. From a distance, it resembled a giant wearing a jade coat, magnificent and grand.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain streams meandered, like a gentle guqin being softly plucked, creating a melodious sound.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain stones were hard and crystal-clear, sparkling with radiance.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain's exposed mineral beds were layered, with veins crisscrossing, incredibly rich. The mine tunnels were deep and complex, extending like a massive network into the mountain's depths, with mine lights flickering like scattered stars. Miners worked like ants, digging tirelessly.<br/>
<br/>
Halfway up the mountain was the Jade Steel Mountain Town, with high city walls and watchtowers standing everywhere. Since the defeat of Meng Zizhong's heavy troops at the Misty Mountain, the landscape here had undergone earth-shattering changes.<br/>
<br/>
Now, many cultivators patrolled day and night, taking turns on guard, with defenses much stricter than before.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Han Zhou was in a small courtyard in the mountain town, gazing at the billowing smoke in the half-sky, produced by the furnaces operating non-stop.<br/>
<br/>
The furnace fires blazed, burning ceaselessly through the night.<br/>
<br/>
"Master Han Zhou, everyone has arrived," an elderly man pushed open the courtyard door and walked in.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou nodded: "Please everyone come in."<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, a large group of Ning family branch members surged into the courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou swept his gaze across them, seeing about twenty to thirty Ning family members, all at the Qi Refinement stage. Some were young, some were elderly, but regardless of age, their eyes all contained a certain light.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou, who had experienced many hardships, had seen cultivators of various levels, and he particularly liked the light in everyone's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Because he knew this light represented hope for the future, an anticipation of happiness.<br/>
<br/>
He sat cross-legged directly on the grass.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family members looked at each other, and soon they all imitated Han Zhou, sitting cross-legged.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou: "Next, I will transmit the Bitter Cold Scripture to you."<br/>
<br/>
He was quite direct, getting straight to the point.<br/>
<br/>
These Ning family members immediately listened attentively, fully concentrated.<br/>
<br/>
After Han Zhou finished transmitting the scripture, most remained silent, with some closing their eyes, wracking their brains, trying to comprehend fully.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu, standing to the side, watched the entire process with a slight smile.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou transmitted the cultivation method directly, covering the Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment stages, very straightforwardly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu, although not intending to cultivate it himself, understood that this Bitter Cold Scripture was extremely sophisticated, no less than the Ning family's main branch's top-tier Ice Heart Technique.<br/>
<br/>
In the main family, branch members would have to dedicate most of their lives to accumulate merits to practice the Ice Heart Technique.<br/>
<br/>
But here in the branch family, they had obtained such high-level treatment so easily.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, the clan leader, truly has methods."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, he actually sent such a powerful expert specifically to teach scripture to our Ning family members."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, this time Ning Jiu's ancestor has actually come to Jade Steel Mountain and is receiving enthusiastic hospitality from the town leader daily. With his endorsement, our Ning family branch's reputation in Jade Steel Mountain will surge dramatically, making many things much easier."<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu felt extremely excited.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's move this time exceeded his expectations.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, ever since becoming the branch family's clan leader, Ning Zhuo had repeatedly brought shocking developments.<br/>
<br/>
Originally, Ning You Fu was worried when Ning Zhuo left Fire Persimmon Immortal City to travel the world. Now it seemed that true talents couldn't be measured by conventional standards.<br/>
<br/>
"I was blind. How remarkable our clan leader is," Ning You Fu gazed at the azure sky, involuntarily imagining the future.<br/>
<br/>
"With such a heaven-sent genius with extraordinary skills as our young clan leader, how could our family not prosper?"<br/>
<br/>
"I never expected that in my twilight years, I could follow such a person and have such a life."<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo's advice was truly excellent."<br/>
<br/>
"Sometimes, choice is more important than effort."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, transmitting the scripture was so effortless, teaching twenty to thirty people."<br/>
<br/>
"According to our agreement, with Young Master Ning Zhuo's support, I will teach even more in the future."<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of Ning Zhuo, Han Zhou immediately felt admiration and a subtle sense of gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
"No, that won't do."<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo's breadth of mind far exceeds ordinary people, truly noble and upright. I cannot just think of myself."<br/>
<br/>
"Theoretically, the Bitter Cold Scripture is very suitable for miners. But to be safe, I must go to the mine site and personally verify its effectiveness before I can truly feel at ease."<br/>
<br/>
With this thought, Han Zhou proposed this request to Ning You Fu.<br/>
<br/>
In the letter to Ning You Fu, Ning Zhuo had explained that Han Zhou was a Foundation Establishment cultivator who came to transmit techniques and help establish reputation.<br/>
<br/>
Unexpectedly, Han Zhou was so proactive, wanting to verify the Bitter Cold Scripture's mining utility.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu immediately expressed thanks and advised Han Zhou to rest after today's scripture transmission, suggesting they could go tomorrow. After all, Han Zhou would be staying here for quite some time and there was no rush.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou firmly shook his head: "Master Ning, I'm from a peasant background. Before entering the cultivation path, I was even a beggar."<br/>
<br/>
"The noble Young Master Ning Zhuo treats me as a bosom friend, never looking down on my background. From our first few meetings, he directly lent me the comprehension diagram to understand frost magic."<br/>
<br/>
"Please don't be too courteous with me. Transmitting scriptures is not tiring at all. If it is convenient for Master Ning, then let's go right now!"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou was so straightforward that Ning You Fu couldn't close his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou's temperament and character truly pleased Ning You Fu.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu said: "Before Master Han Zhou, I'm not some elder. Just call me fellow cultivator. Since you're interested, let's go to the mine right now."<br/>
<br/>
The mine was not far from the mountain town. More precisely, a large number of mines were within the town's jurisdiction.<br/>
<br/>
The guarding cultivators, seeing Ning You Fu's token, immediately let them pass.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the first time when Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong entered the mine, they had to pay a fee.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the Ning family branch controlled part of the mining rights and could be considered half-owners.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou entered the mine tunnel, gradually going deeper.<br/>
<br/>
He activated the Bitter Cold Scripture to try mining.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, he abandoned mining tools and started digging with his bare hands.<br/>
<br/>
With the support of the suffering body technique, the more exhausted and injured he became, the more his physical abilities and strength were enhanced, and his movements became increasingly faster.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu, watching from the side, exclaimed excitedly: "What a great technique, what a great technique!"<br/>
<br/>
"Our clan members generally lack magical tools and have low magical power. Practicing this technique not only helps with mining but also enhances cultivation‚Äîkilling two birds with one stone, truly marvelous!"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou said: "Using magical tools for mining would be much more efficient than my bare-handed digging. However, when calculating costs, using magical tools would significantly increase magical power consumption."<br/>
<br/>
"Cultivators would need to draw from spirit stones mid-process to replenish magical power to continue."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, mining magical tools will suffer wear and tear, requiring periodic repairs."<br/>
<br/>
"Calculating all this, my Bitter Cold Scripture is indeed quite suitable for mining."<br/>
<br/>
Realizing this, Han Zhou relaxed and sighed: "It seems I have not let down Young Master Ning."<br/>
<br/>
While speaking, he did not stop his movements.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, there was a crisp cracking sound.<br/>
<br/>
The stone wall he was digging suddenly cracked.<br/>
<br/>
The cracks spread instantly, causing a large section of the wall to shatter into pieces, revealing an opening.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou and Ning You Fu had already retreated more than ten steps, their hearts racing.<br/>
<br/>
Such changes could hide many dangers, and in serious cases, could even trigger a collapse.<br/>
<br/>
As the dust settled, the mine tunnel remained stable.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou and Ning You Fu exhaled in relief, calming themselves before carefully exploring the opening.<br/>
<br/>
A cultivator's divine sense was significantly hindered in mine tunnels, primarily because the precious materials scattered about blocked divine sense penetration, unlike ordinary soil that was easily permeated.<br/>
<br/>
After their divine sense swept through the tunnel momentarily, both Han Zhou and Ning You Fu revealed joyful expressions.<br/>
<br/>
After confirming safety, they descended through the opening.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, their vision widened as they entered an underground cavern.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the cavern, many vines and weeds grew.<br/>
<br/>
The vines were thick and entirely yellow-brown. The weeds were sharp like swords, radiating a keen edge.<br/>
<br/>
"These Living Earth Vines and breaking stone grass," Ning You Fu said.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou, unfamiliar with these, asked for explanation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu explained that living earth vines buried deep in the ground could soften stone layers during growth, transforming them into soil.<br/>
<br/>
Breaking stone grass often grew alongside living earth vines, with grass blades so sharp they could split rocks.<br/>
<br/>
"Because of this, ordinary mountain stones cannot exist here. Only minerals resistant to living earth vines and breaking stone grass can remain."<br/>
<br/>
This did not require Ning You Fu's explanation, as Han Zhou could see for himself.<br/>
<br/>
This expansive underground cavern - its walls, top, bottom, left and right - was entirely composed of jade-infused steel.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the quality of these jade-infused steels was far superior to other locations, almost all in top-tier condition.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu's face showed immense joy as he looked at Han Zhou: "Fellow cultivator Han Zhou, you've arrived and immediately encountered such an opportunity. Veteran miners call such caverns 'treasure caves'. By my divine sense estimation, these jade-infused steels are at least a zhang thick, with a market value of at least 30 million low-grade spirit stones."<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou couldn't help but be moved.<br/>
<br/>
By his understanding, a small Foundation Establishment cultivation sect (possessing one to three Foundation Establishment cultivators) would only earn about 4-8 million low-grade spirit stones annually.<br/>
<br/>
The value of this mine cave exceeded half a year's profit of an ordinary Foundation Establishment sect!<br/>
<br/>
"Mining is truly excellent," Han Zhou sighed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu continued detecting with his divine sense while laughing: "According to our branch family's rules, Fellow Cultivator Han Zhou, since you discovered this, you will receive a one-third share."<br/>
<br/>
"10 million low-grade spirit stones?!" Han Zhou's eyes immediately widened.<br/>
<br/>
His heart was stirred.<br/>
<br/>
Then, in his dantian's divine sea, the Cold Suffering true intent melted like snow under sunlight.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou's expression immediately changed.<br/>
<br/>
He firmly shook his head, a bitter smile on his face: "These are external objects. I do not need them."<br/>
<br/>
At first, Ning You Fu thought Han Zhou was being polite.<br/>
<br/>
After a few exchanges, Ning You Fu confirmed that Han Zhou truly did not want the reward.<br/>
<br/>
This elder of the Ning family branch couldn't help but take a deep breath, becoming even more impressed with Ning Zhuo's methods: "Oh my heavens, where did the clan leader find such a person. He's so perfect!"<br/>
<br/>
"The Bitter Cold Scripture is so well-suited to mining. We can foresee that many clan members will give up mining rewards to improve their own cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
"How amazing, this is truly amazing."<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou suddenly turned his head, looking toward the southeastern wall of the cave: "Master Ning, there seems to be a different type of jade-infused steel one zhang and eight feet beyond here."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh?" Ning You Fu's divine sense could only penetrate a limited area, and the latter half was quite blurry.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu immediately used a magical tool, disregarding the significant magical power consumption, and dug a deep hole.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment, he extracted a metal ore from the deep hole.<br/>
<br/>
The ore was a deep blue, with a slight bluish tinge, and its surface carried a faint silver-white light, like moonlight falling on a lake, with rippling brilliance.<br/>
<br/>
The ore's surface was smooth as a mirror, cold to the touch, dispersing traces of a moon-like cool and clear atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu became excited: "This is Blue Moon Essence Steel, the essence of jade-infused steel, formed by the combination of jade-infused steel and moonlight."<br/>
<br/>
"It must be formed during perfectly clear nights without clouds, where light penetrates the cold air and seeps into the ore veins, accumulating and gradually taking shape over hundreds or thousands of years."<br/>
<br/>
"This is a Golden Core level mineral!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu looked at Han Zhou: "Fellow Cultivator Han Zhou, are you sure you don't want a share?"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou's expression became even more bitter, and he shook his head with difficulty: "No need, really no need."<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu bowed respectfully, solemnly saying: "Fellow Cultivator, your noble character is rare in this world!"<br/>
<br/>
"Please help me seal this location."<br/>
<br/>
"We need to further detect the Blue Moon Essence Steel's reserves."<br/>
<br/>
"If the reserves are too large, it could cause significant complications and potential future troubles."<br/>
<br/>
"Fortunately, our family's ancestor is here. I must report this immediately."<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou said: "Please go ahead, I'll keep watch here."<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu quickly left the mine cave, heading to the town center's mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was currently drinking with the current town leader, Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan raised his wine cup to Zhu Xuanji again: "This time in my misfortune, thanks to Master Zhu's assistance in saving my life, I will forever remember this kindness!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan had previously been ambushed. Although he fought impressively, he knew in his heart that continuing to fight would be extremely dangerous. The opponents were well-prepared and might be specifically targeting him.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and Shen Ling Shu stood in the clouds, observing. Seeing that Ning Jiufan's techniques were exhausted and he was about to be overwhelmed, they decisively intervened. Not only did they break the formation and rescue him, but Zhu Xuanji also displayed shocking combat power, decisively killing three cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
His stunning battle prowess left Ning Jiufan deeply shocked.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, equally bold, was about to speak after emptying his wine cup when a attendant came to report.<br/>
<br/>
Ning You Fu entered the mansion, immediately saluting Zhu Xuanji and the current town leader, indicating he wanted to report something privately.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan led him to a side room, learned of the good news, and immediately rewarded Ning You Fu with two talismans, telling him to bring one to Han Zhou.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the wine table, Ning Jiufan frankly shared the discovery of a mineral deposit containing Blue Moon Essence Steel.<br/>
<br/>
The current town leader and Zhu Xuanji were quite satisfied with the Ning family's transparency and lack of concealment.<br/>
<br/>
The atmosphere at the wine table became even more harmonious.<br/>
<br/>
They exchanged cups, thoroughly enjoying themselves.<br/>
<br/>
After the banquet, Zhu Xuanji came to see Shen Ling Shu, informing him about the unexpected mineral discovery.<br/>
<br/>
"Senior, if Ning Zhuo has established a life-thread connection with Han Zhou, with their qi intertwined, could this explain such good fortune?" Zhu Xuanji inquired.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Ling Shu took out the mysterious qi absorption bag.<br/>
<br/>
The bag was bulging, filled with qi absorbed from Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Ling Shu pondered: "I observe secretly every day. Ning Jiufan's qi has suffered significant loss, but still maintains a high level."<br/>
<br/>
"If there is indeed a life-thread connection, this would be the expected phenomenon!"</div>
