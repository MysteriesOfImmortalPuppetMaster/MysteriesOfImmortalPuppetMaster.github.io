<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">When Ning Zhuo saw the head of the Jiao Clan at the door, a headache set in instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">For now, it was still necessary to maintain the identity of “Jiao Ma.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">His grudge with the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth ran too deep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">If his true identity were exposed, the two would undoubtedly come for him. And with both being Nascent Soul cultivators, if they joined forces to corner him, how would he - stripped of his military position - still handle affairs in White Paper Immortal City? How would he ever join the Myriad Manifestations Sect?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“That said, if I can get into the Myriad Manifestations Sect, that super-sect could serve as an excellent shield.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">But that was still a long way off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">For now, Ning Zhuo would be staying in White Paper Immortal City for a while longer, and the disguise was necessary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Still, he had no desire to waste time with the Jiao Clan Patriarch. He blocked the doorway, face expressionless. “Not long ago, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was assassinated and killed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“I’m avoiding contact with all suspicious individuals as much as possible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Patriarch’s face flushed red with anger. “I’m your father! And you suspect me?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo’s expression didn’t change. “The traitor within the city is exceptionally skilled at disguise. As long as I remain inside this threshold, the formation still offers protection. Whatever you came to say, make it brief.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Jiao Clan Patriarch hadn’t expected this kind of reception from the son he’d come specifically to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Fine. Fine.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He forced down his rage. “My son, I know you’re still angry with me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“But everything we asked of you - was for the sake of the clan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Your two older brothers… both lost their primordial yang. To serve the City Lord like that, in such a diminished state - it would’ve been a grave offense!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“You’re the only one who’s truly suitable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo cut him off. “Do you have anything else? I’m quite busy right now - cultivating on one hand, investigating for the City Lord on the other.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sensing he was being dismissed, the Patriarch did his best to squeeze a smile onto his face. “My son, I’m truly proud that you overcame adversity by your own strength.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“You’ve brought honor to our Jiao bloodline. Misfortune turned to fortune - now even the City Lord holds you in high regard.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“That’s why I came.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Whatever you need for your investigation, just ask. Our clan will support you with everything we have.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred - he caught the hidden meaning instantly. “How many people did the clan send this time?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Patriarch didn’t hold back. “Eighty percent. Another ten percent left the Black Swamp, and the final ten - just the old, weak, and infirm - remained behind to guard the ancestral grounds.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">It was standard practice for a cultivation clan to split up in times of calamity, preserving their bloodline.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">But sending eighty percent… that was an extreme commitment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Eighty percent?” Ning Zhuo looked at the Patriarch, a bit surprised at the man’s boldness. That was practically throwing everything into supporting White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Patriarch’s face turned grim. “It was a decision made after days of deliberation with the clan elders.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“The living and the dead walk separate paths. No matter how many ghost creatures pour in from the underworld, they rarely surpass the Nascent Soul stage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“White Paper Immortal City has stood here for so long - it won’t fall to a ghost tide.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Of course, there’s another reason.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“The City Lord’s latest decree offers generous rewards to every cultivator who comes to aid the city. I’ve never seen such an extravagant bounty in my life!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Once again, Ning Zhuo caught the hidden meaning. “Heavy rewards bring bold warriors. If White Paper Immortal City is emptying its coffers, it must mean they expect you to risk your lives.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Of course. That’s exactly what it is - hazard pay,” the Jiao Clan Patriarch acknowledged without hesitation. “But at this price, I believe it’s worth it. We’ve already received orders: we’ll begin with covert training, then head out to engage the enemy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo frowned. “That ghost army may not be large, but it’s impeccably disciplined, acts with perfect coordination, and is bolstered by battlefield formations. How could you hope to win in open combat?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The patriarch laughed heartily. “My son, rest assured. We’re not facing them head-on. Our task is to launch ambushes, cut off their scouts, that sort of thing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo’s brows eased slightly. “A war of attrition, then.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He had battlefield experience - enough to know that, given the circumstances, this was the most White Paper Immortal City could reasonably do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Seeing that Ning Zhuo still cared for the clan, the patriarch’s earlier anger faded. Before leaving, he reminded him, “My son, the City Lord has summoned troops from nearly every town and village this time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Hidden Yang Manor will likely be packed. You’d best hurry and earn promotion to the Vigorous Yang Residence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“If I fall on the battlefield, and you can secure a place in the City Lord’s court, then the family’s future rests on your shoulders.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">At this, the patriarch sighed and took out a jade slip. “This contains our clan’s entire body of techniques, and this is the Patriarch’s Command Token. Keep them both safe. If things go badly, you may need these to revive the clan one day.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo didn’t reach for them. The patriarch simply placed the jade slip and token on the ground, then turned and left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Watching the scene unfold, Sun Lingtong remarked, “Not bad, Little Zhuo. You just earned yourself a hefty bonus.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Though Sun Lingtong was inside the ghost army’s camp, Ning Zhuo could transmit scenes from his surroundings to him through the Life Hanging by a Thread technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">So what Sun Lingtong saw was not much different from if he’d been soaring the skies beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo sighed. The patriarch’s final gesture stirred complicated emotions in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He couldn’t help but wonder: if his own father were still alive, and faced with such a situation, would he have acted the same way?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo was not Jiao Ma. From an outsider’s view, it was clear - the Jiao Patriarch had placed his son in the safest position available. It was a choice made for the sake of the clan, yes, but also one steeped in a father’s love.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">A thought surfaced in Ning Zhuo’s mind. “Boss, we’ve borrowed his son’s identity. I suppose that means we owe the Jiao Clan a favor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong raised an eyebrow. “Oh? And what do you want to do about it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“I’ve got the Patriarch’s token now. I can send swift messages to members of the Jiao Clan. Since you’re inside the enemy camp, how about gathering some intel? I’ll pass it along to them - help them avoid some casualties. It’s the least we can do.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Sun Lingtong shrugged. “It’s not like it’s any trouble. Sure, we’ll do it your way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo ran his fingers over his mechanical ring, then inspected the jade slip and token carefully. Once he was sure they were safe, he put them away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Besides the Jiao Clan’s cultivation techniques, the jade slip also contained a treasure map.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Before setting out, the clan had made preparations - dividing up their wealth and hidden caches in various locations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo had little interest in the treasure map. The Jiao Clan wasn’t that prestigious. Most of their assets had been distributed among their members. What was left likely wasn’t worth much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Nor was he especially curious about the cultivation techniques. After glancing through them briefly, he set them aside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He already had more than he could handle with the supreme methods from Three Sects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His body cultivation continued steadily, aided by the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">But soul cultivation - that was his true focus now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After all, possessing four Nascent Soul–grade soul artifacts was no small feat. And the Hungry Ghost Backlash Cauldron and the Underworld Punishment Codex were borrowed from the City Lord. Once he left White Paper Immortal City, he’d have to give them back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo's soul foundation surged at an alarming rate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Within the city, several night raids had been organized. Though they hadn’t shaken the enemy’s main camp, they had indeed caused trouble and casualties among the ghost troops. All in all, the results were decent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Wen Ruanyu came to see Ning Zhuo multiple times, urging him to investigate the traitor within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">But how could finding a traitor be that easy?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo was well aware of his own strengths - he wasn't cut out for this kind of detective work. Rather than waste time chasing shadows, he preferred to seize the opportunity before him and devote every second to cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But Wen Ruanyu was relentless. On one visit, he finally revealed what was on his mind: “The City Lord has entrusted you with a crucial task. How can you afford to slack off? If you press harder, dig up more intel, you might just uncover the spy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">So that was it. Ning Zhuo, through Sun Lingtong, had been feeding the Jiao Clan real-time military intelligence. Each time they launched a raid, they struck the weakest points of the ghost army’s formation. After doing this repeatedly, it was only natural that some sharp-eyed observer would begin to notice something strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">To Wen Ruanyu, it simply confirmed one thing: this “Jiao Ma” wasn’t really Jiao Ma at all. The City Lord had assigned him to investigate the spy precisely because of his uncanny ability to gather intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo, annoyed by the constant prodding, deflected with a few perfunctory replies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But Wen Ruanyu was deeply invested in the survival of White Paper Immortal City. He wouldn't be brushed off so easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After a moment of thought, Ning Zhuo offered a suggestion: “Senior Wen, there's no need to be so anxious. Whether or not White Paper Immortal City survives this ghost tide ultimately doesn’t hinge on the traitor. The key lies with our City Lord.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“So long as she recovers, if she can purge the excess yin energy in her body and regain the ability to move freely - then with the power of this city behind her, who could possibly take us down?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Wen Ruanyu nodded. “You’re not wrong. But the problem is, she’s still in this condition right now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo fixed him with a steady gaze. “Senior Wen, I don’t believe a place like White Paper Immortal City wouldn’t have prepared a contingency plan for this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Wen Ruanyu hesitated briefly, then transmitted his voice directly to Ning Zhuo. “Very well. You’re already the Vice City Lord now. It’s only right that you know.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He laid out the plan, succinct and to the point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo’s eyes flickered with surprise. “The Golden Swallow Trident?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong learned of it at nearly the same moment and chuckled to himself. “Little Zhuo, that treasure’s name feels like fate. It’s practically made to go with our Sky Iron Heroic Armor. It was meant to be ours!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The plan was simple. Find a compatible cultivator and have the Golden Swallow Trident recognize them as its master. Then, harness its immense yang energy to purge the City Lord’s overwhelming yin, thereby restoring a measure of her mobility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Once her burden lightened enough, the City Lord would be able to act again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Wen Ruanyu sighed. “Originally, Master Jin Yangzi was the best candidate for the task.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“He was planted here by the White-Haired Dragon Lord. We all knew it, but for the greater good, we held our tongues.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Unfortunately, the traitor moved first and took him out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo said, “So the traitor knew about this plan as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Wen Ruanyu replied, “The Golden Swallow Trident’s existence has long been known among the upper ranks. In fact, it serves as a symbol of hope, a way to steady morale and inspire confidence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo clapped his hands. “In that case, why don’t we use it to lay a trap?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“If we waste time chasing leads all over the city, it’ll not only be dangerous, but if the enemy floods us with fake clues, we’ll be running in circles. Isn’t that exactly what they want?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Rather than let them run us ragged, we should stay put and cast a net. Let them come to us!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Wen Ruanyu was convinced. He nodded slightly. “You make a good point.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo said, “But before anything else, move me into the Vigorous Yang Manor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Recently, too many human men had been taken into the Hidden Yang Manor, and the place had grown loud and chaotic - completely unsuitable for cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“That’s easy enough!” Wen Ruanyu agreed at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In truth, with his current status as Vice City Lord, Ning Zhuo could have arranged it himself without any trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Soon after, he was relocated smoothly to the Vigorous Yang Manor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The temperature there was noticeably higher than the rest of the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Deep underground lay a pool of Fire Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The main hall was called the Sunfire Temple. Behind it stood the Rising Sun Stele, and at the center of the front courtyard towered the Golden Crow Pillar, a blazing column that seemed to prop up the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo’s new residence was uniformly called the Hearthflame Quarters, and many of the furnishings were made from Fire Jade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The atmosphere, however, was far from friendly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">That very afternoon, while taking a walk, Ning Zhuo was cornered in the back garden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“You. Heard you were personally placed here by Lord Wen?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“Quite the connections, huh? But don’t get ahead of yourself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“I’m destined to be the master of the Golden Swallow Trident!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The one threatening him was Zuo Han, a cultivator whose left eye gleamed with a cold, silvery light like moonlight. His expression was stern and unyielding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Just as Ning Zhuo was about to respond, someone darted out from behind an ornamental rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">It was Yang Weida - an old acquaintance, someone from the same village.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Grinning, Yang Weida bowed and scraped before Zuo Han, doing his best to smooth things over for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Jiao Ma, you’ve finally risen up the ranks!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“That’s great news!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“We’re the same kind, aren’t we? We should be helping each other, showing all those old bastards who tried to keep us down. Let them watch with their beady old eyes as we succeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Then he looked intently at Ning Zhuo. “You finished the medicine I sold you, right? Want some more?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“That won’t be necessary,” Ning Zhuo said flatly, turning away without another word. He had no interest in getting tangled up with Yang Weida.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He had cultivation to do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">When it came to soul refinement, Ning Zhuo remained tireless in his practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">As for the trap they were laying around the Golden Swallow Trident, Wen Ruanyu had taken full charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo, content to let things unfold, had become a hands-off overseer and was enjoying a period of relative peace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Until a certain girl arrived - and shattered that peace entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Her skin had a bluish tint, with dark green spiral markings at her joints. On her elbows and knees, patches of skin had hardened into scale-like keratin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Two short, spiral horns rose from her brow, like twin bronze sickles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">She wore tight-fitting leather armor that accentuated her curves - full chest, shapely hips, and a slim waist that emphasized the exaggerated arc of her silhouette.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The girl came straight to him, locking eyes with Ning Zhuo, her gaze intense and burning. “Little Ma, you still love me, don’t you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo immediately understood - this must be Qing Chi, the daughter of Qing Qan. She was the ghost-tribe girl who’d once been in love with Jiao Ma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">His head throbbed. He shook it, expression cold. “What’s the point in talking about love now? Just leave. And don’t come back. From now on, let’s pretend we never met.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The girl stepped back, her face pale. Clutching her chest, she looked utterly devastated. “Little Ma… how could you be so cruel? Your words cut like knives!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">“I don’t believe you!” she cried, shaking her head. Her eyes, equal parts desperate and resolute, bore into Ning Zhuo’s. “You still love me. You’re just lying to yourself!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
