<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The Old Stone Monster originated from a chunk of ten-thousand-year earth essence; he himself did not possess any divine abilities.<br/>
<br/>
The "Stone Forging Earth Treasure" divine ability was acquired after it swallowed a fragment of the "Treasure Dividing Rock" and then cultivated over a long period.<br/>
<br/>
This was extremely difficult!<br/>
<br/>
Existences like earth essences and fire essences had it even harder to enter the Dao than demonic beasts and spiritual plants.<br/>
<br/>
They needed at least ten thousand years of accumulation to have the possibility of entering the Dao.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the ten-thousand-year fire essence in Fire Persimmon Mountain only barely touched the threshold of cultivation after absorbing the spirituality that scattered when cultivators fell. Such opportunities were extremely rare for normal earth and fire essences.<br/>
<br/>
The "Treasure Dividing Rock" was rumored to be one of the supreme treasures of the earth-attribute.<br/>
<br/>
A poem testified:<br/>
<br/>
<div style=" padding: 8px; font-style: italic;">"Gray-white rock seems without light,<br/>
<br/>
Concealing treasure aura that illuminates all directions.<br/>
<br/>
Billions of merits deeply accumulated,<br/>
<br/>
Thick accumulation leads to thin release, responding to heavenly blessings."</div><br/>
<br/>
The Old Stone Monster attempted to break through the bottleneck at the Nascent Soul stage, aiming to advance to the Soul Formation level.<br/>
<br/>
He failed in his breakthrough, causing the "Stone Forging Earth Treasure" divine ability to remain continuously active, which was a rather unexpected situation.<br/>
<br/>
However, it was precisely because the "Stone Forging Earth Treasure" divine ability continued to emit power, just like a teacher constantly demonstrating his most adept skill.<br/>
<br/>
This gave Ning Zhuo a very precious opportunity to observe and learn.<br/>
<br/>
If most cultivators faced this opportunity, they could only stare blankly, unable to grasp it.<br/>
<br/>
Only those with a certain standard in the earth-element realm would have the possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's Five Elements realm was quite profound, so he had the qualification to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Before this, when he treated Sun Lingtong's injuries, he had gained great inspiration from Zhang Zhongyi.<br/>
<br/>
Since Zhang Zhongyi could use silver needles and silk threads to establish a "suspended thread pulse-taking," building a bridge to help an outsider like Ning Zhuo perceive the principles of petrification,<br/>
<br/>
Then, naturally, Ning Zhuo could use his divine ability "Life Hanging by a Thread" and his own mechanism staff heads to achieve the same effect.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to medical skills, Ning Zhuo was more proficient in mechanism arts. These staff heads could be a replacement for silver needles, being just a little thicker than the needles.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, his divine ability "Life Hanging by a Thread" could establish a very mysterious connection, which was much better than the silk threads condensed by Zhang Zhongyi's magical power.<br/>
<br/>
It had to be said that Ning Zhuo was quite adept at learning.<br/>
<br/>
He seized this opportunity and learned a new divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
"Just as I expected!"<br/>
<br/>
"Since I can see through most of the Five Elements enlightenment diagrams in the world, I can naturally comprehend related Five Elements divine abilities."<br/>
<br/>
*Forming.*<br/>
<br/>
In Ning Zhuo's spiritual sea and dantian, the divine ability "Stone Forging Earth Treasure" was gradually taking shape.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the lotus flower form of "Life Hanging by a Thread," the form of "Stone Forging Earth Treasure" was a stone ball.<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo mastered this divine ability more deeply, the stone ball was gradually growing larger.<br/>
<br/>
The stone ball was simple and unadorned, quite similar to the current form of the Old Stone Monster.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo faintly had an insight ——when the divine ability "Stone Forging Earth Treasure" was completely mastered by him, its complete form would be a round and ancient stone ball.<br/>
<br/>
A feeling of joy welled up.<br/>
<br/>
"I mastered the divine ability 'Life Hanging by a Thread' through multiple explorations of the Lava Immortal Palace, constantly accumulating."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, by a stroke of luck, I might achieve it in one fell swoop and completely master the divine ability 'Stone Forging Earth Treasure'!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's mind continuously delved deeper, immersing in the various principles contained in the "Stone Forging Earth Treasure" divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
"Earth, deep burial, foundation, accumulation, quantitative change, qualitative change, the carving of time... sedimentation, continuous sedimentation."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was not only learning but also applying as he learned.<br/>
<br/>
With the help of the mechanism staff heads and "Life Hanging by a Thread," he infused magical power, consumed mental energy, and continuously pried open the tight defenses of the Old Stone Monster's corpse.<br/>
<br/>
If the stone ball was compared to a locked multi-layered treasure chest, then Sun and Ning's previous use of iron pickaxes to excavate the stone ball was like violently smashing the outer shell of the treasure chest.<br/>
<br/>
The inner defenses could not be broken violently unless Sun and Ning's attack levels reached the Nascent Soul level.<br/>
<br/>
Even if Ning Zhuo did not hesitate to endure backlash and used the big serpent scythe, the violent cracking would certainly cause a huge commotion.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning would have had to set up formations in advance to conceal it; this series of actions would be very troublesome.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's current action was like studying the structure of the lock and specially configuring a key.<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo gradually mastered the "Stone Forging Earth Treasure" divine ability, the impact of his configured key became more and more apparent.<br/>
<br/>
The pickaxe in Sun Lingtong's hand swung continuously, so fast that it almost formed a blur.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, at a certain moment, a qualitative change occurred.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong struck down with a pickaxe and successfully broke open the inner layer of the stone ball.<br/>
<br/>
"It's done, we did it!" Sun Lingtong felt extremely excited.<br/>
<br/>
A large amount of precious materials was excavated by him and directly stuffed into his arms. Sun Lingtong worked vigorously and soon became breathless.<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty of mining was still very high; his magical power, divine sense, and physical strength were greatly consumed. The cultivation method Sun Lingtong practiced mainly focused on the upper dantian, with little improvement in physique.<br/>
<br/>
During a break, Sun Lingtong turned back to look at Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't help but sigh in his heart: "It's useful, it's useful."<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo is becoming more and more excellent under my nurturing."<br/>
<br/>
"He will definitely become even more powerful in the future!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong couldn't help but envision the future. With Ning Zhuo's profound Five Elements realm, most Five Elements obstacles in this world would be broken by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"My brother and I, working together, might become famous worldwide by stealing together in the future."<br/>
<br/>
"Wow! The future is really something to look forward to."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt very excited just thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Ning Zhuo still couldn't succeed in one go; he had to stop halfway.<br/>
<br/>
A strong sense of fatigue enveloped his body and mind; his state declined extremely seriously.<br/>
<br/>
In his spiritual sea and upper dantian, the originally densely packed, mirror-like various mirror thoughts had almost dissipated completely.<br/>
<br/>
The essence and blood in his lower dantian were also consumed a lot; after all, maintaining the operation of his brain required it.<br/>
<br/>
The magical power in his middle dantian was consumed the least. Although Ning Zhuo had been continuously infusing magical power through "Life Hanging by a Thread."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo went into the "Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon."<br/>
<br/>
He came to the cultivation cabin, took out a meditation mat, and sat down cross-legged.<br/>
<br/>
He took out handfuls of spiritual food, stuffed them into his mouth, and meditated to replenish his state.<br/>
<br/>
First, he boosted the reserves of essence and blood, then operated the "Five Elements Qi Rhythm Technique" to replenish magical power.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the "Mirror Platform Spiritual Connection Technique" was the key.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took out the "Tranquil Mind Bell." Accompanied by the soft chime of the bell, Ning Zhuo immediately fell into a deep meditation state.<br/>
<br/>
Only top-level spiritual sea cultivation methods could so swiftly create specific thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
In his spiritual sea, a large number of mirror thoughts rapidly generated.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the "Mirror Platform Spiritual Connection Technique" demonstrated the value of a top-level cultivation method!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo still felt it was insufficient.<br/>
<br/>
"If only the Spirit Concealment Willow were by my side, I would comprehend the 'Stone Forging Earth Treasure' divine ability more easily and quickly."<br/>
<br/>
*Spirit Concealment Willow.*<br/>
<br/>
Under the willow tree, Hua Guzi, who was bending over to fertilize, straightened up in confusion and looked at the Spirit Concealment Willow.<br/>
<br/>
In Southern Bean Country, Ten Thousand Medicines Valley.<br/>
<br/>
In the forbidden area of the valley, many willow branches of the Spirit Concealment Willow suddenly trembled.<br/>
<br/>
She cast a spell to investigate but found nothing unusual.<br/>
<br/>
"But just now, I did feel the Spirit Concealment Willow shudder. What's going on?"<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, a passage was opened in the formation, and a young girl in a tender yellow dress walked in.<br/>
<br/>
It was Miss Lin Shanshan of the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect.<br/>
<br/>
"Why are you here again?" Hua Guzi saw Lin Shanshan, her face darkened, and she didn't even try to hide her strong hostility, which overflowed directly.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled: "This is an important place of my sect; of course, I have to inspect it from time to time."<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi sneered: "You just want to come here to recall someone. Hmph, before Ning Zhuo left, he asked me to take care of the Spirit Concealment Willow. You can go away!"<br/>
<br/>
"No wonder the Spirit Concealment Willow shuddered just now; it must not like you."<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi then came to the nearby ground spring.<br/>
<br/>
The ten-thousand-year water essence, which had transformed into fish in the pond, was startled, and immediately dissipated, merging with the pool water.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi pointed at the spring water: "These two ten-thousand-year water essences are also Ning Zhuo's. Look, they've been scared away by you."<br/>
<br/>
"Don't come again in the future!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan showed more smiles.<br/>
<br/>
She immediately heard the implied meaning in Hua Guzi's words: the Spirit Concealment Willow and the ten-thousand-year water essences all belonged to Ning Zhuo and had nothing to do with Lin Shanshan, which further implied that Ning Zhuo had nothing to do with Lin Shanshan.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan was angry in her heart, and the next moment she said something that made Hua Guzi grit her teeth: "I and Ning Zhuo are close friends who practice martial arts together. Naturally, I will help take care of his things."<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi sneered: "Practice martial arts? So impressive. I also sparred with Ning Zhuo." Lin Shanshan smiled: "But I was the first, even Han Zhou was after me. If I hadn't been grounded to help Ning Zhuo, temporarily losing my freedom, how could it have been Han Zhou's and your turn?"<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi's face sank, gritting her teeth: "It seems Miss Lin is very good at practicing martial arts. How about we two spar?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled even more, her tone carrying a chill: "What if I make you cry?"<br/>
<br/>
"Gugugu..." Hua Guzi tilted her head back, laughing in anger.<br/>
<br/>
She abruptly stopped laughing, glared at Lin Shanshan: "Come, let's go to the martial arts arena now!"<br/>
<br/>
The two female cultivators immediately left the important place in the valley, angrily heading to the martial arts arena.<br/>
<br/>
*Thousand Peaks Forest, Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.*<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly recovered and immediately flew out to see the stone ball again.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had been excavating, already sweating profusely.<br/>
<br/>
He had harvested countless precious materials of inestimable value. The more Sun Lingtong worked, the more energetic he became; the more tired he was, the more worthwhile he felt!<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo come out, Sun Lingtong immediately asked: "Little Zhuo, the further we mine, the harder it is; we can hardly chisel it. How long until you completely solve this defense?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo replied: "Boss, I have probably mastered thirty percent of the 'Stone Forging Earth Treasure' divine ability. In the next comprehension, I should be able to push it to sixty percent."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong chuckled, nodding repeatedly: "Good, good! Such progress even exceeds my expectations, very remarkable."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo showed no pride: "Alas, if only I had profound realms in body cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
"In that case, the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing' wouldn't trouble me."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said: "These days, I've been comprehending this method and have gained quite some insights."<br/>
<br/>
"The Embryonic Breathing Technique, on the surface, is not using the mouth and nose to breathe, as if one were still in the womb. The mouth and nose are just the portals of breathing; the dantian is the source of qi. The place where the sage starts is where the true one is stored, hence called fetal breathing."<br/>
<br/>
"But in fact, fetal breathing is to reach a state of mind and life of no thought and no action."<br/>
<br/>
"Fetus means root, beginning; calmness, unmoving, not shaking, no worries, no fears, no thoughts, no thinking, like a baby in the mother's womb."<br/>
<br/>
"Breathing means settling, stopping; the spirit and qi return to the root, and thoughts stop; the heart does not move, no coming, no going, no out, no in, naturally constant. The mind stays and does not move; this is called fetal breathing."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong talked about petrification.<br/>
<br/>
"Why does my petrified body, with the help of the Fetal Breathing Spiritual Boat, have miraculous effects in body refining?"<br/>
<br/>
"Precisely because the petrified body coincides with the state of calmness, unmoving, not shaking, no worries, no fears, no thoughts, no thinking, no out, no in."<br/>
<br/>
"The 'Stone Forging Earth Treasure' divine ability uses the earth to nurture treasures. The 'Embryonic Breathing Method' makes the cultivator themselves similar to an unborn fetus, receiving nourishment from heaven and earth. The two seem different but lead to the same goal."<br/>
<br/>
"Therefore, combining them produces a wonderful reaction."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's comprehension was not inferior to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
These days, to help Ning Zhuo burn the Fetal Breathing Spiritual Boat more quickly, he had been fully comprehending the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.'<br/>
<br/>
As a result, this action intended for others, unexpectedly helped him, greatly enhancing the foundation of his physical body.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Sun Lingtong's insights, Ning Zhuo immediately understood that Sun Lingtong's comprehension of the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing' was far above his.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, Sun Lingtong was not a body cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
But after thinking for a moment, Ning Zhuo understood.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was from the 'Void Sect,' bearing the Void mark. His understanding of the Dao of the Void / Nothing was deep, which was very similar to the state in the Embryonic Breathing Method. The spirit and qi return to the root, thoughts stop; the heart does not move, no coming, no going, no out, no in, which could be crudely understood as emptying the mind.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said: "Boss, I need to consult you more about this scripture."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said: "What are you talking about between us brothers? Once I fully comprehend it and confirm there are no mistakes, I'll teach it all to you!"<br/>
<br/>
The two smiled at each other and continued to work. With Ning Zhuo's assistance, Sun Lingtong immediately felt that the stone ball's defense became much more pliable.<br/>
<br/>
He dug with great enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually, he felt he couldn't dig anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong turned to look at Ning Zhuo, finding that the latter's eyes were closed, and his brows were slightly furrowed.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong thought: "It seems that the more completely the divine ability is mastered, the more the difficulty of learning increases!"<br/>
<br/>
"But this certainly won't stump Little Zhuo." Sun Lingtong was more confident than Ning Zhuo himself.<br/>
<br/>
But for a while, Sun Lingtong had nothing to do.<br/>
<br/>
The medicinal mud applied on his body gradually dried up, and the exposed skin rapidly petrified, much faster than what he experienced before.<br/>
<br/>
With a successful therapy, these Dao wounds instead became resources for his physical foundation growth.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong chuckled, unconcerned.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the stone skin on his body, Sun Lingtong suddenly paused, and a bold idea popped into his little head.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike Ning Zhuo, who always considered repeatedly and constantly reviewed his thinking habits, Sun Lingtong acted as soon as he thought.<br/>
<br/>
He stuck the Fetal Breathing Spiritual Boat onto the surface of the stone ball, then lay inside the boat.<br/>
<br/>
He chuckled, directly taking out the Fetal Breathing Spiritual Boat from the mechanical dragon.<br/>
<br/>
The stone skin gradually formed, quickly covering the Fetal Breathing Spiritual Boat.<br/>
<br/>
The boat trembled, revealing the full text of the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.'<br/>
<br/>
Just like when Ning Zhuo previously burned it with fire, this time, the Fetal Breathing Spiritual Boat, also to protect itself, activated all its power and entered the fetal breathing state.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong benefited from this, the essence of heaven and earth poured into his body, and his physique increased rapidly!<br/>
<br/>
Using it in such an unorthodox way, the efficiency exploded. Far more effective than the orthodox method, hundreds of times more!<br/>
<br/>
"Incredible, so incredible."<br/>
<br/>
"Continuing like this, I can pretend to be a body cultivator, hahaha." Sun Lingtong comprehended much of the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing,' immediately suppressing his joy, entering into the state of empty thought.<br/>
<br/>
In this way, it more closely fit the Fetal Breathing Great Method, and the essence of heaven and earth poured in like opening floodgates!<br/>
<br/>
Scenes and memories reached Sun Lingtong's mind.<br/>
<br/>
He was stunned for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
These scenes and memories all came from the Old Stone Monster!<br/>
<br/>
"I used his corpse to perform fetal breathing. He is dead and his Dao dissipated; the stone ball also returns to a part of heaven and earth."<br/>
<br/>
"I get the stone skin, and receive nourishment from heaven and earth; thus, I also incidentally received the residual memories of the Old Stone Monster."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong thought for a moment and immediately understood the reason.<br/>
<br/>
"Interesting, interesting!"<br/>
<br/>
The cultivation perspective of a ten-thousand-year earth essence really gave him a rare insight.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Outside the Thousand Peaks Forest, several figures gradually appeared.<br/>
<br/>
Master of the Demon Heart Cave, Master of the Blood Shadow Cave, and Master of the Black Abyss Cave!<br/>
<br/>
"Great Cave Master, the formation has been checked, ensuring no errors," the Demon Heart Cave Master respectfully said.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Abyss Cave Master, Lu Tu, was the Great Cave Master of the Six Cave Sect, the highest leader.<br/>
<br/>
"Once this formation is activated, it will prohibit earth escape and void teleportation. If the Old Stone Monster agrees to come out, he is sensible."<br/>
<br/>
The great war was imminent; he needed to rally all combat power to resist the army of the Two Notes Country.<br/>
<br/>
"If he doesn't agree, let him suffer a bit."<br/>
<br/>
Lu Tu's aura was vast, his face solemn, expression firm.<br/>
<br/>
The Old Stone Monster at the Nascent Soul level was considered a native of the Thousand Peaks Forest, a natural ally. How could he stand by and watch?</div>
