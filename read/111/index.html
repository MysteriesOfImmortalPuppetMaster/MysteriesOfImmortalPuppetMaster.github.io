<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 111: Moving with Ten Percent Ling Zhang</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Lava Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family‚Äôs carriage traveled down the street at a leisurely pace.<br/>
<br/>
Passersby quickly stepped aside.<br/>
<br/>
This was due to the large character "Ning" displayed on the carriage and flags, indicating it belonged to the esteemed Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
The carriage itself exuded multiple layers of magical artifact auras, suggesting a high level of importance and prestige.<br/>
<br/>
Even those who couldn't recognize these signs could see the grand procession ‚Äì the carriage was flanked by eight guards, four at the Qi Refining stage and four at the Foundation Establishment stage.<br/>
<br/>
From such a grand display, it was obvious even to a fool that an important member of the Ning family was inside.<br/>
<br/>
However, the one sitting inside was Ning Zhuo. <br/>
<br/>
Recently, the geniuses of the Qi Refining stage from the four major factions of Lava Immortal City had been targeted in a series of assassinations.<br/>
<br/>
This had severely shaken the factions, prompting them to not only tighten their cooperation but also to increase the protection of their respective geniuses.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, Ning Zhuo benefitted by being able to travel in such a high-specification carriage. <br/>
<br/>
Currently, he sat cross-legged inside the carriage, surrounded by floating clouds.<br/>
<br/>
The Foundation Establishment stage guards, using their divine senses to check on him, couldn't help but admire Ning Zhuo's diligence.<br/>
<br/>
Those who had been guarding him for some time gradually realized how hardworking and tenacious he was in his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
He seemed to have no time for leisure or relaxation, almost as if a formidable beast was chasing him, forcing him to keep up his pace lest he be devoured.<br/>
<br/>
The floating clouds could obscure the fluctuations from his Qi Refining, but even if they were exposed, it wouldn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivating to the limit required continuous refining to produce new mana for use.<br/>
<br/>
It was reasonable for him to use floating clouds to conceal his actions during every cultivation session.<br/>
<br/>
Considering his troubled and solitary upbringing and the recent assassination attempts, it made sense for someone to feel a profound lack of security.<br/>
<br/>
Using such actions to fill that sense of security was entirely reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
However, in truth, Ning Zhuo was controlling Yuan Dasheng!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had initially taken out the Gold-Blooded Battle Ape, Yuan Dasheng, and secretly placed it in Ning Ze's residence.<br/>
<br/>
Once he left the family compound and boarded the carriage, which attracted everyone's attention, he then subtly controlled Yuan Dasheng, activating it to start a separate operation.<br/>
<br/>
With the Mirror Platform Spirit Connection Technique, Ning Zhuo could constantly monitor Yuan Dasheng's surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
The imprint left by the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal allowed Ning Zhuo to control Yuan Dasheng even without his divine sense or puppet strings.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Yuan Dasheng itself had a certain level of sentience, able to comprehend relatively complex commands, which greatly increased the chances of success for Ning Zhuo's current plan.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng, disguised in a Cang Iron Man Armor, walked the streets as an ordinary cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
While Ning Zhuo rode in the carriage, Yuan Dasheng strolled down a nearby street, blending seamlessly with the passersby.<br/>
<br/>
Upon reaching the vicinity of Ning Zhuo‚Äôs courtyard, Yuan Dasheng quickly ducked into an alley and, ensuring no one was around, slipped into the sewers.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in the sewer, Yuan Dasheng touched a brick on the wall, activating a hidden teleportation array.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Ning Zhuo felt his control weaken as Yuan Dasheng was transported to the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
This was where Han Ming was being held, serving as Ning Zhuo‚Äôs transit point every time he visited the black market and where he had once stored his fire essence.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng approached the furnace.<br/>
<br/>
He opened his storage bag and threw all the items inside it into the furnace.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he closed the furnace door and infused it with spiritual power, gradually increasing its power.<br/>
<br/>
As the temperature rose, the fiery red glow dispelled the surrounding darkness.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Yuan Dasheng was still clad in the Cang Iron Man Armor, he sat cross-legged in front of the furnace and, with Ning Zhuo‚Äôs help, began to activate the Fire Burial Praj√±ƒÅ Spirit Dissolution Sutra! The spiritual power, following the method of the sutra, started to reveal its profound and mysterious abilities.<br/>
<br/>
The scarlet flames in the furnace rapidly melted everything related to Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
From the flames, specks of pink light emerged, dancing gracefully at the tips of the flames like snow.<br/>
<br/>
When the fire burial was complete and Yuan Dasheng opened the furnace door, these pink lights, lacking a vessel, instinctively flew towards him, filling his spirit.<br/>
<br/>
The original seventy-nine percent spirit quickly climbed.<br/>
<br/>
After a few breaths, some pink light particles hovered around Yuan Dasheng but couldn‚Äôt enter his body, eventually dissipating regretfully.<br/>
<br/>
This was because Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs spirit was now full!<br/>
<br/>
Ten percent spirit! <br/>
<br/>
This was a transformative milestone.<br/>
<br/>
From now on, Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs spirit could recover on its own, no longer relying solely on external supplements.<br/>
<br/>
"Excellent, excellent!" Ning Zhuo, sitting in the carriage, smiled, though he looked exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
It was his first time fully activating the Fire Burial Praj√±ƒÅ Spirit Dissolution Sutra, and he had done it through remote control.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, his soul was robust and his spirit vigorous.<br/>
<br/>
His Mirror Platform Spirit Connection Technique had already reached the sixth level, making it the standout among his three cultivation techniques.<br/>
<br/>
"Return the way you came," Ning Zhuo commanded.<br/>
<br/>
But the next moment, his smile froze.<br/>
<br/>
From Yuan Dasheng came a clear refusal!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: ?!!<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng, controlling the Cang Iron Man Armor, slowly stood up.<br/>
<br/>
He looked around in confusion, then examined his hands, feet, and body.<br/>
<br/>
He felt utterly bewildered.<br/>
<br/>
He no longer knew who he was or where he was.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly issued the command again!<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng felt a voice in his mind, telling him what to do.<br/>
<br/>
However, he chose not to follow this voice and instead placed his hand on his chest.<br/>
<br/>
Deep within him, a strong surge of anger and hatred, like a floodgate opening, burst forth violently.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Yuan Dasheng was overwhelmed by these intense emotions.<br/>
<br/>
He let out a low roar, a heartrending ape cry, which woke Han Ming in her cell.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming had been recuperating in recent days.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving, Ning Zhuo had loosened her restraints.<br/>
<br/>
Although she was still chained, her range of movement now covered half of the cell.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had also set up mechanisms to feed Han Ming at regular intervals.<br/>
<br/>
To accommodate her sanitation needs, he had added a wooden partition with a bucket in a corner of the cell.<br/>
<br/>
When the waste accumulated, a mechanism would activate, opening a floor tile and flushing the waste away with water.<br/>
<br/>
To prevent Han Ming from feeling lonely, Ning Zhuo had placed various books in the cell, covering a wide range of topics, to help her pass the time.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these provisions, Han Ming was nearing her breaking point.<br/>
<br/>
She yearned to see another being, even a cockroach would bring her some joy.<br/>
<br/>
So, when she heard the ape‚Äôs cry, she was initially terrified but then overjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
She rushed to the cell door, but the chain yanked her back, causing her to fall on the cold floor tiles.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting there, she screamed toward the door, "I'm here, I'm here! Master, is that you? Have you come?"<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng heard Han Ming‚Äôs voice but ignored it.<br/>
<br/>
The intense hatred vanished as quickly as it had appeared, like a layer of ice on the ocean‚Äôs surface.<br/>
<br/>
Beneath the ice lay the vast, deep waters of sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
This profound sadness engulfed Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs spirit, burying it deeply.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes, once mechanical and lifeless, now showed immense sorrow and grief.<br/>
<br/>
Moving slowly, his steps heavy, like a walking corpse, Yuan Dasheng used the teleportation array to leave the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming was left behind, still crying out desperately.<br/>
<br/>
She struggled against the iron chain, trying to resist the returning silence of the dungeon. "Please, master, are you out there?" she pleaded. "Please, I don't want to be locked up anymore! I'll do anything, just let me out. I can't take it anymore, I really can't! Boohoo‚Ä¶." Han Ming broke down completely.<br/>
<br/>
The underground base returned to its eerie calm, like a despairing force gripping her throat.<br/>
<br/>
She cried for a long time until she finally passed out.<br/>
<br/>
Through Yuan Dasheng, Ning Zhuo sensed Han Ming‚Äôs distress, but he could no longer deal with it!<br/>
<br/>
"Yuan Dasheng, stop, halt! Return the way you came, return the way you came!!" Ning Zhuo tried to communicate strongly with Yuan Dasheng through the Mirror Terrace Spirit Communication Technique.<br/>
<br/>
But it was no use! Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs spirit rejected the command. "A fully developed spirit! I never expected such a downside!" Ning Zhuo in the carriage was extremely anxious.<br/>
<br/>
If Yuan Dasheng was exposed, it would point directly to his fatal flaw.<br/>
<br/>
Heart Seal! My Buddha Heart Demon Seal!!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo closed his eyes tightly, fully responding to the precious seal, causing two streams of blood to quickly flow from his nose. <br/>
<br/>
It was no use.<br/>
<br/>
He was only at the Qi Refining stage and could only draw out a tiny bit of the seal‚Äôs power.<br/>
<br/>
The distance between him and Yuan Dasheng was too far, and as Yuan Dasheng moved on his own, the distance was increasing.<br/>
<br/>
Even using the Heart Seal only made Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs movements stiffen and slow down a bit, but it couldn‚Äôt exert a decisive influence.<br/>
<br/>
Through the Mirror Terrace Spirit Communication Technique, Ning Zhuo saw Yuan Dasheng leave the sewer, exit the alley, and enter a busy street with constant pedestrian traffic. <br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Ning Zhuo felt an impulse to jump off the carriage and run directly to Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
But he quickly suppressed this foolish idea.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúCalm down, calm down.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs breathing steadied, and his eyes were filled with cold light.<br/>
<br/>
He told himself to stay calm, and surprisingly, he adjusted his mindset in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
The efficiency was so high that even he was a bit surprised.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly assessed the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng was covered in the Iron Hide Armor, appearing as an ordinary cultivator rather than a monkey.<br/>
<br/>
This wouldn‚Äôt attract attention in Lava Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúThe situation isn‚Äôt the worst yet.‚Äù <br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúEmotions have strong impact but aren‚Äôt lasting. The previous rage and hatred were replaced by sadness.‚Äù <br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúOnce the emotions subside to a certain extent, my control over Yuan Dasheng will return.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúOn the contrary, if I lose my composure and jump off the carriage to run to Yuan Dasheng, that would be the biggest mistake.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
In the floating clouds, Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and completely calmed down. <br/>
<br/>
With so many guards protecting him, he needed to continue heading to the Zheng family.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúEven if Yuan Dasheng is exposed, I still have a last resort.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis sudden change isn‚Äôt as serious as the crisis of changing the leaderboard name and plotting to kill Yuan Dasheng.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Since the explosion at the Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo has rapidly grown.<br/>
<br/>
It‚Äôs not just his cultivation but also his mindset. <br/>
<br/>
Difficulties, challenges, and the pressure of death have made him shed his mortal shell, gaining a hint of a strong person's demeanor.</div>
