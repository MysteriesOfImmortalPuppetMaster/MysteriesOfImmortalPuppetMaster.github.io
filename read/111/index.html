<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 111: Moving with Ten Percent Ling Zhang</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Ning family’s carriage traveled down the street at a leisurely pace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Passersby quickly stepped aside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This was due to the large character "Ning" displayed on the carriage and flags, indicating it belonged to the esteemed Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The carriage itself exuded multiple layers of magical artifact auras, suggesting a high level of importance and prestige.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Even those who couldn't recognize these signs could see the grand procession – the carriage was flanked by eight guards, four at the Qi Refining stage and four at the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">From such a grand display, it was obvious even to a fool that an important member of the Ning family was inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">However, the one sitting inside was Ning Zhuo. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Recently, the geniuses of the Qi Refining stage from the four major factions of Lava Immortal City had been targeted in a series of assassinations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This had severely shaken the factions, prompting them to not only tighten their cooperation but also to increase the protection of their respective geniuses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">As a result, Ning Zhuo benefitted by being able to travel in such a high-specification carriage. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Currently, he sat cross-legged inside the carriage, surrounded by floating clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Foundation Establishment stage guards, using their divine senses to check on him, couldn't help but admire Ning Zhuo's diligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Those who had been guarding him for some time gradually realized how hardworking and tenacious he was in his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He seemed to have no time for leisure or relaxation, almost as if a formidable beast was chasing him, forcing him to keep up his pace lest he be devoured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The floating clouds could obscure the fluctuations from his Qi Refining, but even if they were exposed, it wouldn't matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Cultivating to the limit required continuous refining to produce new mana for use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">It was reasonable for him to use floating clouds to conceal his actions during every cultivation session.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Considering his troubled and solitary upbringing and the recent assassination attempts, it made sense for someone to feel a profound lack of security.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Using such actions to fill that sense of security was entirely reasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">However, in truth, Ning Zhuo was controlling Yuan Dasheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo had initially taken out the Gold-Blooded Battle Ape, Yuan Dasheng, and secretly placed it in Ning Ze's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Once he left the family compound and boarded the carriage, which attracted everyone's attention, he then subtly controlled Yuan Dasheng, activating it to start a separate operation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">With the Mirror Platform Spirit Connection Technique, Ning Zhuo could constantly monitor Yuan Dasheng's surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The imprint left by the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal allowed Ning Zhuo to control Yuan Dasheng even without his divine sense or puppet strings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Additionally, Yuan Dasheng itself had a certain level of sentience, able to comprehend relatively complex commands, which greatly increased the chances of success for Ning Zhuo's current plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Yuan Dasheng, disguised in a Cang Iron Man Armor, walked the streets as an ordinary cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">While Ning Zhuo rode in the carriage, Yuan Dasheng strolled down a nearby street, blending seamlessly with the passersby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Upon reaching the vicinity of Ning Zhuo’s courtyard, Yuan Dasheng quickly ducked into an alley and, ensuring no one was around, slipped into the sewers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Somewhere in the sewer, Yuan Dasheng touched a brick on the wall, activating a hidden teleportation array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The next moment, Ning Zhuo felt his control weaken as Yuan Dasheng was transported to the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This was where Han Ming was being held, serving as Ning Zhuo’s transit point every time he visited the black market and where he had once stored his fire essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Yuan Dasheng approached the furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He opened his storage bag and threw all the items inside it into the furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Then, he closed the furnace door and infused it with spiritual power, gradually increasing its power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">As the temperature rose, the fiery red glow dispelled the surrounding darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Even though Yuan Dasheng was still clad in the Cang Iron Man Armor, he sat cross-legged in front of the furnace and, with Ning Zhuo’s help, began to activate the Fire Burial Prajñā Spirit Dissolution Sutra! The spiritual power, following the method of the sutra, started to reveal its profound and mysterious abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The scarlet flames in the furnace rapidly melted everything related to Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">From the flames, specks of pink light emerged, dancing gracefully at the tips of the flames like snow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">When the fire burial was complete and Yuan Dasheng opened the furnace door, these pink lights, lacking a vessel, instinctively flew towards him, filling his spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The original seventy-nine percent spirit quickly climbed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">After a few breaths, some pink light particles hovered around Yuan Dasheng but couldn’t enter his body, eventually dissipating regretfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">This was because Yuan Dasheng’s spirit was now full!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ten percent spirit! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">This was a transformative milestone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">From now on, Yuan Dasheng’s spirit could recover on its own, no longer relying solely on external supplements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Excellent, excellent!" Ning Zhuo, sitting in the carriage, smiled, though he looked exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">It was his first time fully activating the Fire Burial Prajñā Spirit Dissolution Sutra, and he had done it through remote control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Fortunately, his soul was robust and his spirit vigorous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">His Mirror Platform Spirit Connection Technique had already reached the sixth level, making it the standout among his three cultivation techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Return the way you came," Ning Zhuo commanded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">But the next moment, his smile froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">From Yuan Dasheng came a clear refusal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo: ?!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Yuan Dasheng, controlling the Cang Iron Man Armor, slowly stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He looked around in confusion, then examined his hands, feet, and body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He felt utterly bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He no longer knew who he was or where he was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo hurriedly issued the command again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yuan Dasheng felt a voice in his mind, telling him what to do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">However, he chose not to follow this voice and instead placed his hand on his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Deep within him, a strong surge of anger and hatred, like a floodgate opening, burst forth violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In an instant, Yuan Dasheng was overwhelmed by these intense emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He let out a low roar, a heartrending ape cry, which woke Han Ming in her cell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Han Ming had been recuperating in recent days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Before leaving, Ning Zhuo had loosened her restraints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Although she was still chained, her range of movement now covered half of the cell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo had also set up mechanisms to feed Han Ming at regular intervals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">To accommodate her sanitation needs, he had added a wooden partition with a bucket in a corner of the cell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">When the waste accumulated, a mechanism would activate, opening a floor tile and flushing the waste away with water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">To prevent Han Ming from feeling lonely, Ning Zhuo had placed various books in the cell, covering a wide range of topics, to help her pass the time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Despite these provisions, Han Ming was nearing her breaking point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">She yearned to see another being, even a cockroach would bring her some joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">So, when she heard the ape’s cry, she was initially terrified but then overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">She rushed to the cell door, but the chain yanked her back, causing her to fall on the cold floor tiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sitting there, she screamed toward the door, "I'm here, I'm here! Master, is that you? Have you come?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Yuan Dasheng heard Han Ming’s voice but ignored it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The intense hatred vanished as quickly as it had appeared, like a layer of ice on the ocean’s surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Beneath the ice lay the vast, deep waters of sorrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">This profound sadness engulfed Yuan Dasheng’s spirit, burying it deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">His eyes, once mechanical and lifeless, now showed immense sorrow and grief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Moving slowly, his steps heavy, like a walking corpse, Yuan Dasheng used the teleportation array to leave the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Han Ming was left behind, still crying out desperately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">She struggled against the iron chain, trying to resist the returning silence of the dungeon. "Please, master, are you out there?" she pleaded. "Please, I don't want to be locked up anymore! I'll do anything, just let me out. I can't take it anymore, I really can't! Boohoo…." Han Ming broke down completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The underground base returned to its eerie calm, like a despairing force gripping her throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">She cried for a long time until she finally passed out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Through Yuan Dasheng, Ning Zhuo sensed Han Ming’s distress, but he could no longer deal with it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Yuan Dasheng, stop, halt! Return the way you came, return the way you came!!" Ning Zhuo tried to communicate strongly with Yuan Dasheng through the Mirror Terrace Spirit Communication Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">But it was no use! Yuan Dasheng’s spirit rejected the command. "A fully developed spirit! I never expected such a downside!" Ning Zhuo in the carriage was extremely anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">If Yuan Dasheng was exposed, it would point directly to his fatal flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Heart Seal! My Buddha Heart Demon Seal!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo closed his eyes tightly, fully responding to the precious seal, causing two streams of blood to quickly flow from his nose. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">It was no use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He was only at the Qi Refining stage and could only draw out a tiny bit of the seal’s power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The distance between him and Yuan Dasheng was too far, and as Yuan Dasheng moved on his own, the distance was increasing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Even using the Heart Seal only made Yuan Dasheng’s movements stiffen and slow down a bit, but it couldn’t exert a decisive influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Through the Mirror Terrace Spirit Communication Technique, Ning Zhuo saw Yuan Dasheng leave the sewer, exit the alley, and enter a busy street with constant pedestrian traffic. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">In an instant, Ning Zhuo felt an impulse to jump off the carriage and run directly to Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">But he quickly suppressed this foolish idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“Calm down, calm down.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo’s breathing steadied, and his eyes were filled with cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He told himself to stay calm, and surprisingly, he adjusted his mindset in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The efficiency was so high that even he was a bit surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He quickly assessed the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Yuan Dasheng was covered in the Iron Hide Armor, appearing as an ordinary cultivator rather than a monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">This wouldn’t attract attention in Lava Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“The situation isn’t the worst yet.” </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Emotions have strong impact but aren’t lasting. The previous rage and hatred were replaced by sadness.” </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Once the emotions subside to a certain extent, my control over Yuan Dasheng will return.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“On the contrary, if I lose my composure and jump off the carriage to run to Yuan Dasheng, that would be the biggest mistake.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">In the floating clouds, Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and completely calmed down. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">With so many guards protecting him, he needed to continue heading to the Zheng family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“Even if Yuan Dasheng is exposed, I still have a last resort.” “This sudden change isn’t as serious as the crisis of changing the leaderboard name and plotting to kill Yuan Dasheng.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Since the explosion at the Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo has rapidly grown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">It’s not just his cultivation but also his mindset. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Difficulties, challenges, and the pressure of death have made him shed his mortal shell, gaining a hint of a strong person's demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
