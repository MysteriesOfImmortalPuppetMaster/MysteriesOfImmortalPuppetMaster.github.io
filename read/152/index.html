<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 152: Ah Zhuo, You Are Amazing!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo, Ning Yong, Ning Chen, and others gathered in Room One.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Thank you all for your assistance this time! Ning Zhuo stands here to express his gratitude to the Ning family." The large-headed puppet Ning Zhuo stood in front of the first door, cupping his hands in thanks to the Ning family members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Ah Zhuo, there's no need to be so polite. If it weren't for your help earlier, how could I have reached the peak of the third layer so quickly?" "There's nothing to say. When I heard you needed help, I came right away."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"We were going to explore the Immortal Palace anyway. Ah Zhuo, feel free to call on me anytime in the future, and I'll definitely come." The Ning family members were very enthusiastic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Previously, Ning Zhuo had taken care of his classmates, helping them cultivate faster without asking for anything in return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In the process, planting the Life Hanging by a Thread was a small matter not worth mentioning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Of course, the Ning family's cultivators were so proactive also due to the internal dynamics of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The main and branch families had been at odds for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Ning family had always upheld a policy of strengthening the main branch while weakening the branches, leading to considerable discontent and resentment among the branch families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Many branch family cultivators, in order to advance, had to be used by the main branch, with few able to remain independent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo could be said to have emerged out of nowhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Not only could he remain independent, but he could also help others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The branch family members of the Ning family had long hoped for such a figure to appear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Although Ning Zhuo was only in the Qi Refining Stage, his talent was already widely known.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In the eyes of almost everyone, Ning Zhuo was a genius with a bright future!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Barring any unforeseen circumstances, as long as he grew smoothly, he would undoubtedly become a banner, a pillar, and a figure to rely on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Therefore, the branch family members of the Ning family had intentionally or unintentionally gathered around Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">On one hand, they were banding together for warmth; on the other hand, they were betting on the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This is the gamble of the righteous path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The weak usually do not allow themselves to be oppressed and controlled without resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">They will do everything they can to resist the strong, striving for more space to survive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Just like the three major families of Fire Persimmon City, unable to resist Meng Kui, they had to obediently follow orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">But as soon as Zhu Xuanji appeared and stirred things up, the three families immediately aligned with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">By doing so, they could use Zhu Xuanji to counterbalance the powerful Meng Kui, striving for more benefits for their own families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The three families flocked to Zhu Xuanji, and the branch family members of the Ning family generally supported Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">In essence, it was the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo scanned the room, seeing the high morale of the crowd, and couldn't help but nod slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This time, he had made up his mind to showcase his expertise in mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Dear family members, before we act, I need to make an agreement with everyone!" Ning Zhuo began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Next, we will combine together, with me as the main controller, manipulating both the spiritual power and your bodies. Only when casting spells do I hope for your cooperation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Ning family members immediately responded:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Understood!" "No problem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo thanked them again: "Thank you all for your understanding and support."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"If during this exploration of the Immortal Palace, anyone suffers losses or makes sacrifices, I will personally compensate you afterward." Pausing for a moment, Ning Zhuo continued with a deep tone: "To speak from the heart, our branch family members are not lacking in talent. Why are we always overshadowed by the main branch? Is it because we don't work hard enough?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"The truth is quite the opposite; we work even harder than they do!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"But all the resources are controlled by the main branch, and every member of the main branch receives obvious preferential treatment. Ning Xiaohui has talent, but I refuse to be overshadowed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"This exploration of the Immortal Palace is to use everyone's strength to show the main branch that our branch is also strong and resilient!" Ning Zhuo's pre-battle speech struck a chord with everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Hahaha, well said." "Exactly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Yong raised his arm and shouted, "I've long been annoyed by Ning Xiaohui. Brother Zhuo, we all follow your lead!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Alright, everyone, let's dismantle ourselves first." After Ning Zhuo finished speaking, he sat down on the ground and began to dismantle his leg components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The others followed suit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Moments later, they had all disassembled themselves and then reassembled into a large mechanical construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo's head was positioned at the highest point of the construct, commanding everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He first activated his spiritual power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The spiritual power swiftly traversed the combined body, constructing the operational trajectory of the third layer of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Everyone sensed this scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Some began to praise on the spot: "Ah Zhuo, you're amazing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Although we are all at the peak of the third layer, Ah Zhuo's mastery of the technique far surpasses mine." "Indeed, I have to admit it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo pushed his spiritual power to the peak, then suddenly opened the first door and squeezed himself into Room Two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">In an instant, countless long spears from both sides of the walls thrust forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Above, a giant hammer-like mechanical trap was activated, ready to fall and lock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">At this critical moment, Ning Zhuo remained calm, extending over twenty arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The long spears were precisely caught by these arms, then smoothly pulled out and turned into weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo's body gently rotated, and the left arms, following inertia, shot the spears into the holes in the right wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The right arms grabbed the spears and threw them into the traps on the left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">With just one rotation, the spear traps were neutralized by Ning Zhuo using their own force against each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The giant hammer trap came crashing down, but Ning Zhuo extended over twenty arms, simultaneously contacting the hammer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Using the rotational force from twisting his arms, he sent the hammer trap flying forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ahead, a massive net trap was triggered, rising from the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The net had just emerged when the hammer trap smashed into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">With a muffled thud, the hammer trap pressed down on the net, and the net neutralized the hammer's momentum, both coming to a halt midway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo maneuvered with over twenty legs, stepping over them with ease, and stood firmly in the elongated Room Two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Only at this moment did the others react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Damn, damn, damn!" This was Ning Yong's voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"What happened? What happened!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"We passed, just like that! Ah Zhuo, how did you do it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo smiled: "Dear classmates, during this period, I've been in seclusion, rigorously training in mechanical manipulation. I especially trained in controlling multiple mechanisms simultaneously, achieving multitasking. This trial is the moment to test my results!" As soon as he finished speaking, Ning Zhuo moved forward with over twenty legs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The others were about to praise Ning Zhuo but immediately fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Ning family's combined puppet moved like a bloated, massive caterpillar, with over twenty wooden legs moving in an orderly fashion, and over twenty arms either supporting, blocking, catching, or unloading, all working in perfect harmony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Massive wooden beams struck horizontally, either being leaped over by Ning Zhuo or blocked by the arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Some mechanical traps were triggered, but only a few legs were suspended, while the remaining long legs stood firmly outside the traps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo commanded the massive body, navigating through various obstacles and traps with the ease of flowing clouds and water, reaching the second door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"We passed, we passed!" The Ning family cultivators' puppet heads shouted in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">They had experienced it firsthand and felt deeply moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Many couldn't believe they had just passed the second checkpoint so easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The entire process was very simple, like walking on flat ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But everyone knew that this simple performance was backed by extraordinary skill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Ah Zhuo, you're so amazing!" "It's truly eye-opening."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"If I hadn't experienced it myself, I wouldn't believe it." "Our coordination was so seamless?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Nonsense, it's all thanks to Ah Zhuo's command!" Ning Yong's voice chimed in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo, however, showed no pride: "The upcoming battles are the key. Let's not talk for now. Everyone, follow my lead and claim the rewards. I have a plan." The Ning family's large puppet stood before the door, carefully selecting their rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Ah Zhuo, go ahead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Our legs, our arms, our heads are all at your disposal!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Ah Zhuo, charge, charge, charge!" The crowd's morale was high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo pushed the door open and entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">In the battle against numerous mechanical puppets, Ning Zhuo held back some of his strength, deliberately "sacrificing" a few companions to defeat all the mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"We won, we won!" "A glorious victory, truly magnificent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Ah Zhuo, you're amazing. How are you so adept at controlling mechanisms?" The answer was simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">In many places, Ning Zhuo made subtle adjustments, ensuring that every leg and arm moved precisely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">With precise movements, there was no mutual interference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The collective strength could be fully unleashed, leaving everyone in awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Of course, Ning Zhuo wouldn't answer this way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The young man laughed heartily: "Thanks to everyone's unconditional trust in me, allowing me to use you. Some classmates were sacrificed, which is my fault, my shortcoming. I will continue to train hard!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"My deepest apologies, everyone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The young man's humble and modest attitude made his classmates feel very comfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Not at all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Ah Zhuo, you're perfect, just a bit too modest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Do you know what you've accomplished? Such a brilliant performance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo laughed again: "Haha, stop praising me. We still have many more checkpoints to pass." He led the group into the preparation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">There, he disassembled himself and the others, returning them to their original forms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Why separate?" Many expressed reluctance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo explained: "During my recent seclusion, I thought of many things and came up with several ideas that can be realized here. Everyone, please trust me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Let me create some useful mechanical components for you, which will be very beneficial for the upcoming trials." With this explanation, the Ning family members all complied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Many wanted to watch Ning Zhuo's modifications, but at this moment, Ning Chen stepped forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Move along, move along, what are you all doing here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"These are Ah Zhuo's mechanical blueprints. We shouldn't look at them." "If we see them, would that be fair to Ah Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">His words left everyone speechless, and they all turned their gazes away, facing away from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
