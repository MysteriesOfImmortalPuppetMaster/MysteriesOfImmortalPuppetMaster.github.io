<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 152: Ah Zhuo, You Are Amazing!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, Ning Yong, Ning Chen, and others gathered in Room One.<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you all for your assistance this time! Ning Zhuo stands here to express his gratitude to the Ning family." The large-headed puppet Ning Zhuo stood in front of the first door, cupping his hands in thanks to the Ning family members.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah Zhuo, there's no need to be so polite. If it weren't for your help earlier, how could I have reached the peak of the third layer so quickly?" "There's nothing to say. When I heard you needed help, I came right away."<br/>
<br/>
"We were going to explore the Immortal Palace anyway. Ah Zhuo, feel free to call on me anytime in the future, and I'll definitely come." The Ning family members were very enthusiastic.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Ning Zhuo had taken care of his classmates, helping them cultivate faster without asking for anything in return.<br/>
<br/>
In the process, planting the Life-Hanging Thread was a small matter not worth mentioning.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the Ning family's cultivators were so proactive also due to the internal dynamics of the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
The main and branch families had been at odds for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family had always upheld a policy of strengthening the main branch while weakening the branches, leading to considerable discontent and resentment among the branch families.<br/>
<br/>
Many branch family cultivators, in order to advance, had to be used by the main branch, with few able to remain independent.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could be said to have emerged out of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
Not only could he remain independent, but he could also help others.<br/>
<br/>
The branch family members of the Ning family had long hoped for such a figure to appear.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo was only in the Qi Refining Stage, his talent was already widely known.<br/>
<br/>
In the eyes of almost everyone, Ning Zhuo was a genius with a bright future!<br/>
<br/>
Barring any unforeseen circumstances, as long as he grew smoothly, he would undoubtedly become a banner, a pillar, and a figure to rely on.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the branch family members of the Ning family had intentionally or unintentionally gathered around Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, they were banding together for warmth; on the other hand, they were betting on the future.<br/>
<br/>
This is the gamble of the righteous path.<br/>
<br/>
The weak usually do not allow themselves to be oppressed and controlled without resistance.<br/>
<br/>
They will do everything they can to resist the strong, striving for more space to survive.<br/>
<br/>
Just like the three major families of Fire Persimmon City, unable to resist Meng Kui, they had to obediently follow orders.<br/>
<br/>
But as soon as Zhu Xuanji appeared and stirred things up, the three families immediately aligned with him.<br/>
<br/>
By doing so, they could use Zhu Xuanji to counterbalance the powerful Meng Kui, striving for more benefits for their own families.<br/>
<br/>
The three families flocked to Zhu Xuanji, and the branch family members of the Ning family generally supported Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
In essence, it was the same.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo scanned the room, seeing the high morale of the crowd, and couldn't help but nod slightly.<br/>
<br/>
This time, he had made up his mind to showcase his expertise in mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
"Dear family members, before we act, I need to make an agreement with everyone!" Ning Zhuo began.<br/>
<br/>
"Next, we will combine together, with me as the main controller, manipulating both the spiritual power and your bodies. Only when casting spells do I hope for your cooperation."<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family members immediately responded:<br/>
<br/>
"Understood!" "No problem."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thanked them again: "Thank you all for your understanding and support."<br/>
<br/>
"If during this exploration of the Immortal Palace, anyone suffers losses or makes sacrifices, I will personally compensate you afterward." Pausing for a moment, Ning Zhuo continued with a deep tone: "To speak from the heart, our branch family members are not lacking in talent. Why are we always overshadowed by the main branch? Is it because we don't work hard enough?"<br/>
<br/>
"The truth is quite the opposite; we work even harder than they do!"<br/>
<br/>
"But all the resources are controlled by the main branch, and every member of the main branch receives obvious preferential treatment. Ning Xiaohui has talent, but I refuse to be overshadowed."<br/>
<br/>
"This exploration of the Immortal Palace is to use everyone's strength to show the main branch that our branch is also strong and resilient!" Ning Zhuo's pre-battle speech struck a chord with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha, well said." "Exactly!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong raised his arm and shouted, "I've long been annoyed by Ning Xiaohui. Brother Zhuo, we all follow your lead!"<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, everyone, let's dismantle ourselves first." After Ning Zhuo finished speaking, he sat down on the ground and began to dismantle his leg components.<br/>
<br/>
The others followed suit.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, they had all disassembled themselves and then reassembled into a large mechanical construct.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's head was positioned at the highest point of the construct, commanding everyone.<br/>
<br/>
He first activated his spiritual power.<br/>
<br/>
The spiritual power swiftly traversed the combined body, constructing the operational trajectory of the third layer of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone sensed this scene.<br/>
<br/>
Some began to praise on the spot: "Ah Zhuo, you're amazing!"<br/>
<br/>
"Although we are all at the peak of the third layer, Ah Zhuo's mastery of the technique far surpasses mine." "Indeed, I have to admit it."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pushed his spiritual power to the peak, then suddenly opened the first door and squeezed himself into Room Two.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, countless long spears from both sides of the walls thrust forward.<br/>
<br/>
Above, a giant hammer-like mechanical trap was activated, ready to fall and lock.<br/>
<br/>
At this critical moment, Ning Zhuo remained calm, extending over twenty arms.<br/>
<br/>
The long spears were precisely caught by these arms, then smoothly pulled out and turned into weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's body gently rotated, and the left arms, following inertia, shot the spears into the holes in the right wall.<br/>
<br/>
The right arms grabbed the spears and threw them into the traps on the left.<br/>
<br/>
With just one rotation, the spear traps were neutralized by Ning Zhuo using their own force against each other.<br/>
<br/>
The giant hammer trap came crashing down, but Ning Zhuo extended over twenty arms, simultaneously contacting the hammer.<br/>
<br/>
Using the rotational force from twisting his arms, he sent the hammer trap flying forward.<br/>
<br/>
Ahead, a massive net trap was triggered, rising from the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The net had just emerged when the hammer trap smashed into it.<br/>
<br/>
With a muffled thud, the hammer trap pressed down on the net, and the net neutralized the hammer's momentum, both coming to a halt midway.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo maneuvered with over twenty legs, stepping over them with ease, and stood firmly in the elongated Room Two.<br/>
<br/>
Only at this moment did the others react.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn, damn, damn!" This was Ning Yong's voice.<br/>
<br/>
"What happened? What happened!"<br/>
<br/>
"We passed, just like that! Ah Zhuo, how did you do it?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled: "Dear classmates, during this period, I've been in seclusion, rigorously training in mechanical manipulation. I especially trained in controlling multiple mechanisms simultaneously, achieving multitasking. This trial is the moment to test my results!" As soon as he finished speaking, Ning Zhuo moved forward with over twenty legs.<br/>
<br/>
The others were about to praise Ning Zhuo but immediately fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family's combined puppet moved like a bloated, massive caterpillar, with over twenty wooden legs moving in an orderly fashion, and over twenty arms either supporting, blocking, catching, or unloading, all working in perfect harmony.<br/>
<br/>
Massive wooden beams struck horizontally, either being leaped over by Ning Zhuo or blocked by the arms.<br/>
<br/>
Some mechanical traps were triggered, but only a few legs were suspended, while the remaining long legs stood firmly outside the traps.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo commanded the massive body, navigating through various obstacles and traps with the ease of flowing clouds and water, reaching the second door.<br/>
<br/>
"We passed, we passed!" The Ning family cultivators' puppet heads shouted in unison.<br/>
<br/>
They had experienced it firsthand and felt deeply moved.<br/>
<br/>
Many couldn't believe they had just passed the second checkpoint so easily.<br/>
<br/>
The entire process was very simple, like walking on flat ground.<br/>
<br/>
But everyone knew that this simple performance was backed by extraordinary skill.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah Zhuo, you're so amazing!" "It's truly eye-opening."<br/>
<br/>
"If I hadn't experienced it myself, I wouldn't believe it." "Our coordination was so seamless?"<br/>
<br/>
"Nonsense, it's all thanks to Ah Zhuo's command!" Ning Yong's voice chimed in.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, showed no pride: "The upcoming battles are the key. Let's not talk for now. Everyone, follow my lead and claim the rewards. I have a plan." The Ning family's large puppet stood before the door, carefully selecting their rewards.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah Zhuo, go ahead."<br/>
<br/>
"Our legs, our arms, our heads are all at your disposal!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ah Zhuo, charge, charge, charge!" The crowd's morale was high.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pushed the door open and entered.<br/>
<br/>
In the battle against numerous mechanical puppets, Ning Zhuo held back some of his strength, deliberately "sacrificing" a few companions to defeat all the mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
"We won, we won!" "A glorious victory, truly magnificent."<br/>
<br/>
"Ah Zhuo, you're amazing. How are you so adept at controlling mechanisms?" The answer was simple.<br/>
<br/>
Life-Hanging Thread!<br/>
<br/>
In many places, Ning Zhuo made subtle adjustments, ensuring that every leg and arm moved precisely.<br/>
<br/>
With precise movements, there was no mutual interference.<br/>
<br/>
The collective strength could be fully unleashed, leaving everyone in awe.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Ning Zhuo wouldn't answer this way.<br/>
<br/>
The young man laughed heartily: "Thanks to everyone's unconditional trust in me, allowing me to use you. Some classmates were sacrificed, which is my fault, my shortcoming. I will continue to train hard!"<br/>
<br/>
"My deepest apologies, everyone."<br/>
<br/>
The young man's humble and modest attitude made his classmates feel very comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
"Not at all!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ah Zhuo, you're perfect, just a bit too modest."<br/>
<br/>
"Do you know what you've accomplished? Such a brilliant performance."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed again: "Haha, stop praising me. We still have many more checkpoints to pass." He led the group into the preparation room.<br/>
<br/>
There, he disassembled himself and the others, returning them to their original forms.<br/>
<br/>
"Why separate?" Many expressed reluctance.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo explained: "During my recent seclusion, I thought of many things and came up with several ideas that can be realized here. Everyone, please trust me."<br/>
<br/>
"Let me create some useful mechanical components for you, which will be very beneficial for the upcoming trials." With this explanation, the Ning family members all complied.<br/>
<br/>
Many wanted to watch Ning Zhuo's modifications, but at this moment, Ning Chen stepped forward.<br/>
<br/>
"Move along, move along, what are you all doing here?"<br/>
<br/>
"These are Ah Zhuo's mechanical blueprints. We shouldn't look at them." "If we see them, would that be fair to Ah Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
His words left everyone speechless, and they all turned their gazes away, facing away from Ning Zhuo.</div>
