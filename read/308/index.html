<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 308: Battle Technique</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Wait, did I hear that correctly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Three Golden Core cultivators fought against Zheng Danlian, including those from major sects like the All-Book Pavilion and Purple Dawn Pavilion, and they all lost?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Could there have been infighting among them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Night Rain Demon Weapon! That's the only explanation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The remaining cultivators in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities were all astonished upon hearing this announcement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zheng Shuangjun and the others quickly recovered from the shock of the news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">They were all in the same Secret Pavilion chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In the center of the chamber were mechanical frogs that wandered aimlessly. Atop the head of a mechanical frog leader sat a treasure chest. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Yet, neither group paid any attention to these mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">That was because of the loosening of restrictions on the competitors following the heavy damage taken by the Lava Immortal Palace. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The maximum cultivator strength limit was now pushed up to the Foundation Establishment stage, thereby reducing the difficulty of the traps and mechanisms inside the pavilion. Moreover, the relative value of the various mechanism tools offered by the rooms had dropped since cultivators could now use their own items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The gazes of both two parties went past the group of mechanical frogs separating them at the center and onto each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Zheng Shuangjun showed a hint of joy: "Unexpectedly, we've run into two members from the Meng family. Meng Chong is only at the mid-level of the Qi Refining stage. We have the advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Jiufan, however, frowned and shook his head. "The situation is still perilous." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Meng Chong possesses immortal talent, and it wouldn't unsurprisingly for him to battle across levels in the early stages of cultivation. Zhou Nongying was eliminated by him. This young man should not be underestimated! We should retreat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Although their cultivation was stronger on paper, Ning Jiufan remained cautious. Actual combat often held surprises. It would be wiser to retreat, join forces with other cultivators, and return to fight later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">After all, it was clear from the list that only two members of the Meng family faction had made it to the third stage of the palace examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In contrast, even though Zhou Nongying had been eliminated, the Zheng family still had two cultivators, and the Ning family had both Ning Jiufan and Ning Zhuo. With the final addition of Zhu Xuanji, their numbers and lineup were the largest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"It's now possible to use our own items and Meng Chong's grandfather, a Nascent Soul cultivator, surely must have given him a number of protective treasures. There's no need to take unnecessary risks." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Let's find more allies and unite with them. When we come back, it will be like Mount Tai crushing an egg or thunderclap sweeping a cave — we will be unstoppable!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Jiufan whispered to Zheng Shuangjun, and additionally reminded him to be wary of the Void Sect, known for their cunning and schemes. Compared to them, the two from the Meng family could be considered potential allies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zheng Shuangjun nodded. "You're right. I was too fixated on Meng Chong being a mere junior. Let's go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Where do you think you're going?" the Golden Core cultivator from the Meng family shouted and charged forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zzzt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">An afterimage of lightning lingered where Meng Chong had been standing before slowly dissipating. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">In an instant, Meng Chong had shot past the central area of the mechanical frogs and was diving down from the air directly in front of Ning Jiufan and Zheng Shuangjun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He slammed into the ground, shattering the floor tiles and causing their countless fragments to fly in all directions. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Zheng Shuangjun and Ning Jiufan had retreated just in time, flanking Meng Chong from either side, trapping him between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Lightning crackled around Meng Chong's body as he stood, his battle intent surging. With a confident smile, he declared, "You're all my prey. None of you will escape!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Zheng Shuangjun snorted, charging forward. "Junior, you've got some nerve!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The two clashed, fists and feet colliding with resounding impacts. After several exchanges, Meng Chong shot away like a bolt of lightning, creating distance between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Jiufan privately judged the situation to be troublesome. Meng Chong's speed was extremely fast; even if he wanted to retreat, Meng Chong could easily catch up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Jiufan had no choice but to act. Whether to fight or flee, they needed to severely injure Meng Chong first!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Ning family ancestor unleashed a frost spell — ice spikes formed and flew toward Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Meng Chong twisted and turned, his body tracing a lightning path in the air, completely evading the ice spikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zheng Shuangjun immediately followed up by throwing darts, but none even grazed Meng Chong's clothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"I'm also your opponent!" At this critical moment, the Meng family Golden Core cultivator had finished slaying the mechanical frogs and rushed over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zheng Shuangjun engaged the Meng family Golden Core cultivator but was retreating step by step. The Golden Core cultivator was a physical cultivator, and Zheng Shuangjun suffered greatly in direct confrontation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">At a critical moment, the storage bracelet on his wrist emitted a brilliant light and released a pair of large blades at the level of magical artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zheng Shuangjun wielded the twin blades, creating a flurry of blade light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The blade light chopped down on the Meng family Golden Core body — but was completely blocked by the Golden Core cultivator's qi armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Meng family Golden Core charged forward, his fists flying like shadows. Zheng Shuangjun was beaten until his qi and blood churned. He retreated again and again, only able to use the twin blades to defend, not having the strength to fight back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">....</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Several hanging rings flew around Ning Jiufan, continuously shooting out silk threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The threads were aimed at Meng Chong, but they all missed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Slow! Slow! Slow!" Meng Chong shouted, his battle intent growing even more intense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He laughed heartily, clearly enjoying the taste of battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He suddenly cast a spell — air currents surged, flames raged, and the silk threads and hanging rings were destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Ning family ancestor, nothing special!" Meng Chong rushed fiercely at Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Jiufan watched as Meng Chong charged, as if seeing a thunder dragon shooting forward. His heart was as calm as jade and ice, fearless in the face of danger. He took a slight step back, then pressed his palm down forcefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Immediately, a strong wave of mana radiated in all directions, forming an ice wall in the blink of an eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The ice wall formed a circular shape, protecting Ning Jiufan in the center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Jiufan did not stop. The ice walls around him extended layer by layer, one after another, like waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The ice walls continuously thickened and quickly condensed together, forming a small glacier in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Jiufan took a deep breath, and cast another spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">A strong north wind howled from the valley, quickly filling the entirety of the pavilion chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The air temperature dropped sharply. Frost flowers rapidly spread on the walls, ceiling, and floor of the chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The biting cold enveloped Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Meng Chong shouted loudly and cast the Grasp Fire Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In the next moment, he was clad in flames, isolating himself from the external cold, and charged once more at Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Jiufan raised his right hand, releasing a large number of ice sculptures from his storage bracelet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">These ice sculptures fell onto the glacier, expanding and transforming into various birds and beasts that attempted to intercept Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Though Meng Chong's speed was much faster than those of the ice sculptures, Ning Jiufan were controlling them while successively casting spells, causing Meng Chong's speed to drop sharply. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Meng Chong decisively chose to abandon his direct charge at Ning Jiufan and temporarily switch his target to the frustrating ice sculptures instead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Bang bang bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Each ice sculpture was essentially at the Foundation Establishment level. In the face of Meng Chong's rapid charge, they had almost no power to resist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Soon, many were shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">For a time, the lightning was like a dragon — wherever it reached, ice sculptures exploded. Brilliant thunder fire and ice crystal fragments intertwined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">However, the ice sculptures were not without effect. One by one, they gradually diminished Meng Chong's momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">When Meng Chong finally reached the glacier, he was once again forced back by the harsh cold wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">....</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Zheng Shuangjun fell like a cannonball, crashing directly onto the glacier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He spat a mouthful of blood. His chest was caved in, bearing an indentation unmistakably shaped like a fist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The magical artifact spear in Zheng Shuangjun's hand had already been broken into two pieces, leading him to simply discard it and retrieve his signature weapon from his storage bracelet — the Sun and Moon Twin Hooks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Meng family physical cultivator attacked again, and Zheng Shuangjun, with his back against the glacier, engaged him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Relying on the magical artifact level Sun and Moon Twin Hooks, Zheng Shuangjun finally managed to hold off the Meng family physical cultivator, but it was a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Inside the glacier, Ning Jiufan keenly observed this scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He quickly analyzed the situation in his mind: "As expected of the Meng family's physical cultivator — what incredible strength!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Zheng Shuangjun relies on the Sun and Moon Twin Hooks, which is quite disadvantageous. It's a magical artifact and consumes a great deal of mana. He won't be able to hold on for long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"It seems that I will have to rely on myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Having thought this, Ning Jiufan took out the Ice Jade Pot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A stream of Ice Jade Wine flew out from the pot's spout which Ning Jiufan quickly swallowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">In the next moment, he silently activated a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Meng Chong relentlessly rushed forward once again, this time with even more ferocity in his momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">It was hard to imagine he was only at the mid-level of the Qi Refining stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ice bricks shot out from the glacier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Meng Chong dodged most of them while enduring the rest as he dived down from high above in his continued charge at Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Yet, in the next moment, these ice bricks suddenly shattered, turning into clusters of hail and snowflakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">For a moment, snowflakes fluttered in the secret pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The north wind raged within the glacier, howling, sweeping up ice shards and snow, and obscuring vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Then, gathering together, the ice and snow transformed into large snow-white pythons that besieged Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Amidst thunder and lightning, Meng Chong continuously dodged while using his fists to smash the pythons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The more he fought, the more excited he became, feeling his blood boiling. This wonderful feeling of solid punches was something he hadn't experienced in a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The puppet body he had when his soul entered the Immortal Palace truly restricted the display of his actual strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The snow pythons were shattered in the wind and snow, but soon reformed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Meng Chong only needed to break through a single point in the encirclement, initially holding the advantage, but over a period of fierce fighting, his strength gradually declined. He was now heavily surrounded, unable to break through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Seeing Meng Chong in trouble, the Meng family Golden Core physical cultivator disregarded safety and went all out against Zheng Shuangjun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zheng Shuangjun's hook tore the physical cultivator's skin, but he himself was sent flying by the Golden Core. Like a cannonball, he crashed directly through the glacier and fell to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Jiufan, nearby, had no time to care for him; he was fully concentrated on controlling the spell, tightly encircling Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">According to common sense, Ning Jiufan's large-scale spellcasting should have consumed a great deal of mana and Meng Chong's point-breaking strategy should have been an effective counter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">However, in actual combat, the scales of victory gradually tipped in Ning Jiufan's favor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Meng Chong was slowly becoming overwhelmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Zheng Shuangjun sat cross-legged on the ground, swallowing pills while giving praise: "Brother Ning, your techniques of Stacking, dividing, and transforming spells are truly exquisite! If you could go even further, you would undoubtedly reach the level of a master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">What he referred to were the techniques of spellcasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Stacking spells involved repeatedly casting the same spell until quantitative changes led to qualitative changes. Earlier, Ning Jiufan had cast ten ice walls in succession, then merged them together into a glacier that surrounded him. This demonstrated stacking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Dividing and transforming spells, on the other hand, could be seen in the flying ice bricks, wherein one spell broke into parts that were then used to transform into another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Lastly, the convergence of the raging wind, snow, and ice into snow pythons integrated all three of the stacking, dividing, and transforming techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Zheng Shuangjun continued to praise, "Brother Ning, we did not misjudge your abilities; you truly are a genuine master of battle techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Just as Ning Jiufan was about to politely respond, he was shocked to find he had suddenly suffered a severe blow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He looked down to see a blade hook piercing through his abdomen. The familiar shape was unmistakable — it was the Moon Hook from Zheng Shuangjun's signature weapon, the Sun and Moon Twin Hooks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In the next moment, the Moon Hook erupted with brilliance, its sharp energy rapidly corroding Ning Jiufan's internal organs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Jiufan's body convulsed violently as he glared at Zheng Shuangjun: "You!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
