<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Qing Chi’s heart was suddenly struck at its sorest point. Her cheeks flushed red with anger as she whipped around to face the speaker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">She saw a tall, broad-shouldered figure wearing a conical hat and draped in silver-gray scale armor, holding a long-handled trident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Qing Chi, small in stature, had only to tilt her head to see the speaker’s face beneath the hat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">And at first glance, she froze - beneath the brim wasn’t a human face, but that of a carp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">More precisely, it was a carp with a pair of silver dragon horns curling from its brow - clearly a demon of carp lineage with dragon blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Seeing her glare, the carp-headed creature grew visibly nervous and waved his hands in protest. “D-Did I guess wrong?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Qing Chi clenched her teeth, refusing to confirm it. Instead, she grew more furious and demanded, “Who are you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The gray-scaled carp demon quickly replied, “I - I’m Li Xiangshang! Sent here by my lord, the Dragon Sovereign.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Qing Chi’s heart gave a jolt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In the Underworld, a sovereign was called a Fujun. In the mortal realm, a ruler was styled as a king. But the title Dragon Sovereign was reserved for overlords of the aquatic realms - noble and powerful beyond compare. Only cultivators of great might could hold such a post.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Qing Chi suppressed her anger. “And which Dragon Sovereign is your lord?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Li Xiangshang immediately broke into an expression of heartfelt reverence. “My lord is the one known as the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign, who rules over - ”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“I know. Half of the Cang River, right?” Qing Chi cut him off impatiently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Li Xiangshang gave a startled “Ah!” Though interrupted, he didn’t take offense. He scratched the back of his head sheepishly. “You already know? That makes things easier.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Despite being a Golden Core cultivator, he spoke humbly to Qing Chi, who was only at Foundation Establishment, his manner deferential and nervous, his whole bearing rather inexperienced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Qing Chi’s anger began to fade. She looked him up and down and felt a suspicion rising in her heart - along with a touch of amusement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">She asked, “Your Dragon Sovereign already sent Jin Yangzi once, and now he’s sent you. Is this still about taking control of the Golden Swallow Trident?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Qing Chi, deeply concerned about Jiao Ma, had gathered a great deal of intel on Vigorous Yang Manor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Recently, the manor had set up a Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation to refine its treasures. Yet after two assassination attempts, both of which killed important consorts, the situation had grown volatile. An insider had deliberately leaked the news, stirring up chaos across the entire city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Qing Chi was well aware of this, and she knew Jin Yangzi had been the strongest candidate to seize the Golden Swallow Trident - until he was assassinated by that same traitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Jin Yangzi had hailed from the Seven Feathers Alliance, but it was under the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign’s orders that he came to Whitepaper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Now that Li Xiangshang had arrived as well, she naturally assumed he had also been sent to compete for the Trident’s control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This filled Qing Chi with genuine delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After all, she was deeply worried that her beloved, Jiao Ma, might stand out due to his cultivation method and become the new master of the Golden Swallow Trident - thereby confirming his status as one of the City Lord’s male consorts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">If Li Xiangshang took the Trident instead, that potential path for Jiao Ma would be cut off. That, in Qing Chi’s view, would be a blessing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">But Li Xiangshang shook his head. “I’m a carp turning into a flood dragon. I cultivate the Ascending Dragon Transformation, a technique bestowed by my lord. Even though I’m male, my nature is water-aligned - it’s not compatible with the Golden Swallow Trident’s essence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“But little miss, you’re half right.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“This time, I’ve come bearing a precious treasure, to find someone worthy - someone I can help to take hold of the Trident.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Your beloved, does he want the Golden Swallow Trident or not? This is a fortune few could dream of. I could help him seize it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Qing Chi’s brow furrowed, and she rolled up her sleeves. “You shameless beast - how dare you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Startled, Li Xiangshang leapt back several steps. “Hey, hey! No fighting, little miss! Fighting is forbidden within the city walls!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Then I’ll make an exception for you, you out-of-town pest!” Qing Chi sneered. Her fists flared with flame as she lunged forward with a punch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Her fist struck Li Xiangshang square in the chest with a muffled thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Azure flames flared, scorching his silver-grey scaled armor - but they died out almost instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Li Xiangshang’s aura surged, spiritual power coursing through his body. He stood unharmed, not even a scratch on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Qing Chi’s eyes narrowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">She was startled by Li Xiangshang’s strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">An ordinary Golden Core cultivator couldn’t have taken that punch so easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">But more importantly, she noticed that he was circulating his cultivation technique within the city - without any suppression from the city’s grand formation. What did that mean?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It meant that before coming to Vigorous Yang Manor, Li Xiangshang must have already met with the higher-ups of White Paper Immortal City. He had their approval. He was recognized as an ally of the city!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Qing Chi’s heart sank. “Not good. The Lord of White Paper City must have struck some sort of deal with the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign. The Dragon Sovereign is making his move.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Though she was fiery in both figure and temperament, Qing Chi knew when to yield. She immediately withdrew her hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“I’m warning you seriously. Stay away from my Jiao Ma. I don’t want him getting anywhere near that Golden Swallow Trident. He’s mine! I’m taking him out of Vigorous Yang Manor myself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Li Xiangshang blinked, scratching the back of his smooth bald head. “Oh, I see.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He seemed to have a sudden realization, then waved his hand apologetically. “That was my mistake.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“I promise - I won’t help your man.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“But if he wins the Golden Swallow Trident on his own merit, that’s none of my business.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Qing Chi narrowed her eyes, carefully scrutinizing him. Seeing that his apology was sincere and that he hadn’t acted superior in the slightest, she snorted. “You’d better mean that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Li Xiangshang nodded repeatedly. “Of course, of course. I swear it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Then, to her surprise, he actually swore a venomous oath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">That made Qing Chi look at him with fresh curiosity. This Li Xiangshang seemed simple-minded, the kind of cultivator who rarely dealt with others and focused solely on cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">There were plenty of people like that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Especially among the sons of great clans or elite sects - sheltered from birth, given everything they needed to cultivate, they spent their early years in seclusion. Only once they had the power to protect themselves were they sent out into the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">That was exactly the impression Li Xiangshang gave her now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">After swearing his oath, he looked earnestly at her. “There. Feel better now, little girl?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Qing Chi’s tone softened slightly. “Little girl? Who are you calling little girl? I have a name. It’s Qing Chi.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Li Xiangshang blinked. “Huh? But you’re way younger than me. I’m probably older than your grandfather. Isn’t it proper to call you ‘little girl’?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Qing Chi rubbed her forehead. “Just call me Qing Chi, alright? And remember your oath.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Here’s some advice: when dealing with people, don’t go around calling them ‘little girl’ or ‘child’ - it’s easy to offend someone.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Li Xiangshang’s eyes went wide, as if he’d just been taught some arcane truth. “Really?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Qing Chi’s eyes sparkled. “Since I taught you something, how will you repay me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Li Xiangshang froze. “Uh…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">This time, Qing Chi waved her hand. “Since you’re here to visit Vigorous Yang Manor, why not bring me in with you? Consider it a thank-you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Li Xiangshang hesitated. “Is that… allowed?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Qing Chi huffed impatiently. “Of course it is! Just bring me along. If anyone tries to stop me, you just glare at them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Li Xiangshang scratched his head, uneasy. “I’m not sure that’s a good idea… I just got here. I don’t want to offend anyone…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Qing Chi said, “If you can’t glare at people, then just keep quiet. Stand there, don’t say a word, and stare at them with a blank face!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Li Xiangshang thought it over. “I can do that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">And so, Qing Chi followed Li Xiangshang into Vigorous Yang Manor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The first thing Li Xiangshang did upon arriving in White Paper Immortal City was pay his respects to the Paper Avatar of the City Lord. His visit to Vigorous Yang Manor this time had already been cleared with the higher-ups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Vigorous Yang Manor welcomed Li Xiangshang warmly - but their attitude toward Qing Chi was something else entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Just as they moved to block her path, Li Xiangshang let out a quiet “Mm,” eyes sharp and unblinking as he looked their way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The courtyard cultivators froze: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Li Xiangshang: …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">After a few beats of tense silence, the cultivators finally got the message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“Oh, so the two of you are together! W-welcome, please come in.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Qing Chi was overjoyed and followed Li Xiangshang deeper into the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">She’d been here before and knew the layout. Midway through, she split off from him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Before leaving, she gave Li Xiangshang a firm pat on the arm. “Alright, I’m heading off now. You’re a decent guy, big fella. Next time I come around, I’ll count on you to show me the way again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Li Xiangshang grinned. “You’re the first friend I’ve made here, Miss Qing. If you ever need my help, just call.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Vigorous Yang Manor cultivators nearby could only smile wryly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Qing Chi made her way to Ning Zhuo’s residence. She took a moment to smooth her hair and clothes, then drew a deep breath, nerves plainly written on her face as she stepped up to his door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Jiao Ma, Jiao Ma, I’ve come to see you,” she called softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">No answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Qing Chi bit her lip, then raised a knuckle and tapped gently on the door. “Jiao Ma, it’s me, it’s Qing Chi - your Qing Qing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Still no response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">She pressed her ear to the door and activated a sound-enhancing technique, but the room was completely silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Qing Chi’s expression darkened, her eyes narrowing. In their depths flickered a trace of blue flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">She began pounding on the door, harder and harder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Bang. Bang. Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Jiao Ma, open up!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Still trying to avoid me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“I’m blocking the damn door!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Open up already! You hear me?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“If you don’t open this door, I’m not leaving today!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“You brat, you don’t even have the guts to face me? You bastard!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Her voice grew louder and louder, emotions flaring, and soon she was kicking the door with full force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">A neighbor from next door finally couldn’t take it anymore. “Please stop yelling, girl. Jiao Ma’s not in there!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Qing Chi shouted back, “Don’t you dare try to cover for him!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Startled, the neighbor stammered, “No, really! He left early yesterday morning and never came back.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Qing Chi blinked, and her rage melted into relief. So Jiao Ma wasn’t avoiding her on purpose after all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">She quickly asked where he’d gone, but the neighbor just shook his head repeatedly. “No idea. Sorry.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Qing Chi clenched her teeth. She wasn’t about to let this go. She’d come all the way to Vigorous Yang Manor - there was no way she’d leave just like that. “I’m going to find someone higher up. I want answers!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">As for Ning Zhuo, he had already gone to seek out Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Following his instructions, Sun Lingtong had successfully reached the seventh regiment of the Paper Soldier Army and located the formation set by Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">But to activate the array plate, one needed Myriad Manifestations energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">That was the hurdle they’d run into. With no way forward, Sun Lingtong could only wait patiently for Ning Zhuo to bring good news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo had taken the initiative the day before. He left Vigorous Yang Manor and sought out Wen Ruanyu to formally ask for instruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Previously, Senior Wen mentioned the possibility of joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect, and also spoke of the Flying Cloud Assembly. The more I think about it, the more I find myself drawn to the idea.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Recently, I learned that anyone who wishes to enter the Myriad Manifestations Sect must cultivate the Myriad Manifestations Scripture.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“I wonder if Senior Wen might be willing to impart some of the scripture’s content to me in advance, so I may begin training early and increase my chances during the Flying Cloud Assembly?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">It was a perfectly reasonable request.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Wen Ruanyu, being the one who had first recommended him, would also gain merit from his successful recruitment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Hearing Ning Zhuo’s earnest petition, he was quite pleased. “Myriad Manifestations Sect embraces all forms and accepts all streams. The introductory chapters of our sect’s foundational technique, the Myriad Manifestations Scripture, are not restricted in their transmission.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“I’ll teach you the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment sections right now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo received the Myriad Manifestations Scripture without a hitch, but he didn’t return to Vigorous Yang Manor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Instead, he went to the south gate of White Paper Immortal City and re-entered the giant Paper Figurine Statue. Only through the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern could he once again tap into Life Hanging by a Thread and contact Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“Boss, everything went smoothly. I’ve got the Myriad Manifestations Scripture,” Ning Zhuo announced with delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Sun Lingtong was overjoyed. “Little Zhuo, I knew you could do it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">After committing the teachings to memory, he began to study them in earnest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Myriad Manifestations Scripture opened with a preface:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“In the beginning, before the world split into clear and turbid, there was the Primal One Qi of Hunyuan. Thus came the Scripture of Hunyuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The Hunyuan Qi gave rise to all things - this was the Myriad Manifestations. The Myriad Manifestations are the pivot of heaven and earth, the union of yin and yang…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">I have seen stars fall into oceans, and thunder split to birth spring shoots. I have realized that the myriad manifestations are merely Qi shifting in form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Thus I composed this scripture: to take the formless into the formed, and to find truth within illusion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">As he delved into it, Sun Lingtong’s heart grew more and more elated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">“This Myriad Manifestations Scripture really lives up to being the core technique of a top-tier sect. Its vision is profound - far beyond most other manuals.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">“Cultivating this scripture produces Myriad Manifestations energy, a power that can simulate and replicate the force of any technique under heaven. It’s miraculous, and yet so straightforward - anyone can pick it up!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">After only a short period of study, Sun Lingtong had already grasped the core of both the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment chapters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Part of it was his exceptional talent; part of it was the scripture’s clarity and accessibility - it truly was easy to learn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">With his understanding solidified, Sun Lingtong immediately began cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">His main practice was the Virgin Boy Technique, which focused on the Divine Sea and upper dantian. His Qi Sea and Essence Sea hadn’t yet been refined by any dedicated method. Conveniently, the Myriad Manifestations Scripture targeted the dantian within the Qi Sea, making him an ideal candidate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">As for Ning Zhuo, his Three Sects Supreme Arts already cultivated all three dantians. That made him incompatible with the Myriad Manifestations Scripture - even if he wanted to learn it, he couldn’t.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Still, because Sun Lingtong’s Virgin Boy Technique was quite refined, his Qi Sea and Essence Sea had already been subtly transformed by the Divine Sea. These changes made him ill-suited for the Myriad Manifestations Scripture as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">To cultivate the scripture successfully, he would need to further adjust his foundation - making things far more difficult than for someone starting fresh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Under ordinary circumstances, Sun Lingtong would never have considered it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">But this wasn’t just about a valuable artifact. It also involved his sworn brother Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Without hesitation, and with full focus, Sun Lingtong threw himself into cultivating the Myriad Manifestations Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">In just two days, he succeeded in generating Myriad Manifestations energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Though it was only at the Qi Refining level, it was already enough for the array plate to recognize and respond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ultimately, Myriad Manifestations energy was just a key.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Sun Lingtong poured it into the plate - and at last, it activated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">A restrained and mysterious energy swept outward, blanketing the entire Paper Soldier Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">The next moment, the paper soldiers began to rustle, stirring ever so slightly even though there was no wind.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
