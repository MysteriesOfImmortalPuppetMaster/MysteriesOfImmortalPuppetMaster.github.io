<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 354: Assistance (Vote for a Monthly Ticket)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The three main cultivation techniques practiced by the Myriad Medicine Sect are the "Evergreen Hundred Herbs Technique," the "Life Pill Method," and the "True Medical Dao Exposition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">From these three core techniques, it can be seen that the cultivators of the Myriad Medicine Sect excel in planting, alchemy, and healing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Thus, the cultivators of the Myriad Medicine Sect are generally divided into three categories: plant cultivators, alchemists, and healers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Because their combat power is relatively lacking, the Myriad Medicine Sect's external business strategies differ from those of other sects. They established Little Contention Peak, offering various benefits to attract outside cultivators for long-term residence, thereby improving the sect's overall strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Many of the cultivators on Little Contention Peak have lived there for ten or even dozens of years. Typically, under a tree, no one allows others to nap beneath it. Few sects would attract large numbers of external cultivators and arrange for them to reside near their sect gates for extended periods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">However, the Myriad Medicine Sect accommodates these people and achieves harmonious coexistence with them through methods. Both parties benefited from this arrangement. It is much like how the Myriad Medicine Sect densely plants countless herbs of various kinds in the Medicine Field Mountain and the Myriad Medicines Valley. The sect’s philosophy is to seek common ground while allowing for differences and to coexist in harmony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Myriad Medicine Sect has only one Nascent Soul stage cultivator, the current sect master, Lin Bufan. Lin Bufan is known as a battle fanatic. However, he is not obsessed with fighting himself but rather with watching battles. In his youth, he was a well-known battle commentator. His remarks often hit the mark and were highly insightful. For many important duels, individuals like him were often invited to help promote the reputation of the fighters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Perhaps watching battles truly has its benefits, for Lin Bufan successfully broke through to the Nascent Soul stage. This breakthrough immediately elevated the Myriad Medicine Sect, a medium-sized sect, to a recognized large sect. The policies and benefits of Little Contention Peak were all crafted by Lin Bufan, who clearly possesses business acumen. Even as a Nascent Soul cultivator, Lin Bufan personally handles many affairs, setting an example for the entire sect, which naturally fosters a clear and upright atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Little Zhuo, it's not easy to seek the Fetal Breath Spiritual Item," Sun Lingtong sighed. "I've looked into it. The Fetal Breath Spiritual Item is a treasured inheritance of the sect and has always been kept by Lin Bufan himself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This was only to be expected. Just like how Ning Jiufan always carries the Ice Jade Pot with him, such items are closely guarded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sun Lingtong continued, "It will be extremely difficult for us to obtain a treasure from a Nascent Soul cultivator. It seems we’ll have to follow the rules, constantly demonstrate ourselves, and accumulate benefits to exchange for a chance to use the Fetal Breath Spiritual Item."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Sun Lingtong handed over a jade slip, saying, "This slip contains information on the strongest Foundation Establishment cultivators at present. If you want to obtain the Fetal Breath Spiritual Item, you’ll need to live in a higher-grade cave dwelling, which will allow you to accumulate benefits faster. These people may be your competitors!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo used his divine sense to examine the jade slip. "Demonic cultivator Zheng Xingchen and sword cultivator Lai Wuying are generally considered the strongest. Below them are the monster cultivator Chang Yan and the mechanical cultivator Luo Man..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up slightly, surprised to find there was a mechanical cultivator among them. He immediately felt a desire to befriend this person. These strong cultivators were all at the Foundation Establishment level. Golden Core cultivators had already been recruited as outer sect elders by the Myriad Medicine Sect and would not be residing on Little Contention Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The intelligence gathered by Sun Lingtong was quite detailed, covering not only the backgrounds of these Foundation Establishment powerhouses but also their notable past battles. Such information was constantly circulating on Little Contention Peak. On the one hand, every duel for cave dwellings was public, making it easy for outsiders to gather information. On the other hand, the interests at stake in these duels had already given rise to an intelligence trade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong warned, "You can't rely too much on this information. Every day on Little Contention Peak, there are new battles. Many cultivators hide a trump card or two, and even if exposed, they’ll quickly study and master new secret techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"When you eventually challenge your way up, I’ll secretly help you test your opponents’ hidden cards in advance," Sun Lingtong added thoughtfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">But Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly. "Boss, don't do that. The situation in the Myriad Medicines Valley is different from the Hidden Mist Mountain. I need the Fetal Breath Spiritual Item to achieve my goal, but unfortunately, it’s a treasured inheritance of the sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"So, my only clear path is to keep investigating, gathering information, and eventually come into legitimate contact with the Fetal Breath Spiritual Item."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"But your covert approach involves using the intelligence I gather to plan a theft. Perhaps, with my cooperation, you could succeed in stealing it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"This time, we need more collaboration!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sun Lingtong grinned mischievously, feeling excited. "To steal a sect's treasured inheritance right under the nose of a Nascent Soul cultivator—within a large sect—sounds incredibly thrilling! Just thinking about it makes me excited!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo quickly said, "Boss, that’s only our last resort. Maybe we can find another way, like persuading the sect master to sell the Fetal Breath Spiritual Item externally."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Sun Lingtong shook his head at the idea. "You expect a sect to willingly sell its inherited treasure?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He found it unlikely. But Ning Zhuo reasoned, "I know it’s a long shot, but who can predict the future? I believe most so-called 'priceless treasures' are only so because the price hasn’t been met yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Their conversation was interrupted by a sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">A moment later, a challenge letter from Han Zhou appeared before Sun and Ning. Sun Lingtong found it amusing. "Interesting. Before you had a chance to challenge anyone, someone has already challenged you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo said calmly, "We just arrived and took Cave No. 281. This was thanks to Lin Shanshan, but it also makes more people want to test us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He continued his analysis, "Han Zhou is just the first. Even if I defeat him, more challengers will follow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Sun Lingtong nodded, "Unless you use the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng, or another powerful construct, to gain a decisive advantage, making others retreat in fear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "There’s no need for that yet. I’d rather advance steadily and use this environment to temper my own strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He recalled, "Watching the battle between the Black Wind Tiger Demon and Meng Zichong left a deep impression on me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Sun Lingtong agreed. "Indeed, one shouldn’t rely too much on constructs. A true fighter is skilled in both close and distant combat, without any glaring weaknesses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong, too, had learned much from their time at Cloud Concealment Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He added, "Little Zhuo, take a good look at the intelligence on Han Zhou. I’ll go out and see if I can gather more information."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo nodded and cautioned, "Boss, be careful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He stayed in the cave, studying the intelligence on Han Zhou. He soon discovered that Han Zhou specialized in close combat with impressive defensive capabilities. Han Zhou had few artifacts, relying solely on his physical body to withstand powerful external attacks. His resilience left Ning Zhuo feeling somewhat inferior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“How should I counter that?” Ning Zhuo pondered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Just then, someone sent a voice transmission. "Is Ning Zhuo in the cave?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows, recognizing the voice. Using the Life Thread Divine Ability, he sensed Lin Shanshan outside the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Miss Lin!” Ning Zhuo greeted her with a bow, inviting her inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I didn’t expect Miss Lin to be the sect master’s daughter. Your help a few days ago left me deeply grateful," Ning Zhuo said politely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Lin Shanshan shook her head slightly, looking worried. "Actually, this is partly my fault."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"I later realized that I shouldn’t have intervened and allowed you to take such a high-numbered cave on Little Contention Peak right away."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Do you know that Han Zhou’s challenge isn’t of his own will? He was asked to do so by someone else."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"This person’s name is Li Jingwei, a merchant who has long bought goods from our Myriad Medicine Sect for resale."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo paused, giving Lin Shanshan a deep look, sincerely thanking her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Lin Shanshan waved her hand. "Don’t think Han Zhou’s low-numbered cave means he’s weak. He’s deliberately keeping a low profile."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"His real name is unknown, but he comes from Han Zhou, which is why he uses that name."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"His strength is formidable, and his cultivation technique is unique. Although he appears to be a body cultivator, his technique focuses on the mind. It’s very likely he cultivates both his upper and lower dantians!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo’s expression grew serious. "Dual dantian cultivation? It seems Han Zhou had his own fortuitous encounter. No sect, no clan, yet he has cultivated such an exceptional technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Miss Lin, what should I do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Lin Shanshan reassured him. "Since you were introduced to Little Contention Peak through me, this matter involves me as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“That’s why I’m here to help you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"This is an upper-grade fasting pill. Take a few before your fight with Han Zhou, and keep some in your mouth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Han Zhou’s attacks are quite peculiar, making people feel hunger and cold, leaving them weak. Healing pills won’t help as much as fasting pills, which can satisfy your body’s need for nourishment. Otherwise, the burning hunger in your organs will undoubtedly diminish your combat strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After Lin Shanshan finished speaking, she also took out a jade pendant. The pendant was fiery red and intricately crafted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">When Lin Shanshan brought it out, her face flushed slightly. This was something she had worn close to her body during her childhood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"This is a Warm Heart Pendant. It will help you maintain your body temperature and keep your spirit strong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Han Zhou is skilled at creating openings in his opponents' defenses. His technique is unusual in this respect. This pendant will help you maintain a stronger and more enduring spirit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo accepted the fasting pills and the Warm Heart Pendant without hesitation. He then looked at Lin Shanshan with clear eyes. "Miss Lin, do you have anything else?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Lin Shanshan’s gaze shifted briefly. She had originally thought that helping Ning Zhuo this much was already generous enough. But faced with him now, she felt she should do more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">So, she took a deep breath and said, "For now, this is all I’ve thought of."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"To help you more, I need to know more about your actual strength. In battle, it’s all about playing to your strengths and compensating for your weaknesses to maximize your advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly. "Miss Lin, you are absolutely right! How about we head to the martial arts arena right now, and I’ll demonstrate my skills?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Ah, this..." Lin Shanshan hesitated. She hadn’t planned on personally inspecting Ning Zhuo’s combat abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">But Ning Zhuo gave her no chance to refuse, immediately opening the door and leaving the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lin Shanshan hesitated for a moment but eventually followed him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Standing at the cave entrance, Ning Zhuo smiled at her. "Miss Lin, may I ask how to get to the martial arts arena?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Lin Shanshan sighed helplessly. "Follow me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Moments later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong returned to the cave. "Little Zhuo, I bought a bunch of fire talismans from the market to help you dispel the cold and keep your mind steady during the fight with Han Zhou!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He looked around but couldn’t find Ning Zhuo anywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“Where did he go?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
