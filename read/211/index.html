<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit..." Ning Zhuo called out repeatedly, but received no response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Has it already left?" Ning Zhuo's tone was filled with disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He still had a lot of questions that he hadn't had the chance to ask.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"It seems the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's condition is really poor." In the small room, only the puppet Ning Zhuo remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This was the reward room Ning Zhuo had reached after passing through the Buddhist Gate path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The information about the Foundation Establishment method had already been transmitted to his mind when he opened the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">On the wall in front of Ning Zhuo hung many waist tokens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This was another part of the reward that he had yet to claim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He stared at these waist tokens, his gaze somewhat unfocused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He was still thinking about his recent conversation with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This exchange had been immensely rewarding for Ning Zhuoâ€”he had finally found a way to become the Palace Master of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">That was to participate in the palace examination, win the top spot, and ultimately ascend to the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">As for the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Ning Zhuo could understand its early allegiance to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After all, the reasons given by the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit were indeed quite compelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Another significant gain for Ning Zhuo was his understanding of the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Like the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Ning Zhuo felt immense pressure after gaining insight into his opponents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">His main competitors were all true disciples at the Golden Core Stage from super sects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Among them, Zhu Xuanji, who hailed from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, was undoubtedly the most formidable competitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Although Meng Chong was only at the Qi Refining Stage, the Meng family behind him was also a colossal force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Their influence in the Southern Bean Kingdom far exceeded that of super sects like the Void Sect, Soul Devouring Sect, and Great Purity Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Moreover, Meng Chong's grandfather was Meng Kui, a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator and the current City Lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, giving him an absolute home-field advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"If it weren't for my Buddha Heart Demon Seal and my mastery of the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, I wouldn't even have the qualifications to sit at the table," Ning Zhuo sighed bitterly in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The more he thought about it, the greater the pressure he felt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Although Ning Zhuo had mentally prepared himself for this, he found that facing these pressures in reality was entirely different from imagining them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">His competitors for the position of Palace Master of the Lava Immortal Palace were like towering mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">In front of them, Ning Zhuo, who was merely at the Qi Refining Stage, was as insignificant as an ant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">How could he possibly overcome these mountains?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"My mind is a bit chaotic." Ning Zhuo closed his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After a moment, he slowly opened them, and the previously scattered gaze had regained its determination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Lava Immortal Palace was a treasure left behind by a great power at the Void Refining Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">When Ning Zhuo decided to participate in this competition, it was destined that he would face such immense, almost despair-inducing pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">There was no turning back for him now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">All he could do was muster all his courage and face the challenges head-on!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Now that I have the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit as an insider, I know a lot about my opponents."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Can I suppress and deal with these competitors as I did with Meng Chong and others before?" Ning Zhuo couldn't help but think.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Since entering the Immortal Palace, he had relied on his exceptional skills, years of accumulation, and a significant early advantage to firmly control the overall situation of the Lava Immortal Palace route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Despite frequent unexpected events, Ning Zhuo had risked his life multiple times to stabilize the situation and ultimately reach this point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">His gains were enormous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Given the current situation, Meng Chong can be temporarily set aside. Zhu Xuanji is the main threat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"What exactly is the Mechanical Demon General? How was it lost in the first place?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"If Zhu Xuanji retrieves it, will it grant him a second-grade position?" Ning Zhuo was puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He lacked a comprehensive understanding of the positions and grades within the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit..." Ning Zhuo called out again with deep emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">In the main hall, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit pretended not to hear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit dared not continue communicating with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">It had observed many times and was very clear: Ning Zhuo was not a normal sixteen-year-old boy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He was extremely shrewd and had a very deep mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had witnessed Ning Zhuo playing the four major forces of Fire Persimmon Immortal City like a fiddle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">In its view, Ning Zhuo's opportunities and combat power were excellent, but his most outstanding qualities were always his strategy and tactics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"He's a little monster."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had long decided to minimize its communication time and frequency with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The more it said, the more flaws it would reveal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A single careless word might expose its disguise to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After calling out for a while without any response from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Ning Zhuo sighed in disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He really wanted to stop Zhu Xuanji, but how could he do that?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhu Xuanji was a Golden Core Stage cultivator with strong investigative abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">However, he hadn't continued his investigation but had instead focused his important time and energy on the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This was a good thing for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Now, should Ning Zhuo actively provoke such a person?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Just thinking about it gave Ning Zhuo a headache.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Facing Qi Refining Stage cultivators like Zheng Jie, Zhou Zeshen, and Meng Chong, he could barely control the situation with his accumulation and methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">But once he faced a Golden Core Stage existence, he immediately felt his own insignificance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"I am still too weak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Although I am at the peak of the ninth layer of the Qi Refining Stage, this cultivation still needs to be purified and refined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"After all, I am only at the Qi Refining Stage. Even if I advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage, there is still a significant gap between me and the Golden Core Stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Fortunately, I have obtained the Foundation Establishment method. After returning, I will study it thoroughly and strive to establish my foundation as soon as possible to narrow the gap with my opponents." Ning Zhuo had passed the Buddhist Gate's checkpoint and obtained the Foundation Establishment method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He was about to start preparing for Foundation Establishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">At the age of sixteen, he was already preparing for Foundation Establishment! Such an achievement was enormous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">It should be noted that from the time he entered the Immortal Palace and changed his cultivation method, less than a year had passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Such a rapid cultivation speed was simply astonishing, like a firecracker shooting straight up into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Of course, relying solely on the rewards and resources within the Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo could not have achieved this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He had leveraged the Lava Immortal Palace to mobilize several other major cultivation families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo had obtained a massive amount of resources from them, allowing him to reach this point step by step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Now, he was not only at the peak of the ninth layer of the Qi Refining Stage but also had a large number of subordinates, controlled the black market, and had many sources of income.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">His rise had been so rapid that he should have attracted attention, jealousy, and suppression from others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But with the recruitment order, the Lava Immortal Palace and the foreign cultivators became the main focus of attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo was overlooked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">This indirectly created a favorable environment for his rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Unable to think of a solution, Ning Zhuo had to choose his rewards first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Each waist token represented a position within the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo casually picked up a waist token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">As soon as it touched his hand, a stream of information was transmitted to his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">This was the token of the Abandoned Room's master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In the Lava Immortal Palace, there was a huge Abandoned Room filled with a large number of discarded items and waste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">These discarded items often required specific methods for proper disposal and could not be casually thrown aside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">At the same time, during the disposal process, they could be remelted or recycled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Abandoned Room managed these items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo naturally wouldn't choose this position, so he put the waist token down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He carefully selected for a while and finally chose the highest-grade position tokenâ€”a token for the master of the Medical Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Once he made his choice, the Medical Pavilion Master Token automatically recognized him as its owner, instantly making him the master of the Medical Pavilion in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">This was a second-grade position!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo could now sense the Medical Pavilion building and oversee its normal operations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Besides the master, the Medical Pavilion also had positions like medical officers and medicine boys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">As the master of the Medical Pavilion, Ning Zhuo had certain appointment and dismissal rights over these people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In fact, his hard work in cultivating the Ning family's cultivators, especially his reformation team classmates, was mainly for this purpose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">As long as these people met certain standards, Ning Zhuo could appoint them as members of the Medical Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">If Ning Zhuo was dissatisfied with them, he could dismiss them with a single thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Dismissing was much easier than appointing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The prerequisite for appointment was that the relevant cultivators had to meet the standards of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">However, there were no such requirements for dismissal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Hmm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">While holding the Medical Pavilion Master Token, Ning Zhuo suddenly sensed that he had a new subordinate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo looked closely and found that it was someone he was quite familiar with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Ning Xiaohui?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"How did she become a medical officer in the Medical Pavilion?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"How did she accumulate so much merit and contribution in such a short time since changing her path?" Ning Zhuo's eyes showed a thoughtful expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Even with the strong support of the Ning family's main branch, such speed is still quite rapid. This indicates that Ning Xiaohui has been living a very tough life recently. She must have been frantically completing tasks to accumulate merit and contributions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"If I dismiss her from her position now, what will happen?" This thought crossed Ning Zhuo's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">In the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Xiaohui entered the Immortal Palace and arrived in front of the Medical Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">At this moment, her fists were clenched, and her face was full of excitement and joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Finally, I have finally been promoted to a medical officer in the Medical Pavilion!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"I have finally achieved my goal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"This will be a brand new starting point for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"From now on, my efficiency in accumulating merit and contributions will far exceed others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Hahaha..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Changing my path and coming here was the right decision!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"This is a whole new world. With my status as a trial disciple, I have far more advantages than those Golden Core cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"My efforts during this period have not been in vain; everything has been worth it!" Ning Xiaohui deeply felt that she was being taken care of.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">With her status as a trial disciple, she was treated as an insider in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">In contrast, Zhu Xuanji and others, even if they were at the Golden Core Stage, were still considered outsiders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">For example, the position of a medical officer in the Medical Pavilion was not available to outsiders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">At this moment, Ning Xiaohui was in the Medical Pavilion, and with her position as a medical officer, she was assigned a mechanical workbench.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Let me see if there are any new tasks that can earn me more contributions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Xiaohui looked closely, and the next moment, her eyes widened in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"This is?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">She saw a mechanical construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">A mechanical construct that left a deep impression on her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The Golden Blood Battle Ape!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had repeatedly obstructed and tormented her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">It had caused her to fail in the first three checkpoints multiple times, making her performance in exploring the Immortal Palace extremely embarrassing and leaving her unable to hold her head high in the reformation team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">And now, this former nightmare, the culprit that tormented Ning Xiaohui, had become the subject of a repair task assigned to her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Soon after, a teleportation circle appeared in front of Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">After a moment of flickering, it delivered the Golden Blood Battle Ape to her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Seeing the Golden Blood Battle Ape on the table, Ning Xiaohui's expression was extremely complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Immediately, she showed a fierce look.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Xiaohui looked at the Golden Blood Battle Ape, imagining Ning Zhuo in her mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">She gritted her teeth and said, "Good, this is perfect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"I will repair you with all my might, restoring you to your best condition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Then, I will make you the biggest obstacle for those people, inflicting the pain you gave me a hundredfold on them." The more Ning Xiaohui spoke, the more excited she became, her eyes shining brightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">From the Golden Blood Battle Ape, she saw the hope of revenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Ning Xiaohui focused all her attention and began examining the condition of the Golden Blood Battle Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The Golden Blood Battle Ape was mostly damaged, with some areas severely injured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Not long ago, Ning Zhuo had used it to forcefully break through the final checkpoint of the Buddhist Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">This had left it almost unrecognizable, with some wounds so large that the internal mechanical parts were visible from the outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">After observing for a while, Ning Xiaohui frowned deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"This Golden Blood Battle Ape is so severely damaged that its true strength is increasingly difficult to exert."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">"Ning Zhuo must have taken advantage of this, no wonder he could repel this mechanical construct." Ning Xiaohui couldn't detect much of the Golden Blood Battle Ape's operational secrets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">In fact, even Ning Zhuo didn't know much about his mechanical construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"Even though I don't understand its structure and don't have its mechanical blueprint, these don't prevent me from healing and repairing it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"My Heavenly Talent Ice Jade Hand is just that unreasonable, hahaha..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Ning Xiaohui took out a medicine bottle, uncorked it, and poured a dozen pills into her mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Then, she sat down cross-legged and began frantically refining the medicinal power, adjusting her state to its best.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">She fully activated her Heavenly Talent, freezing the Golden Blood Battle Ape in a huge block of ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Ning Xiaohui exerted all her strength, pushing her talent to the limit, while blood slowly seeped from her seven orifices.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit muttered to itself, "Ning Xiaohui, do you really have to go this far?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Although the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could fully understand Ning Xiaohui's actions, as an observer, it was also very clear: the Golden Blood Battle Ape was Ning Zhuo's mechanical construct, his most important general in controlling the Lava Immortal Palace's assessment, bar none.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but wonder, "If Ning Xiaohui finds out in the future that the Golden Blood Battle Ape she painstakingly repaired is the mechanical construct of the person she hates the most, what kind of reaction will she have?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't imagine such a scene and couldn't help but look forward to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">At this moment, its expression changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">Using the Lava Immortal Palace, its gaze penetrated through layers of space and fixed on Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Since obtaining the Mechanical Demon General, Zhu Xuanji had been focused on its repair work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Currently, the broken left arm of the Mechanical Demon General had been newly reattached.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">For this, Zhu Xuanji had been working day and night, busy to the point of exhaustion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">When the royal family's reply reached him, his expression was momentarily dazed before he reacted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">Back then, Zhu Xuanji had written to the royal family seeking help to find the true scripture by investigating the little ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">Now, the royal family's reply had arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">Zhu Xuanji unfolded the letter and saw the royal family's unique encrypted text.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">This didn't matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">In his mind, Zhu Xuanji quickly translated the encrypted text.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">Thus, the appearance of Yuan Dasheng as an adult and in old age emerged in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">"Yuan Dasheng?!" Zhu Xuanji was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">For a moment, he stood still like a statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">But in his mind, thoughts were swirling like a storm, turning everything upside down!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="349">Seeing this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit excitedly stood up, its four claws on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="351">Although it couldn't understand the contents of the royal family's reply, just seeing Zhu Xuanji's drastic change in expression, it could guess a thing or two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="353">"Find Ning Zhuo, find Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="355">"He is the real culprit, the mastermind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="357">"Catch him, catch him quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="359">"Hahaha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="361">Anticipating Zhu Xuanji's imminent capture of Ning Zhuo, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely excited, its face full of joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="363">It was very eager, wishing to see this scene happen in the next moment!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
