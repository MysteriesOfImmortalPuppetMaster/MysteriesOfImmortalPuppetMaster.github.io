<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit..." Ning Zhuo called out repeatedly, but received no response.<br/>
<br/>
"Has it already left?" Ning Zhuo's tone was filled with disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
He still had a lot of questions that he hadn't had the chance to ask.<br/>
<br/>
"It seems the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's condition is really poor." In the small room, only the puppet Ning Zhuo remained.<br/>
<br/>
This was the reward room Ning Zhuo had reached after passing through the Buddhist Gate path.<br/>
<br/>
The information about the Foundation Establishment method had already been transmitted to his mind when he opened the door.<br/>
<br/>
On the wall in front of Ning Zhuo hung many waist tokens.<br/>
<br/>
This was another part of the reward that he had yet to claim.<br/>
<br/>
He stared at these waist tokens, his gaze somewhat unfocused.<br/>
<br/>
He was still thinking about his recent conversation with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
This exchange had been immensely rewarding for Ning Zhuo‚Äîhe had finally found a way to become the Palace Master of the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
That was to participate in the palace examination, win the top spot, and ultimately ascend to the throne.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Ning Zhuo could understand its early allegiance to him.<br/>
<br/>
After all, the reasons given by the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit were indeed quite compelling.<br/>
<br/>
Another significant gain for Ning Zhuo was his understanding of the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Like the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Ning Zhuo felt immense pressure after gaining insight into his opponents.<br/>
<br/>
His main competitors were all true disciples at the Golden Core Stage from super sects.<br/>
<br/>
Among them, Zhu Xuanji, who hailed from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, was undoubtedly the most formidable competitor.<br/>
<br/>
Although Meng Chong was only at the Qi Refining Stage, the Meng family behind him was also a colossal force.<br/>
<br/>
Their influence in the Southern Bean Kingdom far exceeded that of super sects like the Void Sect, Soul Devouring Sect, and Great Purity Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Meng Chong's grandfather was Meng Kui, a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator and the current City Lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, giving him an absolute home-field advantage.<br/>
<br/>
"If it weren't for my Buddha Heart Demon Seal and my mastery of the Life-Hanging Thread Divine Ability, I wouldn't even have the qualifications to sit at the table," Ning Zhuo sighed bitterly in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
The more he thought about it, the greater the pressure he felt.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo had mentally prepared himself for this, he found that facing these pressures in reality was entirely different from imagining them.<br/>
<br/>
His competitors for the position of Palace Master of the Lava Immortal Palace were like towering mountains.<br/>
<br/>
In front of them, Ning Zhuo, who was merely at the Qi Refining Stage, was as insignificant as an ant.<br/>
<br/>
How could he possibly overcome these mountains?<br/>
<br/>
"My mind is a bit chaotic." Ning Zhuo closed his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment, he slowly opened them, and the previously scattered gaze had regained its determination.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace was a treasure left behind by a great power at the Void Refining Stage.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo decided to participate in this competition, it was destined that he would face such immense, almost despair-inducing pressure.<br/>
<br/>
There was no turning back for him now.<br/>
<br/>
All he could do was muster all his courage and face the challenges head-on!<br/>
<br/>
"Now that I have the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit as an insider, I know a lot about my opponents."<br/>
<br/>
"Can I suppress and deal with these competitors as I did with Meng Chong and others before?" Ning Zhuo couldn't help but think.<br/>
<br/>
Since entering the Immortal Palace, he had relied on his exceptional skills, years of accumulation, and a significant early advantage to firmly control the overall situation of the Lava Immortal Palace route.<br/>
<br/>
Despite frequent unexpected events, Ning Zhuo had risked his life multiple times to stabilize the situation and ultimately reach this point.<br/>
<br/>
His gains were enormous.<br/>
<br/>
"Given the current situation, Meng Chong can be temporarily set aside. Zhu Xuanji is the main threat."<br/>
<br/>
"What exactly is the Mechanical Demon General? How was it lost in the first place?"<br/>
<br/>
"If Zhu Xuanji retrieves it, will it grant him a second-grade position?" Ning Zhuo was puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
He lacked a comprehensive understanding of the positions and grades within the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit..." Ning Zhuo called out again with deep emotion.<br/>
<br/>
In the main hall, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit pretended not to hear.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit dared not continue communicating with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
It had observed many times and was very clear: Ning Zhuo was not a normal sixteen-year-old boy!<br/>
<br/>
He was extremely shrewd and had a very deep mind.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had witnessed Ning Zhuo playing the four major forces of Fire Persimmon Immortal City like a fiddle.<br/>
<br/>
In its view, Ning Zhuo's opportunities and combat power were excellent, but his most outstanding qualities were always his strategy and tactics.<br/>
<br/>
"He's a little monster."<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had long decided to minimize its communication time and frequency with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The more it said, the more flaws it would reveal.<br/>
<br/>
A single careless word might expose its disguise to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
After calling out for a while without any response from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Ning Zhuo sighed in disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
He really wanted to stop Zhu Xuanji, but how could he do that?<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was a Golden Core Stage cultivator with strong investigative abilities.<br/>
<br/>
However, he hadn't continued his investigation but had instead focused his important time and energy on the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
This was a good thing for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Now, should Ning Zhuo actively provoke such a person?<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking about it gave Ning Zhuo a headache.<br/>
<br/>
Facing Qi Refining Stage cultivators like Zheng Jie, Zhou Zeshen, and Meng Chong, he could barely control the situation with his accumulation and methods.<br/>
<br/>
But once he faced a Golden Core Stage existence, he immediately felt his own insignificance.<br/>
<br/>
"I am still too weak."<br/>
<br/>
"Although I am at the peak of the ninth layer of the Qi Refining Stage, this cultivation still needs to be purified and refined."<br/>
<br/>
"After all, I am only at the Qi Refining Stage. Even if I advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage, there is still a significant gap between me and the Golden Core Stage."<br/>
<br/>
"Fortunately, I have obtained the Foundation Establishment method. After returning, I will study it thoroughly and strive to establish my foundation as soon as possible to narrow the gap with my opponents." Ning Zhuo had passed the Buddhist Gate's checkpoint and obtained the Foundation Establishment method.<br/>
<br/>
He was about to start preparing for Foundation Establishment.<br/>
<br/>
At the age of sixteen, he was already preparing for Foundation Establishment! Such an achievement was enormous.<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that from the time he entered the Immortal Palace and changed his cultivation method, less than a year had passed.<br/>
<br/>
Such a rapid cultivation speed was simply astonishing, like a firecracker shooting straight up into the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, relying solely on the rewards and resources within the Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo could not have achieved this.<br/>
<br/>
He had leveraged the Lava Immortal Palace to mobilize several other major cultivation families.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had obtained a massive amount of resources from them, allowing him to reach this point step by step.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he was not only at the peak of the ninth layer of the Qi Refining Stage but also had a large number of subordinates, controlled the black market, and had many sources of income.<br/>
<br/>
His rise had been so rapid that he should have attracted attention, jealousy, and suppression from others.<br/>
<br/>
But with the recruitment order, the Lava Immortal Palace and the foreign cultivators became the main focus of attention.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was overlooked.<br/>
<br/>
This indirectly created a favorable environment for his rise.<br/>
<br/>
Unable to think of a solution, Ning Zhuo had to choose his rewards first.<br/>
<br/>
Each waist token represented a position within the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo casually picked up a waist token.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as it touched his hand, a stream of information was transmitted to his mind.<br/>
<br/>
This was the token of the Abandoned Room's master.<br/>
<br/>
In the Lava Immortal Palace, there was a huge Abandoned Room filled with a large number of discarded items and waste.<br/>
<br/>
These discarded items often required specific methods for proper disposal and could not be casually thrown aside.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, during the disposal process, they could be remelted or recycled.<br/>
<br/>
The Abandoned Room managed these items.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo naturally wouldn't choose this position, so he put the waist token down.<br/>
<br/>
He carefully selected for a while and finally chose the highest-grade position token‚Äîa token for the master of the Medical Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
Once he made his choice, the Medical Pavilion Master Token automatically recognized him as its owner, instantly making him the master of the Medical Pavilion in the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
This was a second-grade position!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could now sense the Medical Pavilion building and oversee its normal operations.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the master, the Medical Pavilion also had positions like medical officers and medicine boys.<br/>
<br/>
As the master of the Medical Pavilion, Ning Zhuo had certain appointment and dismissal rights over these people.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, his hard work in cultivating the Ning family's cultivators, especially his reformation team classmates, was mainly for this purpose.<br/>
<br/>
As long as these people met certain standards, Ning Zhuo could appoint them as members of the Medical Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo was dissatisfied with them, he could dismiss them with a single thought.<br/>
<br/>
Dismissing was much easier than appointing.<br/>
<br/>
The prerequisite for appointment was that the relevant cultivators had to meet the standards of the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
However, there were no such requirements for dismissal.<br/>
<br/>
"Hmm?"<br/>
<br/>
While holding the Medical Pavilion Master Token, Ning Zhuo suddenly sensed that he had a new subordinate.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked closely and found that it was someone he was quite familiar with.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui?"<br/>
<br/>
"How did she become a medical officer in the Medical Pavilion?"<br/>
<br/>
"How did she accumulate so much merit and contribution in such a short time since changing her path?" Ning Zhuo's eyes showed a thoughtful expression.<br/>
<br/>
"Even with the strong support of the Ning family's main branch, such speed is still quite rapid. This indicates that Ning Xiaohui has been living a very tough life recently. She must have been frantically completing tasks to accumulate merit and contributions."<br/>
<br/>
"If I dismiss her from her position now, what will happen?" This thought crossed Ning Zhuo's mind.<br/>
<br/>
In the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui entered the Immortal Palace and arrived in front of the Medical Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, her fists were clenched, and her face was full of excitement and joy.<br/>
<br/>
"Finally, I have finally been promoted to a medical officer in the Medical Pavilion!"<br/>
<br/>
"I have finally achieved my goal."<br/>
<br/>
"This will be a brand new starting point for me."<br/>
<br/>
"From now on, my efficiency in accumulating merit and contributions will far exceed others."<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha..."<br/>
<br/>
"Changing my path and coming here was the right decision!"<br/>
<br/>
"This is a whole new world. With my status as a trial disciple, I have far more advantages than those Golden Core cultivators."<br/>
<br/>
"My efforts during this period have not been in vain; everything has been worth it!" Ning Xiaohui deeply felt that she was being taken care of.<br/>
<br/>
With her status as a trial disciple, she was treated as an insider in the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, Zhu Xuanji and others, even if they were at the Golden Core Stage, were still considered outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the position of a medical officer in the Medical Pavilion was not available to outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Xiaohui was in the Medical Pavilion, and with her position as a medical officer, she was assigned a mechanical workbench.<br/>
<br/>
"Let me see if there are any new tasks that can earn me more contributions."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui looked closely, and the next moment, her eyes widened in shock.<br/>
<br/>
"This is?!"<br/>
<br/>
She saw a mechanical construct.<br/>
<br/>
A mechanical construct that left a deep impression on her.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Blood Battle Ape!<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had repeatedly obstructed and tormented her.<br/>
<br/>
It had caused her to fail in the first three checkpoints multiple times, making her performance in exploring the Immortal Palace extremely embarrassing and leaving her unable to hold her head high in the reformation team.<br/>
<br/>
And now, this former nightmare, the culprit that tormented Ning Xiaohui, had become the subject of a repair task assigned to her.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, a teleportation circle appeared in front of Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment of flickering, it delivered the Golden Blood Battle Ape to her.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the Golden Blood Battle Ape on the table, Ning Xiaohui's expression was extremely complex.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, she showed a fierce look.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui looked at the Golden Blood Battle Ape, imagining Ning Zhuo in her mind.<br/>
<br/>
She gritted her teeth and said, "Good, this is perfect!"<br/>
<br/>
"I will repair you with all my might, restoring you to your best condition."<br/>
<br/>
"Then, I will make you the biggest obstacle for those people, inflicting the pain you gave me a hundredfold on them." The more Ning Xiaohui spoke, the more excited she became, her eyes shining brightly.<br/>
<br/>
From the Golden Blood Battle Ape, she saw the hope of revenge.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui focused all her attention and began examining the condition of the Golden Blood Battle Ape.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Blood Battle Ape was mostly damaged, with some areas severely injured.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, Ning Zhuo had used it to forcefully break through the final checkpoint of the Buddhist Gate.<br/>
<br/>
This had left it almost unrecognizable, with some wounds so large that the internal mechanical parts were visible from the outside.<br/>
<br/>
After observing for a while, Ning Xiaohui frowned deeply.<br/>
<br/>
"This Golden Blood Battle Ape is so severely damaged that its true strength is increasingly difficult to exert."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo must have taken advantage of this, no wonder he could repel this mechanical construct." Ning Xiaohui couldn't detect much of the Golden Blood Battle Ape's operational secrets.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, even Ning Zhuo didn't know much about his mechanical construct.<br/>
<br/>
"Even though I don't understand its structure and don't have its mechanical blueprint, these don't prevent me from healing and repairing it."<br/>
<br/>
"My Heavenly Talent Ice Jade Hand is just that unreasonable, hahaha..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui took out a medicine bottle, uncorked it, and poured a dozen pills into her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Then, she sat down cross-legged and began frantically refining the medicinal power, adjusting her state to its best.<br/>
<br/>
She fully activated her Heavenly Talent, freezing the Golden Blood Battle Ape in a huge block of ice.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui exerted all her strength, pushing her talent to the limit, while blood slowly seeped from her seven orifices.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit muttered to itself, "Ning Xiaohui, do you really have to go this far?"<br/>
<br/>
Although the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could fully understand Ning Xiaohui's actions, as an observer, it was also very clear: the Golden Blood Battle Ape was Ning Zhuo's mechanical construct, his most important general in controlling the Lava Immortal Palace's assessment, bar none.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but wonder, "If Ning Xiaohui finds out in the future that the Golden Blood Battle Ape she painstakingly repaired is the mechanical construct of the person she hates the most, what kind of reaction will she have?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't imagine such a scene and couldn't help but look forward to it.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, its expression changed.<br/>
<br/>
Using the Lava Immortal Palace, its gaze penetrated through layers of space and fixed on Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Since obtaining the Mechanical Demon General, Zhu Xuanji had been focused on its repair work.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the broken left arm of the Mechanical Demon General had been newly reattached.<br/>
<br/>
For this, Zhu Xuanji had been working day and night, busy to the point of exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
When the royal family's reply reached him, his expression was momentarily dazed before he reacted.<br/>
<br/>
Back then, Zhu Xuanji had written to the royal family seeking help to find the true scripture by investigating the little ape.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the royal family's reply had arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji unfolded the letter and saw the royal family's unique encrypted text.<br/>
<br/>
This didn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
In his mind, Zhu Xuanji quickly translated the encrypted text.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the appearance of Yuan Dasheng as an adult and in old age emerged in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
"Yuan Dasheng?!" Zhu Xuanji was stunned.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, he stood still like a statue.<br/>
<br/>
But in his mind, thoughts were swirling like a storm, turning everything upside down!<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit excitedly stood up, its four claws on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Although it couldn't understand the contents of the royal family's reply, just seeing Zhu Xuanji's drastic change in expression, it could guess a thing or two.<br/>
<br/>
"Find Ning Zhuo, find Ning Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
"He is the real culprit, the mastermind."<br/>
<br/>
"Catch him, catch him quickly."<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha."<br/>
<br/>
Anticipating Zhu Xuanji's imminent capture of Ning Zhuo, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely excited, its face full of joy.<br/>
<br/>
It was very eager, wishing to see this scene happen in the next moment!</div>
