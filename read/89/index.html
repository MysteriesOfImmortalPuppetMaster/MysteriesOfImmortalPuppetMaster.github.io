<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Clan cultivators entered one after another, pouring into Ning Zhuo’s small courtyard with expressionless faces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">They fanned out to the left and right, subtly placing themselves all around Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A few others were stationed along the perimeter of the residence, scanning their surroundings with vigilance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Ze and Ning Fan stood in front of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Ze concisely explained the purpose of their visit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows. “I do have a lot of spirit stones, but that’s my own business. What does it have to do with the clan?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“You came all the way here just to ask about this, Uncle?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The youthful and tender face of the boy was full of confusion and disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Fan remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Ze shook his head slightly. His expression was solemn as he said, “Little Zhuo, you’re still young. It’s understandable that you don’t grasp these things. Just tell us the truth and explain where all that money came from.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">But Ning Zhuo shook his head, troubled. “Sorry, Uncle, but I can’t say tell you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Ze and Ning Fan were momentarily stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Ze lowered his voice and his face grew graver. “Why can’t you tell us? At a critical moment like this, you’re still hiding things?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo shrugged. His tone was casual, yet also revealed the stubbornness characteristic of youth. “What’s the big deal? It’s my own money. I’ll spend it however I want.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Ze became agitated. “Little Zhuo, you don’t comprehend your current situation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Do you think you’re still the same as before?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“You’re not!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Now, you are someone the clan is focusing on cultivating, the second most important figure in the recultivation team. Don’t you understand?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Someone has reported you, claiming that you’re squandering money and in possession of a mysterious fortune of unknown origin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Just when the clan is investing in you, offering you every kind of support, this happens! Don’t you think you owe everyone an explanation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Little Zhuo, your view of the world is too simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“In the past, you were unknown and unremarkable. No one paid attention to you, so these things didn’t matter. But now that you’re at the peak of the third level, everyone is watching you. Every little flaw will be magnified, seized upon by those with ill intent, and used against you with full force to bring you down!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Now that you’re acting so suspiciously, they’ll spread rumors about you, saying that you’re secretly being funded by another clan, that you’ve turned traitor, or that you’re a spy sent to infiltrate our family. Doesn’t the clan have to investigate this thoroughly? How else can we be at ease?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Ze spoke at length, his tone both firm and earnest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo fell silent for a long while before finally saying, “Uncle, there are indeed hidden reasons behind this. But I can assure you, I’ve done nothing wicked or immoral. The money was obtained righteously. My conscience is clear!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Ze shot him a glare and almost grabbed Ning Zhuo by the ear. “Damn it, was I wasting my time talking just now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Did you even hear me?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“You say your conscience is clear, but who can prove that? Who will believe it?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Fine. If you really didn’t do anything wrong, say it clearly. Right now, you need to prove yourself to the clan!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo still said nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Are you listening to me?” Ning Ze raised his voice, his brows furrowing in frustration as his face twisted in barely restrained anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo sighed and finally revealed a bit more. “Uncle, you are my closest relative. Please believe me, I really haven’t done anything wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“But this matter is something I really can’t speak of.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“I made a contract with someone. If I speak, I’ll suffer backlash from the contract.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Ze was stunned, then his brows furrowed even tighter. “What kind of situation would lead you to sign a contract like that?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Aiya, you kid, you’re driving me mad!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Ze pointed at Ning Zhuo, his finger trembling with urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo just lowered his head and stayed silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Ze looked at him, then turned to Ning Fan beside him, forcing a smile. In a low voice, he said, “Brother Ning Fan, could you give us a moment? I’d like to speak with my nephew alone.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Fan looked conflicted. “You know I was sent here specifically to supervise...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At this point, Ning Ze couldn’t afford to care and quickly sent a voice transmission, offering some benefits for the favor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Fan hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “You two have promising futures. I’d rather not offend you. Fine, I’ll give you half a cup of tea’s worth of time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Ze led Ning Zhuo into the house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Speak. Whatever you couldn’t say before, say it now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“It’s just the two of us here.” Ning Ze’s face was grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo said, “Uncle, I told you the truth already. I’m not lying. I really did sign a contract and can’t say anything about it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Ze glared, jabbing his finger at Ning Zhuo’s forehead. Through gritted teeth, he said, “Ning Zhuo, do you understand how serious this is?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“The clan values you now, extremely so. That’s why they’ve sent out a special investigation team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“To prevent any misunderstandings, they even sent me to talk to you personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“This is your best chance to come clean. If you miss it, the consequences could be huge!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Ze inhaled deeply. “Fine. Even if you’re bound by a contract, it’s not the end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“You must understand, where there’s a lock, there’s a key.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Just tell me what kind of contract it is. With the clan’s strength, removing it might still be possible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo shook his head. “Uncle, I think this matter is best left untouched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Sigh, if you insist, I’ll tell you just one thing – this involved a Golden Core stage cultivator!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“What?” Ning Ze was shocked and subconsciously took a step backward. “You… you’re not lying to me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The strongest person in the Ning Clan, the old ancestor, was also at the Golden Core stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo sighed. “Why would I lie to you, Uncle?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“That’s why it’s better to leave this matter alone. Let’s end things here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“If the clan can’t trust me, I’ll withdraw from the recultivation team and will no longer participate in the exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Ze stomped in anger. “Little Zhuo, how can you spout such nonsense?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“I had to spend a lot of money to get you into the recultivation team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“You think you can quit just because you want to?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Even if you quit now, the clan will definitely investigate everything about you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“You, you... just what have you been doing?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“How did things end up like this?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Tell me, just who is that Golden Core cultivator. It… it’s not the black shadow demonic cultivator, is it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">At these words, Ning Ze’s pupils contracted violently, and a chill ran down his spine. He took another step backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The next moment, he sent a voice transmission to Ning Zhuo, demanding sharply, “Quick, tell me! Does it have anything to do with the black shadow demonic cultivator?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo frowned. “Uncle, don’t force me. I can’t say it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“How could you... actually sign a contract like that. Aiya, aiya. You… you’ve doomed our whole family… our whole clan!” Ning Ze slapped his thigh in frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo sighed. “Uncle, I had no choice.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Upon hearing that, Ning Ze could not help but become even more convinced that the black shadow demonic cultivator was indeed involved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He paced back and forth with his hands behind his back, then suddenly stopped and stared intently at Ning Zhuo. “Little Zhuo, this matter is extremely serious. You can't avoid it just because you want to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Today, we must get to the bottom of things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“Don't blame me. It's all because you did something wrong!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo was startled and quickly said, “Uncle, it’s not as serious as you think...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But Ning Ze shook his head, eager to distance himself from Ning Zhuo and prove his own innocence. He strode outside and said to Ning Fan, “My nephew did indeed sign a contract. What should we do next?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“Does the clan have any means to break the contract? The key point is that this matter involves a certain Golden Core cultivator.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Fan was shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He paused for a moment, then his expression darkened. “This is a major issue, but as long as the contract wasn’t personally formed by a Golden Core cultivator, we can try breaking it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“But are you certain?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Right now, Ning Zhuo can’t reveal any details about the contract, and we’ll have to test different things. In the process, he may receive unavoidable harm.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded firmly. “This investigation was ordered from above, and the entire clan is watching. If we don’t go this far, how can we give a proper report? Do it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Fan’s eyes flickered. “You are Ning Zhuo’s uncle and the chief officer of this investigation. It’s your call.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“However, it would be best if Ning Zhuo cooperates voluntarily. Things would go much easier then.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Just as Ning Fan finished speaking, Ning Zhuo said, “I refuse!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Ze turned back and glared. “Unfilial son, this is not up to you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Ze looked around and shouted in a low voice, “Still not making a move?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Fan sighed and gave a discreet hand signal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Two sturdy men from the investigation team stepped forward, one on each side, and grabbed Ning Zhuo. With a burst of magical power, they easily subdued him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Fan took out a magic artifact and handed it to Ning Ze. “This is the Thought-Capturing Father-Son Bracelet. You wear the father bracelet, and place the son bracelet on Ning Zhuo’s wrist. You’ll then be able to extract his thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“As the saying goes, none know the son better than the father.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Although Ning Zhuo is bound by a contract and cannot speak the truth, his thoughts are not restricted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“As long as we forcibly extract the related thoughts from his divine sea, we can learn the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“But doing so may trigger the backlash of the contract. Our investigation team will do its best to suppress it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Moreover, the act of forcibly capturing thoughts itself can damage the divine sea. To avoid that, it’s best if young friend Ning Zhuo cooperates willingly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo was pinned down and could only struggle in place. “I refuse. I absolutely refuse!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Ze snorted coldly and placed the bracelets on himself and Ning Zhuo. “Little Zhuo, you’re being stubborn. As your elder, and the closest person to you in this world, how can I allow you to continue down this errant path?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“Cooperate. It’ll be less painful that way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo refused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Ze’s face turned icy, and he activated the Father-Son Bracelet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The pair of bracelets on their wrists emitted a bluish-white glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">A powerful suction force entered Ning Zhuo’s divine sea. Just as it was about to rampage within, it collided with the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">If the suction force was a fierce wind, then the treasure seal was an unmoving mountain, perfectly guarding Ning Zhuo’s divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo’s eyes rolled back, his body convulsed in the chair, and two streams of blood flowed from his nostrils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">With an expressionless face, Ning Ze continued urging the Father-Son Bracelets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Some thoughts that Ning Zhuo had prepared ahead of time offered themselves up. Just as they were about to be captured by the suction force…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">A loud sound echoed out, and the doors to the house were flung open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Seeing the scene in the hall, junior patriarch Ning Xiaoren immediately flew into a rage and roared out, “Stop!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
