<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The figure of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King completely overshadowed Gao Cuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Compared to the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, Gao Cuo appeared as tiny as an ant beside an elephant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Insignificant, weak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Indeed, this was the reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Starlight Sword Qi barely scratched the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King's skin, while the Azure Lotus Sword Qi was continuously shattered under the sweeping roots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sword Elder spoke in a solemn tone: "Little Gao, the enemy is strong, and we are weak. We must escape. Soon, I'll demonstrate the sword technique I'm most proud of in my life. Watch closely! It has saved me countless times, but now, using it once will consume an enormous amount of my energy, and it will take years to recover."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Hearing this, Gao Cuo's spirit immediately lifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sword Technique - Life Guide!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sword Elder controlled Gao Cuo's body, shaping his fingers into a sword gesture and pointing downward. Sword Qi condensed at the fingertips, becoming almost tangible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">A halo of moonlight rippled across the sword's edge, and droplets of dew hung from its tip, as though it had just brushed across a cold pond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The sword form manifested as a pattern of the Southern Dipper constellation, with sword Qi overflowing, transforming the surrounding Qi into vigorous life energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"As the saying goes, 'The Northern Dipper governs death, the Southern Dipper governs life!'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Sword Elder timely explained to Gao Cuo: "During my lifetime, I once encountered a rare opportunity, entering the Heavenly Path Palace and passing a challenging trial, I had the opportunity to read the Theory of Heavenly Fate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“From it, I comprehended this sword technique.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“The fate of all things is like silk threads, interwoven into a limitless web of calamity. Each intersection represents a critical junction of karmic decisions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Once this sword technique is mastered, using Sword Intent as the shuttle and the Nascent Soul as the guide, one can instantly see the intertwined threads of destiny clearly unfolding.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">At this point, Sword Elder suddenly widened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In this instant, his gaze sharpened dramatically, his vision transforming drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Everything in the world blurred and became illusory, even the Dragon King Ginseng appeared indistinct. Numerous fate threads emerged vividly, colored in bright green, withered yellow, precious blue, and others, clearly interwoven.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Some threads were murderous paths wrapped in blood-red threads, others burning knots entangled by karmic flames, and some intertwined threads of black and white - representing life and death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Gao Cuo! Look carefully! Find our path to survival!" Even in this critical moment, Sword Elder didn't forget to guide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Gao Cuo desperately observed, yet saw everywhere only life-and-death threads, murderous paths, and tangled karmic knots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Gao Cuo panicked and murmured softly, “Sword Elder, I…I can't see it, can't discover it, can't find our path to survival!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Sword Elder paused briefly and then finally admitted, “Neither can I!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Gao Cuo: ???</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sword Technique - Life Guide, failed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The spell's failure instantly caused a severe backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Gao Cuo spat out a mouthful of blood; countless thoughts in his spiritual sea scattered like bubbles blown away by the wind. His mind trembled violently, nearly fainting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Earlier, the Ginseng Dragon King sensed Gao Cuo's extraordinary aura, profound and mysterious as though it resonated with the natural laws of heaven and earth, making him cautious and fully vigilant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But Gao Cuo’s failure revealed a significant flaw. The Dragon King Ginseng immediately seized the opportunity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Demonic Technique - Dragon Whisker Binding Heaven!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Instantly, countless ginseng whiskers rapidly expanded, piercing through space, embedding deeply into the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The void held the immense power to grind down and dissolve all physical entities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Even the ginseng roots of the Dragon King were swiftly consumed and damaged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Yet the life-force within Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King was as vast as an ocean. However much the whiskers were damaged, an equal amount of vitality surged forth, healing rapidly and countering the destructive force of the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Thus, the Dragon King seized complete control of the surrounding space, firmly preventing any Nascent Soul from escaping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Achieving this, he continued the assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Countless ginseng whiskers surged from all directions like a coordinated hunt of dragons, not leaving Gao Cuo any opportunity to escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In no time, Gao Cuo was thoroughly bound by numerous ginseng whiskers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Gao Cuo and Sword Elder were captured alive!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“A remnant soul of a Soul Formation-level Sword Cultivator... Tell me, who sent you to impersonate the Old Stone Monster and lure me into your trap?” The spiritual thoughts of Dragon King Ginseng brutally invaded Gao Cuo's spirit sea, overwhelmingly dominating and condensing into a gigantic figure of his true form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Gao Cuo: ……</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sword Elder: ……</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After a long pause, Gao Cuo responded within his spirit sea, “It was our own plan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Dragon King Ginseng laughed angrily at this, "Hahaha! Still stubborn even when in my grasp. Good, I admire your backbone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"But do you think this god lacks methods of severe torture?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Take them back and slowly deal with them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Sword Elder sighed: “Divine One, you misunderstand. We're telling the truth; there’s no need for us to hide anything.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Dragon King Ginseng ignored them completely, focusing only on binding them securely and sealing them tightly. Even the towering dragon form within Gao Cuo’s spirit sea slowly closed its eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Gao Cuo cried out in despair: “Dragon King, you've truly misunderstood!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Still so stubborn…” Dragon King Ginseng sneered internally. Even an entity like him couldn't help but feel furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He had fallen into their trap, misled by the fake Old Stone Monster, abandoning the frontline battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Old Stone Monster was tremendously significant to the Dragon King, crucial to his fundamental control over the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"If Du Tiechuan and I end up severely injured again... Old Stone Monster has already advanced to the Soul Formation stage. He wouldn’t even need to confront my true body; merely refining the earth veins of the Thousand Peaks Forest would suffice to steal away my foundation and resources, turning them into his own!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Dragon King had invested extensively in the earth veins of the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Unfortunately for him, Old Stone Monster was originally born from a ten-thousand-year-old earth spirit, naturally excelling at manipulating earth veins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">This was precisely why Ginseng Dragon King had vehemently suppressed Lu Hongtu and Old Stone Monster when they attempted to map the earth veins of the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Old Stone Monster... Back then, I fought against him and thoroughly gauged his potential; it was impossible for him to ascend to Soul Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Who could have imagined the Two Note Kingdom, seeking to pacify the Thousand Peaks Forest, would pay such an enormous price to secretly support a foreign monster."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Thinking about this, the Dragon King recalled a certain piece of intelligence. The intelligence speculated that Hu Dao, favored by the ruler of the Two Note Kingdom, was likely a demon cultivator with an extraordinary background!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Simply being a demon cultivator wouldn’t justify paying such a high price to forcefully elevate another demon cultivator to the Soul Formation stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Such generosity and courage could probably only come from the old ancestors of the Bloodslaughter Imperial Dynasty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Back then, I rejected their offer. Is that why they're scheming against me now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Hmph! A bunch of country fools unable to see reality, dreaming of restoring a fallen dynasty!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Dragon King pondered deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He didn't think at all that this was merely Gao Cuo’s individual action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Because the timing was far too coincidental.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"I've fallen into their trap!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The frontline battlefield might be in danger. The outcome has probably already been decided."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"No, even if not yet... this is likely a trap to lure me into action."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"How could I, the Dragon King, fall for the same trap again and again?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">As the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King thought this far, turmoil suddenly erupted within him, causing his powerful body to shake violently with intense pain, as if blades were churning through his belly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This injury was inflicted by Du Tiechuan's sword qi during their first confrontation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Even now, the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King hadn't fully healed. The residual sword qi within him was exceptionally tenacious, embodying an unyielding "Iron Wall" nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He had tried all methods available, but none had yielded significant results. The only option left was to slowly wear it down with his own vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Thank you, Lord Dragon King, for driving away the enemy!" Azure Vine Healer Bi Tengyi reappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">She had condensed a new body, but her expression was gloomy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">She could have achieved a better, more perfect form. However, due to Gao Cuo's interference, she had to compromise significantly in exchange for speed, resulting in a body far inferior to what she'd originally planned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Dragon King tossed out a single remark, "This time I've been tricked. The Thousand Peak Forest will face a grave crisis. Still, as long as I remain alive, the Thousand Peak Forest will not be completely conquered. You're on your own now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">With that, the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King left immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">On the frontline battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The main encampment of the Two Note Kingdom remained the core combat zone of this second great battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">This place had the fiercest fighting intensity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Even with the protection of the Light Mountain Heavy Mist Painting, Lu Hongtu found it difficult to remain unscathed. Currently, his clothing was disheveled and stained with blood. His face was pale, and he coughed lightly, sending a message via divine sense to Elder Long: "Elder Long, we should retreat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"No, I haven't lost yet!" Elder Long attacked fiercely, fighting valiantly in every direction, radiating imposing might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Lu Hongtu glanced across the entire battlefield and sighed deeply, "The tide has already turned against us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Apart from the Nascent Soul cultivators in the central combat zone, the situation on the vast majority of the battlefield was already crystal clear: the allied forces of Thousand Peak Forest were collapsing on a large scale, while the morale of the Two Note Kingdom’s troops surged, cutting down countless foes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The remaining Thousand Peak Forest armies were like isolated reefs - though they still stood firm temporarily, it was just a matter of time before they were overwhelmed by waves of enemy soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Elder Long was certainly aware of the situation, yet he resolutely rejected retreating: "No! As long as we keep fighting, there is still hope."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"We have not lost, nor can we lose!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Finally unable to contain his anxiety, Lu Hongtu took the initiative to ask: "Our current strength is nothing but an illusion. If Du Tiechuan personally joins the battle, how will we resist?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Elder Long paused briefly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He instantly understood what Lu Hongtu was really questioning - there was only one implication: whether or not the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King would appear and join the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">It was no wonder Lu Hongtu harbored doubts. If the Dragon King intended to fight, he had just missed a perfect opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Allowing their army to collapse so extensively would inevitably result in catastrophic losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">This second great battle was already a severe blow to the entire Thousand Peak Forest alliance - truly damaging their foundations!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Any minimally competent leader would never allow this to happen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Yet now, it had indeed happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Elder Long fell silent for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Divine One…" he murmured silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">As a leader, he was well aware of the Dragon King's whereabouts, knowing he had gone to the Azure Vine Peak to engage the Old Stone Monster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Such a trip would inevitably take considerable time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">And the possibility of the Dragon King not returning increased significantly. After all, Old Stone Monster was at the Soul Formation stage, and after a fierce battle, the Dragon King would undoubtedly be in poor condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"What I must do is rally as many people as possible, firmly anchoring myself here like a nail, pinning down Du Tiechuan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"I must prevent him from joining that fight and sabotaging the Divine One's plan to subdue or kill Old Stone Monster!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Elder Long had long prepared himself mentally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Thus, in the next moment, he transmitted via spiritual consciousness to Lu Hongtu: "Haha, strategist, you are overly cautious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Our lord hasn't made his move yet, naturally having his own deeper considerations. We mere Nascent Soul cultivators, how can we understand his profound intentions?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Besides, Du Tiechuan hasn't appeared yet. Perhaps our lord is already secretly engaging him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“A mere defeat is nothing to worry about!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“As long as our lord is victorious and Du Tiechuan is slain, The Two Note Kingdom would lose a Soul Formation expert and be deeply wounded. Would the Kingdom dare provoke my Thousand Peaks Forest again?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Lu Hongtu subconsciously narrowed his eyes and, after a moment's pause, replied, "Elder Long speaks reasonably!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In truth, he was not persuaded by Elder Long's words, but rather impressed by his actual deeds - he had remained committed to the fight without any sign of retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Recollecting this, Lu Hongtu temporarily steadied himself and fought even more fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Martial Technique: Dragon Terror!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The dragon roars shook the skies; each palm strike formed illusions of flying dragons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Dragon energy erupted violently, inflicting countless casualties on the White Jade Battalion, sending severed limbs flying in every direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Hold your ground! Stand firm!" Shuang Jing's face was deathly pale, and her sharp cries carried panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Elder Long and the White Jade Battalion were old rivals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">In the previous ambush, Elder Long personally led the attack, nearly annihilating the entire White Jade Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">This battle was even more devastating for the White Jade Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Damn it! My 'Gao Sheng’s Legacy Writings' were stolen by that accursed Old Stone Monster. If only I still had it, I'd at least match blows with Elder Long!" Shuang Jing inwardly raged, his hatred for Old Stone Monster deepening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Divine Ability: Vitality Collapse Explosion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Elder Long instantly released all the vitality he had stored and absorbed from the environment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">His body grew taller and broader, swelling to an astonishing degree, almost bursting through his armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Seeing this, Shuang Jing was shocked, "He...he can still unleash such divine techniques once more?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">They could not hold!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The White Jade Battalion was already struggling against Elder Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">With Elder Long's strength soaring yet again, he crushed through the White Jade Battalion's formations with overwhelming force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">“Well done,” Elder Long commented, blood dripping from his mouth and nose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Clearly, he had already surpassed his physical limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Elder Long charged directly towards Shuang Ling’s body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The Mechanical Princess screamed, quickly activating a mechanism to return her Nascent Soul instantly back to her true body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">With the Nascent Soul back in control, her physical body immediately opened its eyes and used her escape techniques, desperately fleeing from Elder Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Unexpectedly, Elder Long turned abruptly, attacking the mechanical puppet, the Flexible Bone Mystic Maiden instead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">“Oh no, it’s a trap!” Realizing this, Shuang Ling’s heart sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Now, her control over the Flexible Bone Mystic Maiden was far weaker compared to before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Elder Long attacked thrice in succession, cornering the construct until escape was impossible, and delivered a simple yet devastating shoulder charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">This seemingly ordinary attack exploded The Flexible Bone Mystic Maiden apart instantly, sending mechanical parts scattering everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Shuang Ling paled slightly, suffering minor backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Her expression worsened as Elder Long, after dealing with the puppet, he immediately turned towards her again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Having lost her strongest construct and exhausted from prolonged fighting, Shuang Ling’s strength had sharply declined. Unable to confront Elder Long, she could only retreat repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Yet Elder Long did not pursue persistently. Halfway through the chase, he suddenly changed course, targeting the Commander's tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">“Du Tiechuan! Come out here and face your death!” Elder Long’s furious roar echoed across the battlefield, stunning Lu Hongtu, Shuang Ling, Ning Zhuo, and the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Directly challenging a Soul Formation cultivator - only someone as fearlessly brave as the Elder Long would dare!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
