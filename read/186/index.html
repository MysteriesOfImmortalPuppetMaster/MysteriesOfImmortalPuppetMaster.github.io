<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 186: Slaughtering Kin and Exterminating the Clan?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The floating clouds were deep, and Ning Zhuo was silently cultivating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">At times, he was surrounded by five colors, his aura fluctuating; at times, his vital blood surged, demonic energy was dense; at times, he was solemn and dignified, his face full of Buddha light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">After experimenting with the three techniques, he gained a more intuitive and profound understanding of the subsequent techniques from the seventh to the ninth layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"These three techniques all retain their greatest advantage from beforeâ€”fast cultivation speed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"But if I were to cultivate according to the original method, the time required would be at least three times more than before!" This is because the techniques from the seventh to the ninth layers have a new advantageâ€”thickness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Whether it is divine sense, mana, or vital blood, they are much thicker than those cultivated by ordinary techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Although the advantage of cultivation speed remains, the standard total amount cultivated is three times higher, so the cultivation time is also extended by three times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">What made Ning Zhuo frown even more was another point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"From the seventh layer onwards, these three techniques start to correspond with each other." "Small realms are fine, but the major realms must advance and retreat in unison, which is quite troublesome."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In other words, the three techniques must simultaneously enter the seventh, eighth, and ninth layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">However, one can be in the early stage of the seventh layer, another in the mid-stage of the seventh layer, and the third at the peak of the seventh layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Previously, Ning Zhuo had a divine sea cultivation at the sixth layer, while the other two techniques were at the fifth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This situation is absolutely not allowed in the subsequent techniques from the seventh to the ninth layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">According to the techniques, if this situation occurs, it will greatly affect the success rate of forming the foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo understood the reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Because this involves the unification of the three fields!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">It was mentioned before that after the Qi Refining Stage is the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Qi Refining Stage has three main cultivation paths: the upper dantian divine sea, the middle dantian qi sea, and the lower dantian essence sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">For most techniques, they specialize in one dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Therefore, there is no concern in this regard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">But for excellent or top-tier techniques, they specialize in more than one dantian, often involving two dantians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">No matter which two dantians they are, unification is required.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">For example, the unification of spirit and qi, the unification of mind, or the harmony of essence and qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">For the three sects' techniques, he has to achieve even moreâ€”the unification of the three treasures: essence, qi, and spirit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This unification is not about merging the three dantians into one but about unifying their auras, making them seem like one, truly opening the path to the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Without this unification, Ning Zhuo's cultivation of these three techniques would be like randomly cultivating three incompatible techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">When it comes to impacting the Foundation Establishment Stage, failure is inevitable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">All three dantians have cultivation, and as long as there is a slight disharmony, without distinguishing the primary from the secondary, it will cause severe conflict, leading to failure in impacting the Foundation Establishment Stage, and the three fields will counteract and damage each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">At best, it will affect the cultivation foundation, causing a fall from genius to waste; at worst, it will pose a life-threatening risk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This is the main reason why cultivating all three dantians is still very rare in today's highly developed cultivation world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo summarized: The three sects' techniques maintain the advantage of cultivation speed in the later stages of Qi Refining, but the time is extended by three times, and the three techniques must advance and retreat together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He immediately thought of the difficulties involved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"In this way, my divine sea cultivation cannot progress too quickly." "I must also consider the progress of the other two fields."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Fortunately, the small realms can be inconsistent. I can still use Ice Jade Wine daily to boost my qi sea cultivation." "But what about the cultivation of the essence sea?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo's cultivation in the essence sea has always been the slowest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">It's not that he lacks talent in this area or that it is really slow, but compared to the rapid progress of the divine sea and the boosted qi sea, the essence sea has always been the last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Previously, this was not a problem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">But now, according to the later techniques of the three sects, this is the biggest shortcoming in Ning Zhuo's cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Although I have obtained the subsequent techniques, new problems have also emerged."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo only glanced at the later content of the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique and felt his divine sea cultivation vaguely surge, with a tendency to cross into the seventh layer, scaring him into quickly dispelling all related thoughts in his divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">His qi sea cultivation had also reached the peak of the sixth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Only the essence sea cultivation was lagging behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"I must fully enhance my essence sea cultivation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Most of the research on the essence sea comes from demonic techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo had little exposure to this area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">His knowledge mainly came from the Ning family's public library, and his expertise in mechanical techniques mainly came from his mother's legacy books.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Although he had also collected intelligence in the black market for many years and paid attention to collecting books.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But the cultivation techniques, spells, etc., that fell into this market were generally of low quality (after all, Fire Persimmon Immortal City is a new city).</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Unless he got lucky or attended certain auctions, it was difficult to buy high-quality techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Demonic techniques were also items targeted and banned by the authorities, making them hard to acquire from regular markets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Before the age of sixteen, Ning Zhuo firmly believed in walking the righteous path and had little desire for demonic techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He never thought that the techniques of the Lava Immortal Palace would involve cultivating all three paths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This made his preparation and accumulation in demonic techniques seriously mismatched with his actual needs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Fortunately, he had an elder brother who came from a major demonic sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo consulted Sun Lingtong on this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Sun Lingtong gave a straightforward answer: "It's very simple." "To enhance essence blood cultivation is actually the easiest." "But Little Zhuo, you definitely can't do it." "Elder Brother, just tell me." Ning Zhuo pressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong then gave an answer that made Ning Zhuo's face change slightly, and he immediately shook his head: "I can't do it, I can't do it!" Sun Lingtong's method was simple: relatives of the same sect, sharing the same bloodline.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Terrifying demonic cultivators, for their own benefit, slaughtered numerous kin to gain rapid progress in cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The key is, as long as demonic cultivators focus on refining and purifying, this method really has no side effects!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo was unwilling: "Brother Sun, is there no other way?" Sun Lingtong did propose a few solutions, but they all had extremely high thresholds or were distant solutions that couldn't solve immediate problems.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">What should he do?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo had no choice but to fully focus on cultivating the essence sea while paying attention to collecting relevant information, hoping to find such opportunities and chances in the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Sun Lingtong comforted him: "This isn't really a bottleneck; it's still steady progress. This is clearly a normal cultivation speed, yet you are dissatisfied." Ning Zhuo sighed and shared his concerns with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Fire Persimmon Immortal City was becoming crowded, with outsiders constantly being attracted by the recruitment order to explore the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo felt the pressure growing day by day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He had to give his all, race against time, and do everything possible to increase his chances of seizing the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He would not forgive himself for any slack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Alas, Little Zhuo is pushing himself too hard." Sun Lingtong sighed inwardly but did not persuade him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Because he knew very well the significance of the Lava Immortal Palace to Ning Zhuo's life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He also knew that any persuasion would be meaningless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The best help he could provide was to fully support Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This is why Sun Lingtong, despite being wanted, risked staying in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He always hid in underground bases, moving every once in a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">For his personality, this kind of life was more torturous than imprisonment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But Sun Lingtong endured it all, just to stay close to Ning Zhuo and see if there was anything he could do to help his little brother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He didn't know that his situation was even more dangerous than Ning Zhuo'sâ€”he had already been targeted by Luo Shang of the Soul Devouring Sect and Yang Chanyu of the Void Sect, both Golden Core true disciples.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">When he rotated back to the previous underground base, he would fall into the enemy's trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo's small courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Good, this Mechanical Fire Monkey is of excellent quality, I'll buy it." Ning Zhuo took out money and bought a mechanical monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Recently, he had been doing this more frequently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Mm, you modified and created this jet tube based on the Lava Immortal Palace's mechanical diagrams?" After receiving a positive answer, Ning Zhuo also bought the jet mechanical tube as encouragement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After Ning Xiaohui left the reformation team, the remaining main branch members were already few in number, and now lacking a backbone, they were completely negligible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Ning family's reformation team was entirely under Ning Zhuo's control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo actively arranged for the reformation team members to accumulate mechanical technique expertise in various workshops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">After a period of fermentation, the results were visibly outstanding!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This made Ning Zhuo suspect whether the Ning family was originally a family specializing in mechanical techniques, and now focusing on ice and snow techniques was a deviation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">A former deacon at the Foundation Establishment Stage clarified his doubts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">This former deacon had participated in the selection of personnel at high levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo then understood that the reformation team members were not randomly chosen but were carefully selected by the Ning family high-ups from a large pool, specifically those suitable for mechanical techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"The more people in the family, the more talents suitable for different cultivation arts." "From the family's perspective, the more people, the better, it's simply more the merrier." The carefully selected personnel of the Ning family now fell into Ning Zhuo's hands, for his use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong's former black market was also under Ning Zhuo's control, with profits skyrocketing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Everything has its pros and cons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Many outsiders flocking to the Immortal City brought him immense competition pressure, but also more transactions and more income.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo's funds were increasing rapidly, accumulating at an unprecedented speed, even though he was constantly spending.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">When he donated to the orphanage, he gave a sum of spirit stones more generous than he had planned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The rewards for the next generation of the Ning family Foundation Establishment were rapidly decreasing as a proportion of total income.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo also invested a large sum in secretly collecting intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He collected a lot of information on demonic techniques for accelerated cultivation, but most were unreliable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo, with his intelligence sensitivity cultivated over ten years, could roughly estimate the credibility of many pieces of information at a glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">He collected a lot of information and clues, but most were just rumors with no value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The vast majority of answers were what Sun Lingtong had mentionedâ€”starting with the kin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Because it involves demonic techniques and concerns the Lava Immortal Palace, I can't approach it through regular channels, nor can I seek help from the three major families." "The current situation is still manageable, but if the essence sea cultivation reaches the seventh layer and the time is extended by three times, it will be unbearable!" Ning Zhuo pondered for many days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">One day, he suddenly had a wonderful inspiration and made a delightful breakthroughâ€”"Wait, I can have mechanical puppets cultivate for me!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
