<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 507: Mu Lan: "My Husband!"</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Du Tiechuan, a Soul Formation-level cultivator specializing in military tactics, was one of the two Great Generals of The Twin Rivers Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
He possessed an innate talent —Iron Wall.<br/>
<br/>
This talent allowed a cultivator to greatly enhance their defense for a short period, standing immovable like a steel fortress. However, while using this talent, the cultivator could not move and had to remain rooted in place.<br/>
<br/>
Due to this major flaw, the Iron Wall talent had always been classified as low-grade.<br/>
<br/>
A low-grade talent seemed unworthy of someone like Du Tiechuan.<br/>
<br/>
Yet true power never lied in talents, magical treasures, or techniques —it lied in the cultivators themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Any talent was merely an opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
How one seized this opportunity and excavated its intrinsic value had always varied from person to person.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of results, Du Tiechuan firmly grasped this opportunity and unearthed an immense treasure from it!<br/>
<br/>
He developed his talent, elevating it into a divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
Even after this elevation, the Iron Wall divine ability remained unremarkable compared to others, with limited applications and low practical value.<br/>
<br/>
But in Du Tiechuan’s hands, he took the Iron Wall divine ability as his core, combined it with his primary cultivation technique, and created a series of military tactics.<br/>
<br/>
Among them, Iron Torrent Flattening the Plains was the most powerful and renowned!<br/>
<br/>
Once activated, this technique could empower soldiers, drastically increasing the entire army’s weight and defense while unifying their strength and form into a cohesive force that continuously accelerated, growing faster and faster. Ultimately, it leveraged overwhelming momentum to deliver unparalleled destructive power.<br/>
<br/>
Its might was like a hurricane —sundering mountains, parting seas, sweeping across heaven and earth, unstoppable.<br/>
<br/>
The army became an iron deluge, crushing all enemies in its path and expanding territories!<br/>
<br/>
Any obstacle blocking the army’s advance would be shattered and ground to dust. Even powerful individual cultivators who dared oppose it would face tens of thousands of iron beasts, an unstoppable force.<br/>
<br/>
This was Du Tiechuan’s trump card, a killer move that could determine the outcome of a war when deployed appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
After the vanguard army was trapped and the situation became unclear, Du Tiechuan dispatched four armies deep into the Thousand Peaks Forest, secretly sending powerful cultivators to escort them.<br/>
<br/>
Once the enemy’s situation was probed, he spent vast resources to rapidly construct the Nine Dragon Shadow Reviewing Platform.<br/>
<br/>
Each army underwent rounds of inspection, allowing Du Tiechuan to temper the troops while selecting the most suitable army to execute the Iron Torrent Flattening the Plains tactic.<br/>
<br/>
After the first round of inspections, many officers guessed Du Tiechuan’s intentions.<br/>
<br/>
That same day, Commander Du issued explicit military orders outlining his plan: he would spend nine days conducting five rounds of inspections. The army that endured until the fifth round would become the main force to execute Iron Torrent Flattening the Plains and launch a full-scale assault on the Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, the entire army erupted in fervent discussion about this tactic.<br/>
<br/>
Past victories had already proven the tactic’s fearsome efficacy.<br/>
<br/>
It could be said this was Du Tiechuan’s unique masterpiece!<br/>
<br/>
“We must join the main force! Every time Iron Torrent Flattening the Plains has been used, it resulted in overwhelming victory —without exception.”<br/>
<br/>
“To personally experience this renowned tactic would be a rare opportunity for our military cultivation.”<br/>
<br/>
“We must get in! Once the battle starts, the main force under the tactic’s enhancement will be unshakable. The remaining flanking armies will become the enemy’s primary targets, reduced to cannon fodder.”<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers weren’t fools. After discussing, they understood the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Over a dozen armies in Wooden Wheel Town would be selected or eliminated through these inspections.<br/>
<br/>
Selected armies would receive the tactic’s empowerment, ensuring both safety and guaranteed military merits.<br/>
<br/>
Eliminated armies would follow the main force into battle, facing extreme danger. The enemy would naturally avoid the strong and attack the weak, targeting vulnerable positions.<br/>
<br/>
Especially since the Thousand Peaks Forest alliance, though possessing several standing armies, lacked forces tempered by national-level resources and prolonged warfare.<br/>
<br/>
The Thousand Peaks Forest coalition was ill-suited for frontal assaults. Facing the main force under Iron Torrent Flattening the Plains, only fools would confront them head-on.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, their response was predictable —they would focus all efforts on attacking the other armies.<br/>
<br/>
Only by swiftly destroying these units could they regain some advantage, then await the tactic’s expiration to challenge Twin Rivers’s main force.<br/>
<br/>
“We must fight our way into the main force at all costs.”<br/>
<br/>
“If we’re eliminated, our situation will turn dire once the battle begins.”<br/>
<br/>
“The difference in treatment is like heaven and earth!”<br/>
<br/>
With this understanding, many well-connected officers began maneuvering the night Du Tiechuan issued his orders.<br/>
<br/>
But all attempts failed!<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan had prepared. Only he could determine the selection —no one else was involved.<br/>
<br/>
Some high-ranking officers directly petitioned Du Tiechuan, but even the Cunning Princess was coldly rejected!<br/>
<br/>
“I enforce strict military discipline. All must comply.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I violate the rules, how can I command the army?”<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan’s righteous stance, once publicized, sharply boosted his prestige.<br/>
<br/>
Two days later, the second round of inspections commenced.<br/>
<br/>
This time, Ning Zhuo felt less strain, unlike his previous discomfort. However, most others fared poorly, with many in the Three Generals Camp collapsing mid-process.<br/>
<br/>
The reviewing platform’s setup subjected soldiers to pressures matching their cultivation levels.<br/>
<br/>
As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Ning Zhuo faced inspections tailored to his stage.<br/>
<br/>
Had the tests focused on combat power, realm, or technique, he’d have passed easily. But the emphasis was on personal defense and physical resilience.<br/>
<br/>
This made his first experience arduous.<br/>
<br/>
“But this time was much better!”<br/>
<br/>
“Many Foundation Establishment cultivators still collapsed.”<br/>
<br/>
“The reason for this improvement is my use of the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s accidentally discovered cultivation shortcut grew more appealing and addictive to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
After this round, only 60% of the Three Generals Camp soldiers passed, with nearly 40% eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
“Our army is newly formed, with uneven quality among recruits. Such eliminations are reasonable,” Ning Zhuo consoled the Three Generals.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong stroked his beard enviously: “The Red Flower Camp performed excellently, with almost no eliminations.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: “If this trend continues, they’ll face mass eliminations too.”<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, by the third inspection, Red Flower Camp suffered heavy losses. The Three Generals Camp saw over half fail to complete the process —an embarrassing scene.<br/>
<br/>
Even the Barbarian Demon Camp fared better.<br/>
<br/>
Though this army had been rebuilt after near-annihilation and suffered losses probing the Thousand Peaks Forest’s defenses, the innate physical advantages of barbarians and demonic cultivators surpassed human cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp’s performance ranked near the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
This humiliated Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang, while heightening their sense of crisis.<br/>
<br/>
“How can we quickly enhance physical resilience?”<br/>
<br/>
“Three inspection rounds have passed, with only two remaining.”<br/>
<br/>
“The difficulty escalates too sharply each round. If this continues, none of Wooden Wheel Town’s dozen armies will qualify.”<br/>
<br/>
“Has Commander Du always demanded such high standards?”<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals’ anxieties echoed throughout the army.<br/>
<br/>
Those familiar with internal affairs revealed a forbidden technique—Iron-Skin Flesh Armor Art!<br/>
<br/>
This demonic technique inflicted excruciating pain: cultivators had to peel off their skin, expose their muscles, and don armor.<br/>
<br/>
Under this technique, the armor fused with flesh, becoming one with the body —replacing the original skin.<br/>
<br/>
This drastically boosted defense and physicality, achieving rapid progress.<br/>
<br/>
However, such shortcuts came with severe drawbacks.<br/>
<br/>
Prolonged use caused progressive erosion —first physical, then mental.<br/>
<br/>
Most demonic techniques eventually destroyed cultivators’ minds.<br/>
<br/>
But these consequences manifested over time.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, with war imminent, using this method to secure a spot in the Iron Torrent empowered ranks would greatly improve battlefield survival rates.<br/>
<br/>
Survivors would earn merits, possibly rising through the ranks.<br/>
<br/>
The choice was obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Most soldiers chose to gamble!<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, demand for full-body heavy armor skyrocketed to absurd levels.<br/>
<br/>
Officers immediately sought the quartermaster.<br/>
<br/>
The quartermaster smiled, informing them: “The capital’s allocated equipment has already been distributed. However, there is a reserve batch of heavy armor for replacements.”<br/>
<br/>
The officers’ eyes lit up, offering bribes and pressing purchase demands.<br/>
<br/>
The quartermaster quoted an astronomical price.<br/>
<br/>
Many recoiled, some cursing his greed outright!<br/>
<br/>
Unfazed, the quartermaster held firm: “Generals, quantities are limited —first come, first served. As stocks dwindle, prices will rise.”<br/>
<br/>
This simple statement broke the deadlock.<br/>
<br/>
Wealthy officers rushed to buy, forcing others to follow. Soon, fierce bidding wars erupted.<br/>
<br/>
“What? Each army has purchase limits?” Some tried to monopolize supplies but were stopped.<br/>
<br/>
The quartermaster remained calm: “Don’t make this difficult, Generals.”<br/>
<br/>
“There’s only so much heavy armor —it can’t all go to one army.”<br/>
<br/>
“Otherwise, I’ll face consequences.”<br/>
<br/>
He spread his hands helplessly, adding: “Of course, you may refuse.”<br/>
<br/>
The officers exchanged glances.<br/>
<br/>
Some reluctantly gritted their teeth: “We’ll take it!”<br/>
<br/>
With limited armor and army quotas —often insufficient for entire forces —heavy armor was quickly snatched up.<br/>
<br/>
Scarcity drove prices higher, soon reaching prohibitive levels.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Ning Zhuo, cultivating in his Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, learned of this, it was too late.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er frantically dragged him to meet the quartermaster.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing the price, Ning Zhuo glared —this was daylight robbery!<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er turned pale.<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll buy,” Ning Zhuo decided after consideration.<br/>
<br/>
He spent nearly half his assets purchasing 400 sets of heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
Lighter armor was available, but experienced deputies clarified: only heavy armor could maximize the forbidden technique’s effects and pass inspections.<br/>
<br/>
Even half-body armor fell short, let alone light armor.<br/>
<br/>
The quartermaster stared at Ning Zhuo in shock.<br/>
<br/>
News of Ning Zhuo’s lavish spending sparked heated discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, deeply moved, shed prior resentment: “The strategist has sacrificed greatly! I’ll remember this forever!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: “Pity we couldn’t equip the entire army.”<br/>
<br/>
As they returned to camp, Mu Lan descended from the sky.<br/>
<br/>
She stared at Ning Zhuo: “Husband, I heard you bought 400 heavy armors?”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s face twisted.<br/>
<br/>
The term “husband” stung him.<br/>
<br/>
He anxiously watched Ning Zhuo, wanting to speak but hesitating.<br/>
<br/>
Though resentful, fear dominated his heart —he dreaded Ning Zhuo reneging.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo scratched his nose and said: “General Mu Lan, no need for this. If you wish to buy armor, I can assist.”<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan pressed: “Even using my full quota wouldn’t cover my army. So husband, I need some of your armor.”<br/>
<br/>
“This...” Ning Zhuo hesitated.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan shook her head firmly: “My Red Flower Camp’s battle formations require elite troops. Missing even a few greatly weakens us.”<br/>
<br/>
“Liu Er.”<br/>
<br/>
“Your Three Generals Camp can always recruit more.”<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan had also struggled with the forbidden technique, lacking funds until Ning Zhuo’s wealth surprised her.<br/>
<br/>
To save her camp, she boldly addressed Ning Zhuo as “husband,” stirring excitement among the troops who avidly watched their interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Caught between Mu Lan’s resolve and Liu Er’s pleading gaze, Ning Zhuo faced a difficult choice.</div>
