<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 507: Mu Lan: "My Husband!"</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Du Tiechuan, a Soul Formation-level cultivator specializing in military tactics, was one of the two Great Generals of The Two Note Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He possessed an innate talent —Iron Wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This talent allowed a cultivator to greatly enhance their defense for a short period, standing immovable like a steel fortress. However, while using this talent, the cultivator could not move and had to remain rooted in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Due to this major flaw, the Iron Wall talent had always been classified as low-grade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">A low-grade talent seemed unworthy of someone like Du Tiechuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Yet true power never lied in talents, magical treasures, or techniques —it lied in the cultivators themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Any talent was merely an opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">How one seized this opportunity and excavated its intrinsic value had always varied from person to person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In terms of results, Du Tiechuan firmly grasped this opportunity and unearthed an immense treasure from it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He developed his talent, elevating it into a divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Even after this elevation, the Iron Wall divine ability remained unremarkable compared to others, with limited applications and low practical value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But in Du Tiechuan’s hands, he took the Iron Wall divine ability as his core, combined it with his primary cultivation technique, and created a series of military tactics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Among them, Iron Torrent Flattening the Plains was the most powerful and renowned!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Once activated, this technique could empower soldiers, drastically increasing the entire army’s weight and defense while unifying their strength and form into a cohesive force that continuously accelerated, growing faster and faster. Ultimately, it leveraged overwhelming momentum to deliver unparalleled destructive power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Its might was like a hurricane —sundering mountains, parting seas, sweeping across heaven and earth, unstoppable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The army became an iron deluge, crushing all enemies in its path and expanding territories!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Any obstacle blocking the army’s advance would be shattered and ground to dust. Even powerful individual cultivators who dared oppose it would face tens of thousands of iron beasts, an unstoppable force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">This was Du Tiechuan’s trump card, a killer move that could determine the outcome of a war when deployed appropriately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">After the vanguard army was trapped and the situation became unclear, Du Tiechuan dispatched four armies deep into the Thousand Peaks Forest, secretly sending powerful cultivators to escort them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Once the enemy’s situation was probed, he spent vast resources to rapidly construct the Nine Dragon Shadow Reviewing Platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Each army underwent rounds of inspection, allowing Du Tiechuan to temper the troops while selecting the most suitable army to execute the Iron Torrent Flattening the Plains tactic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After the first round of inspections, many officers guessed Du Tiechuan’s intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">That same day, Commander Du issued explicit military orders outlining his plan: he would spend nine days conducting five rounds of inspections. The army that endured until the fifth round would become the main force to execute Iron Torrent Flattening the Plains and launch a full-scale assault on the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Instantly, the entire army erupted in fervent discussion about this tactic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Past victories had already proven the tactic’s fearsome efficacy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">It could be said this was Du Tiechuan’s unique masterpiece!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“We must join the main force! Every time Iron Torrent Flattening the Plains has been used, it resulted in overwhelming victory —without exception.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“To personally experience this renowned tactic would be a rare opportunity for our military cultivation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“We must get in! Once the battle starts, the main force under the tactic’s enhancement will be unshakable. The remaining flanking armies will become the enemy’s primary targets, reduced to cannon fodder.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The soldiers weren’t fools. After discussing, they understood the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Over a dozen armies in Wooden Wheel Town would be selected or eliminated through these inspections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Selected armies would receive the tactic’s empowerment, ensuring both safety and guaranteed military merits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Eliminated armies would follow the main force into battle, facing extreme danger. The enemy would naturally avoid the strong and attack the weak, targeting vulnerable positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Especially since the Thousand Peaks Forest alliance, though possessing several standing armies, lacked forces tempered by national-level resources and prolonged warfare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Thousand Peaks Forest coalition was ill-suited for frontal assaults. Facing the main force under Iron Torrent Flattening the Plains, only fools would confront them head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Thus, their response was predictable —they would focus all efforts on attacking the other armies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Only by swiftly destroying these units could they regain some advantage, then await the tactic’s expiration to challenge Two Note’s main force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“We must fight our way into the main force at all costs.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“If we’re eliminated, our situation will turn dire once the battle begins.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“The difference in treatment is like heaven and earth!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">With this understanding, many well-connected officers began maneuvering the night Du Tiechuan issued his orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">But all attempts failed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Du Tiechuan had prepared. Only he could determine the selection —no one else was involved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Some high-ranking officers directly petitioned Du Tiechuan, but even the Cunning Princess was coldly rejected!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“I enforce strict military discipline. All must comply.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“If I violate the rules, how can I command the army?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Du Tiechuan’s righteous stance, once publicized, sharply boosted his prestige.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Two days later, the second round of inspections commenced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This time, Ning Zhuo felt less strain, unlike his previous discomfort. However, most others fared poorly, with many in the Three Generals Camp collapsing mid-process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The reviewing platform’s setup subjected soldiers to pressures matching their cultivation levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Ning Zhuo faced inspections tailored to his stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Had the tests focused on combat power, realm, or technique, he’d have passed easily. But the emphasis was on personal defense and physical resilience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This made his first experience arduous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“But this time was much better!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Many Foundation Establishment cultivators still collapsed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“The reason for this improvement is my use of the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong’s accidentally discovered cultivation shortcut grew more appealing and addictive to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">After this round, only 60% of the Three Generals Camp soldiers passed, with nearly 40% eliminated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Our army is newly formed, with uneven quality among recruits. Such eliminations are reasonable,” Ning Zhuo consoled the Three Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Guan Hong stroked his beard enviously: “The Red Flower Camp performed excellently, with almost no eliminations.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo shook his head: “If this trend continues, they’ll face mass eliminations too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sure enough, by the third inspection, Red Flower Camp suffered heavy losses. The Three Generals Camp saw over half fail to complete the process —an embarrassing scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Even the Barbarian Demon Camp fared better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Though this army had been rebuilt after near-annihilation and suffered losses probing the Thousand Peaks Forest’s defenses, the innate physical advantages of barbarians and demonic cultivators surpassed human cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Three Generals Camp’s performance ranked near the bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This humiliated Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang, while heightening their sense of crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“How can we quickly enhance physical resilience?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Three inspection rounds have passed, with only two remaining.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“The difficulty escalates too sharply each round. If this continues, none of Wooden Wheel Town’s dozen armies will qualify.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Has Commander Du always demanded such high standards?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Three Generals’ anxieties echoed throughout the army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Those familiar with internal affairs revealed a forbidden technique—Iron-Skin Flesh Armor Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This demonic technique inflicted excruciating pain: cultivators had to peel off their skin, expose their muscles, and don armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Under this technique, the armor fused with flesh, becoming one with the body —replacing the original skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">This drastically boosted defense and physicality, achieving rapid progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">However, such shortcuts came with severe drawbacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Prolonged use caused progressive erosion —first physical, then mental.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Most demonic techniques eventually destroyed cultivators’ minds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">But these consequences manifested over time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Currently, with war imminent, using this method to secure a spot in the Iron Torrent empowered ranks would greatly improve battlefield survival rates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Survivors would earn merits, possibly rising through the ranks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The choice was obvious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Most soldiers chose to gamble!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Instantly, demand for full-body heavy armor skyrocketed to absurd levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Officers immediately sought the quartermaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The quartermaster smiled, informing them: “The capital’s allocated equipment has already been distributed. However, there is a reserve batch of heavy armor for replacements.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The officers’ eyes lit up, offering bribes and pressing purchase demands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The quartermaster quoted an astronomical price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Many recoiled, some cursing his greed outright!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Unfazed, the quartermaster held firm: “Generals, quantities are limited —first come, first served. As stocks dwindle, prices will rise.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">This simple statement broke the deadlock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Wealthy officers rushed to buy, forcing others to follow. Soon, fierce bidding wars erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“What? Each army has purchase limits?” Some tried to monopolize supplies but were stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The quartermaster remained calm: “Don’t make this difficult, Generals.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“There’s only so much heavy armor —it can’t all go to one army.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“Otherwise, I’ll face consequences.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He spread his hands helplessly, adding: “Of course, you may refuse.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The officers exchanged glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Some reluctantly gritted their teeth: “We’ll take it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">With limited armor and army quotas —often insufficient for entire forces —heavy armor was quickly snatched up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Scarcity drove prices higher, soon reaching prohibitive levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">By the time Ning Zhuo, cultivating in his Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, learned of this, it was too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Liu Er frantically dragged him to meet the quartermaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Hearing the price, Ning Zhuo glared —this was daylight robbery!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Liu Er turned pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“I’ll buy,” Ning Zhuo decided after consideration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He spent nearly half his assets purchasing 400 sets of heavy armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Lighter armor was available, but experienced deputies clarified: only heavy armor could maximize the forbidden technique’s effects and pass inspections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Even half-body armor fell short, let alone light armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The quartermaster stared at Ning Zhuo in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">News of Ning Zhuo’s lavish spending sparked heated discussions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Liu Er, deeply moved, shed prior resentment: “The strategist has sacrificed greatly! I’ll remember this forever!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo: “Pity we couldn’t equip the entire army.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">As they returned to camp, Mu Lan descended from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">She stared at Ning Zhuo: “Husband, I heard you bought 400 heavy armors?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Liu Er’s face twisted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The term “husband” stung him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He anxiously watched Ning Zhuo, wanting to speak but hesitating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Though resentful, fear dominated his heart —he dreaded Ning Zhuo reneging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo scratched his nose and said: “General Mu Lan, no need for this. If you wish to buy armor, I can assist.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Mu Lan pressed: “Even using my full quota wouldn’t cover my army. So husband, I need some of your armor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“This...” Ning Zhuo hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Mu Lan shook her head firmly: “My Red Flower Camp’s battle formations require elite troops. Missing even a few greatly weakens us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">“Liu Er.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">“Your Three Generals Camp can always recruit more.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Mu Lan had also struggled with the forbidden technique, lacking funds until Ning Zhuo’s wealth surprised her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">To save her camp, she boldly addressed Ning Zhuo as “husband,” stirring excitement among the troops who avidly watched their interaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Caught between Mu Lan’s resolve and Liu Er’s pleading gaze, Ning Zhuo faced a difficult choice.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
