<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">An indescribable explosion erupted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Buddhist Light shot skyward, while the terrifying Earth Lung Turbid Qi formed a shockwave that surged in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Klesha Extinction Buddha Intent rose, swiftly weakening and ultimately extinguishing the shockwave, turbid qi, and Buddhist Light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Rain fell from the sky, its vapor swirling and churning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Branch of the Wangchuan River, now reduced to less than one percent of its original size, carried shattered prayer beads and an Ice Coffin that froze the surrounding water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom's shattered body floated silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Its form had shrunk by more than eighty percent from its original size, covered in horrifying wounds. From these wounds, specks of Buddhist Light continuously seeped out, its aura plummeting to the lowest depths, as if on the verge of disintegrating at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Yet its right hand firmly grasped half of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's ruined divine body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Unattended, the Branch of the Wangchuan River was easily crossed by the Nirvana Buddha Phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Holding the half-destroyed body of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, the Buddha's phantom stepped onto the Sacrificial Altar, one foot in front of the other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God reacted slowly, reaching out to grasp the Nirvana Buddha Phantom's arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But that was his limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let out a defiant roar, then disintegrated into a massive yellow haze of smoke and dust that enveloped the sacrificial altar, using its last shred of strength to hinder the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Buddha's phantom shook his head with a faint smile. "You'd rather dissipate your Divided Spirit and body to stall me with your final strength?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, you've lost your composure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"If you maintained your Divided Spirit, it would have drawn upon the last reserves of my Lifebound Buddha Wheel to suppress you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He released his grip, spreading his fingers, and let the yellow haze disperse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">With his withered, crumbling feet that seemed ready to fall apart at any moment, the Buddha ascended the steps, one by one, climbing toward the highest point of the altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The crimson glow that once shrouded the altar had dwindled to a millstone-sized mass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Within this bloodlight, the Heavenly Ghost Skull had dissolved into a deep blue liquid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom raised his remaining right hand to his chest, palm upright, and intoned:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Sunken ships sink deeper, withered trees turn green in death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Defeat hides in the Heavenly Game, a faint light becomes a star in the fight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He ascended to the summit of the sacrificial altar and stood firm. Extending his right hand, he plunged his fingers into the blood-red glow, making contact with the dark blue liquid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">In an instant, the liquid abruptly transformed, coalescing into a deep blue skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom, whose countenance had remained as tranquil as an ancient well, underwent a sudden, dramatic change. His eyes widened, radiating an expression of incredulous joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He continued chanting the second half of the verse:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Having climbed the heavenly stairs, I now behold your true form. In this fleeting moment of forgetting, the Buddha reveals his original name."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"So this is it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Before going to battle, the Soundless Ghost Monk had successfully prayed to the Buddha and received this Revealing Word. Only now did he finally grasp its meaning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"The Buddha reveals his original name" directly pointed to this Acquired Talent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This was both the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long plan, a Dao Path designed to complement his innate talent, and the Soundless Ghost Monk's own gamble - a sacrificial battle that had won him this Buddhist Affinity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This talent would bring a qualitative leap to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, and for the Soundless Ghost Monk, it offered tremendous potential for soaring success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Even the Soundless Ghost Monk couldn't suppress his overwhelming joy, causing the Silent Extinction Buddha Intent to grow increasingly dim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">In fact, the entire Buddha's phantom was fading, like dense fog exposed to sunlight, visibly thinning before their eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Has the True Form still not arrived, even after all this fighting?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Even though it was far away earlier, that was likely to lull the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and others into complacency. By now, it should have arrived."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"What could be holding it up?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">A flicker of concern crossed the Nirvana Buddha Phantom's face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Hmm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">His gaze paused, catching sight of Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi had been patiently waiting for Luo Si to recover as much as possible. But then they heard a deafening explosion, followed by silence - no further sounds of battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ignoring his injuries, Luo Si opened his eyes and urged Ning Zhuo to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As the trio emerged from the passage, they saw the Nirvana Buddha Phantom clutching the Heavenly Ghost Skull, his delight barely concealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Huff!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Luo Si exhaled a cloud of turbid qi. "I never expected the Soundless Ghost Monk to be the ultimate victor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Soundless Ghost Monk?" Ning Zhuo asked curiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Qing Chi frowned, scanning the Altar Battlefield. "Where did the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord go? Could the Great Buddha have eliminated him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Driven by a desire for revenge, she urgently searched for her enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Hack! Cough! Cough!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was racked with violent coughs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In an instant, he had traversed thousands of miles, harnessing the power of the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Grand Formation to teleport back to Forgetful River Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The surrounding cultivators hurriedly prostrated themselves upon seeing him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Prefecture Lord first glanced behind him, his pupils constricting as he saw the empty Formation Core of the Earth Aspect Formation. Fury surged within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"You worthless fools!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"You couldn't even defend the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Where is he?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The cultivators stammered, pleading for forgiveness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Get out of my sight," the Prefecture Lord snapped, dismissing them without a second thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Alone at last, he settled into a cross-legged meditation, simultaneously recuperating and using the Grand Formation to remotely monitor the Sacrificial Altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Though he had retreated to his stronghold, he hadn't abandoned his plans entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">When the Nirvana Buddha Shadow ascended the altar to perform the bone-crushing ritual, the leader of the Forgetful River Prefecture smirked, his scheme coming to fruition. He murmured, "Soundless Ghost Monk, this altar isn't as easy to ascend as you think."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">As the words left his lips, the Nirvana Buddha Phantom's expression abruptly shifted. It lowered its head to gaze downward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Chunks of the Buddha's body began to disintegrate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This sacrificial altar was no ordinary structure; it served as the core of the Heavenly Aspect Formation, a formidable artifact. To ascend it, three conditions had to be met simultaneously:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">First, a foundation of at least a million souls was required.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Second, sufficient demonic qi was needed to suppress the altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Third, one must possess a Fate Attribute capable of enduring Divine Retribution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom, being a temporary Divine Buddha body manifested through the Silent Extinction Buddha Power of the Lifebound Buddha Wheel, naturally lacked any soul foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This phantom radiated the terrifying Silent Extinction Buddha Intent, which made it difficult for other realms of consciousness to coexist with it. This was evident in battle, where even the most potent Earthly Fiend Qi of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God proved incapable of corrupting the Buddha's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Thus, the phantom also lacked any demonic qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">As for a Fate Attribute, that was even more absent. If the Nirvana Buddha descended personally, or even the true form of the Soundless Ghost Monk, they might have met this requirement. But the Lifebound Buddha Wheel was merely a magic treasure - what Fate Attribute could it possibly possess?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Without a Fate Attribute, how could it withstand Divine Retribution?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had sacrificed the Underworld Celestial Heavens, channeling the Netherworld Azure Heaven Power into the Heavenly Ghost Skull to nurture its growth. In other words, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had secured the support of the Nether Heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Having obstructed and defeated the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, the Nirvana Buddha Phantom naturally incurred divine retribution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The power of the Heavenly Azure Heaven descended!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">This caused the Nirvana Buddha Phantom to collapse on a massive scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Trapped!" In an instant, the Soundless Ghost Monk's divine sense finally realized the deception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Earlier, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's withdrawal of his True Form had been both a strategic retreat to avoid annihilation and the beginning of his scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He even deliberately dispersed the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God to lull the Soundless Ghost Monk's divine sense into a false sense of security.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">By commanding the Buddha's phantom to ascend the sacrificial altar, the Soundless Ghost Monk had unwittingly triggered the trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Unlike the Ash Bone Elder, who had warned him of the altar's dangers, the Soundless Ghost Monk remained unaware of the hidden perils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Had his physical body been present, with its boundless divine sea and lightning-quick thoughts, he might have sensed the conspiracy and avoided the altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But within the Buddha's phantom resided only a fragment of his divine sense, already drained to its limits after prolonged battle, both his Buddha power and divine sense depleted to critical levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">As the saying goes: "Even the wisest man makes mistakes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had seized this weakness to craft his scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">And he had succeeded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The power of Divine Retribution coiled around the Buddha's phantom, impossible to dispel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom sighed, clutching the Heavenly Ghost Skull as it rose into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">It knew its destruction was inevitable, but the ultimate winner wasn't necessarily its opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"As long as I use all my strength to escape this place, I might be able to reunite with my True Form."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Its essence was the Lifebound Buddha Wheel, so it couldn't directly use the Heavenly Ghost Skull. But if it could reunite with its True Form and deliver the skull before the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord returned, it would secure victory!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"If I can't reunite, I'll bury the skull halfway and buy as much time as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"In that case, I'll have to rely on my True Form to find it sooner."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Just as the Nirvana Buddha Shadow flew off the sacrificial altar, there was a splash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Waves surged again as a branch of the Wangchuan River, like a massive water python, surged forward in pursuit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Nirvana Buddha Shadow focused its gaze and swiftly spotted the ice coffin and beaded string within the river branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The ice coffin had already been eroded by more than half, but the Nether Dragon Scissors inside trembled slightly, radiating power outward. The beaded string was severely damaged, only about thirty percent remaining, yet under the Nether Dragon Scissors' power, it still propelled the Wangchuan River branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Of course, none of this would be possible without Lord Wangchuan's true form. He was currently stationed within the Forgetful River Immortal City, remotely controlling the situation from a position of invincible advantage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Nirvana Buddha Shadow's heart sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The battle had once again devolved into a stalemate, and it was impossible to predict who would ultimately emerge victorious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Would He collapse first, or manage to temporarily shake off the Branch of the Wangchuan River?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Regardless, we must eliminate them first," the Nirvana Buddha Phantom suddenly veered course, turning towards Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Damn it," Ning Zhuo instantly felt a surge of malicious intent bearing down on them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"This great Buddha harbors ill intent!" Qing Chi, also sensitive to such things, agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Quick, retreat!" Luo Si shouted, his condition deteriorating rapidly, his combat strength now comparable to that of an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">In the blink of an eye, the Nirvana Buddha Phantom had already extended a finger, pointing at the trio.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He had refrained from attacking Ning Zhuo and the Qing-Jiao Army earlier because he had just escaped confinement and recognized them as the Human Tribulation sent by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord - a tribulation manifesting from the Heavenly Mandate of the Mortal Realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Enemies of one's enemy are one's friends, so He had held back, focusing solely on the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">But now that the larger situation had clarified, He needed to renew his struggle against the Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Whether it was the Soundless Ghost Monk or the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord himself, both were in a wretched state, their power diminished to a critical point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Under these circumstances, Ning Zhuo and his companions became a tremendous threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"These people are the Human Tribulation of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, backed by the Heavenly Mandate of the Azure Sky in the Living Realm. If we let them run unchecked, they might become the greatest beneficiaries!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Soundless Ghost Monk had come here to wage war, to halt the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Dao Path. This was partly due to their mutual blood feud, and partly because the Revealing Word hinted at a Buddhist Affinity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He would never willingly relinquish that Buddhist Affinity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">In that instant, alarm bells went off in the minds of Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and Luo Si, their hair standing on end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Luo Si shoved Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi aside. "I'll take the hit..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">But before he could finish speaking, the phantom's finger pierced the air and descended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">At the critical moment, a beam of Buddhist Light suddenly erupted from Ning Zhuo's divine sea!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The Buddhist Light shot skyward, radiating from Ning Zhuo's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom's finger, sensing the Buddhist Light, instantly dissipated without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"What... is this Buddha treasure?!" The Soundless Ghost Monk's divine sense trembled violently, utterly baffled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Then, something even more horrifying occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Nirvana Buddha Body abruptly lost control. The Buddha himself had descended his will, casting an inquisitive gaze upon Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Who is he? To warrant such attention from My Buddha?!" The Soundless Ghost Monk's divine sense trembled violently, overwhelmed by shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The Buddha Heart Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo was equally astonished, never expecting the Precious Seal within his divine sea to be activated at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"No!" The Soundless Ghost Monk gritted his teeth, horrified as he realized the out-of-control Buddha Body was about to hurl the Heavenly Ghost Skull toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"This is mine! This is my Buddhist Affinity!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The Soundless Ghost Monk remained the Soundless Ghost Monk, and the Nirvana Buddha remained the Nirvana Buddha.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">To preserve his Buddhist Affinity, the Soundless Ghost Monk dissolved the Divine Summoning Art embedded within his Lifebound Buddha Wheel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The Nirvana Buddha Body completely disintegrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Yet the Divine Retribution power, like a relentless shadow, continued to descend upon the Lifebound Buddha Wheel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Crack... Crack...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The Buddhist Wheel slowly spun, cracks spreading across its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">As its radiance dimmed, the Soundless Ghost Monk mustered his last shred of power, forcefully hurling the Heavenly Ghost Skull away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Enveloped in a surge of Buddha power, the skull shot forth like a meteor, vanishing into the heavens in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Under the relentless assault of Divine Retribution, the Buddhist Wheel shattered, its fragments scattering. The Soundless Ghost Monk's divine sense was utterly exhausted, leaving the wheel reduced to an ordinary copper artifact that plummeted from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Luo Si instinctively activated his fishing technique, casting out half of the Netherworld Ferrying Line. He wrapped it around the severely damaged Buddhist Wheel and reeled it into his hands. The Buddhist Wheel, too badly damaged to resist, offered no resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"We must hurry after it!" Qing Chi activated the Night Wanderer Divine Art and chased after the Heavenly Ghost Skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Wait, get on my Mechanical Dragon!" Ning Zhuo slapped his belt, unleashing the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The trio dove into the dragon, and it immediately took flight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The Ten Thousand Li traversing Dragon instantly pierced through the air, vanishing from its original position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Within the Forgetful River Immortal City, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's eyes glimmered with a cold light, a sharp smile curling his lips. "In the end, the ultimate victor remains this lord!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Inside the Ten Thousand Li traversing Dragon, Qing Chi groped around in wonder. "Little Ma, how did you get such a treasure? When did you acquire it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Luo Si, usually composed, spoke with a hint of excitement. "This is the Ten Thousand Li traversing Dragon, capable of traversing the Void. With it, we can cover thousands of miles in moments, arriving ahead of the Heavenly Ghost Skull and ambushing it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Ning Zhuo sighed. "It's a pity the Ten Thousand Li traversing Dragon can't penetrate Formation barriers. Otherwise, that battle would have been far easier."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Ripples spread through the void as the Ten Thousand Li traversing Dragon materialized out of thin air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">After waiting for a moment, the trio still saw no sign of the Heavenly Ghost Skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"How is this possible?" Qing Chi frowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Luo Si and Ning Zhuo's gazes met in mid-air, and they spoke in unison: "The Sacrificial Altar!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
