<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Alright, as for the position of clan leader, you can compete fairly in the future. I won‚Äôt interfere with the regular affairs of the Ning family." <br/>
<br/>
"Work hard. With your age and talent, there is indeed hope for you to take charge of the entire Ning family in the future." <br/>
<br/>
"But right now... it‚Äôs impossible!" <br/>
<br/>
"A mere Qi Refining junior, if he were to become the leader of the clan, who would take the Ning family seriously?" <br/>
<br/>
"Okay, okay." Ning Zhuo sighed and raised his eyes filled with expectation, "Then Ancestor, appoint me as the Young Clan Leader. When I inherit the position of Clan Leader in the future, it will be justified." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan replied, "Ning Zhuo, do not bring up such requests again!" His tone became even more displeased. <br/>
<br/>
"Alright, alright." Ning Zhuo pouted, "Then please grant me some magical artifacts, such as robes and armor, to protect myself?" <br/>
<br/>
"I want to take risks as bait; I‚Äôm not afraid of the unexpected, but I fear the worst. If I have magical artifacts on me that can be triggered instantly, I can feel a bit more at ease." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan shook his head, telling Ning Zhuo that magical artifacts cannot be casually granted, worried that assassins would detect them from afar and refrain from making a move if they found out Ning Zhuo had magical artifacts. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then sought the Ice Heart Technique. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan scolded him for being greedy, saying that this technique is the foundation of the family.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's contributions to the family have not yet met the standard; how could he be taught the Ice Heart Technique? <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan warned him not to attempt to make excessive demands during this opportunity, violating the family rules. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo suddenly had a thought and mentioned, "Ancestor, may I split from the family?" <br/>
<br/>
"If I split from the family, I won‚Äôt have to be the leader of the main family or the Young Clan Leader anymore. I would directly be the leader of the branch family; wouldn‚Äôt that be wonderful!" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was furious, blowing his beard and glaring: "You little brat! At such a young age, you actually want to split the family? You dare to bring it up in front of me; do you want to die? Or do you want to be locked in the dungeon for life?" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly waved his hands, explaining, "Ancestor, please listen to me." <br/>
<br/>
"Look, you and Lord Zhu Xuanji are quite close. The three major families in Fire Persimmon Immortal City are also closely connected. This is correct." <br/>
<br/>
"But there are also great risks involved. What if in the future, Lord Zhu fails to compete and does not become the Lord of Lava Immortal City?" <br/>
<br/>
"When that time comes, he will just pack up and leave, and our Ning family will still have to make a living in Fire Persimmon Immortal City." <br/>
<br/>
"Even the old farmers know that you can‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket." <br/>
<br/>
"So, you and the main line are close to Lord Zhu, while I take some branch families to split off and align with the current Lord‚Äôs family." <br/>
<br/>
"In this way, regardless of which side ultimately wins, our Ning family can stand undefeated." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan: ‚Ä¶ <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji: <br/>
<br/>
You can‚Äôt say that Ning Zhuo‚Äôs words don‚Äôt make sense! <br/>
<br/>
With this thought, Ning Jiufan said to Zhu Xuanji, "My second son is young and speaks without restraint, causing Lord Zhu to laugh." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji sighed softly, "This is indeed a technique for the family‚Äôs longevity." <br/>
<br/>
"For example, the first family among cultivators‚Äîthe Gu family. Gu Tian and Gu Le are respectively the left ministers and national masters of the rival countries, White Light Kingdom and Grand Flood Kingdom." <br/>
<br/>
"This phenomenon is indeed common." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan quickly continued to make excuses: "Hmph, Ning Zhuo is too young and short-sighted. If he knew that the Lord‚Äôs mansion truly wanted his life, he would surely laugh at his current foolishness!" <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji waved his hand, signaling Ning Jiufan to stop speaking, then pointed at Ning Zhuo and nodded. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan understood the meaning and immediately transmitted a message to Ning Zhuo: "Enough, kid!" He dared not let Ning Zhuo continue making requests. <br/>
<br/>
"I‚Äôll lend you a protective spirit talisman that can withstand a full-force attack from an ordinary Golden Core." <br/>
<br/>
"I‚Äôll also grant you three directional escape talismans that can instantly transport you to pre-arranged teleportation points." <br/>
<br/>
"Lastly, I‚Äôll give you three taels of Ice Jade Wine. Do a good job, and afterwards, I‚Äôll count it as a great contribution to the Ning family!" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs eyes lit up upon hearing this: "Three taels... three taels is a bit too little, Ancestor." <br/>
<br/>
"How about one jin? Let‚Äôs make it one jin, alright?" <br/>
<br/>
"Hmph!" Ning Jiufan could no longer hold back, using his means to release an invisible pressure. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was caught off guard and was instantly pressed to the ground, prostrating with his body, his bones creaking slightly as if he were carrying a mountain. <br/>
<br/>
He hurriedly begged for mercy. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan then withdrew his means. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo regained his freedom, his face filled with lingering fear, raising his palm and extending five fingers: "Five taels, five taels, Ancestor." <br/>
<br/>
"I‚Äôm risking my life here!" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan: ‚Ä¶ <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji: <br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha." Ning Jiufan couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. <br/>
<br/>
He was laughing out of anger. <br/>
<br/>
After a moment. <br/>
<br/>
In Ning Zhuo‚Äôs courtyard. <br/>
<br/>
Su Mo was in a small pavilion, enjoying fine wine and delicacies while mockingly taunting Ning Zhuo. <br/>
<br/>
"The food is good, but a bit soft." <br/>
<br/>
"The wine is also good, but not strong enough, a bit too mild." <br/>
<br/>
"Good, good, good. This fine wine and food are indeed worthy of the Ning family‚Äôs preparation, just like the Ning family!" The two Foundation Establishment guards serving him had faces as dark as the bottom of a pot. <br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Zhuo‚Äôs voice came: "Su Mo, you‚Äôre so arrogant!" <br/>
<br/>
"I‚Äôm treating you to fine wine and food, wanting to establish a good relationship with you, yet you don‚Äôt appreciate it." <br/>
<br/>
"Refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit!" <br/>
<br/>
"The key is that you insult me, and that‚Äôs one thing, but insulting the reputation of my Ning family is utterly detestable." <br/>
<br/>
"What do you want to spar about? Speak!" <br/>
<br/>
"I‚Äôm ready." <br/>
<br/>
The two Foundation Establishment guards looked at Ning Zhuo, both surprised and delighted, secretly praising: After all, it‚Äôs Young Master Ning Zhuo, a sixteen-year-old genius, full of youthful spirit, unwilling to be humiliated, caring for his family; truly a good son of the Ning family branch! <br/>
<br/>
Su Mo stood up, carefully sizing up Ning Zhuo, his heart filled with joy, but his face wore a serious expression. <br/>
<br/>
After a round of conversation, he clasped his hands to Ning Zhuo and stated his request. <br/>
<br/>
This time, if he wins the spar, he asks Ning Zhuo to inform him of the contents of the Demonic Dao Scripture. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sneered: "So it‚Äôs for this." <br/>
<br/>
He extended three fingers and swore publicly: "I swear on the reputation of my Ning family that I have never obtained a single word from this so-called Demonic Dao Scripture." <br/>
<br/>
"You came to my door, looking for me to spar, and you‚Äôre not sincere at all." <br/>
<br/>
"Using the reputation of the Ning family to coerce me, to kidnap me into agreeing to spar with you, is even more sinister." <br/>
<br/>
"I don‚Äôt care who you have behind you or what orders you‚Äôve received; this time, I will make you pay the most painful price!" <br/>
<br/>
Su Mo became nervous upon hearing this, forcing himself to calm down, sneering: "What? You, Ning Zhuo, want to bully me, a mere wanderer, with numbers?" <br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, I won‚Äôt make it difficult for you tonight." Ning Zhuo said, "Tomorrow morning, we‚Äôll meet on the martial arts stage for a true showdown." <br/>
<br/>
"You want to be the first to eat the crab? Good, I also want to kill a chicken to warn the monkeys." <br/>
<br/>
Su Mo‚Äôs expression changed again, looking increasingly grim. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan: ‚Ä¶ <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji: ‚Ä¶ <br/>
<br/>
The two exchanged glances in secret, both thinking: After Ning Zhuo received the protective talisman and directional escape talismans, his courage surged, moving from one extreme to another. <br/>
<br/>
The next day. <br/>
<br/>
Early in the morning, the martial arts stage was packed with people. <br/>
<br/>
The main characters on the stage were two: Ning Zhuo and Su Mo. <br/>
<br/>
Soon after, only Ning Zhuo remained as the main character. <br/>
<br/>
In the area he was most skilled in‚Äîmaking talismans‚ÄîSu Mo was clearly at a disadvantage, losing decisively without any objections. <br/>
<br/>
Considering that Ning Zhuo was only sixteen years old, the gap between the two felt even more exaggerated. <br/>
<br/>
However, just as Su Mo stepped down, a second challenger appeared. <br/>
<br/>
The challenger stepped onto the martial arts stage, wanting to spar with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The request was still for the Demonic Dao Scripture. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sneered upon hearing this.<br/>
<br/>
He then swore publicly that he had already been approached by Zhu Xuanji and had no knowledge of this Demonic Dao Scripture. <br/>
<br/>
There were many truths in the rumors, but the claim that the scripture belonged to him was purely a rumor, utterly unfounded. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo rejected the second challenge: "You all come for the Demonic Dao Scripture, but unfortunately, you‚Äôve found the wrong person." <br/>
<br/>
"How can I comply with your wishes, sparring endlessly?" <br/>
<br/>
"My Ning family is a righteous clan; I, Ning Zhuo, was born in a place of righteousness, witnessing and hearing all the benevolent ways. Between dawn and dusk, teachers impart wisdom, good deeds and righteousness gather like spring rain, subtly influencing my heart." <br/>
<br/>
"However, we righteous cultivators stand upright before heaven and earth, ancestors; kindness is not without its sharp edge, how can we be swayed by such petty schemes?" <br/>
<br/>
"From now on, anyone who wishes to spar with me, using the reputation of the Ning family to pressure me, will be regarded as an enemy, and I will not rest until one of us is dead!" <br/>
<br/>
"Now, who will challenge me?" <br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the crowd below the martial arts stage fell silent. <br/>
<br/>
In the distance, atop a tavern. <br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core disciples of the Great Purity Palace had sinister expressions, their mouths moving as they transmitted messages. <br/>
<br/>
Among the crowd, one person received the order, pushed through the crowd, and stepped onto the martial arts stage. <br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, I challenge you; it‚Äôs a fight to the death!" The newcomer was a burly man, rolling up his sleeves and clenching his fists like sandbags.<br/>
<br/>
At first glance, he was clearly a physical cultivator. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stared at the burly man, his eyes gleaming coldly: "I‚Äôve said what I needed to say, yet you still come at me aggressively, full of malice; you must be a waste cultivator!" <br/>
<br/>
"Come, someone, kill him!" <br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the Foundation Establishment guards, who had long been eager to move, leaped onto the stage and swarmed the burly man. <br/>
<br/>
The burly man was taken aback: "Isn‚Äôt this a one-on-one duel?! How despicable!" <br/>
<br/>
He was overwhelmed by spells, and before he died, he could only let out a scream. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood with his hands behind his back, looking down at the stage: "What kind of morality is there to discuss with waste cultivators? Naturally, it‚Äôs about exterminating demons and upholding the Dao, and everyone strives to be the first!" <br/>
<br/>
"Do you really think that our righteous cultivators are easy to bully?!" <br/>
<br/>
Wherever his gaze fell, everyone avoided it.</div>
