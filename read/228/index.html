<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Alright, as for the position of clan leader, you can compete fairly in the future. I wonâ€™t interfere with the regular affairs of the Ning family." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Work hard. With your age and talent, there is indeed hope for you to take charge of the entire Ning family in the future." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"But right now... itâ€™s impossible!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"A mere Qi Refining junior, if he were to become the leader of the clan, who would take the Ning family seriously?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Okay, okay." Ning Zhuo sighed and raised his eyes filled with expectation, "Then Ancestor, appoint me as the Young Clan Leader. When I inherit the position of Clan Leader in the future, it will be justified." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Jiufan replied, "Ning Zhuo, do not bring up such requests again!" His tone became even more displeased. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Alright, alright." Ning Zhuo pouted, "Then please grant me some magical artifacts, such as robes and armor, to protect myself?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"I want to take risks as bait; Iâ€™m not afraid of the unexpected, but I fear the worst. If I have magical artifacts on me that can be triggered instantly, I can feel a bit more at ease." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Jiufan shook his head, telling Ning Zhuo that magical artifacts cannot be casually granted, worried that assassins would detect them from afar and refrain from making a move if they found out Ning Zhuo had magical artifacts. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo then sought the Ice Heart Technique. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Jiufan scolded him for being greedy, saying that this technique is the foundation of the family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo's contributions to the family have not yet met the standard; how could he be taught the Ice Heart Technique? </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Jiufan warned him not to attempt to make excessive demands during this opportunity, violating the family rules. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo suddenly had a thought and mentioned, "Ancestor, may I split from the family?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"If I split from the family, I wonâ€™t have to be the leader of the main family or the Young Clan Leader anymore. I would directly be the leader of the branch family; wouldnâ€™t that be wonderful!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Jiufan was furious, blowing his beard and glaring: "You little brat! At such a young age, you actually want to split the family? You dare to bring it up in front of me; do you want to die? Or do you want to be locked in the dungeon for life?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo hurriedly waved his hands, explaining, "Ancestor, please listen to me." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Look, you and Lord Zhu Xuanji are quite close. The three major families in Fire Persimmon Immortal City are also closely connected. This is correct." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"But there are also great risks involved. What if in the future, Lord Zhu fails to compete and does not become the Lord of Lava Immortal City?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"When that time comes, he will just pack up and leave, and our Ning family will still have to make a living in Fire Persimmon Immortal City." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Even the old farmers know that you canâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"So, you and the main line are close to Lord Zhu, while I take some branch families to split off and align with the current Lordâ€™s family." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"In this way, regardless of which side ultimately wins, our Ning family can stand undefeated." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Jiufan: â€¦ </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Zhu Xuanji: </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">You canâ€™t say that Ning Zhuoâ€™s words donâ€™t make sense! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">With this thought, Ning Jiufan said to Zhu Xuanji, "My second son is young and speaks without restraint, causing Lord Zhu to laugh." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhu Xuanji sighed softly, "This is indeed a technique for the familyâ€™s longevity." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"For example, the first family among cultivatorsâ€”the Gu family. Gu Tian and Gu Le are respectively the left ministers and national masters of the rival countries, White Light Kingdom and Grand Flood Kingdom." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"This phenomenon is indeed common." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Jiufan quickly continued to make excuses: "Hmph, Ning Zhuo is too young and short-sighted. If he knew that the Lordâ€™s mansion truly wanted his life, he would surely laugh at his current foolishness!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Zhu Xuanji waved his hand, signaling Ning Jiufan to stop speaking, then pointed at Ning Zhuo and nodded. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Jiufan understood the meaning and immediately transmitted a message to Ning Zhuo: "Enough, kid!" He dared not let Ning Zhuo continue making requests. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Iâ€™ll lend you a protective spirit talisman that can withstand a full-force attack from an ordinary Golden Core." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Iâ€™ll also grant you three directional escape talismans that can instantly transport you to pre-arranged teleportation points." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Lastly, Iâ€™ll give you three taels of Ice Jade Wine. Do a good job, and afterwards, Iâ€™ll count it as a great contribution to the Ning family!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuoâ€™s eyes lit up upon hearing this: "Three taels... three taels is a bit too little, Ancestor." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"How about one jin? Letâ€™s make it one jin, alright?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Hmph!" Ning Jiufan could no longer hold back, using his means to release an invisible pressure. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo was caught off guard and was instantly pressed to the ground, prostrating with his body, his bones creaking slightly as if he were carrying a mountain. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He hurriedly begged for mercy. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Jiufan then withdrew his means. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo regained his freedom, his face filled with lingering fear, raising his palm and extending five fingers: "Five taels, five taels, Ancestor." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Iâ€™m risking my life here!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Jiufan: â€¦ </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhu Xuanji: </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Hahaha." Ning Jiufan couldnâ€™t help but laugh. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He was laughing out of anger. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">After a moment. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">In Ning Zhuoâ€™s courtyard. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Su Mo was in a small pavilion, enjoying fine wine and delicacies while mockingly taunting Ning Zhuo. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"The food is good, but a bit soft." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The wine is also good, but not strong enough, a bit too mild." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Good, good, good. This fine wine and food are indeed worthy of the Ning familyâ€™s preparation, just like the Ning family!" The two Foundation Establishment guards serving him had faces as dark as the bottom of a pot. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">At this moment, Ning Zhuoâ€™s voice came: "Su Mo, youâ€™re so arrogant!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Iâ€™m treating you to fine wine and food, wanting to establish a good relationship with you, yet you donâ€™t appreciate it." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"The key is that you insult me, and thatâ€™s one thing, but insulting the reputation of my Ning family is utterly detestable." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"What do you want to spar about? Speak!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Iâ€™m ready." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The two Foundation Establishment guards looked at Ning Zhuo, both surprised and delighted, secretly praising: After all, itâ€™s Young Master Ning Zhuo, a sixteen-year-old genius, full of youthful spirit, unwilling to be humiliated, caring for his family; truly a good son of the Ning family branch! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Su Mo stood up, carefully sizing up Ning Zhuo, his heart filled with joy, but his face wore a serious expression. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After a round of conversation, he clasped his hands to Ning Zhuo and stated his request. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This time, if he wins the spar, he asks Ning Zhuo to inform him of the contents of the Demonic Dao Scripture. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo sneered: "So itâ€™s for this." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He extended three fingers and swore publicly: "I swear on the reputation of my Ning family that I have never obtained a single word from this so-called Demonic Dao Scripture." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"You came to my door, looking for me to spar, and youâ€™re not sincere at all." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Using the reputation of the Ning family to coerce me, to kidnap me into agreeing to spar with you, is even more sinister." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"I donâ€™t care who you have behind you or what orders youâ€™ve received; this time, I will make you pay the most painful price!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Su Mo became nervous upon hearing this, forcing himself to calm down, sneering: "What? You, Ning Zhuo, want to bully me, a mere wanderer, with numbers?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Hmph, I wonâ€™t make it difficult for you tonight." Ning Zhuo said, "Tomorrow morning, weâ€™ll meet on the martial arts stage for a true showdown." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"You want to be the first to eat the crab? Good, I also want to kill a chicken to warn the monkeys." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Su Moâ€™s expression changed again, looking increasingly grim. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Jiufan: â€¦ </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Zhu Xuanji: â€¦ </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The two exchanged glances in secret, both thinking: After Ning Zhuo received the protective talisman and directional escape talismans, his courage surged, moving from one extreme to another. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The next day. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Early in the morning, the martial arts stage was packed with people. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The main characters on the stage were two: Ning Zhuo and Su Mo. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Soon after, only Ning Zhuo remained as the main character. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">In the area he was most skilled inâ€”making talismansâ€”Su Mo was clearly at a disadvantage, losing decisively without any objections. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Considering that Ning Zhuo was only sixteen years old, the gap between the two felt even more exaggerated. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">However, just as Su Mo stepped down, a second challenger appeared. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The challenger stepped onto the martial arts stage, wanting to spar with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The request was still for the Demonic Dao Scripture. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo sneered upon hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He then swore publicly that he had already been approached by Zhu Xuanji and had no knowledge of this Demonic Dao Scripture. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">There were many truths in the rumors, but the claim that the scripture belonged to him was purely a rumor, utterly unfounded. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo rejected the second challenge: "You all come for the Demonic Dao Scripture, but unfortunately, youâ€™ve found the wrong person." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"How can I comply with your wishes, sparring endlessly?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"My Ning family is a righteous clan; I, Ning Zhuo, was born in a place of righteousness, witnessing and hearing all the benevolent ways. Between dawn and dusk, teachers impart wisdom, good deeds and righteousness gather like spring rain, subtly influencing my heart." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"However, we righteous cultivators stand upright before heaven and earth, ancestors; kindness is not without its sharp edge, how can we be swayed by such petty schemes?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"From now on, anyone who wishes to spar with me, using the reputation of the Ning family to pressure me, will be regarded as an enemy, and I will not rest until one of us is dead!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Now, who will challenge me?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">For a moment, the crowd below the martial arts stage fell silent. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In the distance, atop a tavern. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Golden Core disciples of the Great Purity Palace had sinister expressions, their mouths moving as they transmitted messages. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Among the crowd, one person received the order, pushed through the crowd, and stepped onto the martial arts stage. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Ning Zhuo, I challenge you; itâ€™s a fight to the death!" The newcomer was a burly man, rolling up his sleeves and clenching his fists like sandbags.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">At first glance, he was clearly a physical cultivator. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo stared at the burly man, his eyes gleaming coldly: "Iâ€™ve said what I needed to say, yet you still come at me aggressively, full of malice; you must be a waste cultivator!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Come, someone, kill him!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">In the next moment, the Foundation Establishment guards, who had long been eager to move, leaped onto the stage and swarmed the burly man. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The burly man was taken aback: "Isnâ€™t this a one-on-one duel?! How despicable!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He was overwhelmed by spells, and before he died, he could only let out a scream. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo stood with his hands behind his back, looking down at the stage: "What kind of morality is there to discuss with waste cultivators? Naturally, itâ€™s about exterminating demons and upholding the Dao, and everyone strives to be the first!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Do you really think that our righteous cultivators are easy to bully?!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Wherever his gaze fell, everyone avoided it.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
