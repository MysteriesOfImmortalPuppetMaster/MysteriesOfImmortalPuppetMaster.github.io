<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The heart and final destination of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long plan—the sacrificial altar for the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual—now stood before Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He had already met all three conditions required to ascend the altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">However, the Branch of the Forgetful River encircling the altar remained the final obstacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"One step away," Ning Zhuo thought. "If I can breach this last barrier, my grand plan will be complete!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The presence of a Forgetful River branch here initially startled Ning Zhuo, but he quickly accepted it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">After all, the Forgetful River Prefecture was named after the Forgetful River. It was only natural for them to have various methods of utilizing its waters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Moreover, the capital city of the Forgetful River Prefecture, Immortal City, was built upon the Forgetful River itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"But how am I to cross this river?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Mother and the leader took another route, aiming straight for Immortal City. They'll face the true Forgetful River, not this branch before me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Mother must have a way to cross the river. Why hasn't she told me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Furthermore, where is Lord Wangchuan's true form?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This was Ning Zhuo's first time entering this core battlefield. He knew nothing of the previous clashes between Lord Wangchuan and the other major powers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"This Earth Aspect Incarnation must belong to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"His True Form hasn't appeared yet. He might be severely injured, or he could be trapped within the Sacrificial Altar, held back by its final mechanism."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">At that moment, the blood-red glow above the altar began to gradually fade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo speculated inwardly: Could the complete disappearance of this blood light signify the end of the Sacrificial Rite?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"But the crucial question remains—how can I breach this Branch of the Forgetful River?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo immediately recalled the prophetic poem:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Ghost tides surge, White Paper in peril,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">A lone goose carries a candle, piercing heaven’s veil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The guest star appears in the north of the literary pivot,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">Myriad Manifestations Lamp ignites, shattering calamity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">"This poem offers no clues to help me cross the Forgetful River!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">"What should I do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">Ning Zhuo fell into a daze, his thoughts drifting aimlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">"I am the Yang Realm's destined hero, the White Paper Immortal City's savior, and the Human Tribulation of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord! There must be a way to pass; this can't be a dead end!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">"Perhaps the answer to crossing the river lies within my grasp?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">Having just used the Return to Silence Path Candle from his Storage Belt to overcome the Turbid Qi Barrier, Ning Zhuo began scanning his belongings again with his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">Soon, his divine sense settled on the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">"Can this boat carry me across the river?" Ning Zhuo instinctively stroked his Mechanism Ring, but it remained as silent as the grave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">His thoughts shifted. "What if I don't use any devices and simply swim across the Branch of Time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Even with this new idea, the Mechanism Ring remained deathly still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">A flicker of worry deep in Ning Zhuo's eyes made him stop stroking the ring. His gaze and thoughts both wandered, various notions rising and falling in his divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">His gaze swept past the Ice Coffin floating in mid-air, and a thought arose: "This Ice Coffin bears some resemblance to the Return to Silence Path Candle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">"It seals a Scissors Magic Treasure. Before I arrived, the Earth Aspect Incarnation was still attacking the Ice Coffin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">"Clearly, this Ice Coffin must be a relic left behind by some powerful being. During the conflict, it sealed away one of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's trump cards!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">"This Scissors Magic Treasure must be very important to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. Otherwise, his opponent wouldn't have treated it with such caution, and the Earth Aspect Incarnation wouldn't be relentlessly eroding the Ice Coffin to retrieve it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">Ning Zhuo was unaware that the ice coffin was also a transformed candle, specifically the Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle belonging to the Ghostfire Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">The young man's gaze fixed on the ice coffin, and he suddenly shivered slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">"The Return to Silence Path Candle has an ice coffin shape, and this one does too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">"Could these similar appearances be a sign of Heaven's Will, a deliberate clue meant for me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes, extending his divine sense to scrutinize the object. His thoughts naturally turned to the next level: "This ice coffin radiates a frigid aura, being both yin and ice elemental. Could it freeze a branch of the Forgetful River?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">"Verifying this is actually quite simple."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Ning Zhuo reached into his Storage Belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">With a flick of his wrist, he unleashed a swarm of Mechanical Golden Swallows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">The golden swallows soared in formation, swiftly ascending toward the ice coffin suspended high above.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">Just as Ning Zhuo was pondering how to maneuver the ice coffin closer to the Forgetful River branch, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God struck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">A whip-like torrent of turbid qi, like a python's strike, viciously lashed out, annihilating nearly the entire swarm. Only two or three swallows managed to reach the ice coffin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">Witnessing this, Ning Zhuo was both surprised and delighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's reaction inadvertently confirmed his earlier conjecture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">Of course, this could also be a deliberate trap set by the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, or perhaps he's overly preoccupied with the Scissors Magic Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">Regardless, Ning Zhuo had at least discovered a potential weak point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">He immediately produced more mechanical constructs, manipulating them to scatter like stars across the sky as they sporadically charged toward the airborne Ice Coffin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's attention was once again diverted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">In no time, the Bronze War Chariot was riddled with wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">Though Luo Si was doing his utmost to protect it, the overwhelming pressure from the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God often left him no time to tend to the chariot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Massive cracks spiderwebbed across its surface, a horrifying sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">"Hold on, old friend!" Luo Si cried out to the chariot, his voice thick with emotion. Though he knew it would be destroyed in this battle, a surge of unwavering resolve burned within him alongside his sorrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">If the chariot fell, it would be even harder for him to contain the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Their only hope now was for Ning Zhuo to find a way to breach the enemy's defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">"Hmm?" Luo Si, standing atop the Bronze War Chariot, watched as the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God struck again, but this time not at him, but at the Mechanical Golden Swallows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">"That Ice Coffin is the key!" A realization struck Luo Si's heart, sudden and undeniable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">His gaze immediately turned to Ning Zhuo, and he inwardly marveled, "As expected of my wise lord—he's already identified the key to breaking this deadlock!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Seizing the opportunity, Luo Si quickly cast a healing spell on himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Having single-handedly held off the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, he'd had no chance to rest. Now that he had the chance, he made every second count!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">"Damn brat!" the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God roared, furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Ning Zhuo, positioned behind Luo Si, continuously launched Mechanical Golden Swallows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">For the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, the cost of these swallows was negligible. Ning Zhuo's Foundation Establishment cultivation was to him like an ant underfoot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Yet this very ant, using these cheap Mechanical Golden Swallows, was now restraining his Earth Fiend Turbid Corruption Avatar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">No wonder the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God was so enraged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">Luo Si felt a great sense of relief!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Not only had he fully healed himself, but he also had the leisure to stabilize the Bronze War Chariot's condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Otherwise, given its precarious state, it could have collapsed completely at any moment, and Luo Si wouldn't have been surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Earth Element - Earth Fiend Collapsing Rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God extended his arms, palms facing upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Spiritual energy erupted around him, releasing wave after wave of power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">These waves rapidly expanded, scattering against the Turbid Qi Barrier that enveloped the Altar Battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">The Earth Lung Turbid Qi churned like boiling water, violently roiling and rapidly coalescing into massive boulders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">The boulders rained down, each imbued with Earthly Fiend energy, hurtling toward the Altar Battlefield with terrifying force!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">The flying stones, swirling with fiendish energy, unleashed a ferocious onslaught. They varied in size, some as colossal as dragons or mammoths, others at least as large as Luo Si's Bronze War Chariot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">The deluge of boulders pummeled the Golden Swallow Automaton Swarm, causing catastrophic damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">Luo Si frantically maneuvered his Bronze War Chariot, dodging the hail of stones with desperate skill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">"If one of these hits me squarely," Ning Zhuo thought, cold sweat beading on his forehead, "I'm a dead man!" In desperation, he hurled his Automaton Token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">Sky Iron Heroic Armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">The token twisted and morphed into a Mechanical Battle Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">Golden Swallow Tailoring Clouds! Han Armor Covers the Body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">The Sky Iron Heroic Armor disassembled, and the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel spun out, adhering to Ning Zhuo's chest. The spine piece attached to his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">Twelve Divided Spirit Mirrors simultaneously emitted silver beams. Guided by the silver light, the arm and leg armor precisely locked into place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">The storage belt, resembling a jade serpent coiled twice around Ning Zhuo's waist, emitted a spiritual glow that formed a protective membrane, enveloping his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Clack, clack, clack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">The helmet, breastplate, vambraces, greaves, and the mechanical golden wings on his back snapped into place, adjusting to fit his form perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Assisted by the mechanical battle armor, Ning Zhuo shot forward like lightning, dodging a collapsing rock barrage and formally initiating the mobile phase of the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Witnessing this, Luo Si decisively ordered, "Qing Jiao Army, retreat immediately beyond the Turbid Qi Barrier!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Qing Chi gritted her teeth, hesitating. She watched Ning Zhuo charge into the falling debris, consumed by worry and longing to fight by her lover's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">Qing Yan gripped her shoulder and pulled her back. "You're no good at flying. You'd only be a burden there. Retreat now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">"I won't!" Qing Chi protested stubbornly. "Even if I die, I'll die with Little Ma!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Qing Yan sighed. "You foolish girl! We're going to win this! Heaven's Will is with us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">"Luo Si's orders are correct!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">"We need to preserve our forces to support them. That's our most crucial role. Our contribution is vital!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Knowing her father was right, Qing Chi allowed herself to be led away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">Just as she was about to be completely pulled out of the Curved Path, Qing Chi struggled to speak: "I'll stay in the passage and watch Little Ma fight. If necessary, I'll join the battle!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Qing Yan hesitated, then finally gritted his teeth. "You stubborn girl, remember this well—you are the commander of our army. Staying alive and maintaining control of the Qing-Jiao Army, providing military might to support them, will be far more helpful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">"Dad, take this!" Qing Chi pulled something from her robes and tossed it to Qing Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Qing Yan caught it and saw it was the Military Artifact Sacrificial Barracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Qing Yan, along with Jiao Ma's biological father, led the Qing-Jiao Army back to their previous position on the Black Cloud Battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Qing Yan activated the Ceremonial Barracks, providing a place for the Qing-Jiao Army to encamp and rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">With the protection of the barracks, the soldiers of the Qing-Jiao Army felt considerably better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Jiao Ma's biological father then led a group out of the barracks, dispersing to scour the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Previously, they hadn't had the time, but now they needed to thoroughly loot the battlefield, gathering spoils to replenish the Military Seed and convert into military logistics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">The Qing-Jiao Army's logistics were already critically low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">With abundant military logistics, their options expanded significantly. They could employ military strategies like "Money-Communicating Ghost" and "Life-Buying Coin," or use the supplies as sacrificial offerings on an altar to attract the assistance of ghosts and deities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Ning Zhuo also noticed the Qing-Jiao Army's retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">He sighed in relief and cast an admiring glance at Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Luo Si's position was even more precarious, with himself and his chariot constantly under the intense scrutiny of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God. Yet he continued to command the battle with remarkably clear insight into the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">"But now I can't monitor the Qing-Jiao Army's status anymore."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">"If we get a chance later, prioritize planting the 'Life Hanging by a Thread' condition on Qing Chi and the others!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">The Military Seed was no longer on Ning Zhuo's person, stripping him of control over the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">"I need to redeploy military forces!" Ning Zhuo transmitted his command to Luo Si through his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Luo Si's response was terse: "Roger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Just as Qing Yan had said, the Qing-Jiao Army's military might was crucial. Without this leverage, Ning Zhuo couldn't unlock Nascent Soul-level combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">And only by possessing such formidable strength could he meet the minimum requirements to participate in this perilous grand battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">Luo Si also needed military assistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Without the military power amplification of the Qing-Jiao Army, he would likely have been severely injured by now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">The sky was pitch black, and countless yellowish-brown boulders hurtled through the air in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Ning Zhuo, clad in Sky Iron Heroic Armor, moved like a streak of refracted gold light through the darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">From the moment he activated the armor, he had disabled its safety limits, pushing it to its maximum speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">The flames erupted by the Li Fire Tongue Array were ferocious, and each emergency maneuver made the Sky Iron Heroic Armor groan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">A boulder the size of an elephant roared toward him from the side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">Ning Zhuo activated his divine sense, hurling over a dozen Mechanical Golden Swallows directly at the massive rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">A series of explosions echoed as the Mechanical Golden Swallows and the boulder mutually annihilated each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">Countless rock fragments scattered in all directions, some still striking Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">The Sky Iron Heroic Armor seemed to have been repeatedly struck by a hammer, its Earth Shield Formation patterns developing fine cracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">Ning Zhuo strained every ounce of his strength just to barely maintain control of his flight direction. The armor's speed was too great, and the lateral impact from the fragments easily caused him to veer off course.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">Amidst this storm of flying rocks, a single misjudgment of direction could send Ning Zhuo crashing into a boulder, resulting in a fate no different from the self-destruction of the Mechanical Golden Swallow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">"Faster! Faster!" Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">The Sky Iron Heroic Armor weaved frantically between the giant rocks, dancing on the precipice between life and death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">The wind resistance was terrifyingly intense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">Despite the White Tiger Shattering Army Formation on the Golden Wings, which should have sliced through the air, Ning Zhuo felt moments where the entire Mechanical Battle Armor seemed to suddenly become trapped in viscous mud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">"No, it's these giant rocks that are messing with us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">Ning Zhuo quickly realized that some of the rocks repelled objects, while others drew them in. The potent Earthly Fiend emanating from the rocks was also negatively affecting the armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">The Mystic Iron Breastplate turned crimson-hot, emitting a burning smell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">Under the influence of the Earthly Fiend, the Earth Shield Formation gradually failed. The temperature inside the armor rapidly climbed, turning it into a steaming cauldron. Ning Zhuo broke into a violent sweat, his clothes soaking through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="286">The Dual Polarity Convergence Formation also began to malfunction. The protective qi membrane it created was now as thin as paper. Where his body pressed against the armor, every emergency turn sent sharp, dull pains radiating through his body.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
