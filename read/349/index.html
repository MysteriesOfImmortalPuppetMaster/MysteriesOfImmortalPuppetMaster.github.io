<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 349: Meng Yehu</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div><paragraph index="0">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon’s refining cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="1">The formation activated, forming array patterns in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="2">The patterns were gold and red, interweaving to form a furnace-like appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The formation was at the Nascent Soul level, but it needed to be anchored to a physical body to fully exert its power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">When Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit initially crafted this mechanical dragon, however, the resources hadn’t been sufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Even using its dragon body, it couldn't create the furnace inside the refining cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="6">The Dragon Turtle fire spirit, guarding the volcano for years,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">had accumulated many Nascent Soul level materials in its treasury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">But Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could only follow instructions rigidly,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">lacking the ability to improvise or adapt the mechanical blueprints with available materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">So, the refining cabin only had the formation, without a furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Similar situations existed in other cabins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">This had both advantages and disadvantages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">A fully equipped Myriad-Li Game Dragon would consume much more magical power than the current one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">The Ten Thousand Miles Traversing Dragon was a Nascent Soul level mechanical construct, meant to be used by a cultivator's Nascent Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">So, it had an incubation cabin where the Nascent Soul could reside and provide vast magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">Currently, the incubation cabin was empty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">It relied on the massive amount of fire essence in the storage room,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">burned in the engine cabin to provide energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This consumed an enormous amount of fire essence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">Before setting out, Ning Zhuo had purchased a lot of fire essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Initially, the fire essence cabin was full, with more stored in his storage belt and bags.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">Now, nearly 60% of the full cabin's fire essence had been consumed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Like now, activating the refining cabin's formation also heavily consumed fire essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Flames burned silently, like warm silk dancing in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">The leaping fire fragrance seemed to perform an elegant, silent song and dance, warming Ning Zhuo's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Large amounts of discarded items vanished in the burning, leaving behind bits of spiritual essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">The spiritual essence flickered with pink light, like a small group of fireflies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin stood silently beside Ning Zhuo, motionless,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">as a small part of the spiritual essence entered her body - this was Meng Yaoyin's spiritual essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Compared to the total spiritual essence, it was only a small fraction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">Ning Zhuo temporarily sealed and stored the remaining spiritual essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The purer the spiritual essence, the better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">For this mixed spiritual essence, Ning Zhuo didn't know how to use it yet. So, he could only store it for now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo examined the Buddhist Healer and found that his mother's spiritual essence had increased by less than 10%, about 7%.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">"Better than nothing, I suppose," Ning Zhuo sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Days ago, he had already performed a fire burial once,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">giving the Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin about 20% spiritual essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">That time, he burned the junk items collected by the Fox God from searching the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">This time, it was the somewhat valuable household items he had looted from the western valley after the Black Wind Tiger Demon's death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">After all, the Black Wind Tiger Demon wasn't a pure beast demon, but a demon cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">Its subordinates were all demon cultivators with growing wisdom and requirements for daily life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin's spiritual essence had reached 100% when in the Lava Immortal Palace, after burning the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">According to Ning Zhuo's calculations, Meng Yaoyin's spiritual essence had long reached the wisdom spirit stage, but she bore a dao injury that constantly eroded her spiritual essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This erosion and burden kept the Buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin constantly dull, unable to communicate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">Even the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng could say a few words to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Every time Ning Zhuo collected relics, he would quickly perform a fire burial,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">extract the spiritual essence, and add it to the buddhist healer Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The more abundant the spiritual essence, the more endurance it had against the dao injury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">This principle was easy to understand - the same injury would have worse consequences for someone with a weaker physique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Mother, I've grown up now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">"This time, I will definitely cure you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Although the buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin couldn't communicate,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">Ning Zhuo would still stand in front of the buddhist healer mechanism each time and say a few words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">This was both to comfort his mother and to encourage himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">He put away the buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin and, without stopping the refining cabin's formation,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">threw a set of tiger bones into the "furnace" outlined by the array patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">These tiger bones were pitch black, emitting a lot of demonic energy. The demonic energy was at the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">These were the bones of the Black Wind Tiger Demon!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">In life, it practiced the Flesh and Blood Devouring technique, even reaching the Golden Core level in demonic cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The most valuable parts of its corpse were the demon core, flesh, and soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">Zhu Xuanji had taken all of these.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo only got this set of tiger bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">The tiger bones floated in mid-air, wrapped in flames, slowly melting until completely dissolved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The condensed spiritual essence gathered together, forming a tiger head shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Ning Zhuo then took out the spirit storage box and opened a small crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The tiger head spiritual essence leaned against the edge of the spirit storage box,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">naturally attracting many spiritual essences, letting them float out through the crack in the box.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Like fireflies, dots of spiritual essence merged into the tiger head spiritual essence, rapidly expanding its size.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">When first refined, it was only the size of an adult's fist,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">but after fully gathering the spiritual essence, it was the size of a human head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">"The spiritual essence is of very high quality," Ning Zhuo's eyes shone with joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">He directly used the divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The tiger demon spiritual essence was what he had refined, naturally close to him and unable to resist the divine ability,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">completely controlled by Ning Zhuo. This process was effortless and smooth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Father God," the tiger demon's spiritual essence, actively conveyed a message to Ning Zhuo through the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">Ning Zhuo immediately felt the tiger demon's spiritual essence's admiration for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Although spiritual essence had no memories of its past life, its recognition of its master was determined by its past experiences and personality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Just as Dasheng regarded Ning Zhuo as his lord, the tiger demon regarded Ning Zhuo as its Father God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">From this, it could be inferred that the Black Wind Tiger Demon had been well cared for by its father, the official Mountain God Tiger God of Mist Concealment Mountain, and had a good father-son relationship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">This information was obtained by Zhu Xuanji after capturing the Black Wind Tiger Demon's soul and searching it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Unfortunately, after this ordeal, the tiger demon's soul had almost dispersed, its value drastically reduced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Now, the tiger demon's spiritual essence spoke again: "Please, Father God, bestow a name upon me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">From just these two sentences, Ning Zhuo could feel that it was much more intelligent and sensitive than Dasheng's spiritual essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, then said:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Our fate comes from the Meng family, you posses the innate talent of night shadow yin evil,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">and in life you were of the tiger species... let's call you Meng Yehu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The tiger demon spiritual essence shook slightly, very satisfied with this name, and immediately said:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">"Meng Yehu thanks Father God for the name."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">After conversing with Meng Yehu for a while, Ning Zhuo contained it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">Spirit Cognition level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo confirmed that the Black Wind Tiger Demon's spiritual essence was higher in quality than Dasheng's, and more than by just one level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">When spiritual essence reaches the wisdom spirit stage, there are five sub-levels:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Spirit Communication, Spirit Intuition, Spirit Cognition, Spirit Perception, and Spirit Mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">Spirit Communication is Dasheng's current level, having some intelligence and being able to communicate with external objects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Spirit Intuition means deeper intelligence, easier communication,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">and deeper understanding of instructions, almost never making mistakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">As the saying goes, "hearts with spiritual intuition connect instantly,"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">with just a slight hint, it can understand the meaning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">At the Spirit Cognition level, intelligence deepens further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">Not only can it understand meanings, but it can also research and learn about meanings, constantly accumulating and cultivating its own knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The qualitative change here is very significant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Because cultivation methods themselves are a form of knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"At the Spirit Cognition level, spiritual essence can learn cultivation methods!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">This gave Ning Zhuo a whole new expectation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In its past life, Meng Yehu had been deceived and schemed against, forced to cultivate the Flesh and Blood Devouring demonic technique, which didn't actually match its innate talents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">"I should craft a mechanical body for it, similar to its past life's tiger head and human body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Then carefully select a cultivation method that matches its innate night shadow yin evil talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">"If I can do this, Meng Yehu's combat power would be quite impressive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"At that time, with Dasheng on my left and Meng Yehu on my right..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Ning Zhuo's lips curled into a slight smile, unable to resist imagining the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He had a premonition that Dasheng and Meng Yehu would become his left and right arms, his two main combat forces in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">Ning Zhuo left the refining cabin. He had already closed the formation inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This was a Nascent Soul level formation that consumed a lot of fire essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Ning Zhuo knew this but still wanted to experiment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Familiarizing himself with the limits of these mechanical parts and collecting relevant information was extremely valuable to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">From this experiment, Ning Zhuo discovered: Even without a furnace, the refining formation alone was enough for him to use for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The tiger demon night bones just now were at the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">How could Ning Zhuo's Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra refine them so quickly?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"In the future, I'll only use it to process Golden Core and Nascent Soul level materials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">"For Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment level materials, I can rely on myself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At this time, Sun Lingtong was constantly watching over the dragon head cabin, so Ning Zhuo wasn't worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">He turned into the storage cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The storage cabin was full of treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Spirit stones were piled into a person-high mound in the corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The ten thousand mid-grade spirit stones obtained from the Fox God were on the surface of this mound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Most of the spirit stones in this pile were still low-grade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The only supreme-grade ice attribute crystal stone in Ning Zhuo's possession was always carried with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
