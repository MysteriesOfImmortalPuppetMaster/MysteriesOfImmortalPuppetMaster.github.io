<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Netherworld's sky remained perpetually dim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Qingjiao Army advanced swiftly across the gray-black plains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">On the back of a Black Blood Paper Horse, Luo Si interrupted his healing, opened his eyes, and gazed toward the horizon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">A flicker of confusion crossed his features.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Water Burial Valley is right there!" Ning Zhuo declared, knowing the location well. After all, Sun Lingtong had once come here, only to be intercepted nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo's expression also turned puzzled - the scene before him differed greatly from his memories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">A dense, black-gray mist billowed upward from the valley, coalescing into an oppressive, leaden cloud that hung low in the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Two black hills loomed like the skeletal remains of colossal beasts, crouched in eternal slumber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo frowned. "Why do these black hills seem so much shorter than I remember?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The hills resembled two gargantuan beasts locked in eternal confrontation, their bodies torn apart by a narrow, bottomless chasm - the entrance to Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"A major battle clearly took place here!" Luo Si communicated telepathically, his expression grave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Both men wore worried expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Luo Si's concern was for the Greybone Elder, while Ning Zhuo's thoughts were fixed on the Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">As they drew closer, the details of the gray-black mist became clearer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Countless tiny, grayish-white flocculent particles drifted and swirled within the mist, resembling burnt paper ash or the spores of some fungus. They rotated silently, emitting a nauseating stench - a putrid mix of mold, corpse rot, and heavy aquatic reek.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"This is the Burial Water, unique to Water Burial Valley," Luo Si explained, his voice heavy with solemnity. "Normally, it flows through the valley like a river."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong had never entered the valley, but Luo Si had ventured in and out countless times, making him intimately familiar with its terrain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo remained silent, his anxiety growing with each passing moment. He desperately wanted to plunge into the valley and search for his mother immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Yet he forced himself to restrain his impulse, instead ordering his troops to maintain full alert and advance slowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This measured response earned him an approving glance from Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Having weathered several major battles, Ning Zhuo's military acumen had far surpassed that of ordinary commanders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Establish camp nearby and guard Qingchi well," Ning Zhuo commanded. "Ensure she suffers no further harm. We'll be back soon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Qingchi remained unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Unlike Luo Si, who had recovered quickly and was already able to ride his horse, Qingchi was still unable to move on her own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo ordered the Qingjiao Army to temporarily encamp near the entrance of Water Burial Valley. He and Luo Si then ventured into the valley to investigate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Upon reaching the entrance, a putrid stench struck Ning Zhuo's nose like a physical blow, nearly suffocating him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He quickly held his breath, allowing Luo Si to lead the way as they entered Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The valley walls were riddled with honeycomb-like holes, covered in thick, greasy moss, and marked with the slick trails of crawling insects and snakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"This place must have once been pristine, with clear waters and fresh air," Luo Si sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Uncertain of the situation, the two cautiously chose to proceed on foot rather than flying - a move that would have made them easy targets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The ground beneath their feet wasn't rock or soil, but a flat, swampy expanse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">It was a mixture of bone fragments from destroyed demonic entities, decaying aquatic plants, viscous mud, and fragments of pale white talisman paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Burial Water continued to be drawn into the sky, transforming into a gray-black mist - residual energy from a fierce battle still affecting the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo could only discern that the spell involved wasn't water-based.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"There must have been a terrifying clash of spells here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">As they ventured deeper, the mountain walls on either side grew increasingly jagged and menacing. Shrouded in swirling black and gray mist, they resembled grotesque demons poised to pounce at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The two had already activated their divine sense and cast detection spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">After cautiously advancing several hundred steps, the gap between the mountain walls widened considerably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Rounding a bend, they found themselves before a vast battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The ground was flat and divided in half: one side covered in thick frost, radiating bone-chilling cold, and the other scorched black, as if seared by intense flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Spiderweb-like cracks crisscrossed the mountain slopes, while the walls themselves bore twisted lines and deep scars, hinting at unimaginable forces that had ravaged the area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"What are these?" Ning Zhuo murmured, his eyes narrowing as his heart sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">At the edge of the battlefield, he spotted countless fragments of Paper People scattered across the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As they crossed the battlefield, the big-headed youth easily recognized the debris as remnants of the Paper Person army from White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Pressing onward, they noticed the density of Paper Person fragments increasing dramatically along the mountain path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Torn paper arms and legs, shattered paper armor, and twisted fragments of paper weapons lay scattered among the mud and rubble, forming a macabre graveyard of paper scraps that sent shivers down their spines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Moments later, they reached the middle section of Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This place has changed dramatically!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The once-spacious mountain path was now buried and blocked by massive piles of shattered rock, forming a chaotic rubble heap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Amidst this rubble lay several colossal, mountain-sized corpses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The upper half of a Hundred-Armed Ghost God's body was mostly buried under the debris. Over half of its hundred massive arms had been severed at the roots, while the remaining dozens hung limply, twisted and broken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Deep claw marks, some penetrating to the bone, crisscrossed its massive torso, alongside charred holes piercing through its chest and back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Ghost God's horned, monstrous head had been severed and tossed aside some distance away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Luo Si said grimly, "This is the Hundred-Armed Ghost God."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He stared at the distant head, his gaze fixed on the Ghost God's twisted expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This wasn't the only Ghost God that had fallen in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The corpse of a Ghost God whose lower body was composed of tree roots and upper body resembled a full-breasted woman was embedded in the stone wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Her tattered robes lay in shreds, surrounded by shattered black glass lanterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Luo Si continued, "This is a Nether Soul Lantern Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">After walking several hundred more steps, the two discovered an empty Skeleton King's Throne, toppled upside down on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The throne was massive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Nearby, a pile of rubble nearly buried the entire body of the third Ghost God, leaving only its right forearm exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The arm was riddled with cracks, from which eerie blue light radiated outward. The glow was faint yet unsettlingly strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo and Luo Si were deeply shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Of the three Ghost Gods, only the third remained unidentified. The first two were formidable combatants, their auras clearly at the Spirit Transformation stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yet all three had paid the ultimate price with their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Even if they were merely ordinary Spirit Transformation cultivators, far inferior to top-tier experts like the Lord of the Wangchuan Prefecture or the Silent Ghost Monk, they still possessed Spirit Transformation-level combat prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"The battle that occurred here must have been incredibly fierce!" Luo Si exclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo's gaze darkened. He instinctively thought of the three Divine Summoning Paper Puppets within his mother's Paper Person army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The Paper Person army led by my mother encountered a formidable enemy in this valley. Most of her soldiers were lost in the initial clashes, leaving a trail of scattered paper scraps along the way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Here, she had to use the three Divine Summoning Paper Puppets to summon the three great Ghost Gods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"In the end, all the Ghost Gods sacrificed themselves, allowing Mother to continue her journey!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo mentally reconstructed the battle, his worry deepening. "Every time Mother acts, she suffers a severe loss of spiritual energy. Her condition is limited; she can't sustain this for long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">As these thoughts raced through his mind, Ning Zhuo felt a burning anxiety alongside his solemn resolve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Luo Si shared the same urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Without a word, they quickened their pace, finally reaching the deepest part of Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The sight before them struck Ning Zhuo and Luo Si like a thunderbolt, leaving them breathless!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The valley floor had been completely reshaped!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">A massive crater, dozens of meters in diameter and several meters deep, dominated the center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The crater walls were smooth as glass, bearing traces of extreme heat and molten rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Viscous magma flowed within the crater, reminding Ning Zhuo of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Around the crater's edge, the earth twisted into bizarre, undulating formations. Rocks had been pushed outward, riddled with frost, scorch marks, corrosive pits, and other signs of devastation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Their divine senses expanded relentlessly, their detection spells permeating every direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Luo Si was the first to discover it. "There's a crude formation hidden within the magma."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The formation was at the Golden Core level, but its construction was so rudimentary that Luo Si easily breached it, creating an opening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The two dove through the hole into the formation's spatial realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Mother!" Ning Zhuo's body trembled violently, his Adam's apple bobbing as he nearly blurted out his innermost thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Senior Greybone!" Luo Si exclaimed in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Greybone Elder lay motionless on the ground, his withered body draped in a loose grey robe. He showed no signs of life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">A portion of his skull had been torn away, as if by some sharp claws.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">His eyes were tightly shut, and his corpse had been hastily arranged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin sat cross-legged beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">In one hand, she gripped the Great Serpent Scythe, its blade deeply embedded in a massive slab of rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Half of her body was missing - an arm, a leg, and the entire right side of her torso. Through the gaping wound, the twisted, mangled mechanisms within her body were visible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">At the edges of the wound, severed spiritual meridians hung like tattered ribbons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Jade Marrow Spirit Liquid, faintly glowing with Buddhist light, dripped steadily from the cracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Charred holes, fissures frozen in ice, and a terrifying, gaping wound pierced through her body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin's head hung low, stained with blood and grime. Her left eye was now a dark, empty socket, its internal mechanisms completely destroyed, leaving only a few severed spiritual meridians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">She should have collapsed, yet she sat upright in a meditative posture. The Great Serpent Scythe, resting on the ground, provided her only support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo keenly noticed that Meng Yaoyin's remaining right hand gripped the scythe's long handle with iron-like fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Her knuckles were twisted and deformed from the extreme force, as if she wished to fuse with the weapon, revealing a fierce determination to fight to the death against her enemies and protect her loved ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo's eyes burned crimson as he finally couldn't hold back his anguished cry: "Mother!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The cry immediately drew Luo Si's attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Overwhelming grief and boundless terror flooded Ning Zhuo's heart. He stumbled forward and collapsed before Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin remained utterly unresponsive, a deathly silence hanging in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo desperately suppressed his shattering mind, his fingertips trembling uncontrollably as he carefully examined the broken Puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin's spiritual essence had completely vanished!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">This realization shattered Ning Zhuo's heart and soul, nearly driving him to collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He suddenly understood that he too had paid a devastating price for thwarting Lord of the Wangchuan Prefecture's century-long scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">And this price was one he could never accept!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Click.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">At that moment, a faint, almost imperceptible sound, like a spring mechanism releasing, echoed through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">A jade slip slid out from within Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin's body. Ning Zhuo instinctively reached out and caught it before it could fall to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Luo Si, his eyes reddened with grief, knelt beside the Greybone Elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Drawn by the strange sound, he turned his sorrowful, questioning gaze toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo immediately submerged his divine sense into the jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The next moment, his mind convulsed violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">For the contents of the jade slip were a message his mother had left specifically for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Zhuo'er, don't despair. Your mother hasn't truly perished. Through the strange Dao, I've preserved a remnant of my life force. When you reach the Myriad Phenomena Sect, open my cave dwelling and take everything within. When the Great Serpent Scythe trembles, the time will be right. Cremate my earthly possessions, and the spiritual light will be restored."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Perhaps, through this misfortune, your mother might even gain a blessing in disguise, mastering deeper mysteries of the strange Dao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Upon reading this, Ning Zhuo immediately stopped crying, as if he had returned from hell to the mortal realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Mother!" He collapsed to the ground, utterly drained, feeling even more exhausted than he had after the battle on the sacrificial altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Thank goodness, thank goodness! There's still a chance to salvage everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The jade slip contained more information. After regaining his composure, Ning Zhuo continued reading.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Water Burial Valley has become a forbidden zone. Alas, though we joined forces with Senior Greybone to slay the formidable foe, we ultimately failed to save him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Zhuo'er, the Lord of the Wangchuan Prefecture will never rest! You must leave this place immediately - leave the Netherworld! Don't linger for a moment!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"The City Lord of White Paper Immortal City... this woman... we must guard against her with extreme caution. Whether Lord of the Wangchuan Prefecture wins or loses, the situation will be different for White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Therefore, you must properly manage the Qingjiao Army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"They must remain in the Black Swampland, yet also frequently enter the Netherworld."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"With guidance from Senior Greybone, I've uncovered many of the Profound Primordial Scholar's hidden strategies. By leveraging these strategies and coordinating with the army's composition, we can enable them to traverse between the Yin and Yang realms, maintaining their influence within the mire."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"You must personally care for Qingchi! I believe you already have some suspicions about her. All your questions will be answered in time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Under no circumstances can you allow her to remain with the Qingjiao Army, nor can you leave her in White Paper Immortal City. Both would endanger her life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Take her with you. Go to the Myriad Phenomena Sect together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"Before Senior Greybone passed away, he granted me permission to teach you the Water Burial Harmony Virtue Accumulation Sutra."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"You must diligently cultivate this Daoist scripture, accumulate merit, and dispel the Nether Heavens' resentment toward you..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"When you reach the Myriad Phenomena Sect, seek out... She was a close friend of mine. You can try to trust her."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">“I also held property rights in the Sect - one talisman business. Reveal your identity, and you should be able to inherit it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Do you remember what I told you? Do not investigate the Chaos Fate Sect. Your current strength is far from sufficient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo stood rooted to the spot, as still as a clay statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">His mother's words struck his heart like heavy hammer blows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Every arrangement, every line, radiated a mother's love and concern for her son...</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
