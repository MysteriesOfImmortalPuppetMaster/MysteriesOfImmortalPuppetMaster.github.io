<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 279: Mysteries in the Palm</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo sat enveloped in floating clouds, meditating and cultivating. Under the Cloud Concealment Bud, although he had the cultivation of the ninth level of the Qi Sea, he only displayed the fourth level. Recently, there had been too many situations that consumed his mana. Even with his ninth-level cultivation, he felt it was insufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">If he felt this way, the members of the three reformation teams felt it even more. They had to expend mana to actively complete various tasks to earn merits while also finding time to cultivate and advance their own cultivation. It was truly exhausting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">However, the three families had also brought out their reserves, providing a large supply of pills to fully compensate for the weaknesses of the reformation team members, striving to clear their cultivation obstacles. Even Zhu Xuanji and Zhu Zhen, two golden core cultivators, had personally contributed many subsidies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">As a result, Ning Zhuo obtained many good items, most of which he stored away. He had ventured too far and had no use for them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Suddenly, in his Divine Sea, Ning Zhuo's Buddha Heart Demon Seal radiated a brilliant Buddha light. The Buddha light enveloped Ning Zhuo's entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Who is probing my fate energy again?" Ning Zhuo quickly stopped his meditation, channeling all his mana into the Cloud Concealment Bud beneath his tongue. The two worked together to perfectly conceal his fate energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">A loud noise shook Ning Zhuo's bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"What happened?! What's going on outside?" Ning Zhuo opened his eyes within the floating clouds. At this moment, the Buddha light disappeared. Clearly, the person probing him had stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo immediately retracted the floating clouds, jumped to the ground, and swiftly opened the door to step into the courtyard. Ning Jiufan was already standing in the courtyard, gazing into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Just as Ning Zhuo was about to greet him, his gaze was firmly drawn to a scene in the sky!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">A massive fire python, nearly a hundred zhang long and as thick as an ancient tree, raised its head high, then its snake head, like a battering ram, fiercely struck the spherical light shield of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The familiar sound echoed in Ning Zhuo's ears. The Lava Immortal Palace beneath his feet trembled once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"So, it was this causing the commotion!" Ning Zhuo immediately understood, drawing a sharp breath. "Ancestor, is this a Nascent Soul-level beast king?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo had seen golden core-level fire snakes and fire pythons from afar. Such a massive body and such a powerful attack could not belong to a mere golden core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Jiufan nodded solemnly, "That's right!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo's heart sank, thinking, "This scarlet flame beast tide indeed has a Nascent Soul-level existence involved!" Crackling sounds echoed as large cracks rapidly appeared on the golden, semi-transparent spherical light shield. The crisp cracking sound was so clear, it was terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Almost all the cultivators in the Lava Immortal Palace were awakened, looking up at this scene with great concern. Their highest cultivation was only at the golden core level, making them extremely powerless against a Nascent Soul-level enemy. Even though the Lava Immortal Palace had suppressive capabilities, it would undoubtedly be a bitter battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Why hasn't City Lord Meng Kui taken action yet?" Ning Zhuo asked anxiously. He had an additional layer of worry compared to others: merits!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The scarlet flame beast tide was triggered by Ning Zhuo and the dragon turtle fire spirit working together. If the Nascent Soul-level fire snake broke through the light shield and caused significant destruction to the Lava Immortal Palace, it would result in a huge negative impact on Ning Zhuo's merits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Just as Ning Zhuo finished speaking, he saw Meng Kui take action. Behind the fire snake, clouds and smoke surged, suddenly clearing to reveal a giant human hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Mysteries in the Palm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The giant hand seemed slow but was actually fast, reaching the fire snake's back in the blink of an eye. Just as it was about to grab the fire snake, the latter suddenly hissed, and its entire flame-condensed body expanded on both sides, forming a pair of fiery wings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The fire snake flapped its wings, leaving a trail of sparks in its wake, and shot out like a meteor. The giant hand grasped at empty air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Meng Kui was surprised. This Nascent Soul-level fire snake, although lacking in aptitude and not having a dragon form at the Nascent Soul level, had mastered fire-element spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Meng Kui took a deep breath, fully mobilizing the city's grand formation to suppress the boiling scarlet flame beast tide, which was about to launch a fierce attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The fire snake, temporarily unthreatened, flew above the Lava Immortal Palace, opened its mouth, and spewed blazing flames. The flames were extremely hot, quickly dimming the golden light of the shield. The temperature within the Lava Immortal Palace soared, causing many cultivators to show discomfort, their faces flushed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Meng Kui shouted, casting a spell to summon wind and rain. However, the mundane wind and rain could only slightly suppress the flames, unable to extinguish them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Damn it! Supporting the shield consumes a tremendous amount of mana. Some of this debt will fall on my shoulders," Ning Zhuo thought, feeling troubled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Meng Kui cast another spell and used a magical artifact to attack the fire snake. The fire snake roared, flapped its fiery wings, and dove down. It shattered the spell, knocked away the magical artifact, and continued its momentum, crashing into the spherical light shield for the third time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This time, the massive cracks spread rapidly, almost spanning the sky, as if to cut the entire spherical light shield in half. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The fire snake's body released fireballs that seeped through these cracks, quickly infiltrating inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">They passed through the shield, officially reaching the sky above the Lava Immortal Palace, condensing into eight golden core-level fire snake beings, dozens of foundation establishment-level ones, and over a hundred Qi refining-level ones!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This move was not a spell. Each snake was an independent life form. It turned out that the fire snake's existence was rather unique; it was essentially a mass of flames without a flesh-and-blood body. Within a tribe, fire snakes could intertwine and temporarily merge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Nascent Soul-level fire snake had countless fire snakes merged within it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Nascent Soul fire snake perched atop the shield, continuing to infiltrate in with its tribe. Meng Kui's Mysteries in the Palm reached out again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The fire snake coiled and twisted, its massive body displaying incredible agility, dodging the grasp. But this time, Meng Kui had learned from the previous lesson, ambushing with a second spell hand, grabbing consecutively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The fire snake couldn't evade this time, its head firmly caught. It let out an unwilling hiss but couldn't resist the hand's power, being flung away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">It crashed into the vertical cave of the volcano, producing a loud noise. The fire snake writhed in pain. Its tail dipped into the magma, stirred the lava, and with a fierce flick, a surging column of lava shot skyward, striking the spell hand holding it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The spell hand was immediately burned and melted, becoming tattered. The fire snake, excitedly twisting its body, was about to break free when Meng Kui's other hand covered it again, suppressing it once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Thus, both sides fell into a stalemate. Within the Lava Immortal Palace, the cultivators and the fire snake swarm engaged in battle. The two sides fought fiercely in the sky and on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Led by Zhu Xuanji and Zhu Zhen, they maneuvered through the air, launching fierce attacks on the golden core-level fire pythons, striving to prevent them from reaching the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Some golden core-level fire snakes, lacking the ability to fly, crashed to the ground, intercepted by golden core cultivators, engaging in fierce battles among the buildings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"My merits!" Ning Zhuo's face and mood were equally heavy. All he could do was gather the Ning family's reformation team members, charge into the battlefield, and do his utmost to make up for his merits!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Destroy, destroy!" In the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace, the dragon turtle fire spirit excitedly roared. It manipulated the shield's mana supply to be intermittent, causing the mechanical constructs to avoid the powerful fire snakes and target the weaker areas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">To it, the Lava Immortal Palace was both its temporary body and a massive cage. The more the Lava Immortal Palace was damaged, the more it suffered, but the larger the breach in the cage became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Eventually, the breach will be large enough for me to escape it! All for freedom, everything for freedom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Hold on, show the fire snake tribe's spirit! Hmm... even though we have no bones." The dragon turtle fire spirit focused on the Nascent Soul battle, cheering for the Nascent Soul-level fire snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, slapped his storage pouch, and released ten fire-exploding monkeys. The fire-exploding monkeys pounced on a group of Qi refining-level fire snakes. In just a few exchanges, they self-destructed one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The fire snakes' bodies were blown apart, but within a few breaths, they all regenerated. Ning Zhuo frowned deeply. The fire-exploding monkeys' self-destruction was his strongest means, but the fire snakes were not flesh and blood, making the self-destruction's effect minimal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The fire snake swarm charged at Ning Zhuo, hissing and intertwining, forming a combined fire snake with a life aura reaching the foundation establishment level as they reached Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo slapped his waist again, releasing a fire bamboo snake. The fire bamboo snake tangled with the foundation establishment fire snake, becoming entangled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Seizing the opportunity, Ning Zhuo cast a spell, releasing ten mechanical flying hands, each arm firing spells. A large wave of frost spells rained down, causing the foundation establishment fire snake to disintegrate, reverting into over a dozen Qi refining-level small snakes, which were then covered by spells and all perished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The fire bamboo snake was severely injured, suffering significant damage. Fortunately, Ning Zhuo had more than just one fire bamboo snake in reserve. He continued to fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Boom, boom, boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Above his head, thunderous explosions continued to echo. Each explosion represented the fierce clash between Meng Kui and the Nascent Soul-level fire snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"The key to this defensive battle lies in the Nascent Soul-level confrontation!" This was something everyone understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Finally, when Meng Kui had gathered enough momentum, he intercepted the fire snake with one hand while the other hand flew back, creating distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The giant spell hand stood in mid-air, beginning to calculate with its fingers. Meng Kui's eyes turned white, and he coldly shouted, "Fire snake, I have calculated... your defeat and escape!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">In the next moment, the giant spell hand used for calculation disintegrated, like a cloud, quickly dissipating. On the Nascent Soul fire snake's body, explosions erupted one after another, crippling it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The fire snake initially didn't care, but soon, it let out a shocked hiss. It was horrified to find that its injuries couldn't heal. At this moment, its advantage of not having a flesh-and-blood body seemed to vanish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
