<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"My friend Ning Zhuo treats me with sincerity, am I being too harsh?"<br/>
Thinking of this, Han Zhou couldn't help but feel a lot of guilt.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo returned to his cave dwelling.<br/>
Sun Lingtong had already returned.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss," Ning Zhuo transmitted softly.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded to him and transmitted back: "The source of these rumors has been investigated. Little Zhu, can you guess who's pushing things behind the scenes, trying to harm you?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed coldly: "These rumors came so suddenly and abruptly, it must be Lin Shanshan's fellow disciples trying to deal with me."<br/>
<br/>
"After all, Boss, you also found out earlier that Lin Shanshan borrowed a lot and paid a heavy price to help me set up the spirit plant cabin."<br/>
<br/>
"These fellow disciples cleared her external debts, but I benefited from it. They also don't want me to get too close to Lin Shanshan. Sigh, measuring a gentleman's heart with a petty person's mindset, of course they want to take revenge on me."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong clapped his hands: "Exactly! You guessed it again, haha!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said: "Guessing this wasn't difficult, and there's nothing to be proud of. Their method of spreading rumors is crude, with many areas that could be improved."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded: "It's clearly a novice move. They tried to distance themselves, but left many traces."<br/>
<br/>
When it came to spreading rumors, Sun and Ning were experts. Lin Shanshan's fellow disciples were too naive in front of them.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo, eager to try: "I've collected all the relevant evidence. If we throw it out, it will definitely make them look bad, haha!"<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo shook his head: "This isn't Fire Persimmon Immortal City, it's their territory. I have some understanding of Lin Bufan's style of doing things, but it's not profound."<br/>
<br/>
"Rashly throwing out this evidence won't benefit us, and instead increases our risk."<br/>
<br/>
"Who knows if Lin Bufan will protect his disciples and make a move against us?"<br/>
<br/>
"After all, these disciples of his were all adopted by him at the same time. He's like a father to them, their feelings are deep."<br/>
<br/>
A glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes: "Keep this evidence for now, it might play a crucial role in the future!"<br/>
<br/>
"If I can persuade Ancestor Ning Jiufan, he might bring that demon ape to the Myriad Medicine Sect. At that time, we might be able to make bigger moves."<br/>
<br/>
"A gentleman's revenge can wait ten years."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was good at enduring.<br/>
<br/>
In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he had endured and disguised himself for more than ten years before finally shining in the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded: "Little brother, let's do as you say."<br/>
<br/>
Since the Lava Immortal Palace incident, Sun Lingtong had gained a deeper understanding of Ning Zhuo, secretly admiring his little brother's depth and foresight.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo deliberately chose not to make a move, allowing the unfavorable public opinion against him to continue fermenting.<br/>
<br/>
Various voices doubting him kept spreading.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, someone couldn't hold back and sent Ning Zhuo a challenge letter.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly responded, agreeing to this private challenge, and overwhelmed his opponent with powerful wood element magic.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, someone else challenged him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo won again with wood element magic, greatly increasing his reputation.<br/>
<br/>
The resident cultivators on Little Contention Peak gradually realized Ning Zhuo's true strength. But Lin Shanshan's fellow disciples continued their efforts, starting to guide public opinion, saying only—<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's methods were limited, he had won with wood element magic both times, showing he only had these three tricks. If someone could make his preemptive strike fail, or withstand these three tricks, then victory wouldn't be far!<br/>
<br/>
This argument made many cultivators itch to try.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, it drew in a cultivator unanimously recognized as one of the top ten in combat power—Hua Guzi!<br/>
<br/>
This female cultivator always acted flamboyantly. Before submitting the challenge letter, she promoted it widely, calling friends to pressure Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo refused to accept the challenge, his reputation would surely plummet.<br/>
<br/>
Challenges on Little Contention Peak had a process. When many people challenged the same cave dwelling at once, the Myriad Medicine Sect would judge and decide which challenger would conduct a public challenge on the Small Contention Day.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from this fixed challenge day, cultivators could arrange private duels at other times.<br/>
<br/>
During Ning Zhuo's time in the Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, the only true Small Contention Days were his battles against Han Zhou and Chang Yan. The rest were personal duels, but all were open for others to watch.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi's challenge was the same.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo accepted all comers and immediately took up the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
This quickly sparked a huge wave of excitement on Little Contention Peak!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was the most prominent new cultivator who had recently emerged, while Hua Guzi was known for her flamboyant actions and unanimously recognized as one of the top ten in combat power.<br/>
<br/>
Such a high-level contest was rare even on regular Small Contention Days.<br/>
<br/>
People speculated wildly about who would win.<br/>
<br/>
"Hua Guzi is an established powerhouse after all, with Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivation, giving her a big advantage over Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"Didn't Chang Yan also have a cultivation advantage? But he was still beaten down by Ning Zhuo's three wood element magic tricks."<br/>
<br/>
"You can't say that. Chang Yan specializes in earth element magic and was specifically countered by Ning Zhuo. But Hua Guzi also specializes in wood element."<br/>
<br/>
"If we're talking about preemptive strikes, Hua Guzi also has an aggressive fighting style, very domineering in battle!"<br/>
<br/>
So people began to discuss whether the outcome of this battle would be determined by the crucial factor of "who lands the first preemptive strike at the start of the battle".<br/>
<br/>
On the Original Mountain.<br/>
In Lin Bufan's mansion.<br/>
<br/>
In her boudoir, Lin Shanshan lay sprawled on a round table, looking extremely bored.<br/>
<br/>
In the center of the round table was a vase with a Misty Elegant Orchid planted in it.<br/>
<br/>
"It's been so long, I wonder how Young Master Ning Zhuo is doing?" Lin Shanshan stared blankly at the Misty Elegant Orchid before her, thinking of the white-robed youth.<br/>
<br/>
"Miss, it's time to eat." Lin Shanshan's personal maid pushed open the door, carrying a food box.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan ate the exquisite lunch, but couldn't taste anything.<br/>
<br/>
The personal maid, who understood her mistress's temperament very well, looked worried and advised: "Miss, you've lost a lot of weight today. Why bother? You should try to look on the bright side."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing this, Lin Shanshan's expression became numb, her gaze blank. She was naturally lively, and being confined was really wearing on her spirits.<br/>
<br/>
The maid felt sorry for her and blurted out: "I have the latest news about Young Master Ning Zhuo here."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan jolted as if electrified, her eyes suddenly lighting up: "Quick, tell me! Has he been challenged again?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hehe, most of those resident cultivators are no match for him, they're all just weaklings."<br/>
<br/>
The maid sighed: "But this time, the opponent is no ordinary person."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, the whole Little Contention Peak is in an uproar, everyone is very interested in this battle."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan's expression changed slightly: "Who is it? Lai Wuying, or Zheng Xingchen?"<br/>
<br/>
The maid shook her head: "It's Hua Guzi."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, it's her." Lin Shanshan first breathed a sigh of relief, then furrowed her brow, "Hua Guzi herself practices wood element techniques, she's been immersed in wood element magic for much longer than Young Master Ning Zhuo. And she often uses preemptive strike tactics, which could indeed threaten Young Master Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"What should we do?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan looked worried.<br/>
<br/>
The maid, seeing that mentioning Ning Zhuo had actually made Lin Shanshan stop eating, regretted it secretly and persuaded: "Miss, you should eat more. Only when you eat more will you have the strength to think and find a way to help Young Master Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan nodded: "You're right."<br/>
<br/>
She noticeably sped up her eating, her appetite increasing greatly.<br/>
<br/>
The maid was just feeling pleased with herself when Lin Shanshan suddenly stopped again: "Among the five elements, metal overcomes wood, and wood gives birth to fire, so if Young Master Ning Zhuo uses metal for attack and fire for defense, he'll have an advantage."<br/>
<br/>
"He needs enlightenment diagrams."<br/>
<br/>
"With his comprehension ability, he could fully understand metal and fire attack techniques before this battle takes place."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, now that I'm confined, who else can help him?"<br/>
<br/>
"Han Zhou, that pauper won't do!"<br/>
<br/>
"Xiao Ju, you have to help me." Lin Shanshan suddenly stood up, walked in front of her personal maid, gripped her shoulders tightly, her eyes full of determination.<br/>
<br/>
The personal maid Xiao Ju immediately turned pale, stuttering: "M-Miss, how could you forget why you were confined?"<br/>
<br/>
"Last time, you helped Young Master Ning Zhuo too much, even neglecting your daily cultivation tasks. This time, do you still want to help him like this?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan shook her head: "Last time, I was indeed impulsive."<br/>
<br/>
"I've been reflecting recently, and I feel I went too far. So, I've never blamed my father. This time I've been confined, it's what I deserve."<br/>
<br/>
"The senior brothers cleared my external debts. When I have money in the future, I'll definitely repay them."<br/>
<br/>
"These are all small matters!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan hadn't been in contact with Ning Zhuo for a while, so she wasn't under the influence of the Buddha's Heart Demon Seal.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, she regained her calmness, and her thoughts and feelings returned to normal without being affected by external influences.<br/>
<br/>
In this calm state, she also reflected on herself, knowing she had made mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
"At that time, I was indeed a bit carried away," Lin Shanshan thought it was just her own impulsiveness, without suspecting anything else.<br/>
<br/>
But even in her normal state, Lin Shanshan still wanted to help Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
"Just say that I've had many insights in my cultivation method and need to study a few metal and fire element enlightenment diagrams," Lin Shanshan came up with an idea.<br/>
<br/>
The maid Xiao Ju stared wide-eyed: "Miss, do you really want to do this?"<br/>
<br/>
She hesitated for a moment, but still said: "Then what about Senior Brother?"<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the outsider Ning Zhuo, Xiao Ju and many fellow disciples all knew about Linghu Jiu's feelings for Lin Shanshan, but Lin Shanshan had never noticed.<br/>
<br/>
Reminded of this, Lin Shanshan's eyes suddenly lit up. She excitedly hugged Xiao Ju and kissed her forehead.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan said excitedly: "Right, how could I not have thought of that?"<br/>
<br/>
"I should ask my Senior Brother for help!"<br/>
<br/>
"Now everyone knows about Young Master Ning Zhuo's battle with Hua Guzi. If I ask for metal and fire element enlightenment diagrams now, it will surely be noticed by the senior brothers and my father, and easily suppressed."<br/>
<br/>
"If I ask my Senior Brother to step in, wouldn't that be perfect?"<br/>
<br/>
"Xiao Ju, you're really my closest friend, thank you for reminding me!"<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju quickly shook her head, panicking so much she was sweating: "Miss, Miss, you've misunderstood me, that's not what I meant!"<br/>
<br/>
But Lin Shanshan ignored her, looking expectant: "Senior Brother has always taken good care of me. Although he's usually lazy, he has a big heart and is tolerant of others. Other senior brothers have issues with Young Master Ning Zhuo, but he definitely won't! He's the one who can help me the most."<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju stared at Lin Shanshan, her face full of disbelief: "Miss, are you serious?"<br/>
<br/>
"Of course I'm serious!" Lin Shanshan immediately gave orders, telling Xiao Ju to take her letter to the Ten Thousand Demons Cave on Great Contention Peak to ask Linghu Jiu for help.<br/>
<br/>
As a maid, Xiao Ju couldn't go against Lin Shanshan's wishes and had to obey.<br/>
<br/>
"Heavens, this world is too crazy."<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother is such a good person, why does he have to suffer like this?"<br/>
<br/>
"It's not my fault, it's not my fault!"<br/>
