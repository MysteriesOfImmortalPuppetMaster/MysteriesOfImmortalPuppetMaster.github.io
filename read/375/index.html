<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"My friend Ning Zhuo treats me with sincerity, am I being too harsh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="2">Thinking of this, Han Zhou couldn't help but feel a lot of guilt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">Ning Zhuo returned to his cave dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Sun Lingtong had already returned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Boss," Ning Zhuo transmitted softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Sun Lingtong nodded to him and transmitted back: "The source of these rumors has been investigated. Little Zhu, can you guess who's pushing things behind the scenes, trying to harm you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo laughed coldly: "These rumors came so suddenly and abruptly, it must be Lin Shanshan's fellow disciples trying to deal with me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"After all, Boss, you also found out earlier that Lin Shanshan borrowed a lot and paid a heavy price to help me set up the spirit plant cabin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"These fellow disciples cleared her external debts, but I benefited from it. They also don't want me to get too close to Lin Shanshan. Sigh, measuring a gentleman's heart with a petty person's mindset, of course they want to take revenge on me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lingtong clapped his hands: "Exactly! You guessed it again, haha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo said: "Guessing this wasn't difficult, and there's nothing to be proud of. Their method of spreading rumors is crude, with many areas that could be improved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sun Lingtong nodded: "It's clearly a novice move. They tried to distance themselves, but left many traces."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">When it came to spreading rumors, Sun and Ning were experts. Lin Shanshan's fellow disciples were too naive in front of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo, eager to try: "I've collected all the relevant evidence. If we throw it out, it will definitely make them look bad, haha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But Ning Zhuo shook his head: "This isn't Fire Persimmon Immortal City, it's their territory. I have some understanding of Lin Bufan's style of doing things, but it's not profound."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Rashly throwing out this evidence won't benefit us, and instead increases our risk."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Who knows if Lin Bufan will protect his disciples and make a move against us?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"After all, these disciples of his were all adopted by him at the same time. He's like a father to them, their feelings are deep."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">A glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes: "Keep this evidence for now, it might play a crucial role in the future!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"If I can persuade Ancestor Ning Jiufan, he might bring that demon ape to the Myriad Medicine Sect. At that time, we might be able to make bigger moves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"A gentleman's revenge can wait ten years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo was good at enduring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he had endured and disguised himself for more than ten years before finally shining in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Sun Lingtong nodded: "Little brother, let's do as you say."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Since the Lava Immortal Palace incident, Sun Lingtong had gained a deeper understanding of Ning Zhuo, secretly admiring his little brother's depth and foresight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo deliberately chose not to make a move, allowing the unfavorable public opinion against him to continue fermenting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Various voices doubting him kept spreading.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Finally, someone couldn't hold back and sent Ning Zhuo a challenge letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo quickly responded, agreeing to this private challenge, and overwhelmed his opponent with powerful wood element magic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Soon after, someone else challenged him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo won again with wood element magic, greatly increasing his reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The resident cultivators on Little Contention Peak gradually realized Ning Zhuo's true strength. But Lin Shanshan's fellow disciples continued their efforts, starting to guide public opinion, saying only—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo's methods were limited, he had won with wood element magic both times, showing he only had these three tricks. If someone could make his preemptive strike fail, or withstand these three tricks, then victory wouldn't be far!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This argument made many cultivators itch to try.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Finally, it drew in a cultivator unanimously recognized as one of the top ten in combat power—Hua Guzi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This female cultivator always acted flamboyantly. Before submitting the challenge letter, she promoted it widely, calling friends to pressure Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">If Ning Zhuo refused to accept the challenge, his reputation would surely plummet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Challenges on Little Contention Peak had a process. When many people challenged the same cave dwelling at once, the Myriad Medicine Sect would judge and decide which challenger would conduct a public challenge on the Small Contention Day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Apart from this fixed challenge day, cultivators could arrange private duels at other times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">During Ning Zhuo's time in the Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, the only true Small Contention Days were his battles against Han Zhou and Chang Yan. The rest were personal duels, but all were open for others to watch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Hua Guzi's challenge was the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo accepted all comers and immediately took up the challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">This quickly sparked a huge wave of excitement on Little Contention Peak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo was the most prominent new cultivator who had recently emerged, while Hua Guzi was known for her flamboyant actions and unanimously recognized as one of the top ten in combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Such a high-level contest was rare even on regular Small Contention Days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">People speculated wildly about who would win.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Hua Guzi is an established powerhouse after all, with Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivation, giving her a big advantage over Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Didn't Chang Yan also have a cultivation advantage? But he was still beaten down by Ning Zhuo's three wood element magic tricks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"You can't say that. Chang Yan specializes in earth element magic and was specifically countered by Ning Zhuo. But Hua Guzi also specializes in wood element."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"If we're talking about preemptive strikes, Hua Guzi also has an aggressive fighting style, very domineering in battle!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">So people began to discuss whether the outcome of this battle would be determined by the crucial factor of "who lands the first preemptive strike at the start of the battle".</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">On the Original Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">In Lin Bufan's mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">In her boudoir, Lin Shanshan lay sprawled on a round table, looking extremely bored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">In the center of the round table was a vase with a Misty Elegant Orchid planted in it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">"It's been so long, I wonder how Young Master Ning Zhuo is doing?" Lin Shanshan stared blankly at the Misty Elegant Orchid before her, thinking of the white-robed youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">"Miss, it's time to eat." Lin Shanshan's personal maid pushed open the door, carrying a food box.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Lin Shanshan ate the exquisite lunch, but couldn't taste anything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">The personal maid, who understood her mistress's temperament very well, looked worried and advised: "Miss, you've lost a lot of weight today. Why bother? You should try to look on the bright side."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Hearing this, Lin Shanshan's expression became numb, her gaze blank. She was naturally lively, and being confined was really wearing on her spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">The maid felt sorry for her and blurted out: "I have the latest news about Young Master Ning Zhuo here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Lin Shanshan jolted as if electrified, her eyes suddenly lighting up: "Quick, tell me! Has he been challenged again?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">"Hehe, most of those resident cultivators are no match for him, they're all just weaklings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">The maid sighed: "But this time, the opponent is no ordinary person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">"Now, the whole Little Contention Peak is in an uproar, everyone is very interested in this battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Lin Shanshan's expression changed slightly: "Who is it? Lai Wuying, or Zheng Xingchen?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">The maid shook her head: "It's Hua Guzi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">"Oh, it's her." Lin Shanshan first breathed a sigh of relief, then furrowed her brow, "Hua Guzi herself practices wood element techniques, she's been immersed in wood element magic for much longer than Young Master Ning Zhuo. And she often uses preemptive strike tactics, which could indeed threaten Young Master Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">"What should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Lin Shanshan looked worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">The maid, seeing that mentioning Ning Zhuo had actually made Lin Shanshan stop eating, regretted it secretly and persuaded: "Miss, you should eat more. Only when you eat more will you have the strength to think and find a way to help Young Master Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">Lin Shanshan nodded: "You're right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">She noticeably sped up her eating, her appetite increasing greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">The maid was just feeling pleased with herself when Lin Shanshan suddenly stopped again: "Among the five elements, metal overcomes wood, and wood gives birth to fire, so if Young Master Ning Zhuo uses metal for attack and fire for defense, he'll have an advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">"He needs enlightenment diagrams."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">"With his comprehension ability, he could fully understand metal and fire attack techniques before this battle takes place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">"Sigh, now that I'm confined, who else can help him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">"Han Zhou, that pauper won't do!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">"Xiao Ju, you have to help me." Lin Shanshan suddenly stood up, walked in front of her personal maid, gripped her shoulders tightly, her eyes full of determination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">The personal maid Xiao Ju immediately turned pale, stuttering: "M-Miss, how could you forget why you were confined?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">"Last time, you helped Young Master Ning Zhuo too much, even neglecting your daily cultivation tasks. This time, do you still want to help him like this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Lin Shanshan shook her head: "Last time, I was indeed impulsive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">"I've been reflecting recently, and I feel I went too far. So, I've never blamed my father. This time I've been confined, it's what I deserve."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">"The senior brothers cleared my external debts. When I have money in the future, I'll definitely repay them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">"These are all small matters!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Lin Shanshan hadn't been in contact with Ning Zhuo for a while, so she wasn't under the influence of the Buddha's Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">Therefore, she regained her calmness, and her thoughts and feelings returned to normal without being affected by external influences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">In this calm state, she also reflected on herself, knowing she had made mistakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">"At that time, I was indeed a bit carried away," Lin Shanshan thought it was just her own impulsiveness, without suspecting anything else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">But even in her normal state, Lin Shanshan still wanted to help Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">"Just say that I've had many insights in my cultivation method and need to study a few metal and fire element enlightenment diagrams," Lin Shanshan came up with an idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">The maid Xiao Ju stared wide-eyed: "Miss, do you really want to do this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">She hesitated for a moment, but still said: "Then what about Senior Brother?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Compared to the outsider Ning Zhuo, Xiao Ju and many fellow disciples all knew about Linghu Jiu's feelings for Lin Shanshan, but Lin Shanshan had never noticed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Reminded of this, Lin Shanshan's eyes suddenly lit up. She excitedly hugged Xiao Ju and kissed her forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">Lin Shanshan said excitedly: "Right, how could I not have thought of that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">"I should ask my Senior Brother for help!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">"Now everyone knows about Young Master Ning Zhuo's battle with Hua Guzi. If I ask for metal and fire element enlightenment diagrams now, it will surely be noticed by the senior brothers and my father, and easily suppressed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">"If I ask my Senior Brother to step in, wouldn't that be perfect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">"Xiao Ju, you're really my closest friend, thank you for reminding me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Xiao Ju quickly shook her head, panicking so much she was sweating: "Miss, Miss, you've misunderstood me, that's not what I meant!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">But Lin Shanshan ignored her, looking expectant: "Senior Brother has always taken good care of me. Although he's usually lazy, he has a big heart and is tolerant of others. Other senior brothers have issues with Young Master Ning Zhuo, but he definitely won't! He's the one who can help me the most."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Xiao Ju stared at Lin Shanshan, her face full of disbelief: "Miss, are you serious?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">"Of course I'm serious!" Lin Shanshan immediately gave orders, telling Xiao Ju to take her letter to the Ten Thousand Demons Cave on Great Contention Peak to ask Linghu Jiu for help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">As a maid, Xiao Ju couldn't go against Lin Shanshan's wishes and had to obey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">"Heavens, this world is too crazy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">"Senior Brother is such a good person, why does he have to suffer like this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">"It's not my fault, it's not my fault!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
