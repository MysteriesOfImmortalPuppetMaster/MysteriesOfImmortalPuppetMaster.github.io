<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ban Ji gritted his teeth, his right hand jerking violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The heavy Azure Chain Hammer shot out like a venomous serpent emerging from its lair, the hammerhead whistling as it smashed straight toward the Bronze Blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">For the uninitiated, this weapon might seem like a simple tool, but its true power lies in its momentum and destructive force!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Bronze Blade met the hammerhead head-on, then slid along its surface, guiding the Chain Hammer's trajectory to slam into the wall, embedding itself deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ban Ji strained with his right hand, trying to pull the hammerhead free, while his left hand gripped the Nunchaku.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Nunchaku whirled into a whirlwind, guarding Ban Ji's vital points. He made no attempt to strike back, focusing solely on self-defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ban Ji understood the formidable power of a Master-level opponent all too well, leaving no room for carelessness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">But in the next instant, the Azure Steel Blade suddenly angled downward, hooking onto the Chain Hammer's chain and twisting sharply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The attack angled toward himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ban Ji, already straining to pull back the hammerhead, lost his balance as the Azure Steel Blade's leverage accelerated the hammerhead's momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Startled, Ban Ji scrambled backward to evade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But the maneuver was too swift. He had no time to react, forced to rely on the Nunchaku for a desperate defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The shift was too subtle; he had already reacted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Clang! Sparks erupted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ban Ji's nunchaku clashed against his own chain hammer, nearly slipping from his grip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">A violent tremor ran through his arm, shattering his defenses in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Bronze Blade followed through, lightly tapping Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">A chill surged through Ban Ji's heart as he frantically rolled backward, but the blade still struck his left clavicle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">A crisp crack of bone echoed through the arena, accompanied by Ban Ji's pained groan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Bronze Blade didn't press its advantage. Instead, it hovered silently in its original position, its blade pointing downward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">If a human hand had gripped the hilt, it would likely be gazing down at Ban Ji with the disdainful air of a superior warrior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ban Ji gritted his teeth, enduring the agony as he forced himself to stand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">One step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Master-level realm, surpassing the Martial Artisan-level, demonstrated a deeper understanding of battlefield dynamics and the art of anticipating an opponent's reactions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Bronze Blade had used the chain hammer to breach Ban Ji's nunchaku defenses, filling him with bitter frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"I'm not familiar with these weapons," he thought. "If I had two swords - no, even just one - it would be far better than this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Hold on!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"I still need to reach the third stage and crush Ning Zhuo under my feet!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"If I'm eliminated in the second stage, Ning Zhuo will mock me relentlessly, and I'll disgrace my family's name!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Outsiders who are eliminated in the first stage will inevitably be ridiculed by Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"I must win! I must claim this Bronze Blade!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ban Ji harmonized his ten spiritual energy channels, channeling his full power into his techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He rallied his spirits and fought with unwavering determination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">His Wolf Tooth Mace swung with ferocious, fearless force; his Flying Knife struck with unpredictable, deadly precision; his Chain Hammer combined brute strength with cunning finesse; and his twin clubs moved with lightning-fast agility and dexterity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Yet against the Bronze Blade, all his efforts seemed as laughable as a child waving a wooden stick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ban Ji's injuries mounted rapidly, and his heart grew colder with each clash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Bronze Blade possessed no earth-shattering aura, no elaborate or flashy techniques. It simply existed, each movement as natural as breathing, each block and counter effortless, as if it had foreseen every struggle, every trajectory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Its techniques were strikingly simple, almost childlike in their execution, like a child swinging a wooden stick. Yet every attack Ban Ji launched was effortlessly neutralized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It firmly controlled the rhythm of the battle, while Ban Ji was merely a pawn it casually manipulated on the chessboard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This was the true essence of "winning without moves," discarding complexity for simplicity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ban Ji's body trembled involuntarily from the excruciating pain and excessive blood loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">His vision blurred, and agony tore relentlessly at his nerves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His four weapons had been battered and chipped by the blade, making them increasingly difficult to wield in combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Qingyin Blade slowly extended its body, its heat scorching the earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Bronze Blade slowly extended its edge, as if a master had lost interest in toying with his opponent and sought to end the battle swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">At this critical moment of victory or defeat, a scene from Ban Ji's past flashed through his mind:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In the family's training hall, he had asked the instructor, "When will I be able to reach the Master-level of 'winning without moves'?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The instructor shook his head. "Ban Ji, ever since I began teaching you five years ago, I've seen tremendous potential in your martial arts journey."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Your progress has been astonishingly rapid. Even if you don't choose to specialize in Mechanism Art..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"In these five years, you've mastered the eighteen weapons, mastered numerous combo techniques, and achieved proficiency in both blade and creation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"You, even in actual combat, adapt to your opponents, transitioning from rigid to fluid. That's already remarkable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"You've advanced from Martial Apprentice to Martial Artisan in just five years. Most people, including myself, who specialize in the Martial Dao, take decades to achieve that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"No move is superior to having no move at all - that's what I'm learning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"No move is superior to having no move at all... I only grasped that in my fifty-sixth year of martial practice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">A glint of greed flashed in Ban Ji's eyes as he pressed, "How do you grasp it? Is there some secret?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">His instructor shook his head, his expression turning serious. "No! Calling it 'grasping' isn't quite accurate. My advancement wasn't due to innate talent. In fact, I'm less gifted than most."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"I simply accumulated enough experience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"The Martial Apprentice level is about learning techniques and mastering them to a meticulous degree. But combat isn't just about yourself; it's about your opponent too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"That's why, at the Martial Artisan level, you need tactical thinking. You must constantly engage your opponent in a dance of feints and counters. There will be real attacks, but also traps disguised as weaknesses, openings deliberately exposed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"A Martial Apprentice masters techniques; a Martial Artisan transforms them, making them fluid, adaptable, and practical."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Achieving a Star Rating that perfectly aligns with a technique doesn't mean abandoning the technique itself. Every seemingly casual movement still requires maximum effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Next, you need to accumulate, and accumulate, and accumulate. One day, you'll master every technique so thoroughly that even a casual movement will align with the principles of the Martial Dao, guided by your body's muscle memory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Combine these two elements, and you'll achieve the state of 'no technique surpasses technique,' making you a Master-level Martial Dao instructor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ban Ji's expression darkened upon hearing this explanation. He couldn't possibly dedicate such vast amounts of time and energy to close-quarters combat. His primary focus remained Mechanism Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"I doubt the remaining time is sufficient for me to become a Master-level Martial Dao instructor," Ban Ji assessed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Instructor nodded in agreement. "Ban Ji, while your talent is exceptional, becoming a Master-level instructor is no simple feat. You'll need at least two five-year cycles - ten years - to truly master the Martial Dao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Once you reach this level of martial prowess, you'll be eligible to participate in the Nine Li Grand Tournament."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"I've already reached this level of martial prowess and possess a Profound Armament Armor. How should I confront the 'no technique surpasses technique' state?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Instructor smiled faintly. "There's a method. It's quite simple. Just remember these four words: 'Overcome skill with brute force.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He paused, then added, "Use clumsiness to defeat finesse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ban Ji's mind froze. His eyes snapped open, his face contorted with a savage, almost manic ferocity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Fine! Then I'll use brute force to overcome finesse!" he roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Without flinching, he thrust his right hand forward like an iron vise, reaching directly for the Bronze Blade, heedless of the danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Qingyin Blade sliced effortlessly through several of Ban Ji's fingers. Seizing the opportunity, Ban Ji lunged forward, his movements sharp and precise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The blade plunged deep into his flesh, piercing bone and sending a geyser of blood erupting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Agony like a tidal wave crashed through his nerves, yet Ban Ji let out a wild, animalistic laugh. His muscles and bones strained to their limits, disregarding all pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">If Zhang Wangxing had witnessed this scene, he would have given Ban Ji a thumbs-up. Cornered and desperate, Ban Ji had resorted to the same desperate tactic Zhang Wangxing had used against his wife.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Bronze Blade trembled violently, yet it couldn't break free from the fleshy prison that bound it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">For a fleeting moment - a single instant - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Rise!" Ban Ji's eyes burned with fury as he channeled his divine sense to summon the Wolf Tooth Mace, Flying Knife, Chain Hammer, and Nunchaku.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The Bronze Blade had barely withdrawn from Ban Ji's body when the four bronze weapons struck simultaneously, each blow landing with devastating force!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">A series of explosive clashes echoed across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Bronze Blade clattered to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ban Ji stumbled and fell, clutching the hilt of the Bronze Blade with a death grip, channeling all his energy into refining it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">His right shoulder was a mangled mess of blood and flesh, barely recognizable. He let out a triumphant, unrestrained roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">His body trembled violently, but ultimately, a single weapon couldn't withstand the combined suppression of four bronze artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I did it! Ha ha ha ha..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ban Ji wanted to laugh heartily, but his energy was completely depleted. He could only lie in the pool of blood, twitching his lips and emitting a weak, almost inaudible chuckle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Using brute force to overcome finesse... a brilliant counter. Ning Zhuo... I'll inflict this feeling upon you too, so you can experience it firsthand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">A blade... I finally have a blade. Heh heh, ha ha ha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Next, if the sixth artifact is another sword..." Ban Ji's eyes darkened as he drifted into dark reverie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He glanced at the severed fingers lying on the ground nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">One of the severed fingers lay right next to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">His right hand had been mutilated, leaving only his ring finger and pinky intact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"I can't wield both the sword and the blade simultaneously."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Realizing this, Ban Ji's smile vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"If I had a shield for this trial, I could have won unscathed and refined the Bronze Blade!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"The Profound Armament Armor can transform into protective plates that cling to the body, but that's not its primary function. Its practical defensive capabilities are limited."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"My luck has been terrible this time, likely suppressed by Ning Zhuo's Human Tribulation. How could I possibly find a shield?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ban Ji shook his head inwardly, then weakly closed his eyes and drifted into a fitful sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">At this moment, refining the fifth piece of Profound Armament Armor was equivalent to obtaining a ticket to the third trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">With no further burdens weighing on him, Ban Ji surrendered to his body's natural restorative instincts, collapsing into a deep slumber, seizing every moment to rest and recuperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo was confronting his fifth piece of Profound Armament Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">It was a long spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Its aged appearance hinted at its ancient origins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Without warning, the spear tip transformed into a streak of azure light, tearing through Ning Zhuo's vision as it thrust forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo's divine sense surged, summoning the Bronze Blade and Bronze Sword to intercept the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The spear shaft coiled like a venomous serpent, effortlessly evading the blade and sword. With a flick of its tip, it unleashed three phantom strikes, targeting Ning Zhuo's brow, throat, and heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo's pupils constricted violently, all thoughts of evasion vanishing in that instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">A thunderous clash erupted, yet Ning Zhuo remained rooted to the spot. At the critical moment, he raised the Bronze Shield on his left arm, its broad surface covering his body and blocking all three phantom strikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The floating Bronze Sword silently pierced forward, followed immediately by the Bronze Blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">After the clash, the spear trembled slightly, its shaft humming with apparent frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In the next instant, the spear abandoned its thrusting attacks. Using its recoil momentum, it swung back in a violent arc, like a colossal python coiling around to sweep across a battlefield, and slammed viciously toward Ning Zhuo's left ribs!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo's hair stood on end. He instantly realized that a direct block would likely result in mutual destruction, with his arm bones shattering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He took a half-step back, lowered his stance, and shifted his weight like a boulder plummeting to earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The shield, initially held vertically, tilted slightly to align with the trajectory of the incoming spear shaft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Almost simultaneously, the sweeping spear adjusted its angle of attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo proactively braced his shield, meeting the charge head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Sensing the shift in the bronze spear's momentum, he reacted with pinpoint precision, adjusting his stance, arm angle, and even the positioning of his feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">A dull thud echoed as the spear slammed against the angled shield. The immense force was channeled downward along the sloped surface, diverting the impact into the stone-tiled ground beneath Ning Zhuo's feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In that instant, stone fragments erupted in a shower of debris.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo's body swayed slightly, but his stance remained unshaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Guided by his divine sense, the Bronze Blade and Bronze Sword darted from behind the shield, slashing at the spear's midsection and forcing it to retreat into a defensive posture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Not content with this, the Bronze Gauntlets seized the opportunity to launch a follow-up assault, driving the spear back further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The spear attacked, Ning Zhuo defended with his shield. When the spear's assault failed, Ning Zhuo seized the initiative to counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The spear, honed by Master-level techniques, unleashed a relentless barrage of strikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Yet against Ning Zhuo, it could never breach the shield's defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo didn't use his shield to attack, focusing solely on defense. He employed a seemingly clumsy yet remarkably effective strategy, advancing steadily and methodically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">In terms of pure technique, the spear's mastery far surpassed Ning Zhuo's. However, Ning Zhuo, with his four Profound Armament Armor pieces, stubbornly adhered to a single tactic, forcing the spear into a confined space where its strengths were neutralized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Thrusts were blocked by the shield; sweeps were deflected; strikes were dispersed; entangling maneuvers were severed by the Bronze Blade and Sword... No matter how refined the spear's techniques, they proved ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Finally, Ning Zhuo pressed his shield against the spear's midsection, pinning it firmly to the ground. The Bronze Blade, Sword, and Gauntlets descended simultaneously, sealing the spear's fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Body Tempering</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Spirit Refinement, Method Refinement</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The bronze spear's struggles rapidly weakened until they ceased entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Zhuo exhaled a long, turbid breath, his tense nerves finally relaxing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo gazed at the shield's surface, scarred with countless marks, then glanced at the bronze spear. He sighed sincerely, "Thank goodness I got this shield. Without it, victory would have come at a terrible cost."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">An inch of length, an inch of advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The open terrain stretched wide and exposed. Ning Zhuo knew all too well that relying solely on his gauntlets, blades, and the dragon-like spear in such a vast space would have left him vulnerable to the spear's dust-sweeping strikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">But the shield stood like an unyielding wall, deflecting every attack with unwavering resolve. I seek no glory, only to avoid mistakes, he thought, channeling the steadfastness of a tortoise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The watching cultivators were speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Ning Zhuo's luck is unbelievable! He managed to get the only shield."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"He's having the easiest time in this Profound Armament Armor battle. Even the three Golden Core cultivators are struggling more than he is."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"Ban Ji is still unconscious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The cultivators who had previously fretted over Ning Zhuo's wasted time now fell silent. Those who had believed in him from the start sighed in genuine admiration: "This is what a true genius looks like!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
