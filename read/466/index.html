<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
At the summit of the mountain peak.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s mentor ———— the old demon cultivator, sat hunched on a rock.<br/>
<br/>
He continuously rolled a spirit pearl between his fingers, silently channeling his energy for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
The old man slowly opened his eyes and activated his spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
The spirit pearl, infused with his energy, gradually radiated a blinding brilliance.<br/>
<br/>
The old man opened his mouth and swallowed the spirit pearl.<br/>
<br/>
Once the pearl entered, it did not follow his throat straight down into his abdomen; instead, it went upward and stopped between the old man’s forehead and brows.<br/>
<br/>
A fierce, excruciating pain struck the old demon cultivator, causing countless blue veins to bulge around his eye sockets, and making his expression become twisted and terrifying.<br/>
<br/>
The spirit pearl’s radiance gradually vanished.<br/>
<br/>
In the center of the old man’s forehead, a huge round lump protruded.<br/>
<br/>
The old demon cultivator brought his fingers together like a blade, raised his palm before himself, and suddenly cleaved toward himself.<br/>
<br/>
A sharp burst of energy erupted, directly slicing open the round lump in the center of his forehead.<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, blood and some indescribable yellow fluid splattered, and the old man could not help but let out a muffled groan of pain.<br/>
<br/>
He gritted his teeth fiercely, closed his two eyes, and relied solely on the “round lump” on his forehead to see.<br/>
<br/>
After being cut open, what appeared was an orange-yellow eyeball, filled with blood threads.<br/>
<br/>
A mysterious light shot out from the eyeball, illuminating an area over a zhang in front of the old man.<br/>
<br/>
In the old man’s field of vision, the distant Green Forest Immortal City had completely changed its appearance. Innumerable strands of fortune and fate intertwined and overlapped, forming a variegated and complex miraculous scene.<br/>
<br/>
The old man activated a spell, continuously adjusting his vision and removing much of the extraneous details.<br/>
<br/>
Very soon, only three parties remained in his vision.<br/>
<br/>
At the very center was a giant red flower, dripping with fresh blood, its petals scattered, wavering amidst wind and rain.<br/>
<br/>
Amid the sweeping wind and rain, there was a golden halberd suspended high above, magnificent and sharp, emanating a golden, chilling light, unstoppable in its fierceness.<br/>
<br/>
The aura of the golden halberd threatened the red flower, as if it would chop down in the very next moment.<br/>
<br/>
There was also a door plaque, made of white jade, crystalline and lustrous, likewise suspended high in the sky, overlooking the red flower with a mountain-like imposingness.<br/>
<br/>
“Red Flower Camp’s Mulan, Golden Halberd Army’s Sun Gan, and the White Jade Camp’s Shuang Jing……”<br/>
<br/>
“Little Six has not yet understood?”<br/>
<br/>
The old demon cultivator murmured in disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
He could not hold on for long. Blood flowed profusely from the eyeball in the lump on his forehead, and blood also welled out from his two eye sockets.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, a surge of vigorous fortune emerged, transforming into a monkey, which also encircled the red flower.<br/>
<br/>
The monkey had yellow fur, three ears, and appeared much smaller compared to the golden halberd and the jade plaque. But as soon as it appeared, it advanced by several steps, closest to the red flower.<br/>
<br/>
The monkey reached out its hand as if to pluck the flower.<br/>
<br/>
“Good, good, good!” The old demon cultivator was overjoyed, “As expected, he bears the king’s destiny. I do not need to give any hints; Little Six has already grasped the true essence!”<br/>
<br/>
The old demon cultivator had lingered nearby without leaving, probing multiple times, just to witness this scene.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the great weight on his heart was more than half relieved.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, it seemed the monkey’s gesture of plucking the flower stimulated the other two parties.<br/>
<br/>
The golden halberd emitted golden rays, sweeping all around. The white jade plaque soared and hovered above the red flower, slowly pressing down.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, the old demon cultivator gradually realized and sighed: “The enemy’s forces are strong indeed.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, if these two sides were not so dominant, how could my Little Six have any opportunity?”<br/>
<br/>
“Heh heh heh.”<br/>
<br/>
Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
“General Shuang, what brings you here?” Mulan’s face was expressionless, her gaze calm.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing clapped his hands. His subordinates immediately carried forward several enormous treasure chests.<br/>
<br/>
All these chests emitted a Golden Core-level aura, clearly all storage treasures of the Golden Core grade.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing then ordered his subordinates to open these chests one by one, revealing the vast quantities of precious materials, spirit stones, and even military equipment inside.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan sneered coldly.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi had already returned to Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
From him, she learned of Shuang Jing’s plot to secretly harm her, and now she loathed Shuang Jing to the extreme in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing said: “General Mulan, these are only a portion of the betrothal gifts. What do you think?”<br/>
<br/>
“Based on your current situation, even one of these chests would be enough to sustain your Red Flower Camp for several months.”<br/>
<br/>
Even though Mulan had been prepared in her heart, she was still so angered that her face turned pale: “You also want to marry me? Then rely on this connection to meddle in the Grand Marshal’s seal?”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing’s smile froze slightly: “Also?”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan sneered: “Not long ago, Sun Gan infiltrated my camp, threatening me that if I did not obey him, then he would pose as the Old Stone Monster and create a tragedy in Red Flower Camp.”<br/>
<br/>
“This time, the Old Stone Monster who attacked the grain-transport team —just who among you played that role?”<br/>
<br/>
“Now I am a bit curious.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly: “General Mulan, there’s no need to trick me. I would never do something like dressing up as the enemy and attacking the grain-transport team.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for Sun Gan, I also do not believe he would do such a thing.”<br/>
<br/>
“He is, after all, the main general of the Golden Halberd Army and one of the Royal Capital’s imperial guards. I ask General Mulan to be cautious with your words!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing did not fall for it.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan wanted to divert trouble by incitement, setting off a dispute between Shuang Jing and Sun Gan.<br/>
<br/>
But Shuang Jing seized the key point: “Then, General Mulan, do you choose Sun Gan, or do you choose me?”<br/>
<br/>
“Although Sun Gan is an imperial guard commander, the family behind him is shallow in foundation.”<br/>
<br/>
“I am not only the main general of the White Jade Camp, but I also bear the surname Shuang. Which is weightier, which is lighter, I think anyone with a brain can distinguish.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan sneered: “You speak of the White Jade Camp, which now has only a hundred remnants left. You still have the nerve to mention it?”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing’s expression froze, but he kept smiling: “With the support of my family behind me, all I need is a period of time, and I can restore it to its former glory. What does General Mulan think?”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan gritted her teeth and stared fiercely at Shuang Jing: “During the ambush battle, your White Jade Camp fell into crisis, at the brink of life and death, and only my Red Flower Camp came to your rescue.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yet you do this now. Bearing the national surname, are you truly going to repay kindness with enmity?”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing’s smile broadened a bit more. Clearly, he had long prepared for such reproach, and now he spoke smoothly: “General Mulan’s words are off.”<br/>
<br/>
“Your camp rescuing my camp is indeed a comradeship of fighting side by side. My camp paid such a heavy price and succeeded in pinning down the strongest enemy combatant, creating a window of opportunity for the entire battle.”<br/>
<br/>
“Now, I see General Mulan in difficulty and take the initiative to offer a helping hand. How can that be considered repaying kindness with enmity?”<br/>
<br/>
“Enough!” Mulan could endure no more and interrupted directly, “Take all these things back! Even if I die, even if the Grand Marshal’s Estate completely declines, I will not accept your ‘help’!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing laughed loudly: “I don’t believe, General Mulan, that you would watch the Grand Marshal’s Estate fall with your own eyes. Nor do I believe you would watch your wounded soldiers in Red Flower Camp die because of lacking food and pay.”<br/>
<br/>
“What I believe is that the conditions I offer are rich enough, certainly something Sun Gan cannot provide.”<br/>
<br/>
“I ask that General Mulan consider it carefully.”<br/>
<br/>
After saying this, Shuang Jing, bringing a few confidants, flicked his sleeves and left.<br/>
<br/>
He did not retrieve these treasure chests, leaving them behind in Mulan’s tent.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan’s face was icy. She immediately ordered: “Someone, move these chests away and follow General Shuang Jing, send them back to his residence!”<br/>
<br/>
Several of Mulan’s personal guards immediately took orders and left.<br/>
<br/>
“You!” Shuang Jing turned back and glared at Mulan, then shook his head, sneered once, and said, “I’d like to see how long you can hold out.”<br/>
<br/>
Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo lifted the main general’s tent flap and entered: “General Liu, you were looking for me?”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er cordially invited Ning Zhuo to sit, then, wearing a troubled face, said: “It is actually a private matter of mine. I ask the strategist if you could help me come up with an idea.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt puzzled and waited quietly for him to continue.<br/>
<br/>
After Liu Er finished speaking, Ning Zhuo’s face was full of strange expression: “General Liu, did I hear correctly? You say you admire General Mulan, fell in love at first sight?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes.” Liu Er spoke without blushing or skipping a beat, “This time I see General Mulan in a difficult situation and want to give her some support.”<br/>
<br/>
“But as you know, after the ambush battle, our camp’s impression of Red Flower Camp is not very good. This time, Third Brother caused a commotion in Red Flower Camp, making the relationship even worse. Fortunately, we have you, Strategist, or else our ties with General Mulan would have completely fallen apart.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pressed his forehead, speechless for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, he looked at Liu Er: “General, if you want to help Red Flower Camp, it’s a bit difficult. To be frank, the current situation is extremely sensitive. I do not recommend that we lend a hand at this moment.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er deliberately asked: “Why is that, Strategist?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed and told him how Zhang Zhongyi had come secretly seeking help and about General Mulan’s old injuries.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was shocked: “I never expected the situation inside to be so complicated!”<br/>
<br/>
“Not good.”<br/>
<br/>
A strong worry showed on his face: “I never imagined General Mulan’s predicament to be so dire, with powerful enemies lurking around. Alas, she must be struggling painfully.”<br/>
<br/>
“How ironic!”<br/>
<br/>
“Because the Red Flower Camp fought bravely, its strength was weakened, and now it is coveted and eyed by its so-called allies who want to swallow it up.”<br/>
<br/>
“Is the interior of Twin Rivers Nation so filthy and dark? Truly disappointing!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er railed against the darkness of politics, then clenched his fist, stood up, and spoke earnestly: “Strategist, I have decided!”<br/>
<br/>
“I cannot let the woman I love fall into such a perilous situation while I stand by idly.”<br/>
<br/>
“These old fogies at Nascent Soul level, they don’t even consider their own ages. They do not truly love General Mulan; they merely want to seize the Grand Marshal’s seal!”<br/>
<br/>
“I must rescue General Mulan from fire and water!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked at Liu Er before him, secretly admiring in his heart: “A kindred spirit, truly a kindred spirit. I never expected Liu Er to have such profound uprightness! Excellent, truly excellent.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo coughed softly and pointed out the difficulties to Liu Er: “General, if you want to marry the one you love, it is difficult, extremely difficult.”<br/>
<br/>
Throughout Twin Rivers Nation, no human-demon hybrid had ever held a position in the court.<br/>
<br/>
If Liu Er could succeed, it would be the very first case.<br/>
<br/>
The first case was always the hardest!<br/>
<br/>
But Liu Er was very insistent and determined: “I also know how difficult this is! But after hearing from you just now about Mulan’s plight…”<br/>
<br/>
“This has instead further stirred my courage and strengthened my resolve.”<br/>
<br/>
“General Mulan, such a fine woman, how could I watch her fall into the clutches of demons with open eyes?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed heavily, his eyes reddened. He stood up, clasping Liu Er’s arm.<br/>
<br/>
With a sincere expression, he said: “General Liu is a man of passion!”<br/>
<br/>
“To risk all for one’s beloved, if you can break through worldly shackles, it will surely be a fine story.”<br/>
<br/>
“I am also indignant at General Mulan being bullied. She is a good general, and though she threw the strongest enemies at us in the ambush battle, in truth that was her superior use of military tactics.”<br/>
<br/>
“I am deeply disappointed in Twin Rivers Nation’s court.”<br/>
<br/>
“Fighting so shamelessly within the halls of power, and this during a time of great external threat. They do not think of killing the enemy, instead they plot against their allies. I find it truly contemptible!”<br/>
<br/>
“This time, I will surely give my all to aid General Liu, to defeat Sun Gan and win the beauty’s heart.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was overjoyed, and he sighed: “With the strategist’s assistance, great matters can be achieved!”</div>
