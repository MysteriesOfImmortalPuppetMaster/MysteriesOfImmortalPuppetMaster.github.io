<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">At the summit of the mountain peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Liu Er’s mentor ———— the old demon cultivator, sat hunched on a rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He continuously rolled a spirit pearl between his fingers, silently channeling his energy for quite some time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The old man slowly opened his eyes and activated his spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The spirit pearl, infused with his energy, gradually radiated a blinding brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The old man opened his mouth and swallowed the spirit pearl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Once the pearl entered, it did not follow his throat straight down into his abdomen; instead, it went upward and stopped between the old man’s forehead and brows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">A fierce, excruciating pain struck the old demon cultivator, causing countless blue veins to bulge around his eye sockets, and making his expression become twisted and terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The spirit pearl’s radiance gradually vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In the center of the old man’s forehead, a huge round lump protruded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The old demon cultivator brought his fingers together like a blade, raised his palm before himself, and suddenly cleaved toward himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">A sharp burst of energy erupted, directly slicing open the round lump in the center of his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Instantly, blood and some indescribable yellow fluid splattered, and the old man could not help but let out a muffled groan of pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He gritted his teeth fiercely, closed his two eyes, and relied solely on the “round lump” on his forehead to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After being cut open, what appeared was an orange-yellow eyeball, filled with blood threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">A mysterious light shot out from the eyeball, illuminating an area over a zhang in front of the old man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In the old man’s field of vision, the distant Green Forest Immortal City had completely changed its appearance. Innumerable strands of fortune and fate intertwined and overlapped, forming a variegated and complex miraculous scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The old man activated a spell, continuously adjusting his vision and removing much of the extraneous details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Very soon, only three parties remained in his vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">At the very center was a giant red flower, dripping with fresh blood, its petals scattered, wavering amidst wind and rain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Amid the sweeping wind and rain, there was a golden halberd suspended high above, magnificent and sharp, emanating a golden, chilling light, unstoppable in its fierceness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The aura of the golden halberd threatened the red flower, as if it would chop down in the very next moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">There was also a door plaque, made of white jade, crystalline and lustrous, likewise suspended high in the sky, overlooking the red flower with a mountain-like imposingness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Red Flower Camp’s Mu Lan, Golden Halberd Army’s Sun Gan, and the White Jade Camp’s Shuang Jing……”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Little Six has not yet understood?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The old demon cultivator murmured in disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He could not hold on for long. Blood flowed profusely from the eyeball in the lump on his forehead, and blood also welled out from his two eye sockets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">At this moment, a surge of vigorous fortune emerged, transforming into a monkey, which also encircled the red flower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The monkey had yellow fur, three ears, and appeared much smaller compared to the golden halberd and the jade plaque. But as soon as it appeared, it advanced by several steps, closest to the red flower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The monkey reached out its hand as if to pluck the flower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Good, good, good!” The old demon cultivator was overjoyed, “As expected, he bears the king’s destiny. I do not need to give any hints; Little Six has already grasped the true essence!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The old demon cultivator had lingered nearby without leaving, probing multiple times, just to witness this scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Now, the great weight on his heart was more than half relieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But in the next moment, it seemed the monkey’s gesture of plucking the flower stimulated the other two parties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The golden halberd emitted golden rays, sweeping all around. The white jade plaque soared and hovered above the red flower, slowly pressing down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Seeing this, the old demon cultivator gradually realized and sighed: “The enemy’s forces are strong indeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“However, if these two sides were not so dominant, how could my Little Six have any opportunity?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Heh heh heh.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“General Shuang, what brings you here?” Mu Lan’s face was expressionless, her gaze calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Shuang Jing clapped his hands. His subordinates immediately carried forward several enormous treasure chests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">All these chests emitted a Golden Core-level aura, clearly all storage treasures of the Golden Core grade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Shuang Jing then ordered his subordinates to open these chests one by one, revealing the vast quantities of precious materials, spirit stones, and even military equipment inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Mu Lan sneered coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Zhang Zhongyi had already returned to Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">From him, she learned of Shuang Jing’s plot to secretly harm her, and now she loathed Shuang Jing to the extreme in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Shuang Jing said: “General Mu Lan, these are only a portion of the betrothal gifts. What do you think?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Based on your current situation, even one of these chests would be enough to sustain your Red Flower Camp for several months.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Even though Mu Lan had been prepared in her heart, she was still so angered that her face turned pale: “You also want to marry me? Then rely on this connection to meddle in the Grand Marshal’s seal?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Shuang Jing’s smile froze slightly: “Also?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Mu Lan sneered: “Not long ago, Sun Gan infiltrated my camp, threatening me that if I did not obey him, then he would pose as the Old Stone Monster and create a tragedy in Red Flower Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“This time, the Old Stone Monster who attacked the grain-transport team —just who among you played that role?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Now I am a bit curious.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Shuang Jing narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly: “General Mu Lan, there’s no need to trick me. I would never do something like dressing up as the enemy and attacking the grain-transport team.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“As for Sun Gan, I also do not believe he would do such a thing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“He is, after all, the main general of the Golden Halberd Army and one of the Royal Capital’s imperial guards. I ask General Mu Lan to be cautious with your words!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Shuang Jing did not fall for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Mu Lan wanted to divert trouble by incitement, setting off a dispute between Shuang Jing and Sun Gan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">But Shuang Jing seized the key point: “Then, General Mu Lan, do you choose Sun Gan, or do you choose me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Although Sun Gan is an imperial guard commander, the family behind him is shallow in foundation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“I am not only the main general of the White Jade Camp, but I also bear the surname Shuang. Which is weightier, which is lighter, I think anyone with a brain can distinguish.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Mu Lan sneered: “You speak of the White Jade Camp, which now has only a hundred remnants left. You still have the nerve to mention it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Shuang Jing’s expression froze, but he kept smiling: “With the support of my family behind me, all I need is a period of time, and I can restore it to its former glory. What does General Mu Lan think?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Mu Lan gritted her teeth and stared fiercely at Shuang Jing: “During the ambush battle, your White Jade Camp fell into crisis, at the brink of life and death, and only my Red Flower Camp came to your rescue.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Yet you do this now. Bearing the national surname, are you truly going to repay kindness with enmity?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Shuang Jing’s smile broadened a bit more. Clearly, he had long prepared for such reproach, and now he spoke smoothly: “General Mu Lan’s words are off.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Your camp rescuing my camp is indeed a comradeship of fighting side by side. My camp paid such a heavy price and succeeded in pinning down the strongest enemy combatant, creating a window of opportunity for the entire battle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Now, I see General Mu Lan in difficulty and take the initiative to offer a helping hand. How can that be considered repaying kindness with enmity?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Enough!” Mu Lan could endure no more and interrupted directly, “Take all these things back! Even if I die, even if the Grand Marshal’s Estate completely declines, I will not accept your ‘help’!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Shuang Jing laughed loudly: “I don’t believe, General Mu Lan, that you would watch the Grand Marshal’s Estate fall with your own eyes. Nor do I believe you would watch your wounded soldiers in Red Flower Camp die because of lacking food and pay.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“What I believe is that the conditions I offer are rich enough, certainly something Sun Gan cannot provide.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“I ask that General Mu Lan consider it carefully.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After saying this, Shuang Jing, bringing a few confidants, flicked his sleeves and left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He did not retrieve these treasure chests, leaving them behind in Mu Lan’s tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Mu Lan’s face was icy. She immediately ordered: “Someone, move these chests away and follow General Shuang Jing, send them back to his residence!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Several of Mu Lan’s personal guards immediately took orders and left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“You!” Shuang Jing turned back and glared at Mu Lan, then shook his head, sneered once, and said, “I’d like to see how long you can hold out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo lifted the main general’s tent flap and entered: “General Liu, you were looking for me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Liu Er cordially invited Ning Zhuo to sit, then, wearing a troubled face, said: “It is actually a private matter of mine. I ask the strategist if you could help me come up with an idea.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo felt puzzled and waited quietly for him to continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After Liu Er finished speaking, Ning Zhuo’s face was full of strange expression: “General Liu, did I hear correctly? You say you admire General Mu Lan, fell in love at first sight?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Yes.” Liu Er spoke without blushing or skipping a beat, “This time I see General Mu Lan in a difficult situation and want to give her some support.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“But as you know, after the ambush battle, our camp’s impression of Red Flower Camp is not very good. This time, Third Brother caused a commotion in Red Flower Camp, making the relationship even worse. Fortunately, we have you, Strategist, or else our ties with General Mu Lan would have completely fallen apart.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo pressed his forehead, speechless for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">After a while, he looked at Liu Er: “General, if you want to help Red Flower Camp, it’s a bit difficult. To be frank, the current situation is extremely sensitive. I do not recommend that we lend a hand at this moment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Liu Er deliberately asked: “Why is that, Strategist?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo sighed and told him how Zhang Zhongyi had come secretly seeking help and about General Mu Lan’s old injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Liu Er was shocked: “I never expected the situation inside to be so complicated!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Not good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">A strong worry showed on his face: “I never imagined General Mu Lan’s predicament to be so dire, with powerful enemies lurking around. Alas, she must be struggling painfully.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“How ironic!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“Because the Red Flower Camp fought bravely, its strength was weakened, and now it is coveted and eyed by its so-called allies who want to swallow it up.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Is the interior of Two Note Nation so filthy and dark? Truly disappointing!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Liu Er railed against the darkness of politics, then clenched his fist, stood up, and spoke earnestly: “Strategist, I have decided!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“I cannot let the woman I love fall into such a perilous situation while I stand by idly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“These old fogies at Nascent Soul level, they don’t even consider their own ages. They do not truly love General Mu Lan; they merely want to seize the Grand Marshal’s seal!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“I must rescue General Mu Lan from fire and water!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo looked at Liu Er before him, secretly admiring in his heart: “A kindred spirit, truly a kindred spirit. I never expected Liu Er to have such profound uprightness! Excellent, truly excellent.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo coughed softly and pointed out the difficulties to Liu Er: “General, if you want to marry the one you love, it is difficult, extremely difficult.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Throughout Two Note Nation, no human-demon hybrid had ever held a position in the court.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">If Liu Er could succeed, it would be the very first case.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The first case was always the hardest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">But Liu Er was very insistent and determined: “I also know how difficult this is! But after hearing from you just now about Mu Lan’s plight…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“This has instead further stirred my courage and strengthened my resolve.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“General Mu Lan, such a fine woman, how could I watch her fall into the clutches of demons with open eyes?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo sighed heavily, his eyes reddened. He stood up, clasping Liu Er’s arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">With a sincere expression, he said: “General Liu is a man of passion!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“To risk all for one’s beloved, if you can break through worldly shackles, it will surely be a fine story.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“I am also indignant at General Mu Lan being bullied. She is a good general, and though she threw the strongest enemies at us in the ambush battle, in truth that was her superior use of military tactics.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“I am deeply disappointed in Two Note Nation’s court.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“Fighting so shamelessly within the halls of power, and this during a time of great external threat. They do not think of killing the enemy, instead they plot against their allies. I find it truly contemptible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“This time, I will surely give my all to aid General Liu, to defeat Sun Gan and win the beauty’s heart.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Liu Er was overjoyed, and he sighed: “With the strategist’s assistance, great matters can be achieved!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
