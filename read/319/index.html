<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 319: Karmic Fire</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The heavenly craftsman ignites the karmic fire of retribution, and the consequences manifest immediately, demanding immediate accountability!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Give me another opportunity!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared in fury, once again overstepping its bounds, forcibly causing trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The cultivators who barged in did not have the qualifications for the palace trial, and their path through the Secret Pavilion was not counted among the thirty-six quotas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Previously, the major opportunity had not been fully utilized by Ning Zhuo and Meng Chong, with Zhu Xuanji, Song Fuli, and Zheng Danlian being the major consumers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Even so, the three had not exhausted the thirty-six quotas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">But now, with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit and Meng Kui cooperating from inside and outside, they took advantage of the Lava Immortal Palace's weakened restrictions to prematurely initiate the opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After this round of opportunity, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's spirituality was greatly diminished, its body semi-transparent, flickering in and out of sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">It fell into an extremely weak state, curled up to the size of a fingertip, enduring the relentless whipping, breathing with difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Meng Kui was not much better off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">At this stage, he was still a distance away from directly intervening in the business.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Forcing his hand now, even with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit as an internal ally, meant directly confronting the Lava Immortal Palace and its restrictions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">His aura greatly diminished, his hair instantly turned snow-white, and seven precious blood droplets slowly flowed out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In an instant, he aged more than ten years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The relative position of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities was overturned once again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Originally, Zhu Xuanji and others had gradually caught up with the shadow demon cultivators, but this effort was now in vain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo and Meng Chong were in the same pavilion and were not affected by this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But in the next moment, Ning Zhuo suddenly self-ignited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Scarlet flames burned him, with the flame tips turning yellow-brown, exuding a strong and intense aura of malice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"What is this?!" Ning Zhuo was horrified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Without the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Ning Zhuo could not suppress the effects of the fate energy, nor could he defend against the attack on this technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He was hit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">As the flames burned, he felt his cultivation rapidly declining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">His five senses, strength, and qi plummeted as if falling off a cliff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"How did I get hit?" Ning Zhuo felt a chill throughout his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Transferring the wooden blocks required expending his spirit and qi. By the end, his vision darkened, seeing double, and he could hardly continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Meng Chong attacked again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The heavily armored blood ape took a step forward, using its massive body as a defense line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Previously, this defense line was very solid, always causing Meng Chong to return empty-handed. But this time, the situation was very different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The heavily armored blood ape had no spirituality residing within, relying entirely on Ning Zhuo's control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo's poor condition caused the heavily armored blood ape's combat power to plummet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Fortunately, Ning Xie had perfect spirituality and the ability to autonomously protect its master. The Ice Snow Weather Sphere shot out ice spikes, sealing off the firepower, forcing Meng Chong back once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Meng Chong panted heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Fighting until now, he fully acknowledged Ning Zhuo's strength, treating him as a true opponent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">His body was covered in wounds, and his condition had also deteriorated significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">But his fighting spirit did not diminish; instead, it grew more vigorous as the situation became more difficult!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Just as he was about to charge again...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The door was suddenly pushed open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">A frantic old woman burst in: "Xiaohui, where have you taken my Xiaohui?!" she shouted, her eyes reflecting the scarlet glow of karmic fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Clearly, she and Meng Chong were closer to the door, but she pointed her finger directly at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"It's you, you hid my Xiaohui, didn't you?! Return my granddaughter to me!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Xiaohui's grandmother screamed madly, charging at Ning Zhuo, launching a reckless attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Meng Chong was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Immediately, the door was pushed open again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The former young clan leader of the Ning family, Ning Xiaoren, entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">His pupils also reflected the scarlet firelight, his face twisted with hatred: "Ning Zhuo, you little rabbit! It's all thanks to you that I've fallen to this state. Now, you still want to break out of here and sit on the palace master's seat? Hehehe, as long as I'm here, it's impossible!" Ning Xiaoren also charged at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Meng Chong was bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He hesitated, wondering whether to join the attack, when the door was pushed open once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen entered hand in hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"I've never seen that big door before; it might be the last door to successfully pass through!" "But Ning Zhuo is occupying it..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Attack!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Meng Chong: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">These frequent intrusions were clearly not coincidences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">So many cultivators barged in, all ignoring Meng Chong, seeing Ning Zhuo as the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Meng Chong stared at the flames engulfing Ning Zhuo, puzzled as to who had made the move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">At this moment, Meng Kui's voice reached his ear: "Child, seize the opportunity, open the door, and enter the main hall!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"It was Grandpa." Meng Chong suddenly understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo's condition was extremely poor, almost unable to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Fortunately, he had advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage and mastered divine sense, which he could use to observe enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">However, the range of his divine sense was also rapidly shrinking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The door was continuously pushed open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">All the cultivators who barged in had karmic entanglements with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Figures like Ning Xiangguo, Zheng Hua, and even his uncle Ning Ze appeared. He had also jumped into the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Ning Zhuo, how did you avenge your cousin? To ascend to the position of branch family Clan Leader, you even used your own blood kin's enmity as a bargaining chip!" "Now, this is your retribution!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo's pupils were filled with firelight, his reason barely remaining, clouded by fate energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Sun Lingtong pushed the door open and entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Little Zhuo, I finally found you!" Sun Lingtong was overjoyed, his eyes also reflecting the firelight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">At this moment, Ning Zhuo was in grave danger, his divine sense reduced to within eight feet of his body. Often, he could only let the mechanical constructs act on their own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Sun Lingtong shook his wrist, and the storage ring shot out a strange light, landing at the edge of the battlefield, revealing the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was in a terrible state. Although Sun Lingtong had patched it up and made emergency repairs, his methods were crude and could not compare to Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng charged straight at the heavily armored blood ape, embracing it warmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The two made close contact, and Yuan Dasheng's spirituality automatically flew out, entering the heavily armored blood ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Master, I have arrived!" The heavily armored blood ape Dasheng roared, sweeping away its previous stiffness, becoming extraordinarily agile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The internal mechanical component, the heart furnace fire essence, was as large as a ball, operating at full capacity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">A large amount of fire persimmons was consumed rapidly, converted into surging qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The surface of the heart furnace was covered with various cylindrical protrusions, expanding and contracting wildly, providing strong power in all directions!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">In the critical moment, the heavily armored blood ape Dasheng stood up bravely, heroically protecting its master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">This mechanical shell, made with a large amount of Golden Core stage materials, was solid and sturdy, allowing Yuan Dasheng to display near-Golden Core combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Although Ning Xiaohui's grandmother and others were numerous, they were ultimately only at the Foundation Establishment stage, unable to reach the Golden Core level. Protected by the heavily armored blood ape Dasheng, Ning Zhuo broke through a path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong, wielding dual daggers and dressed as a shadow demon cultivator, attacked Ning Xiaohui's grandmother and others, covering Ning Zhuo's retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Just as he was about to breathe a sigh of relief, the small door of the Secret Pavilion was pushed open again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Golden light scattered out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Zhu Xuanji, maintaining three divine abilities, made a grand entrance!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
