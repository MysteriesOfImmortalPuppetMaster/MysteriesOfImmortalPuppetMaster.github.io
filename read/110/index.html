<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo occasionally came up behind Ning Chen or Ning Yong, placing his hand on their backs to help them manipulate the Sharp Advancement Needle, thereby opening various qi meridians ahead of time. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Both were behind Ning Zhuo in terms of cultivation, and many of their qi meridians were still unopened. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo had long since reached the peak of the third layer and had now broken through to the fourth layer. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He was very familiar with these qi meridians, akin to a local guiding outsiders. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Ice Light Strong Vein Talisman and the Sharp Advancement Needle formed a very ingenious combination. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Newly opened qi meridians were still weak and unstable. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">At this moment, applying the Ice Light Strong Vein Talisman could stabilize them, saving cultivators a lot of subsequent nurturing and conditioning effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Soon, both Ning Chen and Ning Yong made breakthroughs! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo monitored them closely, constantly providing guidance. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">At first, the new energy flow paths were difficult for Ning Chen and Ning Yong to operate. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">However, Ning Zhuo secretly manipulated the Thread of Fate to directly control their bodies, adjusting their breathing and optimizing their rhythm. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Simultaneously, he also used a trace of the power from his Buddha Heart Devil Seal to guide their thoughts, ensuring they didn't realize the truth and instead believed that Ning Zhuo was simply an excellent teacher and that they were learning well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Cultivators have a daily limit to how much energy they can absorb. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Chen reached his limit first, followed shortly by Ning Yong. Only then did Ning Zhuo withdraw his hand from their backs. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Rest and adjust your breaths. I'll be waiting outside," he said before stepping out of the cultivation chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Not long after, Ning Chen and Ning Yong emerged, looking exhausted. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Chen, leading the way, bowed deeply to express his gratitude for Ning Zhuo's guidance. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Yong, scratching his head, couldn't match Ning Chen's eloquence but simply said, "I feel the same way!" Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, dismissing it as a small matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Chen, with a serious expression, bowed deeply, "If you ever need anything, Brother Ning Zhuo, just say the word." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo nodded and smiled, noting that Ning Chen was perceptive, unlike Ning Yong. Ning Yong, catching on, quickly added, "I mean it too!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo then said, "In fact, there's something I could use your help with right now." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Relieved, Ning Chen quickly asked what it was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo explained that he needed them to go to the Monkey Head Gang's headquarters to find the current leader, Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Yuan Er sat at the head of the hall, with numerous gang elders engaged in heated discussions below. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Their voices were loud, and during arguments, they often banged the table, cursed, and competed to see who could shout the loudest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The once solemn council chamber of the Su Building now resembled a chaotic marketplace. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Yuan Er's face was ashen. Without Yuan Da Sheng to back him up, the elders had become unruly! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Yuan Er couldn't get a word in edgewise; he felt like a puppet, sitting in the main seat but with no respect from anyone. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ostensibly, the elders were arguing, but in reality, they were watching Yuan Er's reactions. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Yuan Er could clearly feel his already meager authority quickly crumbling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"What should I do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Who can help me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Perhaps hearing Yuan Er's inner plea, Ning Chen and Ning Yong were led in by members of the gang. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Chen wore a serious expression, while Ning Yong strode in confidently, taking the lead. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Upon entering the council chamber, he loudly declared, "Yuan Er, our young master has matters to discuss with you." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The chamber fell silent. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The gang elders turned their heads to look at the two young Qi Refinement cultivators, their gazes converging on the identity badges at their waists.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Family?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">A flash of delight crossed Yuan Er's eyes. Slowly standing up, he carefully chose his words, "Does Mr. Ning Zhuo have business with me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Chen nodded, "Indeed. We request the gang leader to step aside so we can discuss in detail."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Of course, of course." Yuan Er was already feeling out of place, like sitting on pins and needles. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">This was the best way to conclude the meeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Please, this way." Yuan Er gestured. Ning Chen walked ahead, and before leaving, Ning Yong nonchalantly waved to the gang elders, "Continue, keep discussing." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The elders were no longer as heated as before. Though they continued their discussion, each of them was now distracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"When did Yuan Er connect with the Ning Family?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Who is Young Master Ning Zhuo? Never heard of him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Check this out when we get back!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Yuan Er led Ning Chen and Ning Yong to a side room. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Upon learning that they were there to collect all of Yuan Da Sheng's old belongings, he was puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Why?" Yuan Er asked, confused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Chen then presented the explanation given by Ning Zhuo, "Young Master Ning Zhuo keeps his promises and values his word. He will personally craft the mechanical monkey for you, putting in his utmost effort. Since the main material is Yuan Da Sheng's body, the created mechanical monkey should emulate Yuan Da Sheng's fighting habits to better utilize the superior qualities of the materials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Yuan Er found this very reasonable and nodded repeatedly, "Yes, that makes sense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Uncle Da Sheng was skilled in close combat, his bones honed through countless battles and fights, perfectly attuned to his martial arts. I'll gather all the footage of Uncle Da Sheng during his lifetime for Mr. Ning's reference. As for his personal belongings, are they really necessary?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Chen shook his head. "Yes, this is Young Master Ning Zhuo's specific instruction. Creating a mechanical monkey is akin to composing poetry; it requires inspiration. Think of the mechanical monkey as a poetic tribute to Yuan Da Sheng. Young Master Ning Zhuo needs to understand Yuan Da Sheng's essence through these personal items and various materials to create a more fitting tribute. It would be best to collect everything related to Yuan Da Sheng and send it to us. The more comprehensive the collection, the better the final product."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Yuan Er nodded repeatedly. "I understand, I understand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">These days had been tough for him, and the future looked even bleaker. No one would anticipate the mechanical monkey more than Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Though Uncle Da Sheng is no longer with us, in another form, he will continue to support and protect me and maintain the entire Monkey Head Gang!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Chen and Ning Yong completed their task perfectly. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">They brought back numerous items closely associated with Yuan Da Sheng. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo collected these to supplement the spiritual essence of the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Da Sheng. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">According to the Fire Cremation Prajna Spirit Extraction Sutra, all things possess spiritual essence. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Strong spiritual essence tends to disperse outward, so personal items often absorb related spiritual essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Some belongings of great cultivators, after long periods of use, often develop a bit of sentience. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Although Yuan Da Sheng was not a great cultivator, he hadn't been dead long, so his belongings still carried some of his spiritual essence. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Since this essence is from the same source, it is highly efficient for replenishment. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This was the most feasible solution for Ning Zhuo at present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Next, I'll train the Fire Cremation Prajna Spirit Extraction Sutra and then find an opportunity to refine these items to extract their spiritual essence. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Apart from the issue of spiritual essence, the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Da Sheng, also needs better repairs." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo also needed to consider how to handle the aftermath if the Zhou family discovered the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Da Sheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Hmm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Chen checked the jade slip provided by Yuan Er. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The slip contained footage of Da Sheng's martial arts training and combat scenes, which broadened Ning Zhuo's horizons. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Particularly impressive was a set of combo moves used by Yuan Da Sheng during battles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">When encountering a strong enemy, Da Sheng would pretend to be outmatched and flee. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">As the enemy pursued closely, he would suddenly squat down, extend his hand backward, and make a downward scooping motion. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">At that moment, his arm seemed to stretch, always hitting the opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">This was a martial art that Yuan Da Sheng gradually comprehended and perfected through real combat in alleyways and beast fights—Hui Shou Tao (Backhand Grab). </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">In the recorded footage, Yuan Da Sheng, now middle-aged, had developed another martial art technique—Sui Yang Shou (Shattering Sun Hand)! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He practiced Sui Yang Shou by first crushing wooden balls, then stone balls, and eventually iron and steel balls, progressing step by step. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The offensive power was terrifying, making Ning Zhuo feel a chill down his spine as he watched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo marveled, “First, the Hui Shou Tao, and then the Sui Yang Shou. The two martial arts techniques form a combo, filled with a ruthless and sinister style. Yuan Da Sheng truly earned his place through brutal battles from the very bottom; it’s so grounded in reality!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">An idea struck him, “Perhaps, when I repair Yuan Da Sheng, I can use this direction for modification. Once it has abundant spiritual essence, it might even replicate these once-proud combo moves.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Just the thought of it filled Ning Zhuo with great anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
