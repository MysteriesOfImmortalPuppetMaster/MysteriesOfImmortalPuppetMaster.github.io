<paragraph index="1">“Second level of Qi Refining, hahahaha!” Meng Chong let out a joyful shout from within the cultivation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He really loved this speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Whenever he activated Ferocious Rushing Thunder, his cultivation efficiency skyrocketed. It was worlds apart from his previous speed, bringing him great satisfaction and a strong sense of accomplishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The more he cultivated, the more excited he became, and he gradually became addicted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ferocious Rushing Thunder, Ferocious Rushing Thunder, Ferocious Rushing Thunder!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The more he used this super-grade innate talent, the more he liked it, and the more he relied on it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Fei Si noticed that something was wrong and gave a gentle reminder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Meng Chong thus restrained himself, cultivating with a frown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He felt deeply uncomfortable. “Slow, too slow! Slow as a snail!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Of course, this was nothing but his own illusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">But after releasing his innate nature, he had become less and less patient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“One more time, just one more time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“One more won’t hurt, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“This will really be the last time!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ferocious Rushing Thunder, Ferocious Rushing Thunder, Ferocious Rushing Thunder…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Woo, hahaha!” Meng Chong’s vigorous laughter echoed through the cultivation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">On his sixth exploration, Ning Zhuo officially entered Room 4.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Room 4 was similar to Room 1, with mechanical components piled up in small hills everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit pursed its lips and observed Ning Zhuo expressionlessly, watching his every move without giving any hints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo tried to grab a mechanical component, but his movements suddenly stilled. He had been restrained by the Life-Hanging Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He immediately tried the treasure seal, but it was useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Then, he walked over to the exit and touched the door. The rewards message appeared in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“I can pass the level like this?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“No, this room should have some use. I just haven’t figured it out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After thinking for a while, Ning Zhuo tried using the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation. Nothing happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Seeing this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit subconsciously stood up, pushing its limbs on the ground and no longer lying down like before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">It seemed a little nervous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo suddenly had a thought and stopped using the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation, instead casting a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">First up was the Icy Embrace Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As soon as the spell was unleashed, a mechanical component immediately flew toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo quickly grabbed it, stumbling backward due to the inertia.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“I guessed correctly!” He was full of excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Bam!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was furious, smacking the ground with its dragon claws and gnashing its teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo had figured it out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The new mechanical component was a forearm with a hand attached. It looked very sturdy, and could float in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo continued casting spells and got another floating arm, a mechanical wooden staff, and a set of twelve mechanical rings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“So this room gives you bonus equipment depending on the number of spells you’ve learned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“It seems this level is meant to test my ability to cast spells.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo then entered Room 5.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">A long hallway appeared in front of him. It was at least ten times longer than the one in Room 2.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">What kind of traps would there be this time?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">In the City Lord Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Hahaha!” Meng Chong laughed loudly. “I’ve reached the peak of the third level, and it only took three days. Who could be faster than me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">For three days and three nights, he had cultivated almost without sleep. Now, he had finally succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“I’ll be the first one to enter the immortal palace!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“But, how do I get in…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The next moment, Meng Chong’s eyes went dark, and his soul was directly pulled away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit stood up excitedly. It had been waiting for this moment for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">It immediately sent a message to Meng Chong’s mind: “Lava Immortal Palace’s mechanical arts inheritance, soul guided by thread, Qi Refining test… activate innate talent, circulate Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation at full strength, leave Room 1 and enter Room 2!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The next moment, a fire whip appeared in the main hall of the immortal palace and viciously struck the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A loud crack rang out, and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit slammed to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The fire whip faded away, and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit’s face was twisted in agony. However, its fierce expression also showed excitement, because it saw that Meng Chong immediately began circulating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">At the same time, arcs of electricity began emanating from his torso.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Crackle…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Lightning flashed continuously, growing stronger and stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The small hill of mechanical components began trembling slowly, and five mechanical components flew out from within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A few breaths later, these five components struck Meng Chong’s torso and assembled themselves in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Meng Chong clenched his fists and puffed out his chest, raising his head and letting out a loud roar. The electricity on his body surged, shooting upward and forming a majestic pillar of lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Boom…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The small hill of mechanical components collapsed under this power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Amid the smoke and dust, Meng Chong held his head high and strode forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He touched the door, and the rewards appeared in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“The Lava Immortal Palace’s inheritance test is quite interesting!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Meng Chong didn’t even look at the mechanical component or spell options and chose the spirit stone without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Room 2, here I come."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He flung the door open and swaggered in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Bam!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">A trap activated, and a heavy hammer fell from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Meng Chong didn’t even have time to react before being smashed into countless wooden fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“What just happened?” With the puppet body being destroyed, Meng Chong’s soul was sent back to his real body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He was completely confused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After thinking about it, he came to a realization. “It looks like I triggered a trap after opening the door.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">A moment later, Meng Chong called over Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Fei Si heard about what happened and immediately gave enthusiastic congratulations, spending a long time praising Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Meng Chong snorted. “I am the genius of the Meng Clan. I can’t embarrass my grandfather! Tell me, what should I do?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Fei Si sighed, “As it turns out, the inheritance test of the Lava Immortal Palace has undergone a huge change now that it’s reached the Qi Refining stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“Recently, I’ve been reading up on all kinds of information about Three Schools Supreme Sage, trying to learn about his thoughts, personality, et cetera…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“If my guess is correct, young master, then the rewards you mentioned should contain a key item that will be of great use to you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Meng Chong immediately fell into thought. “Which one is it? The spirit stone, the hanging ring, or One Gust of Air?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Also, when will I reenter the Lava Immortal Palace?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">After this failure, even though his soul power was still sufficient, he wouldn’t return before six hours were up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo entered the palace for the seventh time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Last time, he failed in Room 5 after using up all his spirit power reserves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Room 5 is similar to Room 2. I need to run and jump past all the obstacles and reach the end of the hallway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“But it’s at least three times more difficult!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“Although I can grab a lot of mechanical components, I’m not familiar with them. When it comes to running and jumping, they’re just extraneous burdens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“And more importantly, those extra mechanical components also increase my consumption of spirit power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Huh?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Arriving at Room 2, Ning Zhuo found that the trap he’d laid here had been triggered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">It was the Thousand Jun Heavy Hammer Platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Previously, he had used it to try smashing the stone pillar that held the ranking lists. On his fourth entry into the palace, he had come up with the idea of moving it to Room 2 and turning it into a trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">On his fifth entry, finding his trap still intact, he was extremely excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">His experiment was successful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thus, with the help of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Ning Zhuo added a lot of extra features to Rooms 2 and 3.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“Meng Chong has entered the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“And then, he got smashed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“I already know that the minimum interval is six hours. Since that’s the case, I can roughly estimate his entry time and avoid running into him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo once again felt urgency, and his face filled with wariness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"A super-grade innate talent…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“This time, I’ll have to add a few more traps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“Or I won’t be able to calm down!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
