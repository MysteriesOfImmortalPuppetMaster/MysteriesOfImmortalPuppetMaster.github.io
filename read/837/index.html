<paragraph index="1">Zhao Hansheng's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Hmm?" The jade pendant at his waist vibrated slightly once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But this time, the sensation it brought him was completely different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This was not a warning, but a reminder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Hmm? I'm just sitting in my room, yet good fortune falls from the sky?" The spiritual intuition from the jade pendant moved Zhao Hansheng, but at the same time, it plunged him into doubt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Soon, Duanmu Zhang's figure slowly appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zhao Hansheng was surprised to see him arrive privately and using concealment methods. In his impression, Duanmu Zhang had a strait-laced nature and always acted openly and squarely. Yet this time, he had completely changed his style, acting with extreme caution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This was very uncommon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Could it be that my good luck lies with him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhao Hansheng's heart stirred, and he stood up to welcome him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Brother Duanmu, your presence graces my humble abode; forgive me for not welcoming you from afar." Zhao Hansheng performed a formal Confucian greeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Generally speaking, the most common courtesy between cultivators was cupping one's hands. For serious and solemn occasions, it would be a Daoist bow. Here, since both parties were Confucian cultivators, this specific etiquette was more appropriate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Duanmu Zhang returned the greeting: "Fellow Daoist Hansheng, there is no need for formalities. This old man has taken the liberty to visit because there is an important matter to discuss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhao Hansheng smiled faintly and invited Duanmu Zhang into the cave dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The two took their seats at the stone table, and Zhao Hansheng poured tea personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Duanmu Zhang did not beat around the bush and directly explained his purpose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">After listening, a glint flashed in Zhao Hansheng's eyes before he immediately returned to normal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Qin De... Sage's Great Theft Scripture..." He muttered, while his heart was filled with joy as he thought to himself, That's it, that's it. This is my good fortune!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Duanmu Zhang sighed, a look of distress on his face: "This villain has been imprisoned in the depths of the Cloud Prison for thirty years. Yet his heretical theories still persist, like maggots in the tarsus bones, difficult to eradicate. After thinking it over, this old man believes only Fellow Daoist Zhao can take action to defeat him frontally in theory using the Way of the Mind!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zhao Hansheng was also a great scholar; during the conversation, he had already figured out the cause and effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The scale of the Confucian cultivator group in the Myriad Manifestations Sect is small; it turns out they are constrained by this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Myriad Manifestations Sect captured Qin De but did not kill him, precisely to use this leverage to contain Duanmu Zhang and the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">And Duanmu Zhang left the Huazhang Kingdom to spread Confucianism. He was originally intending to enter the service of the Flying Cloud Kingdom, and it was only upon the personal invitation of the previous Sect Master of the Myriad Manifestations Sect that he finally stationed himself here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">No wonder he welcomed my students and me, opening the door of convenience for us. So that's how it is!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This is a golden opportunity, a golden opportunity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Thinking of this, Zhao Hansheng looked at Duanmu Zhang and said with a solemn expression, "Brother Duanmu, this matter is of grave importance. Although that Qin De is imprisoned, I have never heard of the Sage's Great Theft Scripture. The Confucian cultivators here look to you as their leader, Brother Duanmu, yet for so many years, no one has been able to defeat him in debate. As a newcomer, how could I possibly shoulder such a heavy responsibility?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Duanmu Zhang looked at him, his gaze calm: "If Mister Zhao is unwilling, this old man will certainly not force you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Saying this, he chuckled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Both were shrewd individuals; he could see at a glance that Zhao Hansheng was already tempted, and inevitably so. The refusal just now was merely a tactic to raise his price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Duanmu Zhang paused, then said meaningfully, "If you can succeed, Fellow Daoist Hansheng's status among us Confucian cultivators will be unshakable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Oh? Please explain in detail." Zhao Hansheng leisurely picked up his tea and took a light sip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Not long after.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Zhao Hansheng personally escorted Duanmu Zhang out of the cave dwelling with full courtesy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Duanmu Zhang left the Sage's Great Theft Scripture with Zhao Hansheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Before parting, Zhao Hansheng assured Duanmu Zhang: "Although I am a newcomer, I am also a disciple of Confucianism. This villain Qin De defiles the sages and incurs the wrath of both man and god. How can I, Zhao, sit by and watch? I will definitely go all out in this scripture debate! I shall clear this obstacle for us Confucian cultivators!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Duanmu Zhang sighed again: "Then I entrust this to you, Fellow Daoist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Returning to his cave dwelling, Zhao Hansheng immediately began to study the Sage's Great Theft Scripture with great care.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated in a hundred battles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"I must win this scripture debate to truly take control of this group of Confucian cultivators. The merit gained might be arranged for Qing'er."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"But first, let's see what this heresy contains."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="81"/>
<paragraph index="83">Blue Stone Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo was performing his daily homework.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His divine sense sank into his Upper Dantian's divine sea, his thoughts like countless small mirrors suspended between heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">As Ning Zhuo thought, these mirror-like thoughts rose and fell, endless and ceaseless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, and a large number of mechanical flying mirrors flew out, of various types. He marshaled his divine sense, controlling these mechanical flying mirrors to practice various techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After sweeping through the formations earlier, he discovered that combining divine sense with mechanical flying mirrors was quite practical. Therefore, he had specifically added this practice to his daily homework since then.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Of course, the duration of the practice was short.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">A moment later, Ning Zhuo withdrew his divine sense and the flying mirrors, switching to circulate the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Five Elements Creation and Destruction Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Metal generates Water, Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal. In a single thought, the Five Elements rotated, and magic power multiplied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Metal overcomes Wood, Wood overcomes Earth, Earth overcomes Water, Water overcomes Fire, Fire overcomes Metal. In a single thought, the Five Elements reversed, and magic power diminished greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Between creation and destruction, it all hinged on a single thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo circulated the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Art, practicing it several times to maintain his feel for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">As the saying goes, practice makes perfect, and perfection leads to ingenuity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Although Ning Zhuo had the enhancement of the Five Viscera Temple Spirit and his realm in the Five Elements was unfathomably deep - allowing him to cast unfamiliar Five Elements spells with great precision and proficiency - that was merely proficiency. It had not reached the realm of ingenuity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo did not have the time to practice the vast majority of Five Elements spells. However, he still needed to invest some time and energy into his lifebound spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This was worth it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After finishing the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art, Ning Zhuo focused on studying the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He utilized his vital essence blood to raise blood qi, weaving it into various blood veins to enhance different parts of his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Enhancing the internal organs strengthened their functions. Enhancing the surface of the skin formed a layer of protection. Enhancing the muscles allowed him to exert a bit more strength. If the force-exerting structure was special, it even allowed Ning Zhuo to perform physical movements that defied common logic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ever since Ning Zhuo realized the connection between weaving techniques and the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art during the trial of the Inherited Dao Jade Page, he had begun practicing the weaving of blood veins extensively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Naturally, he had his key areas of practice, which were seven types of weaving: plain, twill, satin, spiral, layered, spiderweb, and palindrome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The blood qi flowed ceaselessly within his body, transforming into different blood veins. Sometimes dense, sometimes smooth, sometimes tough, sometimes piercing, sometimes layered, sometimes netting, sometimes looping back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo had participated in various Rising Cloud Minor Trials, gaining all sorts of insights that also brought some improvements to his daily cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Blood qi congeals into veins. These blood veins can also serve as formation threads!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Where formation threads intersected, formation eyes could form, gathering energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Where blood veins intersected, nodes could form, gathering blood qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Layers of formation threads could form a formation net, covering an area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Layers of blood veins could form a vein net, covering the whole body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">As Ning Zhuo cultivated today, thoughts sprang up one after another, and he naturally deduced many things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This was his master-level formation realm coming into play.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"I only have the Foundation Establishment stage of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art. I fear that at the Golden Core stage, the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art will require constructing magical formations within the human body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Foundation Establishment section of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art taught various structures of blood veins. The Golden Core section would likely be even more complex. Massive amounts of blood veins would combine to form formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Different formations meant different powers, which foreshadowed multiple miraculous uses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"But in this way, the complexity of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art will likely skyrocket by more than a hundred times compared to the Foundation Establishment stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo speculated inwardly, feeling that this possibility was quite high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Given enough time, I could even deduce a portion of the subsequent cultivation method contents."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo's formation realm was sufficient. He also had a major aid - the Luo Shu page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">With its help, Ning Zhuo's deduction ability would skyrocket by far more than a hundred times!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Of course, the authentic Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art might not follow this route. It's best to return to Fire Persimmon Immortal City and obtain the true original from the Dharma Transmission Bell."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"In this regard, I am not in a hurry."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo was currently only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, and he had not yet finished cultivating the subsequent methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Relying on his own foundation, he could already continue creating upon the Foundation Establishment method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Cultivation methods were created this way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">High realms and skills allowed cultivators to constantly bring forth the new through the old, contributing their own efforts to this flourishing age of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">However, the masters of the Three Sects were Void Refinement level mighty figures. Given the conditions, Ning Zhuo would naturally follow the creative train of thought of these mighty figures; it was safer and had more potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The benefits brought by the Luo Shu page were not limited to deducing and creating cultivation methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo also used the Luo Shu page while comprehending the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">There were truly too many blood vein construction methods recorded in the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art. The seven types Ning Zhuo mainly practiced were just his chosen focus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo needed to memorize all the other construction methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Luo Shu page helped Ning Zhuo calculate, allowing him to understand the internal logic of an unfamiliar structure much faster. This made Ning Zhuo's comprehension and memorization much more efficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Currently, Ning Zhuo's Upper and Middle Dantians had both undergone the phenomenon of planting the talisman, possessing lifebound talismans. Only the Lower Dantian was lagging behind, still at the stage where the dantian glowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Only after Ning Zhuo fully comprehended the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art and condensed a lifebound talisman could the Three Dantians advance together, pushing his cultivation forward as a whole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"If I specialized in one school, I'm afraid I would already be at the late Foundation Establishment stage, or even at the peak level by now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">There was no helping it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">This was the path Ning Zhuo had chosen himself. Cultivating all Three Dantians simultaneously meant immense strength and a deep foundation, but it required more time and consumed more energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo also had to carve out more time to improve in other aspects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He took out the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat and climbed inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The spirit boat vibrated slightly as the Embryonic Breath Great Method operated at full capacity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Heaven and earth essence qi surged from all directions, following the guidance of the spirit boat to seep into the limbs and bones of the big-headed youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Using the spirit boat as the womb and heaven and earth as the mother, nurturing the physical body, returning to the original state of truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Muscles grew, bones strengthened, the skin membrane became tough, and internal organs enlarged... but the effect was getting worse and worse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo exited the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, looking at the spirit boat filled with cracks. His brow furrowed slightly, knowing it was time to repair this treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">If the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat were fully repaired, the cultivation effect would definitely improve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"But the degree of improvement won't be much. After cultivating for another period, I'll have to find another path for physical cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The main cultivation method a cultivator practiced would bring continuous improvement. However, Ning Zhuo's Three Sects' Supreme Methods had other strengths; their improvement of the physical body and soul was negligible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">If Ning Zhuo wanted to make progress in the two major aspects of body and soul, he had to find other ways and pay a greater price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">These costs were very high! Thinking about it, the cost-performance ratio of cultivation methods was extremely high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo already foresaw that even if the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat were repaired completely, it would only last for a short while. And he had long found an outlet for physical cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">That was the long-term consumption of spirit food and medicinal pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Regarding spirit food, with the help of the Old Chef, it wasn't a problem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Although the Old Chef's Dark Cuisine tasted terrible, its effects were undeniable. Ning Zhuo ate it every day!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Regarding medicinal pills, Ning Zhuo was doing quite poorly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Next, I need to make progress in this area!" Ning Zhuo had already ordered Chen San to collect intelligence regarding the minor trials related to pill refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"I also have to handle the repair of the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat myself. Only a cultivator proficient in the Embryonic Breath Great Method can do this. It cannot be smelted carelessly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Sigh, there isn't enough time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">For Ning Zhuo, time was never enough!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">After finishing his physical cultivation, he began cultivating his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine: The liquid was semi-transparent silver-gray, with a layer of pale moonlight floating on the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Nine Springs Repose Incense: The incense stick was thin as a withered twig, dark purple on the surface, emitting the scent of rotting earth mixed with cold, wet white plums.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Hungry Ghost Backlash Cauldron: A bronze cauldron with three legs and two ears. The body of the cauldron was covered in verdigris, the corrosion forming blurred images of a hundred ghosts devouring each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Underworld Penal Book: A book with iron skin and iron pages. The iron cover was as dark as night, and the pages were cold-rolled from thousand-tempered glacial ice, glowing with a ghostly green light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">These were the Four Treasures of Soul Cultivation from White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo's physical foundation had improved and could now bear the weight of a million human souls. Ning Zhuo had recently restarted his soul cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">His soul foundation began to soar wildly again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The speed was far faster than his physical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Therefore, to avoid the previous predicament of the soul crushing the body, Ning Zhuo had to ensure his physical cultivation speed also caught up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="257"/>
<paragraph index="259">Zhaoyao Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Xiao Juxia mingled with the crowd and arrived at the peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The Lord of Zhaoyao Peak was most skilled at refining various banners and flags, and also enjoyed collecting them. On his peak, he planted a banner every few hundred steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">There were Cloud Gathering Banners, Dust Avoidance Banners, Lightning Attraction Banners, Flowing Wind Banners, Position Shifting Banners, and so on - a wide variety and great quantity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"The first stage of this trial is to repair the numerous banners on the mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"When the time limit is up, the top one hundred with the best results will advance to the next stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The cultivator presiding over the trial announced loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Subsequently, the trial officially began. A large number of cultivators swarmed out, racing against time to find banners and repair them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Compared to these hurrying cultivators, Xiao Juxia walked with a leisurely and composed pace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">He had full confidence in his ability in artifact refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">After slightly repairing two banners, Xiao Juxia gained some insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"To stitch the flag surface, one must first find the right materials. Only if they match can the work proceed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Flagpoles are often hollow. If one uses too much force during repair, they will snap directly, causing more serious damage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"Among the banners here, there are also Position Shifting Banners. That means the current position of the banner is different from its original one. So, one needs to survey the formations here and figure out the Zhaoyao Peak Lord's thoughts to plant the banner back in its most suitable position after repairing it!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
