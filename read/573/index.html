<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Thus, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong secretly revised their previous plan, joining the group of cultivators heading toward White Paper City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Within the Ghostly Black Marshlands, waterways were abundant and intricate. The three redwood warships carried many people, who were all locals that were familiar with the environment, which made their journey smooth and uneventful throughout the day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo hadn't yet learned the Ghostman Tribe leader's full name, only knowing his surname was Qing from overhearing others. Coupled with the leader's pale green complexion, it seemed rather fitting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Since Leader Qing had already made arrangements, Ning Zhuo was placed directly under his care. Qing suggested Ning Zhuo use the Bone-chilling Crocodile stomach bag to recuperate, offering to personally protect him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">But Ning Zhuo wanted none of that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">His appearance and physique were easily disguised through his thieving skills, but his soul wasn't as malleable. Using the crocodile's stomach required separating the soul from the body to enter the bag. Doing so would surely expose him, and leaving his physical body unattended posed significant danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Yet this small obstacle didn't trouble Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He kept a stern expression, addressing the Golden Core leader by surname alone, clearly showing a reluctant obedience beneath a facade of subservience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Leader Qing, once we reach White Paper City, I'll naturally use the stomach bag to rest. There's no need for you to trouble yourself so much on my behalf."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ironically, the Golden Core Ghostman Tribe leader felt reassured, chuckling knowingly, "Jiao Ma, don't think I don't understand your thoughts. You're still thinking about my daughter and afraid you'll owe me a favor that's tough to repay."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Hmph."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"You're a human, and my daughter is of the Ghostman Tribe. A union between you two would hardly lead to happiness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"And what's wrong with becoming a male consort? If you become the City Lord’s husband, wealth and power would come effortlessly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Ghostman Tribe Golden Core didn't miss a chance to persuade Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Beside him, Sun Lingtong struggled to hold back laughter, chiming in mockingly, "Indeed, Young Master Jiao Ma. Becoming a male consort is a rare opportunity that others can't even dream of."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo snorted coldly, pointing sharply at Sun Lingtong, "Who are you again? Even if you've saved me, I'm talking to Leader Qing. Who permitted you to interrupt? Slap yourself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong froze on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Although the Ghostman Tribe's numbers in the Ghostly Black Marshlands surpassed those of humans, their status remained inferior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In the broader cultivation world, humans unquestionably dominated. The Ghostman Tribe was sparse, significant only within this marshland.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Therefore, Ning Zhuo, as a human, ordering a Ghostman Tribe Foundation Establishment cultivator to slap himself wasn't out of place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Leader Qing's eyes flickered subtly but said nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Suddenly, a dozen gazes landed on Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Gritting his teeth, Sun Lingtong glared at Ning Zhuo, prepared to strike himself when Ning Zhuo raised a hand to stop him. "But who am I?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"I am Jiao Ma, magnanimous and open-minded, not like some who hold petty biases between humans and ghostmen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Leader Qing chuckled softly, understanding Ning Zhuo was indirectly mocking him. Remembering Ning Zhuo's pursuit of his daughter, Qing chose not to retaliate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo pointed again at Sun Lingtong, "Since you've saved me, I'll show forgiveness this once."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"How about this: given your short stature and dark complexion, like a lump of iron, why not change your name to Iron Lump?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"I'll accept you as my servant. From now on, you’ll work under me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong resisted the strong urge to roll his eyes, inwardly thinking, "Fine, if that's how we're playing, then alright."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Obediently kneeling halfway, he clasped his fists respectfully, calling Ning Zhuo "Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, beckoning, "Come here, stand beside me. Await my orders."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Yes, Master." Sun Lingtong ground his teeth in hidden resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He hadn’t expected Ning Zhuo to be so audacious as to demand servitude from him. This was absolute rebellion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The old Ning Zhuo would never behave like this. Travelling around has really emboldened him. Joining that battle unleashed his wild side! Hmph, just you wait. Once I find the chance, I'll definitely settle the score!" Sun Lingtong had mocked Ning Zhuo earlier but was now trapped in this ironic reversal, helpless to resist for the time being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Yet, Sun Lingtong knew Ning Zhuo's true intention was to position him nearby for easier coordination of their future actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Seeing Ning Zhuo successfully subdue a Ghostman Tribe member, Leader Qing extended his spiritual sense, scanning Sun Lingtong thoroughly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Having a mid-stage Foundation Establishment ghostman cultivator as your servant is acceptable,” Elder Qing nodded slightly. “Though, he's a bit too poor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">With that, he produced two magical artifacts and tossed them to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“These were my personal artifacts in my youth; you can use them now. One is the Flying Bone Shield, the other is the Malevolent Soul Saber. One for attack, one for defense - perfect for your use.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Refine them first, then I'll teach you how to wield them properly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Seeing Ning Zhuo was unwilling to accept favors directly, Elder Qing cleverly went around the issue, enhancing the strength of Ning Zhuo's supposed "servant," Iron Lump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong paused momentarily, inwardly marveling, “This little rascal Ning Zhuo really knows how to read people far better than I do.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He quickly caught the artifacts, expressing his gratitude loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo snorted lightly, showing some hesitation, but ultimately did not object.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">As the others sailed onward, Elder Qing personally assisted Sun Lingtong in rapidly refining the two artifacts and instructed him on their use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">With his sharp mind and extensive experience from countless thefts, Sun Lingtong swiftly mastered these ghost-path artifacts, wielding them adeptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Impressed, Elder Qing reassessed Sun Lingtong anew, remarking, “You're a clever one despite your shabby looks, little runt. From now on, serve your young master loyally, understood?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Yes, sir,” Sun Lingtong grunted quietly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Elder Qing Yan,” a man's voice suddenly called out, “I, surnamed Yang, am an outsider who happened to receive your village’s appointment quota, selected as a male concubine. Shouldn't Elder Qing Yan reward me with something too?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Everyone turned to look. The speaker was a sturdy, towering middle-aged man, broad-faced with a lion-like nose, a full beard, and a chest thick with black hair, exuding strong masculine energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Only then did Ning Zhuo learn Elder Qing’s full name: Qing Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Elder Qing Yan eyed the man, unperturbed, laughing loudly. “You're an outsider but willingly chose to become a male concubine, indeed contributing to our village. Tell me what you desire; I'll consider it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This middle-aged man's full name was Yang Weida, a body cultivator and merchant from Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Hearing about the recruitment of male concubines and believing his cultivation to be outstanding, Yang Weida sought higher connections. After surviving an attack through his own skills, he witnessed Qing Yan favoring Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong; therefore, his merchant instincts prompted him to boldly request rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Outwardly straightforward yet inwardly shrewd, Yang Weida promptly requested a Bone-Chilling Crocodile Stomach Pouch like Ning Zhuo’s.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Elder Qing Yan scoffed coldly, “Your appetite is too large. A pouch from a Golden Core-level beast isn’t something given away casually. Ask for something practical.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Yang Weida quickly responded, “Then I request a few Soul-Ferrying Lamp Wicks.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Elder Qing Yan withdrew six artifact-grade Soul-Ferrying Lamp Wicks from his storage bag and tossed them to Yang Weida.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A chilling laugh suddenly echoed, “Just a few lamp wicks and you get an outsider willing to die for you. Qing Yan, you'd make a good merchant - quite the profitable deal!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Who goes there?!” Qing Yan stood abruptly, sharply demanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The others tensed, instantly alert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The river exploded upward, revealing a Golden Core-level Bone-Chilling Crocodile, atop which sat an enormous elephant-sized human cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">This man, entirely encased in bone armor with a chilling, ruthless gaze, stared at the cultivators aboard the three ships. “White Paper City Lord demands vast amounts of Yang energy. Selecting male concubines serves her dual-cultivation practice, endlessly supplying her with Yang energy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“As a result, becoming her male concubine will drain your life force excessively, ultimately costing your lives.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“You fools chosen as male concubines, still feeling proud? Pathetic! You're digging your own graves.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Many cultivators paled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo’s eyes deepened thoughtfully. Yang Weida, his expression shifting slightly, retorted, “I don’t believe you! If true, the White Paper City Lord would have long faced universal outrage and rebellion. Even without rebellion, everyone would’ve fled long ago. Yet she’s repeatedly selected male concubines for many cycles.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">His argument, logical and convincing, prompted Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong to reconsider him carefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Qing Yan snorted coldly, “Bone Crocodile Demon! Were you behind the recent crocodile attack on my village?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Bone Crocodile Demon openly admitted, “Indeed. I despise greedy idiots like you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“White Paper City Lord reigns over us - by what right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“You blind fools willingly give her vast amounts of Yang energy, sustaining her cultivation. That's why White Paper City stands unshakeable!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“Our City Overthrow Alliance aims to eliminate you degenerates, purifying and liberating the Ghostly Black Marshlands!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">At his declaration, countless Bone-Chilling Crocodiles rose from the river depths, assaulting the three ships.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Immediately, the Redwood warships activated their protective arrays, glowing brightly to repel the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The cultivators aboard the ships unleashed a torrent of spells, striking ferociously at the Piercing Bone Crocodile horde and the Bone Crocodile Demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Under the relentless magical assault, the crocodiles suffered immense casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Some crocodiles hurled themselves against the ships, while others spewed corrosive venom from their gaping mouths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Bone Crocodile Demon roared with laughter amidst the fierce barrage. Clad in robust, heavy bone armor, he remained unscathed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Is this the best you can do? Feels like you're tickling me," mocked the demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Is that so?" Qing Yan sneered, abruptly striking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He summoned a gigantic soul blade, its energy surging and swelling to the size of the warships, slamming down fiercely from midair onto the Bone Crocodile Demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Unable to withstand such overwhelming force, the Bone Crocodile Demon was thrown into the river, creating massive waves several meters high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Undeterred, the Bone Crocodile Demon launched counterattacks from beneath the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Qing Yan pressed his advantage aggressively, his dominating strikes consistently forcing the Bone Crocodile Demon into defensive positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Meanwhile, the remaining Piercing Bone Crocodiles fell rapidly under the collective assault of the other cultivators, their corpses floating lifelessly on the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Although the Bone Crocodile Demon was a Golden Core cultivator, his strength lay primarily in beast control rather than personal combat prowess. Qing Yan's relentless attacks left him overwhelmed and defensively reactive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Initially, the crocodile swarm had seemed to hold the upper hand against the cultivators, but the three sturdy redwood battleships, acting like mobile fortresses, rendered their assaults largely ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Later into the battle, Qing Yan gave a sharp cry and dove straight into the water, confronting the Bone Crocodile Demon directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Explosions continuously erupted from beneath the water's surface, creating massive, towering sprays.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Enraged, the Bone Crocodile Demon's voice echoed, "Qing Yan, you foolish loyal dog! What has the White Paper City Lord given you that makes you so devoted to her?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Qing Yan responded coldly, "Your Overturning Alliance is short-sighted! Without the White Paper City Lord guarding the Immortal City and resisting the annual Ghost Tide, how could we survive here? Protecting the City Lord means preserving our lives and safeguarding the entirety of Ghostly Black Marshland's order!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Bone Crocodile Demon sneered, "You speak well, but you're just thinking of yourself. Have you considered the fate of those selected as male consorts? They have become nothing but cultivation sacrifices for the White Paper City Lord!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Stop your slander!" Qing Yan shouted angrily. "Becoming a male consort grants wealth and honor. The City Lord has never harmed innocents. Those unable to provide Yang energy simply leave; she never restricts their freedom. Your Overturning Alliance only seeks power and dominance but lacks the strength to resist the Ghost Tide. Given your pathetic skills, it's clear your whole alliance amounts to nothing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The Bone Crocodile Demon exploded with fury, "You dare insult me? Qing Yan, today I'll tear you apart and teach you the true strength of your Grandpa Crocodile Demon!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Underwater explosions intensified, growing louder and more frequent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Yet, after a fierce round of clashes, the explosions significantly diminished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Qing Yan’s voice resonated once more, confident and defiant, "Crocodile Demon, if you have any tricks left, now's the time to use them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Damn it!" roared the demon, clearly disadvantaged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He sneered coldly, "Qing Yan, you don't understand the City Lord's true state. I'll tell you plainly - she's finished. Even if she takes new male consorts, their Yang energy won't be enough to balance her condition. She's ruled White Paper City too long, accumulating excessive Yin energy. This time, your defeat is inevitable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Meanwhile, at Black Water Mountain, within White Paper City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">In the dimly lit Whisper Pavilion, only the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was present, sitting solemnly. In front of her, on a jade desk, lay several treasures - a bronze lamp, seven yellow jade bells, and a charred-tailed ghost-patterned zither.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">She extended her hand, lighting a long incense stick with the bronze lamp. Blue smoke curled upwards, swirling persistently in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Guided by her spiritual consciousness, she plucked the zither. The music merged with the swirling smoke, its patterns shifting rapidly. As the seven jade bells hovered and chimed harmoniously, the divination entered its most critical phase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Gradually, the sorrowful melody faded away. The smoke descended upon the table, forming a thin layer of gray ash. The ashes subtly outlined a prophetic poem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, breathing lightly and focusing intently, softly recited:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Ghost tides surge, White Paper in peril,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">A lone goose carries a candle, piercing heaven’s veil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The guest star appears in the north of the literary pivot,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Myriad Manifestations Lamp ignites, shattering calamity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">She quickly formed hand signs, interpreting the prophecy further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Her breathing weakened, but her eyes shone brighter with clarity. "The turning point lies in the north. The 'lone goose' and 'guest star' represent outsiders. An outsider with a candle who ignites the Myriad Manifestations Lamp will be key to overcoming this crisis!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">"Myriad Manifestations... Is this referring to a lamp, or the Myriad Manifestations Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">After deep thought, inspiration suddenly struck her. She dispatched a flying message: "Wen Ruanyu, you are from the Myriad Manifestations Sect and a crucial figure in this prophecy. Go north immediately and greet an outsider. Remember, he carries some form of candle - perhaps literal, or simply candlelight or flame."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
