<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 85: Joint Examination of the Three Clans</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Regardless of whether it was the Zhou Clan, Zheng Clan, or Ning Clan, all three placed great importance on this joint examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Inside the guest hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Zhou Clan patriarch sat upright in the main seat. To his left was the Zheng Clan patriarch, and to his right sat the Ning Clan patriarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“It’s really strange. Just where did that black shadow demonic cultivator come from? And now, they’ve disappeared without a trace.” The Zhou Clan patriarch took a sip of tea and set down his cup. “This time, our Fire Persimmon Immortal City has truly lost face.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Although he spoke thus, the Zhou Clan patriarch’s expression remained calm. There wasn’t the slightest trace of embarrassment or anger on his face; instead, he seemed composed and at ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This was clearly a probing remark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After the incident, the Zhou Clan’s upper levels gradually started to put the pieces together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Just as Zhu Xuanji had speculated, the Zhou Clan was also wondering who the traitor was, who had secretly released the black shadow demonic cultivator beforehand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Zheng Clan patriarch said in a booming voice, “If you ask me, that black shadow demonic cultivator must have secretly escaped a long time ago! On the day of the Fire Persimmon Festival, our Golden Core stage ancestors joined forces and dug so deep they almost hollowed out the mountain base, and still didn’t find a thing!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Zhou Clan patriarch looked over at the Ning Clan patriarch and narrowed his eyes. “What does Brother Ning think of this matter?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Ning Clan patriarch spread both hands. “No matter where the black shadow demonic cultivator came from, or who they were colluding with, none of that matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Right now, Sir City Lord Meng Kui has stationed himself above the volcano and is preventing any cultivator from entering the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Since that’s the case, only juniors in the Qi Refining can enter the immortal palace with their souls and compete for its inheritance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Meng Kui’s direct grandson Meng Chong possesses a super-grade innate talent. I’m sure you two understand the significance of an immortal talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“Only by joining together, cooperating closely, and throwing our full support behind our juniors can our three clans hope to stand against Meng Chong.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">At this point, the Ning Clan patriarch didn’t know that Meng Chong was already unconscious after failing his exploration of the immortal palace again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But his words drew agreement from both the Zhou Clan and Zheng Clan patriarchs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Meng Chong and his immortal talent put immense pressure on the other two clans. That was one of the main reasons they agreed to let the Ning Clan join their alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">All three clans had a strong desire to form an alliance and were willing to contribute their own foundation to vigorously support the younger generation. The problem, however, was how to split things up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">If one clan contributed more, then the other clans would benefit less.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">None of the three clans wanted to suffer a loss, so the preliminary alliance talks had become deadlocked over the issue of resource allocation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The three clans couldn’t reach an agreement for now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Let’s first see how this examination goes,” said the Zhou Clan patriarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Zheng Clan patriarch nodded. “Then we must watch carefully!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Ning Clan Patriarch remained silent, a trace of worry in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He knew that this joint cultivation examination had a deeper meaning behind it. The three clans would evaluate the quality of each clan’s recultivation team and determine how to divide resources accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Ning Clan Patriarch was well aware that his own clan was the weakest here. Right now, he could only hope that the gap between them and the Zhou and Zheng Clans wasn’t too wide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo followed a servant and arrived at the Zhou Clan’s training grounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Many cultivators had already gathered in the square.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Most had youthful faces, while a few were middle-aged or elderly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The crowd was divided into three clear groups – Zhou Clan members, Zheng Clan members, and Ning Clan members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Ah Zhuo, you’re here.” Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, Ning Yong immediately stepped out from the crowd and jogged over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Chen was also among the crowd and waved at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo smiled and waved back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Since the bombing of the immortal palace the other day, his relationship with Ning Yong and Ning Chen had undergone a qualitative change. They had gone from being ordinary classmates to comrades who had faced life and death together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The training ground was noisy and bustling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo and Ning Yong blended into the Ning Clan group, unremarkable among the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">As he casually chatted with Ning Yong and Ning Chen, Ning Zhuo also kept an eye on those around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“The Ning Clan’s recultivation team has grown!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In the training ground, the Ning Clan had the largest number of people, at more than sixty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Zhou Clan had twenty-nine, and the Zheng Clan had forty-five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Standing together, the Ning Clan group gave off an imposing aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Many youngsters were busy looking around. Whenever they locked eyes with cultivators from the other two clans, a contest of will broke out, giving the air a palpable tension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo silently analyzed, “Among the three great clans, the Ning Clan started the latest and is the weakest overall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Originally, the recultivation team was also the smallest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“But the higher ups suddenly expanded the recultivation team. Is it because they’re lacking confidence and are trying to make up for it with sheer numbers?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“It seems the Ning Clan really wants the Lava Immortal Palace!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo then turned his eyes to observe the Zhou and Zheng Clan cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Zhou Clan cultivators were generally quiet and interacted very little with one another, creating a stifling atmosphere. Two leading figures stood at the center of their group. One was tall and burly, and the other short and thin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen.” Ning Zhuo, having gathered a fair amount of intel, recognized them immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Zheng Clan cultivators all had well-built physiques and gave off a sharp, elite vibe. Their eyes were piercingly bright, like unsheathed weapons. Many Ning Clan cultivators instinctively avoided meeting their gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">At the very front of the Zheng Clan group stood a young cultivator wearing a headband. Strikingly, his eyes were shut, yet several hook-shaped magic artifacts swirled lazily around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“That’s Zheng Jian!” Ning Zhuo thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After looking at the other two clans’ cultivators, he glanced back at his own Ning Clan and immediately felt that despite their numbers, the Ning Clan seemed more like a disorderly mob.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">An elder of the Zhou Clan appeared before the crowd, activated the testing formation, and announced the beginning of the cultivation examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Big Zhu, let’s go,” said Zhou Zeshen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Mm,” Zhou Zhu responded in a low voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Although Zhou Zhu clearly had the higher cultivation base, he still followed behind Zhou Zeshen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The two of them had been standing in the center of the crowd, but once they began moving, the Zhou Clan members ahead of them seemed to grow eyes on their backs and instinctively stepped aside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Once the two Zhou Clan prodigies passed, those who had moved aside immediately returned to their spots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">As Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen walked forward, the Zhou Clan members flowed like water, parting and converging with natural ease, showing the coordination and subtle cooperation born of formation mastery. Every step they took seemed to resonate with the others. Though the formation was full of shifting figures, there was not the slightest trace of chaos, and the demeanor of a great clan was on full display.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo’s eyes flashed with insight. He immediately picked up on a crucial clue and thought, “These Zhou Clan cultivators are unusual. Their coordination is seamless, moving if they were a single entity. They must have deep training in battle formations.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Zhou Clan’s recultivation team had the fewest members, but they were not to be underestimated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Many cultivators who could recognize such expertise revealed solemn expressions at the sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">However, most didn’t pay it much mind. The Ning Clan had the greatest number of such inattentive individuals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Under countless watching eyes, Zhou Zhu stepped into the testing formation first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Once inside, he activated the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation with full force, causing the formation to glow with the light of the five elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Zhou Clan elder took a glance and loudly announced, “Zhou Zhu, peak of the third level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In an instant, the Zhou Clan cultivators erupted in cheers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">They were clearly well-prepared, responding in unison. Their coordinated voices drew the attention of cultivators from the other two clans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Next, Zhou Zeshen entered the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Zhou Zeshen, middle stage of the second level!” the elder announced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Once again, the Zhou Clan cultivators cheered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Someone from the Zheng Clan snorted in disdain and said, “Some prodigy! Just the middle stage of the second level? I’m already at the third level!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Zheng Jian opened his eyes and cast a faint glance at the speaker, who immediately fell silent as if struck dumb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">This small exchange did not escape Ning Zhuo’s notice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“Mm, another useful piece of intel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Within the Zheng Clan’s recultivation team, Zheng Jian is the undisputed leader and wields significant authority.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Inside the guest hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Zheng Clan patriarch sighed, “Brother Zhou, your clan’s Gathering-Dispersal As-You-Wish Ebbing Spirit Formation really is effective.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Ning Clan Patriarch nodded slightly in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Naturally, they knew more than outsiders. They were aware that Zhou Zeshen had only recently begun his recultivation and had already reached the middle stage of the second level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">That kind of speed was extremely fast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Zhou Clan patriarch gave a dramatic sigh. “If it were just the Gathering-Dispersal As-You-Wish Ebbing Spirit Formation, how could such results be possible? That junior Zhou Zeshen pushed himself to the limit. Though he lacks Zhou Zhu’s innate talent, he’s been desperately catching up with the help of various healing methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“There were several times when he came close to death, worrying many members of the clan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Zheng Clan patriarch was moved. “With juniors like this, how could a clan not flourish?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Ning Clan Patriarch echoed the sentiment, though his heart grew heavier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo continued to watch in silence. He knew that both Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen had trained at the Mud Flow Sect and was quite curious about their foundation in mechanical arts skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Unfortunately, today’s event gave them no opportunity to showcase their mechanical arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
