<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Liu Zhen first inquired about Ning Zhuo from Sun Lie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"You're asking about Ning Zhuo? He's now well-known throughout Fire Persimmon Immortal City," Sun Lie replied with slight surprise, but still answered Liu Zhen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"How did your sect come to hear of Ning Zhuo's reputation, and why are you inquiring about his situation?" Sun Lie asked curiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Liu Zhen explained the circumstances, as there was no need to hide anything. Moreover, he trusted Sun Lie greatly, as he had saved his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">After listening, Sun Lie said with a smile, "So, Ning Zhuo has already left Fire Persimmon Immortal City to travel and gain experience. No wonder he's always been in seclusion for cultivation and hasn't appeared in public for many days."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo had left secretly, using the mechanical creation "Ten Thousand Miles Traversing Dragon." In the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City, only the highest-level cultivators knew this secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lie was obviously not among them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Liu Zhen bowed respectfully and said, "Please, Master Sun, tell me more about this Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lie said, "Speaking of Ning Zhuo, he is indeed a young talent, very impressive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"In his early years, his parents..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After Sun Lie's introduction, Liu Zhen remained silent for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He was inclined to believe that everything Sun Lie said was true, as the latter had no reason to deceive him. Moreover, he could easily verify this information from others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"But if this is the case, this Ning Zhuo is too extraordinary and truly inspiring!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Although Ning Zhuo was no longer in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he had become a hot topic of discussion among the city's residents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Despite being born into a great clan, he had suffered hardships in his early years, facing much discrimination and harsh treatment, and was unremarkable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It was during the emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace that he rose rapidly, gradually showing his brilliance, and finally succeeded in splitting from the family, replacing the Zheng family to become the patriarch of the Ning family branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The city's residents wouldn't know the final details of the Lava Immortal Palace incident, but the existence of the Ning family branch was always there, silently telling everyone about Ning Zhuo's achievements!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Such an accomplishment would be rare even for a middle-aged person. Yet, Ning Zhuo was only a sixteen-year-old youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo's success inspired countless young people. It gave the most common lower-class city residents the best role model to identify with; Ning Zhuo's success was also their inner desire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Thus, unknowingly, Ning Zhuo had become an idol for the residents of Fire Persimmon City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"So Ning Zhuo has such an identity. He endured disdain for years and only recently gained the favor of the family's Golden Core Patriarch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"How did he manage to do it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Splitting from the family is a very taboo thing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Liu Zhen felt curious and incredulous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">How did Ning Zhuo manage to split from the family peacefully? What was going on with the Ning family's main branch? Didn't they try to stop him? Doesn't the Ning family have a Golden Core Patriarch? Did they just watch him split off?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Liu Zhen realized that things were far from simple on the surface. Ning Zhuo must have already reached many behind-the-scenes agreements with the Ning family's Golden Core Patriarch, Ning Jiufan, and the Ning family's main branch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Liu Zhen thought for a moment and asked Sun Lie, "So, how do other forces in Fire Persimmon Immortal City view the Ning family branch?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lie smiled, "That's a good question you're asking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"I won't say much about the rest, but let me tell you about what happened when Ning Zhuo set up the flowing feast during the family branch founding ceremony."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">After listening, Liu Zhen's face was full of shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Ning Zhuo is just a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but on the day of the family branch founding ceremony, he actually attracted two Golden Core cultivators, Fei Si and Zhou Nongying, to personally cast spells!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"And even Zhu Hou, a member of the royal family, attended?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"The Golden Core cultivator Song Fuli from Cloud Merchant, who doesn't get along with Ning Zhuo, blocked the door to cause trouble for Ning Zhuo that day, but was persuaded to retreat by several consecutive flying letters, completely humiliated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">What does this indicate?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Liu Zhen was very clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"This indicates that the new force established by Ning Zhuo has been fully recognized by the existing factions in Fire Persimmon Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Their level of recognition is extremely high, and they're even willing to come forward to persuade Song Fuli to retreat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Looking at it this way, the Ning family branch is bound to flourish in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"This Ning Zhuo kid is really impressive!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Liu Zhen originally thought that Ning Zhuo was just a young master from a cultivation family, sheltered by his elders since childhood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He didn't expect that he was almost a self-made man, creating the foundation of a family branch as its patriarch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lie revealed a mysterious expression and told Liu Zhen, "According to rumors, Ning Zhuo even played a very important role in the final stages of the battle in the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Is that so?" Liu Zhen listened attentively, with various guesses floating in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"This is really inspiring!" Liu Zhen sighed repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Of course, he wouldn't just gather information from Sun Lie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He left the Purple Yang Villa and went to various places in Fire Persimmon Immortal City to gather intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This intelligence was not much different from what Sun Lie had said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Liu Zhen came to the original site of the Zheng family, looking at the Ning family's signboard, his heart full of emotion: "Although Ning Zhuo is young, he's definitely not simple."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Looking at his rise to power, he was mistreated and ignored when he was young. He firmly grasped the opportunity of the Lava Immortal Palace, disregarding his status as a scion of a great clan, willing to act as the lord of the black market, driving for the City Lord's Manor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"He's very good at using others to achieve his goals. In the process of self-strengthening, he used many resources from the Zhou family, Zheng family, and even the City Lord's Manor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"He also mobilized within the family, bringing down the young patriarch of the main branch. His political skills are incredibly sharp!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Rather than saying he's a young hero, it's better to say he's a young ambitious one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"When dealing with such a person, you absolutely can't underestimate him! You must be wary of him borrowing power and influence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Liu Zhen left early and didn't know that his little junior sister had already been confined for helping Ning Zhuo too much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">With different thoughts in mind, he actively walked to the front gate of Ning Zhuo's family branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Facing the cultivator serving as a guard, he directly said, "I'm a rogue cultivator. I heard you're hiring here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The guard looked him over and said, "If you want to work, please register first. Someone will lead you there. Don't wander around in our Ning family territory, or you'll bear the consequences."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Liu Zhen had no intention of wandering around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After all, his strength had been greatly weakened, and he had just recovered from a serious illness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">This time, he just wanted to use the opportunity of job hiring to delve into the Ning family branch and personally investigate the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Soon after, Liu Zhen and other short-term working cultivators were led into the artifact refining room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Inside the artifact refining room, a large number of furnaces were burning and refining day and night without ceasing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">According to the foreman's arrangement, Liu Zhen came to his position and began to work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After just half a day, his weakened constitution couldn't hold up anymore, feeling weak to the point of seeing stars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"The workload is too heavy, there's been almost no rest all morning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Liu Zhen was covered in dirt and felt quite terrible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He couldn't continue; if he did, he would collapse from exhaustion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He spoke to the foreman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The foreman had long been dissatisfied with his efficiency: "How come your body is so weak that you can't handle this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Liu Zhen sighed, "I didn't expect the work to be this heavy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The foreman shook his head, "Otherwise, why do you think the Ning family is paying us such high wages? It's indeed difficult for you to earn this money. Go, go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"If you can't do it, there are plenty of people who want to..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">As he was speaking, a one-armed cultivator walked in, shouting irritably, "Why is the output of your Room 3 the lowest among all the artifact refining rooms?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"What exactly are you doing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Don't you know we're on a tight schedule? If this batch of Jade Moistened Dark Steel isn't refined in time, the next batch will be here! The family storehouse is almost full!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The foreman waved Liu Zhen away, no longer paying attention to him, but ran in front of the one-armed cultivator, bowing and apologizing repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The one-armed cultivator was not a stranger, but one of the three rogue cultivators from the black market, the One-Armed Craftsman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Since Ning Zhuo established the family branch, he had recruited him and temporarily appointed him as the Head of Artifact Refining for the branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">One-Armed Craftsman greatly enjoyed this position and had always maintained an extremely high enthusiasm for work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Liu Zhen left the Ning family branch territory, already clear in his mind that although the branch had just been established, the family style was good, and they were working with great enthusiasm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Even though One-Armed Crastman was an externally hired guest elder, he treated it as his own career.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">When Liu Zhen was about to exit the main gate, a group of young cultivators were chatting excitedly, striding into the family territory with heads held high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Liu Zhen keenly observed: Although these cultivators were very young, their demeanor was extraordinary, and other Ning family members' attitudes towards them were very respectful and envious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Some of the young cultivators were even carrying parts of demon beast corpses, with remnants of killing intent and battle spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">They should have just returned from hunting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Liu Zhen went to ask the guard and learned the identities of these people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Almost all of them were Ning Zhuo's classmates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Especially the leaders, Ning Yong and Ning Chen, who had followed Ning Zhuo even before the family split.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">They had received multiple instances of care from Ning Zhuo. Obviously, in Ning Zhuo's heart, the friendship with these two classmates was the deepest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"So they are Ning Zhuo's confidants, the future backbone of the family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"But their cultivation levels are generally weak. How did they hunt demon beast corpses that are generally at the Qi Refining level?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Liu Zhen carried these doubts and went to inquire further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The answer he received shook his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">It turned out that according to the tripartite agreement, many cultivators in Ning Zhuo's branch held important positions in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">With these positions, they could borrow the power of the Immortal Palace to help them hunt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"So, the Ning family branch also has some control over the Lava Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Discovering this point, Liu Zhen's assessment of the Ning family branch in his heart sharply rose to a whole new level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"The Ning family branch is refining artifacts on a large scale, running this business, the benefits will definitely not be poor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Jade Moistened Dark Steel... How did the Ning family branch suddenly have such large-scale cooperation with Jade Steel Mountain?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"The Ning family branch has considerable control over the Lava Immortal Palace, which allows them to stand firmly in the power structure. As long as these positions remain, they won't fall from their tier."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"In comparison, very few people in the Ning family main branch hold positions in the Immortal Palace. The contrast between the two is quite striking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"The Ning family branch is backed by Fire Persimmon Mountain, has obtained the foundation of the Zheng family, and has close relationships with other forces in the city. They are developing both quickly and steadily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Liu Zhen sighed with emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He was quite envious of Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">This is truly a man's foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"I'm much older than him, but compared to him, I've practically wasted all these years!" Liu Zhen thought of this and immediately felt somewhat dejected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Enduring his disappointment, he made the intelligence into a jade slip and first sent it out through the post station of the Southern Bean Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Afterwards, he set out with Sun Lie on the journey back to the Myriad Medicine Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
