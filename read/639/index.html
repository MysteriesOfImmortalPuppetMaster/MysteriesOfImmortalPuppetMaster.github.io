<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Forgetful River Crossing erupted in an uproar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"How did he get on first?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"He was supposed to be at the very back of the line!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Could this be the secret method to board the Void Return Raft? But how could such basic instructions achieve this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ghostly creatures and Soul Cultivators clamored, utterly baffled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The elder who had been guiding Sun Lingtong was momentarily stunned before bowing deeply to Yun Xiao's Reflection. "Thank you, Senior, for your great kindness and support. I am deeply grateful and will proclaim your benevolence and fairness for a lifetime!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">His words instantly silenced the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Though resentment and doubts lingered, they wisely held their tongues. The reason was simple: Yun Xiao's Reflection had promoted the elder. To question this was to oppose the Cloud Dao Reflection's decision!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Yun Xiao's Reflection remained impassive, merely waving his long sleeve again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In the next instant, Sun Lingtong vanished from the bank and reappeared on the Void Return Raft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Forgetful River Crossing erupted once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"What's happening?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"How did that little ghost get on?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Why is he allowed to board? He was just the one being helped!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">If not for the established rules, the Soul Cultivators and ghostly creatures would likely have stormed the Void Return Raft to attack the old man and the boy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This is outrageous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Void Return Raft only had ten spots, and two had already been taken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">It's important to note that over thirty people were currently queued at the Forgetful River Crossing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The limited slots for passage had caused many ghostly creatures and Soul Cultivators to nearly erupt in curses, shouting about backdoor dealings!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">As one of the affected parties, Sun Lingtong was utterly bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He approached the old man and uses his divine sense to ask, "Old man, what exactly is going on here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The old man winked at Sun Lingtong. "Actually, this is all thanks to you, Little Ghost. Consider this a debt I owe you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Huh?" Sun Lingtong is startled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Clearly, he was the one who had been guided and helped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The old man gazed deeply into Sun Lingtong's eyes. "Little Ghost, who were you in life? What kind of good deeds did you perform to accumulate such immense merit and light of purity?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"You're an exceptionally good person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Thus, even a small act of assistance from me is enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong's pupils constricted, his heart pounding. He quickly realizes the truth: How could he possibly be such a "good person"? Before joining the Void Sect, he'd spent his days stealing - how could he possess light of purity?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"It's the Qi given to me by Xiao Ning's mother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"She said it would help me enter the Forgetful River Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"So this Qi actually has such a great use!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Although he had figured it out, Sun Lingtong continued to feign ignorance, scratching his head. "I really don't understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The old man patted his shoulder. "Losing some memories after becoming a ghostly creature is perfectly normal. Don't worry if you can't figure it out. I said I owed you a favor, and I will definitely repay you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">As their divine senses communicated, Yun Xiao's Reflection waved his sleeves repeatedly, selecting eight more individuals to board the Void Return Raft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Cloud Dao Reflection gradually faded away, dissolving into the vast river mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Soul Cultivators and ghostly creatures left behind at the Forgetful River Crossing watched helplessly, or glared furiously, as the Void Return Raft drifted leisurely away. Many stared at Sun Lingtong and the old man, their throats bobbing as they opened their mouths to speak, yet none dared utter a single curse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">After all, they could still remain in line, waiting for their chance to cross later. If they cursed and angered the Cloud Dao Reflection, being expelled would mean losing this opportunity forever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Void Return Raft floated slowly on the surface of the Forgetful River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">It didn't resemble an ordinary boat, but rather a massive, frost-white crescent moon, slightly concave, or a withered yet veiny lotus petal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The bow and stern of the Void Return Raft curved naturally inward, its lines flowing yet carrying an aura of desolation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">It emitted an extremely faint, almost ethereal moon-white glow, forming a halo as thin as a cicada's wing yet infinitely resilient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong, unable to stay still, paced back and forth on the raft, touching and feeling its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He discovered that the material of the Void Return Raft was utterly peculiar, neither metal nor wood, neither stone nor jade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The body of the raft seemed woven from countless translucent, hair-thin glazed meridians. Within these meridians flowed a dim, star-like silver light, like frozen tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The substance filling the spaces between the meridians was beyond Sun Lingtong's experience; he couldn't identify it at all. It felt icy to the touch, yet its texture was unexpectedly resilient and stable. After enduring countless ages, it possessed both fragility and tenacity, reminding Sun Lingtong of moonlight - only this was condensed, frozen moonlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The entire raft was peerlessly exquisite, yet it radiated a profound, bone-deep loneliness and emptiness. Recalling the stories of Yun Xiao and Yue Yi, Sun Lingtong faintly understood the endless, irreparable loss that had consumed Yun Xiao's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The waters of the Forgetful River surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Countless ghosts drifted and struggled here, emitting silent screams and wails. When they saw the figures on the Void Return Raft, they surged forward, their faces twisted with despair and malice, desperate to drag others down with them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Soul Cultivators and ghostly creatures on the raft felt their tension grow. They knew all too well the dire consequences of being dragged into the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Adding to their unease, the raft itself felt insubstantial beneath their feet. A strange sensation of floating, as if treading on dense, icy mist, made them feel utterly unsteady.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The turbulent river surged around them, waves crashing against the raft's protective barrier and sending sprays of water into the air. Each impact shook the raft, causing the starlight and moonlight within its glazed meridians to shimmer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The silvery-white starlight and gentle moonlight intertwined, forming a steady shield that enveloped the raft's passengers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A swirling vortex, formed by the intermingling currents, trapped the Void Return Raft. For a moment, the raft circled helplessly in place, causing the passengers' faces to pale with growing anxiety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Fortunately, the vortex soon dissipated, and the raft resumed its journey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">A yin wind whipped across the surface of the Forgetful River, its waters crashing and roaring, mingled with the anguished cries of drowning ghosts. Yet within the raft, a profound silence prevailed, a stark contrast to the chaos outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This silence, however, was oppressive, like a deathly stillness that made everyone distinctly uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The longer they remained, the deeper the sorrow that permeated their hearts, growing increasingly heavy. At the same time, they felt a profound emptiness, as if a void had opened within them, stripping away all meaning and purpose, leaving everything utterly devoid of vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Past regrets and the pain of loss loomed larger in their minds, yet there was no one to confide in, tormenting them relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Forgetful River stretched endlessly, and their sense of time became blurred. It might have been only the time it takes an incense stick to burn, or it might have been a thousand years. Around them swirled boundless yin winds, turbid waves, and vengeful souls. Only the Void Return Raft beneath their feet emitted a small, faint but steadfast glow, like the sole ark of salvation adrift in the abyss of despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Amidst this oppressive atmosphere, the raft trembled slightly, and the pale, moonlit glow surrounding it rapidly faded and vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The passengers above were astonished to discover that they had arrived at the Forgetful River Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Or, more precisely, at the city's foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Countless black pillars, unimaginably massive, like the fangs of primeval behemoths, pierced the murky waters of the Forgetful River, rising in twisted or straight lines toward the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Where the Void Return Raft docked, one could barely call it a "dock" - a few uneven, perilously slippery stone steps emerged from the pitch-black waterline, vanishing into the shadows cast by the towering pillars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The turbulent waves surged just below, their filthy spray nearly reaching the foot of the stone steps. The mournful wails of resentful souls mingled with the yin wind, echoing endlessly between the stone pillars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">As soon as Sun Lingtong stepped off the Void Return Raft, he was enveloped by the bone-chilling yin wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He climbed the stone steps with painstaking caution, each step fraught with peril.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The narrow, slippery steps offered no railing. To one side lay the surging, murky waters of the Forgetful River. The higher they ascended, the more tense the group grew, knowing that a single misstep could send them plummeting into the river's abyssal depths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">After passing the halfway mark, the yin wind grew fiercer, howling past them with a blade-like chill. Miasmic gray mist swirled around, draining both spirit and physical strength from those it touched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">As they drew closer to the Immortal City, signs of life increased. Lianas snaked across the path, threatening to entangle ankles, ensnaring even ghostly creatures and ethereal souls. Fossilized bones weathered into the stone crevices silently testified to the fate of those who had failed the climb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">When Sun Lingtong's group had set out, they numbered ten. By the time they reached the summit, only four remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong felt as if his limbs and bones were made of lead, his mind overwhelmed by terror, despair, and other negative emotions, leaving him utterly exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The old man kept his promise, intervening multiple times along the way to help Sun Lingtong ascend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">When they reached the massive city gates, Sun Lingtong collapsed onto the ground, too exhausted to move, gasping for breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The other three weren't much better off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The stone platform was wide and icy-cold. The walls of Forgetful River Immortal City towered like a colossal iron curtain descending from the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Rumble...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sensing the four newcomers, the heavy gates slowly creaked open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">At the very top of the gates hung the Karmic Mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The ancient bronze mirror, covered in a gray patina that seeped with reddish-purple hues, had a surface like murky mercury. Within, swirling gray sand emitted a ghastly green phosphorescence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">This was the Karmic Mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The four cultivators, either lying prone or sitting, panted as they stared at the mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">After a long silence, the first to recover stood and solemnly stepped toward the open gates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Buzz - !</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The bronze mirror suddenly vibrated, its resonant hum tearing through the stillness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">A piercing green light erupted from the mirror's surface, so intense it made their eyes ache.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Ugh..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Ghost Cultivator struck by the light screamed. Black-red flames erupted from his body, only to vanish like snow under the blazing sun beneath the mirror's green glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong and the others' pupils constricted in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The deceased Ghost Cultivator had possessed Golden Core cultivation, yet had been utterly defenseless against the mirror's light, weaker than a newborn infant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">And once activated, the Karmic Mirror showed no mercy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The azure pillar of light, having obliterated the first Ghost Cultivator, continued its relentless sweep, now targeting the elder who had been assisting Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The elder, who had been sitting, suddenly lowered his head as if an invisible mountain had descended upon his neck. Straining with all his might, he trembled violently, white steam rising from his body under the mirror's glare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong and the fourth Ghost Cultivator were observing the scene when, without warning, the azure pillar of light abruptly expanded, engulfing both of them in its radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Sun Lingtong's heart leapt into his throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In that instant, he felt utterly stripped bare, exposed in a frozen wasteland, every past sin laid bare and undeniable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Just as despair threatened to overwhelm him, the aura he carried erupted, enveloping his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This aura belonged to Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Under the azure light, the aura transformed into a majestic golden glow, intermingling with the azure-white radiance, rising like auspicious clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The once frigid, judgmental, and destructive azure light, now tempered by the golden glow and auspicious clouds, softened into a warm, gentle radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Sensing merit and purity, the Karmic Mirror's resonant hum mellowed, as if in acknowledgment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The elder transmitted his thoughts telepathically: "Heavens! Little Ghost, how many good deeds did you possibly perform in your lifetime?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He was barely holding on, so he secretly stole a few strands of Qi and added them to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The azure light shining on the two of them swiftly dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The remaining light still enveloped the fourth person, lingering for a moment before slowly fading away, leaving the severely wounded individual unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The old man looked at the fourth person with lingering fear, explaining to Sun Lingtong, "He failed, but his sins aren't deep. His life has been spared. Once he recovers, he can return the way he came, using the Void Return Raft to cross back to the other side of the river."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Sun Lingtong narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing the old man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The old man waved his hand apologetically. "My apologies, young friend. I've benefited from your kindness once again. I will repay you handsomely once we're inside the city."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Sun Lingtong hummed in acknowledgment and turned away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He walked ahead, the old man following behind. Thus, the old man and the youth passed through the city gates, officially entering the Forgetful River Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Meanwhile, on another route, the thunderous hoofbeats of an Underworld cavalry echoed as they marched in grand procession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The cavalrymen were ghostly creatures, their faces either green with fangs or red-haired with ghostly eyes. Yet the bone blade battle flags fluttering in the wind, the frosty crescent moon greatswords, the void-piercing spears compressed from talisman paper, and the black blood paper horses all revealed their true identity - the Qing-Jiao Army!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">After parting ways with Sun Lingtong and Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi, and the others set off for the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Their ability to transform into various ghostly creatures stemmed from a spell inherent to the Qing-Jiao Army, called Human-Ghost Visage. This spell allowed soldiers to fully assume either a human or a ghostly form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">However, their battle flags, weapons, and other equipment remained unaffected, leaving them vulnerable to detection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Fortunately, their chosen route was remote, and any scattered encounters with ghostly creatures or Soul Cultivators along the way proved inconsequential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Directly above us should be the sacrificial altar for the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual!" Following Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's instructions, Ning Zhuo arrived at the designated location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He and Qing Chi looked up to see dense black clouds overhead, occasionally streaked with scarlet flashes like lightning within thunderclouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Qing Chi felt stumped. "The altar is so high up. How will we reach it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Few members of the Qing-Jiao Army possessed the ability to fly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo, however, had already devised a solution during their march. "This is easy," he said. "We'll use the Ceremonial Barracks."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
