<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ban Ji's expression was grim, his anxiety barely concealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Ban Clan's Celestial Mechanism Chain had long foretold this event, prompting Ban Ji to begin preparations years ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He had devoted countless hours and immense effort to mastering both the saber and sword, honing his skills in these close-combat weapons while also developing formidable hand-to-hand combat abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">All this was for the Rising Cloud Minor Trial of the Ninefold Profound Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">For Ban Ji, the Profound Armor held far greater significance than for ordinary cultivators. It would be crucial in helping him weather each eruption of his Immortal Talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This much was obvious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"The more Bronze Artifacts I defeat now, the greater my rewards will be."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"If I can secure nine artifacts in the second stage, I'll claim first place outright."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"But that's too difficult. Based on my calculations, my limit is seven artifacts. I'll need to reach the third stage, seize Profound Armor from others, and gather nine in total to secure first place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">First place was Ban Ji's sole ambition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Even with Golden Core-level Body Cultivators and Martial Cultivators as rivals, Ban Ji remained confident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The three stages of the competition within the Profound Armor Cave largely suppressed cultivation levels, drastically narrowing the gap between Golden Core and Foundation Establishment cultivators and allowing for direct confrontation. Qi Refining Stage cultivators participating in the Minor Trial would receive enhancements from the formation, ensuring that the competition emphasized martial techniques and divine sense over cultivation level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo's arrival weighed heavily on Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ban Ji had carefully considered his strategy: "I handled the first two rounds alone, so I definitely have an advantage. I'll only face Ning Zhuo in the third round."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"By then, I'll teach Ning Zhuo a lesson he'll never forget. I'll seize all his Profound Armor, pushing me closer to collecting nine pieces and claiming first place!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Until then, I need to gather as much Profound Armor as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">It was clear that the more Profound Armor a cultivator refined and mastered, the greater their advantage in the third round, and the higher their chances of securing first place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ban Ji's initial plan was to acquire a Bronze Sword and Bronze Saber in the early clashes. These were his favored weapons, allowing him to unleash combined sword-and-saber techniques that fully showcased his personal combat prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">But now, he had already obtained his third Bronze Artifact, yet he hadn't even glimpsed a single sword or saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Well, throwing knives are technically blades... bullshit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ban Ji was deeply frustrated and utterly perplexed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"This shouldn't be happening."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"According to common sense, swords and sabers are the most common weapons. Even if they appear randomly, their numbers should be the highest and their appearance the most frequent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">It was precisely for this reason that Ban Ji had chosen the saber and sword as his primary weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He glared at the throwing knives and chain mace in his hands, his anger burning like a physical ache. Both were considered unorthodox weapons. Glancing at the wolf-toothed mace before him, eager to be wielded, he found himself speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"I hope the fourth and fifth Bronze Artifacts contain a saber and sword."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"But the Bronze Artifacts in the second trial become increasingly difficult to obtain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"If I can't fully unleash my combat potential, I'll never reach the later stages. My absolute limit is seven weapons, and I definitely won't reach that this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This meant Ban Ji had only three chances left: the fourth, fifth, and sixth Bronze Artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo faced the Bronze Saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Hmm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In the next instant, the saber sliced through the air, thrusting straight at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The saber tip moved with ruler-straight precision, a textbook thrust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo flicked his wrist, and the Bronze Sword in his hand met the attack head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Clang! A crisp, metallic ring echoed as sparks flew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Bronze Sword's tip struck the saber's point with flawless accuracy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo himself lacked such pinpoint precision, but the fundamental sword techniques embedded within the Bronze Sword corrected his movements, ensuring each strike was executed with perfect form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Although Ning Zhuo possessed a vast repertoire of sword techniques from various cultivators, these skills were not truly his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Significant discrepancies existed between these inherited experiences and his personal capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">For instance, physical attributes varied greatly. Some cultivators had longer arms, others were taller, some possessed greater stamina, while others wielded superior strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Furthermore, temperament played a crucial role. Faced with the same technique, some favored defense, others prioritized evasion, while still others preferred to use offense as their best defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Therefore, experience remained just that - experience. For Ning Zhuo, its applicability varied greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Moreover, these inherited experiences often clashed with one another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This was why Ning Zhuo needed time to transform and assimilate these techniques, to digest this treasure trove of knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Such practical combat proved particularly transformative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">In close-quarters combat, the transitions between offense and defense were lightning-fast. A moment's lapse in focus could expose a fatal weakness, leading to bitter defeat. Ning Zhuo had to maintain absolute concentration, leaving no time for conscious deliberation. His choices - whether to evade, parry, or prepare a counterattack - arose instinctively, rooted in his very nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This forced him to rapidly filter through the myriad options offered by his inherited experiences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The rebounding force traveled along the Bronze Sword's blade, surging through Ning Zhuo's arm and into his shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo retreated swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Bronze Sword moved a step ahead of Ning Zhuo, guiding his wrist to twist and redirect the rebounding force along its blade, channeling the energy outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Simultaneously, it blocked the Bronze Saber's second attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Once again, the Bronze Sword provided Ning Zhuo with crucial assistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Had he relied solely on his own skills, Ning Zhuo would have been unable to evade the saber's follow-up strikes and would inevitably have been wounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Bronze Sword reacted autonomously in combat, responding with lightning speed and executing the correct countermeasure before Ning Zhuo could even process the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This precise response etched itself into Ning Zhuo's mind, his eyes gleaming with understanding. "I've learned something!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">It was as if a master swordsman were guiding his hand, teaching him practical combat techniques with every breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Bronze Sword deflected the Bronze Saber's subsequent attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The saber's blade smoothly transitioned from a thrust to a sweeping motion, arcing toward Ning Zhuo's ankle. The transition between techniques was seamless, executed with fluid precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo's pupils constricted slightly as he hastily retreated, leaping backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His hurried jump left him hunched mid-air, his upper body leaning forward. This movement caused the Bronze Sword to create a fleeting curtain of blades for defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Bronze Sword assisted in refining his technique, helping Ning Zhuo better deflect the treacherous saber strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Still, a thin slit was torn in his pant leg, and the hairs on Ning Zhuo's calf stood on end as a chilling draft swept across his skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Before Ning Zhuo could regain his footing, the Bronze Saber struck again, clinging to him like a shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The saber unleashed a series of rapid strikes, forming a seamless combo:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Wave-Breaking Triple Blade!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The first strike was overwhelmingly heavy. Ning Zhuo braced his sword horizontally, his arm trembling and numb as he retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The second strike shifted from a downward slash to a diagonal thrust, the saber's edge darting like a viper's tongue, angling low to sweep toward Ning Zhuo's flank. Forced to raise his guard after the initial block, Ning Zhuo exposed his left ribs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Just as the blade threatened to pierce him, Ning Zhuo twisted his body in a desperate maneuver, the saber's spine narrowly scraping past his waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Shriek! The hem of his robe tore, and a thin line of blood appeared on his side where the blade had grazed him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The third strike transitioned into a rolling thrust, leveraging the momentum of his twisting motion to stab toward Ning Zhuo's right shoulder with lightning speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The evasive maneuver had thrown Ning Zhuo off balance, making this final strike impossible to dodge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">In the next instant, blood sprayed as the saber carved a deep gash into his shoulder, exposing bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo swiftly transferred the Bronze Sword to his left hand, unleashing a flurry of defensive strikes with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Guided by the Bronze Sword, his parries, deflections, and counter-thrusts flowed seamlessly, blocking the Bronze Saber's follow-up attacks with textbook precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Yet searing pain radiated from his right shoulder, and blood rapidly stained Ning Zhuo's robe crimson.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo's realization was profound: "The Bronze Sword only taught basic sword techniques, but the Bronze Saber takes it to another level. It's not just about basic saber techniques; the strikes are faster, the transitions between moves are smoother, and there are even combos!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The three basic saber techniques he had just faced formed a small combo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The chop, collision, and thrust flowed seamlessly together, each strike building upon the previous one, the rhythm shifting abruptly to anticipate Ning Zhuo's reactions and inflict maximum damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The sensation was akin to being struck by three consecutive waves, leaving him no room to breathe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The wound on his right shoulder had already stopped bleeding on its own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The searing pain from the saber cut was also rapidly subsiding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with sharp focus. The vividness of his recent experience had brought his past memories surging to life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Images of countless Demonic Cultivators wielding saber techniques and facing saber attacks flooded his mind, merging into an indescribable, overwhelming insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Time continued to flow. Having weathered the initial onslaught, Ning Zhuo found his footing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">His close-quarters sword skills rapidly adapted to the higher-level opponent, allowing him to trade blows evenly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">A familiar pattern began to unfold before the watching Cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"He's learning in real-time again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"His progress is truly visible to the naked eye."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"I get it now!" A cultivator suddenly clapped his palm against his fist. "That's why he took first place in the Confucian cultivator's Minor Trials twice! It must be his incredible learning ability!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">This remark immediately resonated with many others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Exactly. Chu Xuangui's Minor Trial was about calligraphy imitation. The more skilled a Confucian scholar was in calligraphy, the greater their disadvantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Meanwhile, Song Taosheng directly taught the 'Head Hanging' and 'Thigh Pricking' spells in the Temple of Literature - both learning methods. This perfectly suited Ning Zhuo's strengths!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Some cultivators also noticed his physical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"His physical foundation is remarkably strong. I've rarely seen such a powerful physique in the Foundation Establishment Stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"I suspect that in addition to cultivating the Five Elements Technique, he's also cultivating the Lower Dantian Essence Sea. In fact, he might be feinting with the Five Elements Technique while primarily cultivating the Essence Sea and only secondarily cultivating the Qi Sea!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Some cultivators nodded in agreement, while others shook their heads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"That possibility can't be ruled out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Ning Zhuo has powerful backing. A genius like him, even if he doesn't primarily cultivate the Essence Sea, would certainly have ample methods and secret techniques to enhance his physical foundation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Just imagine Situ Xing and Ban Ji - these individuals are the public faces of major powers in the Foundation Establishment Stage. Any aspects their primary cultivation arts neglect are supplemented with various secret techniques, though at a steep price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">As the cultivators discussed, Ning Zhuo suddenly thrust forward, his sword tip striking the Bronze Saber and knocking it to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This was an excellent opportunity to subdue the saber, but Ning Zhuo didn't seize the advantage. Instead, he retreated a step, maintaining his stance with his sword at the ready, fully alert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Seeing this, some cultivators sighed. "Here he goes again! Ning Zhuo isn't even nervous; he's still trying to learn on the fly. At this rate, he'll definitely end up in last place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Others recognized Ning Zhuo's strategy. "I think he's made the right choice. Imagine if he had rushed to refine the Bronze Sword earlier. Would his close combat skills have improved? He probably would have been defeated by the Bronze Saber's simple combo just now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"True," someone interjected. "This is a steady, methodical approach. Ning Zhuo, as a top-tier genius, clearly has his own plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"But if he keeps this up, he'll never catch up to the others. He might even be eliminated in the second stage due to lack of time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Sigh, let's just hope he knows what he's doing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Though the cultivators had only just met Ning Zhuo, they naturally favored such a righteous figure. More importantly, they eagerly anticipated a clash between Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji - missing such a spectacle would be a true pity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">While Ning Zhuo remained immersed in practical combat learning, the other Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators were widening the gap between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Facing the Bronze Saber, Zhang Wangxing burst into wild laughter, utterly fearless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He pounded his chest. "Come on, strike me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Bronze Saber struck his body, but his flesh, as soft as mud and seemingly boneless, collapsed inward, instantly engulfing the blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">As the saber's momentum waned, it tried to withdraw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Zhang Wangxing seized the hilt with both hands, gripping it with a death grip. Simultaneously, his arms melted into flowing flesh, enveloping the blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Bronze Saber struggled violently, convulsing within Zhang Wangxing's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Heh heh, heh heh, heh heh...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Zhang Wangxing's face paled as he endured wave after wave of excruciating pain, yet his grin widened, his laughter growing more maniacal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Bronze Saber's attacks rapidly weakened, and soon, Zhang Wangxing had refined it completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Zhang Wangxing cultivated the Flesh Transformation Sutra, granting him profound mastery over his own flesh. He could manipulate it into bizarre and violent transformations, simultaneously shifting his bones and internal organs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"The Rising Cloud Minor Trial of the Ninefold Profound Armor is nothing more than this! Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Having claimed three Bronze Artifacts, Zhang Wangxing surpassed Ban Ji's pace, surging to the top of the Foundation Establishment cultivators in the arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Wave-Breaking Triple Blade!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The Bronze Saber's momentum surged anew, unleashing a rapid series of strikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo's gaze sharpened. Instead of retreating, he advanced, his Bronze Sword trembling slightly as he met the first heavy downward slash with an upward diagonal cut.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Amidst the ear-splitting clash, Ning Zhuo refused to yield. The Bronze Sword in his hand grazed the saber's blade at a precise angle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The force of the impact surged through Ning Zhuo's arm and shoulder. Fully absorbing the momentum, he channeled it into a counter-strike, neutralizing the saber's power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The first strike of the Wave-Breaking Triple Blade exhausted its force. Ning Zhuo seized the brief pause between the first and second strikes, disrupting the saber's momentum entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">His eyes blazed with intensity as the Bronze Sword moved with lightning speed, forcing the Bronze Saber into a series of retreats. Each time the saber attempted to retaliate, Ning Zhuo redirected its force, twisting the blade into a series of contortions until it was as weak as a paper wall, utterly devoid of its earlier ferocity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The Bronze Saber clattered to the ground for the thirty-second time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Unlike before, Ning Zhuo stepped on the saber's blade, channeling massive amounts of divine sense and spiritual energy into it, directly refining the artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">He bent down and lifted the Bronze Saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Left saber, right sword!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">His breathing gradually slowed from rapid gasps to measured breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Sweat trickled down his cheek, dripping onto the blades of both weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">He couldn't help but think of Ban Ji. Could I emulate Ban Ji's dual-wielding techniques, combining the saber and sword into a single, devastating strike? If so, I'd have another means to counter him in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Meanwhile, elsewhere...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ban Ji dragged his Bronze Mace forward, his face dark with frustration. "Swords and sabers! Swords and sabers!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Before him lay a pair of nunchaku.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"I..." Ban Ji's eye twitched uncontrollably, his face flushing crimson with rage.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
