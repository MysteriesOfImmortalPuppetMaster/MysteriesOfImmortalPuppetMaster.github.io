<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“Ha, you think I’d believe you?” Han Ming sneered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo’s voice turned cold. “Since you won’t cooperate willingly, I can only use force.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">As he spoke, Ning Zhuo took out some tools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">These were mechanical needles with differing length and thickness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“What are you planning to do to me?” Seeing Hanging-Hair Traveler walking toward her step by step, Han Ming began to panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo tried to speak as gently as he could. “Some of these mechanical needles are a little thick, so you might feel a bit of pain. Just bear with it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">More than a dozen mechanical puppets, each carrying a few mechanical needles, quickly scaled Han Ming’s body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“You old villain, just kill me… AH!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Han Ming’s body trembled all over as she threw back her head and screamed. Her shrill cries echoed chillingly in the prison cell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">A while later, dozens of mechanical needles had been inserted all over her body. They were stabbed into various joints, acupuncture points, and even at the front and back of her head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The thin needles were fine, but some of the thicker needles had blood oozing out around them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and activated the secret technique to control the needles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The various mechanical needles rose and fell continuously under his control. Some drilled deeper into her body, while others whirred outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“AAAAHH!!” Han Ming screamed again, loud enough to pierce a bystander’s eardrums.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Her body twisted violently in agony, and her slender fingers tightly squeezed the cold iron chain. It wasn’t long before her fingertips started bleeding due to squeezing with excessive force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But this pain was nothing compared to the pain caused by the needles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo concentrated with all his might and activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his divine sea!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">This treasure seal stood like a great mountain in his divine sea. The demon engraving on one end began emitting a red, demonic light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The same demonic light soon appeared on the various mechanical needles that were penetrating Han Ming’s body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">A moment later, a pink heart seal shot out from Ning Zhuo’s body and flew into Han Ming’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Han Ming’s screams gradually ceased, and a strong sense of terror filled her mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">She discovered that her body was no longer under her control, and it was circulating the Nine-Turns Soul Devouring Incantation all on its own!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“No, no!” Han Ming’s pupils shrank to pinpoints, but she couldn’t stop herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Soon, the technique began drawing out her soul essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">At this moment, Ning Zhuo released his hold on her and tossed out the Soul Capturing Shuttle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The shuttle didn’t fall to the ground; instead, Han Ming controlled it to slowly float in front of her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Then, the tip of the Soul Capturing Shuttle gently pierced her chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Soul Capturing Shuttle began using its power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Han Ming had never expected that she would have a day like this!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">She had killed thousands of people with the Soul Capturing Shuttle and brought disaster to countless more. But today, that very weapon was now being used against its master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">And the one wielding the shuttle was none other than herself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Soul Capturing Shuttle trembled slightly, and the pure soul essence that Han Ming had accumulated throughout her lifetimes was gradually sucked away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">As the soul essence entering the Soul Capturing Shuttle gradually approached full capacity, the entire shuttle began shining with a faint cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Soon, the Soul Capturing Shuttle was completely filled up and returned to Ning Zhuo’s control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Han Ming’s complexion was deathly pale, and her body slumped down as if she had lost all her bones. The only reason she remained standing was because her wrists, shoulders, and other parts were chained to the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“What did you just do to me? What kind of trick was that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Han Ming looked up and stared at Ning Zhuo in horror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Are you from the Phantom Sect? Was that the Soul-Enchanting Grand Magic just now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Or are you a person of the Gu Bewitchment Church? Did you use a gu on me?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“No, none of those are right…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Her whole body was shaking, and her very heart trembled. All her confidence and self-assurance had completely disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Beneath the Iron Will Gray Armor’s mask, blood was already leaking from Ning Zhuo’s nose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Buddha Heart Demon Seal, a Buddha to the self and a demon to others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">If he used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal by itself, targets of the same level could be directly influenced, but usually only for a moment. If he was facing someone with a higher level of cultivation, the seal’s power was even more limited; he could only use it to guide the target’s thinking and not directly tamper with their mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But if other means were used to assist, like those mechanical needles, the seal’s effectiveness would greatly increase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Just now, Ning Zhuo had used the heart seal to give Han Ming an order – “Use the Nine Turns Soul Devouring Incantation and pass on your soul foundation to the person in front of you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">With the help of the mechanical needles, Han Ming had indeed followed this order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Her own lack of willingness didn’t matter at all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“In the mechanical arts secret records that my mother left behind, there were more kinds of control rods – the 十-head control rod, the 干-head control rod, and the 王-head control rod. Unfortunately, my cultivation is too shallow and can’t use these more powerful control rods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“For the time being, I can only use these 一-head control rods.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo’s mother was a mechanical arts cultivator, and Ning Zhuo’s accomplishments in mechanical arts mostly originated from her mechanical arts secret records.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Hanging wires and control rods were the two mainstream methods of controlling mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Just now, Ning Zhuo had treated Han Ming as a mechanical construct and controlled her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Of course, by themselves, even 王-shaped control rods wouldn’t be so effective. The only way would be if Ning Zhuo’s cultivation level far surpassed Han Ming’s, or his mechanical arts skills were hundreds of times stronger than their current level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This qualitative leap in efficacy was all thanks to the Buddha Heart Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This combination was something that Ning Zhuo had gradually discovered on his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The advantages of this method were obvious. However, there was a disadvantage – the target would quickly perish, making them a limited-use item.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo wasn’t in a hurry to absorb the soul essence and instead carefully checked on Han Ming’s injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Your cultivation technique is excellent, and many parts of your body have successfully zombified. This means you can last longer. Good, very good.” Ning Zhuo’s voice was full of praise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Hearing these words, Han Ming couldn’t hold on any longer. Her anger rushed to her head, and she fainted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Meanwhile…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Meng Chong rushed back to the City Lord Mansion. He ran to the cultivation room, not wasting a moment before beginning to disperse his power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Super-grade innate talent—Ferocious Rushing Thunder!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Lightning crackled on his body, and his essence, qi, and spirit plummeted rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Using lightning to disperse his power was amazingly effective!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Eyes full of lightning, Meng Chong shouted in surprise, “At this rate, all my magical power will disappear by the time tomorrow comes! I’ll be able to start recultivating!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“I see, I get it now!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Ferocious Rushing Thunder is my greatest asset. From now on, I will be bold and fearless, rushing forward without worrying about anything else!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Meng Chong was immersed in the joy of a breakthrough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He discovered that the more he rushed forward singlemindedly, the stronger his Ferocious Rushing Thunder became, and even his control over it improved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Sure enough, as long as I express my innate nature, my innate talent will become stronger and stronger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Old Sun, you’re so awesome. Hahaha!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">In the underground prison cell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo ignored the unconscious Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He went to the neighboring room and got out of his armor. Holding the Soul Capturing Shuttle in his hand, he gently pressed it to his skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The next moment, a stream of cool, pure, and gentle soul power flowed out of the Soul Capturing Shuttle and into his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo’s pupils expanded as he took a step backward. An extremely comfortable feeling filled his body and mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">It was like jumping into a cool lake during the hottest day of summer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">His soul foundation rose rapidly, soon exceeding his sixteen years of accumulation. At this point, the power of his soul had already doubled!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">And yet, only half of the soul essence in the Soul Capturing Shuttle had been consumed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">A few breaths later, the Soul Capturing Shuttle was emptied out, and the previously faint cold light completely disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Refreshing, too refreshing.” Ning Zhuo felt extremely comfortable, better than ever before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Then, he noticed something strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He felt as if his left arm was slightly warm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"What's going on?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Just like Meng Chong, he was surprised and happy. “My left arm is heating up. Did something trigger my innate talent? Is it starting to manifest itself?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo became anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">If he could find the triggering condition, he could continue to cultivate this innate talent and make it fully manifest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“What’s the condition?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Is it because I absorbed pure soul essence?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Or is it because I dealt with a demonic cultivator, punishing evil and upholding justice in the world?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
