<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Family Ancestral Land.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">In the cultivation chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Ning Family Patriarch sat within a massive block of ice, meditating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">In his arms, a pot-shaped magical treasure emitted a layer of pure white light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The ice block gradually melted away until it was completely gone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Ning Family Patriarch slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a breath of turbid air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He then reached out to touch his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Even now, there was still a dent on his head, though it was no longer as pronounced as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Ning Family Patriarch's heart was filled with anger and hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">To him, this had been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He had already entered the Lava Immortal Palace and was waiting for the right moment to enter the side hall when the External Peach Fate Core descended from the sky, severely injuring him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Ning Family Patriarch was well aware of Meng Kui's Sitting Mountain Observation Technique and the External Peach Fate Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After being heavily injured by the peach core, the Ning Family Patriarch could only flee, abandoning the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Just like that, the excellent situation was completely ruined by Meng Kui!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Meng Kui is truly overbearing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"The Lava Immortal Palace was originally an ownerless treasure, left for those with fate energy. Everyone should have a chance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"My Ning Family was already a latecomer. This time, we were fortunate enough to enter the side hall, but Meng Kui couldn't even tolerate that and destroyed it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Perhaps in his heart, the Lava Immortal Palace has long been his possession."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"He doesn't allow anyone else to touch it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Ning Family Patriarch caressed the Ice Heart Jade Pot, gradually calming his emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Ice Heart Jade Pot was the Ning Family's treasured heirloom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The entire pot was meticulously carved from a single piece of translucent cold jade, its body crystal clear, like a pristine ice lake, emitting a faint cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">When the Ning Family Patriarch touched the pot, he never felt a bone-chilling cold, but rather a jade-like warmth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Ning Family Patriarch pondered the current situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Meng Kui is at the Nascent Soul Stage and is also the City Lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"His reason for sealing the volcano's mouth is legitimate and grandiose. If I want to enter the Immortal Palace, I must disguise myself. But once disguised, I lose my righteous identity and will be shamelessly targeted by Meng Kui."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Sigh, in this case..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Our family's greatest hope still lies in the competition at the Qi Refining Stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"But in the Qi Refining Stage competition, can Ning Xiaohui really contend with Meng Chong?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Thinking of Meng Chong's innate talent, the Ning Family Patriarch felt a heavy heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He couldn't help but speculate: Has Meng Chong already reached the latter stages? Is he close to the finish line?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Touching the dent on his forehead again, the Ning Family Patriarch's gaze became resolute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"It seems I must increase support for the family's reformation team."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">After a moment of contemplation, the Ning Family Patriarch immediately gave orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Xiaohui was the first to know this good news in the reformation team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Oh? The Patriarch personally ordered the retrieval of the Frostless and Proud Thunder Comprehension Diagram, and also activated three bottles of White Snow Spring Pills to be distributed to the entire reformation team. He even plans to take out the Ice Jade Wine from the Ice Heart Jade Pot to reward the most outstanding cultivators in the reformation team?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Hehe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Xiaohui glanced at her hands and sneered, "Reward the most outstanding? Why not just give it to me directly, it's purely redundant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Since experiencing a life-and-death crisis, Ning Xiaohui's mindset had grown significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Later, with her grandmother's help, she initially mastered the Innate Ice Jade Hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">During this process, the power of the Ice Jade Hand completely healed Ning Xiaohui's injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">As a result, Ning Xiaohui, as a latecomer, surpassed the Zhou Family twins and Zheng Jian of the Zheng Family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">While the latter three were still recovering, Ning Xiaohui had already begun special training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo returned to the family residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Along the way, he smiled and greeted familiar clan members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">After disarming Cheng Bai and briefly conversing with Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo hurried back in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">At this critical moment, he had to quickly return to the public eye to prevent Han Ming from being captured and revealing that she had seen Yuan Dasheng's corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">On the surface, it was Ning Zhuo who obtained Yuan Dasheng's corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Even though there was no evidence linking Ning Zhuo and Chui Xu Ke, even if Ning Zhuo was investigated, he had various excuses, such as selling it on the black market or the corpse being stolen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">However, this would indeed implicate Ning Zhuo's true identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">To prepare for a possible investigation, Ning Zhuo couldn't stay in the underground base for long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Family Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Little Zhuo, you're finally back. The whole city was in chaos yesterday, with conflicts breaking out everywhere. Are you hurt anywhere?" Wang Lan hurried over, concerned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly, "Aunt, don't worry. Since the assassination attempt, I've been very cautious. Besides, I have the family's assigned guards protecting me, nothing will happen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"That's good, that's good." Wang Lan suddenly sighed, "Sigh, you're safe, but your uncle is in trouble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"The prisoner in the neighboring cell suddenly went mad. Just because of a minor argument, he grabbed your uncle's hair and kept smashing his head against the bars."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Your uncle's head is bleeding profusely and he urgently needs a good environment to recover."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Little Zhuo, please go and plead with the Young Patriarch again, ask him to release your uncle!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo's face darkened, showing a look of sorrow, and he sighed, "Aunt, I didn't know such a thing happened!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Uncle has truly suffered this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"But I already pleaded with the Young Patriarch last time. This time, the chances of success are very slim."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Unless..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Aunt, unless you can fully compensate me for all the cultivation resources I've been deprived of over the years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"This..." Wang Lan's face immediately changed color, her brows furrowing deeply, her expression full of difficulty, and a surge of anger rising fiercely in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">She roared internally, "That Ning Xiaohui never provided any cultivation resources; the truth is far from what he's saying." But she could only roar in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Little Zhuo, to be honest, your uncle's family has very thin resources. The daily expenses are too high, and there's basically no surplus. It's simply unrealistic for me to give you everything at once."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo interrupted her, "Aunt, I still need to cultivate. You should at least return a part of it first. You haven't returned anything yet." Unwilling to entangle with Wang Lan any further, Ning Zhuo politely declined and then plunged into the cultivation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He activated the Floating Cloud Technique, using layers of floating clouds to conceal himself, and then took out the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng and the Golden Blood Battle Ape mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The former, after a fierce battle, was left with only a skeleton.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">If it weren't for Yuan Dasheng's display of immortal talent, even the skeleton would have been burned to ashes by the Nether Fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo inspected the skeleton and found that the material was still the same as before, but it had become much more fragile than it initially was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Is it because it bore the Righteous Bone Golden Firmness?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He had always been puzzled about how Yuan Dasheng could display the Righteous Bone Golden Firmness within the Tree Martial Ape and planned to gather some related texts to study in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">With the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng nearly completely destroyed, Ning Zhuo took out the Golden Blood Battle Ape mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Divine Ability Prototypeâ€”Life Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He repeated his old trick, extracting Yuan Dasheng's spirit from the Tree Martial Ape skeleton and placing it into the Golden Blood Battle Ape mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Yuan Dasheng's spirit has undergone a significant change!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">As soon as he extracted it, Ning Zhuo noticed the difference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Previously, Yuan Dasheng's spirit was like a pink light ball, with the surface occasionally morphing into the shape of a young monkey's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Now, Yuan Dasheng's spirit, though still a pink light ball, was more than three times larger than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The monkey head image it morphed into was no longer that of a young monkey but an adult one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The lines outlining the adult monkey head were more profound and lifelike than the previous young monkey head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Moreover, when suspended in mid-air, Yuan Dasheng's spirit ball was now surrounded by a layer of halo, a feature that hadn't existed before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">From this point, Ning Zhuo quickly recalled the related records in "On Spirits."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"This halo is called Spirit Radiance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"When the spirit is abundant enough to overflow, reaching a certain level, Spirit Radiance will be produced."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"As the spirit continues to grow, the Spirit Radiance will become more and more intense, interacting with all things, communicating and discerning them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"So, Yuan Dasheng has already entered the Intelligent Spirit Stage!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">According to the classification of spirit states:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The first stage is the Non-Spirit Stage, the second is the Dead Spirit Stage, the third is the Living Spirit Stage, the fourth is the Intelligent Spirit Stage, and the fifth is the Divine Spirit Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Dead Spirit Stage is subdivided into five phases, and so is the Living Spirit Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">From low to high, the Living Spirit Stage is divided into Spirit Star, Spirit Lively, Spirit Long, Spirit Active, and Spirit Sensitive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Previously, Yuan Dasheng's spirit had reached the Spirit Active phase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In this phase, the spirit is lively and active, strongly influenced by emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">According to Ning Zhuo's research, as long as one commands in accordance with the spirit, one can achieve complete control again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">After the Spirit Active phase is the Spirit Sensitive phase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Now it seems that Yuan Dasheng has skipped the Spirit Sensitive phase and directly advanced to the first phase of the Intelligent Spirit Stageâ€”Spirit Communication."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"The Living Spirit Stage is also called the Beast Spirit, following instincts. The Intelligent Spirit Stage's spirit, however, is a wisdom spirit. The first major qualitative change it undergoes is the ability to communicate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"This is why Yuan Dasheng can speak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The first phase of the Intelligent Spirit Stage, Spirit Communication, means that the spirit can start normal communication with its surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo placed Yuan Dasheng's spirit into the Golden Blood Battle Ape but did not rush to communicate with him, instead putting him back into the storage bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Under the heavy cover of floating clouds, Ning Zhuo took out the cultivation manual and began his daily practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, sixth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, fifth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Demonic Blood Vein Technique, fifth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"My cultivation is still too weak, too weak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"This time, defeating Cheng Bai mainly relied on Meng Kui's peach core and my years of accumulation. When will I be able to defeat strong enemies with my own cultivation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"What other methods can make me cultivate faster?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"I need to cultivate faster; I need to become stronger!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Having just gone through a life-and-death battle, Ning Zhuo's desire for cultivation was ten times stronger than before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Meanwhile, in another part of the Ning family territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Peak of the third layer of Qi Refining, Ice Fat Jade Hand! With just these two points, who among Zhou Zhu, Zhou Zeshen, and Zheng Jian can be my enemy?" Ning Xiaohui's face was full of pride.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">This was because the talents of Zheng Jian and the others were not aggressive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The Ice Fat Jade Hand was different!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Xiaohui unfolded two scrolls, carefully examining them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"With my Ice Fat Jade Hand, I have a natural affinity in this aspect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"As long as I comprehend the Frost and Proud Snow techniques, I will be like a tiger with wings!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"By then, only Meng Chong can be considered my strong enemy. The others are not worth worrying about."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
