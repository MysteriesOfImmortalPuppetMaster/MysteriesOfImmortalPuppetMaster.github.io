<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Nearly twenty strands of Golden Core-level Void Spider Silk per day from a single spider? That production rate seems a bit exaggerated," Ning Zhuo thought, even though he wasn't particularly familiar with Void Spiders. Judging solely by market value, the claim still struck him as unbelievable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Could it be that this spider possesses some innate talent that accelerates its silk production?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo dismissed the wild speculation, knowing it would be inappropriate to pry further during their first meeting. Asking such a question would be considered rude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He chose to believe Che Zhuzi. There was no apparent reason for the man to lie, and someone as shrewd as Che Zhuzi, who had thrived in the Myriad Manifestations Sect for so long, must value his business reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"In that case, I'll order sixty strands to start," Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Che Zhuzi hadn't yet grasped the scale of this potential deal, still wearing a smug smile. "What quality are you looking for?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In his mind, Ning Zhuo was a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator who would naturally use Foundation Establishment-level materials. Of course, if quantity was the priority, it wouldn't be unusual for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to opt for Qi Refining-level materials instead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Golden Core-level, naturally," Ning Zhuo replied calmly. "If your spider can produce Nascent Soul-level silk at a reasonable price, I'll buy that too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Naturally, if higher-grade materials were available, he would use them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Che Zhuzi's eyes widened in surprise, his expression shifting slightly as he stared at Ning Zhuo. "Sixty Golden Core-level Void Spider Silk strands - are you certain?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo nodded. "Absolutely. This is the deposit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">With that, he produced a Ghost Path Golden Core and handed it directly to Che Zhuzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"A... a Golden Core?!" Che Zhuzi's eyes widened further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo had demonstrated both his wealth and his power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">A Golden Core... Che Zhuzi himself was only a Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Which Foundation Establishment cultivator would offer a Golden Core as a mere deposit?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Chewing on this, Che Zhuzi desperately wanted to ask Ning Zhuo, "Who exactly are you? Where does your family come from?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">His assessment of Ning Zhuo's status skyrocketed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Forcing himself to remain calm, Che Zhuzi replied with feigned nonchalance, "Sixty Golden Core-grade Void Spider Silk strands? This Golden Core would more than cover the full price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo frowned slightly, then apologized, "Ah, Senior Che Zhuzi, my apologies for not being clearer! I meant sixty strands per month."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Che Zhuzi lost his composure, staring at Ning Zhuo in disbelief. "Sixty strands per month? Are you certain? For how long?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo shrugged slightly. "Let's start with a year's contract, shall we?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Che Zhuzi's brow furrowed, his mind racing. Although my production has skyrocketed seventeenfold, I can't sustain this level of output indefinitely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Producing seventeen strands of Golden Core-level spider silk daily would be utterly exhausting. Over time, it would drain my vital essence, damage my Origin, and even harm my foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">To produce sixty strands of Void Spider Silk per month at full capacity would take at least four days. But realistically, I can't operate at full capacity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">At normal production levels, it would take six days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">How many six-day periods are there in a month?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Che Zhuzi felt trapped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo wasn't his only client; in fact, Ning Zhuo was a newcomer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Che Zhuzi had long-standing business relationships with other buyers, his production comfortably meeting their needs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">But now, Ning Zhuo had forcefully inserted himself into the market, outbidding everyone else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Seeing Che Zhuzi deep in thought, Ning Zhuo decisively raised the stakes. "Senior Che Zhuzi, do you find the deposit insufficient? No problem, I can add more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">With that, he produced another Ghost Path Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Che Zhuzi's heart jolted again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo produced the Golden Core as casually as if it were an ordinary Medicinal Pill, his demeanor far too relaxed and nonchalant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"With such deep pockets, he'll definitely be a major client in the future!" Che Zhuzi's heart raced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Interrupted from his thoughts, Che Zhuzi might have been annoyed before, but now he forced a fawning smile and hastily replied, "Two Golden Cores as a deposit are more than enough - more than enough!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo was even more decisive, immediately urging, "Then let's sign the contract first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Under Lady Spiderweb's watchful gaze, the two smoothly finalized the agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"I'll take my leave now, Senior Che Zhuzi," Ning Zhuo said, turning to depart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This was a substantial deal with even greater potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Che Zhuzi quickly called out, "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, no need to rush. We've hit it off so well - why not let me prepare some fine wine for us to share?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo tilted his head. "I have other matters to attend to. Senior Che Zhuzi, we can always catch up another time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Despite the rejection, Che Zhuzi's smile only widened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He personally escorted Ning Zhuo out of Azure Stone Cave Mansion. "No need to call me 'Senior' anymore. Let's just treat each other as equals."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"That works too," Ning Zhuo nodded, accepting the suggestion with casual ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Che Zhuzi observed this nonchalant attitude and couldn't help but speculate: It seems Ning Zhuo's status is truly extraordinary. Golden Core cultivators are nothing special to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Che Zhuzi grew increasingly convinced that befriending Ning Zhuo had been the right decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">As Ning Zhuo prepared to depart, he suddenly turned to Che Zhuzi and said, "Fellow Daoist Che Zhuzi, I have a proposal for you to consider.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"If Ban Ji seeks to purchase Void Spider Silk from you, refuse him outright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"I will acquire the corresponding quantity at a fifty percent premium, compensating you for any losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"What do you say?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A sharp glint flashed in Che Zhuzi's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He understood Ning Zhuo's deeper meaning: he was being asked to choose a side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"This certainly requires consideration," Che Zhuzi replied, not immediately rejecting the offer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">In a short time, Ning Zhuo had demonstrated his strength, completely altering Che Zhuzi's initial perception of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Upon returning to Azure Stone Cave Mansion, Ning Zhuo immediately interrogated Lady Spiderweb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Lady Spiderweb collapsed to the ground, weeping and pleading. She began by praising Ning Zhuo as a paragon of the Righteous Path, a model of Virtue, and a peerless figure. Then she questioned how it could be right to enslave a weak woman. If he spared her, she vowed to reform and repay him later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo nodded, a faint smile playing on his lips, and commended her willingness to admit her wrongs. He then inquired about Ban Ji's plans to deal with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Lady Spiderweb's expression grew desperate, her voice trembling. She swore that if Ning Zhuo spared her, she would reveal everything she knew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo's smile widened. "Do you think I'm a naive child, Woman?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Lady Spiderweb had previously observed Ning Zhuo's verbal sparring with Che Zhuzi. Now, tears streaming down her face, she declared her unwavering resolve to die rather than lose her freedom. She also offered to lead Ning Zhuo to hidden treasure troves if he spared her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Wouldn't I find out anyway if I searched your soul?" Ning Zhuo asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Lady Spiderweb shook her head vehemently, tears welling in her eyes. "Young Master Ning Zhuo, you're a rising star of the Righteous Path! How could you possibly use the Soul-Searching Art - a demonic technique?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"What kind of Demonic Path methods are these?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"If this were exposed, it would tarnish your reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"You are kind and compassionate, merely trying to frighten me and guide me toward righteousness. I would gladly let you guide me..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lady Spiderweb cast a coquettish glance at Ning Zhuo before taking a few steps forward, her intention clear: to press against his calf.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo immediately snorted coldly, his patience with Lady Spiderweb's evasiveness wearing thin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">With a swift kick, he sent Lady Spiderweb sprawling to the ground, his face radiating righteous indignation. "You heinous Demonic Cultivator! What use is there in discussing morality with someone like you? Isn't that utterly absurd?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"I ask you this: when you plotted to harm me, did you hold yourself to such moral standards?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Lady Spiderweb quickly began to sob, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, I was merely manipulated by others! Ban Ji's gang paid me handsomely, I..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo waved his hand dismissively. "Silence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Lady Spiderweb immediately fell silent, whimpering but unable to utter another word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo sneered. "See? You've run out of excuses, haven't you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Lady Spiderweb's pupils constricted sharply as she glared at Ning Zhuo, her face flushed with anger. If you have the guts, don't use the Slave Contract to control me! Let me speak! Ahhh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">How can a young prodigy of the Righteous Path be so shameless?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo issued his final warning: "I won't waste any more time with you. This is your last chance. Confess honestly and spare yourself the pain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Lady Spiderweb finally abandoned her menacing facade and sneered at Ning Zhuo. "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, you hold the Slave Contract. Why not use it to force me to reveal the truth?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Before Ning Zhuo could answer, she answered her own question: "Yes, your suspicions are correct."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"After accepting Ban Ji's commission, we signed a contract. Any breach of its terms would result in severe consequences."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Even if you use the Soul-Searching Art, you won't find what you seek."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Don't forget, I am a Demonic Cultivator!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"As a Demonic Cultivator, how could I not prepare defenses against Soul-Searching Arts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"I might as well tell you - I've long cultivated my soul to resist such techniques. In a critical moment, my soul will self-destruct, leaving you with nothing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Even if my soul shatters and scatters, I will never let my enemies gain the upper hand!" Lady Spiderweb declared, her eyes flashing with ruthless determination, finally revealing the true nature of a Demonic Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo fell silent, his gaze fixed on Lady Spiderweb. After a few breaths, he spoke calmly, "You claim to resist Soul-Searching Arts? Which specific techniques are you referring to?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"For example, Soul-Binding Silken Threads, Three Souls' Spinning Wheel, Soul-Inquiry Demon-Feeding? Or perhaps Spirit Embryo, Soul Cicada Compensation, Human Candle Sacrifice?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Or could it be Soul-Adornment Mirror Observation, Drowning Soul Sutra, Dream-Draining Soul Ointment?" Ning Zhuo rattled off the techniques as if listing precious treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"If none of those work, there's also Nine-Fee Bone-Inquiry Bell, Affection-Tugging Buddha Detection Guide, Flea-Heart Ghost Comfort, Resentful Puppet Sympathetic Movement, and so on...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"All these methods possess the wondrous ability to search souls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Which ones can you resist?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Lady Spiderweb listened in stunned silence. Her throat bobbed as she unconsciously swallowed. Her eyes, fixed on Ning Zhuo, were filled with shock and suspicion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Why are you so familiar with these Soul-Searching Arts?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Are you the Demonic Cultivator here, or am I?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">From Ning Zhuo's smile, Lady Spiderweb felt a chilling dread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo silently thanked Tian Shuang, one of the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts, for his invaluable contribution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">A heavy silence settled between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Lady Spiderweb could only gamble that Ning Zhuo was bluffing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">And indeed, he was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Though he knew the Soul-Searching Arts, he hadn't truly mastered them, leaving him unable to use them against her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">I could use the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability in conjunction with the Slave Contract... but the real key is the potential existence of a Secret-Keeping Covenant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">I need to find the full text of this covenant, then identify any loopholes or weaknesses before choosing which Soul-Searching Art to use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">It's like picking a lock - avoiding backlash while opening the gates to her memory vaults for my perusal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">As this thought crystallized, Ning Zhuo's mind and body jolted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">So that's it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">A spiritual light flashed in his divine sea, the weight of recent events finally allowing him to grasp a crucial insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Earlier, when this same light had appeared, Ning Zhuo's unsettling encounter with Ban Ji had disrupted his focus, preventing him from fully capturing the inspiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Now, having captured Lady Spiderweb and contemplating the Soul-Searching Arts, the same inspiration resurfaced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Soul-Searching Arts - they're the key!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo trembled with barely suppressed excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">According to his theory, mastering these arts could trigger a profound qualitative transformation in his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo immediately put the matters of Ban Ji and Lady Spiderweb out of his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">I must focus all my efforts on mastering the Soul-Searching Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Cloud Soul Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Tian Shuang stood at the edge of a precipice, his tattered robes whipping in the fierce wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">A fierce battle had just concluded, with Tian Shuang defeated and Di Hui victorious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Di Hui cast a spell and shouted, "Tian Shuang, awaken!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">As if struck by lightning, Tian Shuang snapped to awareness. He grabbed his face and tore the mask away with a violent tug.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">After a few breaths, he ripped a ghost mask from his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">I am Tian Shuang! I am Tian Shuang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">(I am not a ghost!)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">With the ghost mask removed, Tian Shuang's mind cleared significantly, allowing him to remember his true identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Seeing his consciousness restored, Di Hui sighed in relief and slowly approached. "Tian Shuang, why did you maintain the Soul Synchronization Art for so long?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Tian Shuang, drenched in cold sweat, shook his head weakly and sighed deeply. "I was too impatient for results."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Di Hui sighed as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Since their disastrous battle in the Thousand Peaks Forest, Tian Shuang had been unable to find peace. He had become restless and impatient in all aspects, desperate for quick success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"The Soul Synchronization Art is one thing. If you misuse it, I can still cover for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"But you must never use the Dream Boat Soul-Crossing Technique!" Di Hui warned sternly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Tian Shuang nodded. "Of course I understand that. I'm not that ignorant or reckless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Di Hui sighed, gazing down at the fathomless abyss below County Cliff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Perpetual mists swirled within the abyss, their gray-white wisps twisting into fleeting, indistinct human faces that vanished as quickly as they appeared in the dense fog.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"This is a rare place for Soul Cultivation," Di Hui said. "The Cloud Souls produced here are unique. Tian Shuang, you've nearly exhausted your family's fortune. Gather as many as you can while you're here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Tian Shuang's face was utterly lifeless. "Can you please stop bringing that up?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Di Hui burst into hearty laughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Myriad Manifestations Sect, Azure Stone Cave Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo stared intently at the Jade Slip. "I've decided - I'll learn the Dream Boat Soul Crossing Technique!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">This technique was a type of Soul-Searching Art, but its effects were extreme and domineering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Once activated, it would ignite the target's soul, transforming it into a burning soul-boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The caster would then extract their own soul and board this fiery vessel, embarking on a self-propelled journey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">During this process, the soul-boat would burn fiercely, unleashing a torrent of memories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The caster would passively absorb these memories, experiencing them as if they were their own, reliving the target's life firsthand!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Through this method, the caster could acquire any skill or knowledge the target possessed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">However, the risks were immense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The overwhelming power of the Soul-Searching Art, combined with its effectiveness, meant that after experiencing another's entire life, the caster might completely forget their own identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
