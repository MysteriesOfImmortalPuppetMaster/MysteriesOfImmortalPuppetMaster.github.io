<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 115: Closing the Door, No Exit!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo cherished every exploration of the Lava Immortal City deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Up until today, his surroundings made it increasingly difficult for him to explore freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This was primarily because more and more people had reached the third-layer peak of Qi Refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo had to blend in with them to avoid drawing attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">In the first room, he assembled his body and regrouped with the people from the Zhou and Zheng families, showcasing his prized possession, the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Da Sheng, in front of everyone. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In the second room, Ning Zhuo ordered Da Sheng to repel all his companions and made a public spectacle of being thrown into the trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This way, there was no need for him to explain himself, as the people from the Zhou and Zheng families would inform the Ning family why Ning Zhuo took so long to return to his physical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo first reset the traps, then, with Da Sheng, he cleaned up the battlefield, extracting all the spirit stones from the puppets and taking them along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">When he pushed open the second door, he selected a mechanism component.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He didn’t use the power of the "My Buddha Heart Demon Seal" to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The reason was that he had already collected all the spell rewards for passing the second room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The spirit stones amounted to only two, and Ning Zhuo preferred to save his soul power as much as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Harnessing a trace of the power from the "My Buddha Heart Demon Seal" consumed soul power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The further he advanced, the more soul power was required to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In the third room, which was also the record limit for Meng Chong, there were numerous mechanism puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, they immediately charged at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Da Sheng let out a low roar, standing in front.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo cast several spells in succession, freezing all the puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">By now, he had received numerous spell rewards, gaining a massive amount of casting experience, making him adept at these spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Passing through the third room, Ning Zhuo arrived at the preparation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Under the leaderboard, he claimed his well-deserved first place rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The number of spirit stones skyrocketed to hundreds! Considering this, the door rewards of spirit stones were pitiful in comparison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">It's worth mentioning that now the insights and experiences gained from spell rewards provided minimal improvement to Ning Zhuo, far less than they did initially.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“I now possess the embryonic form of a divine ability. Can I use the 'My Buddha Heart Demon Seal' to remove my name from the leaderboard directly? Or perhaps hide the leaderboard stone pillar altogether?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo tried, but did not succeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Passing through the preparation room, he entered the fourth room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo cast spells in rotation, obtaining over a dozen mechanism components, such as the Flying Hand and the Qi Dissipation Ring, fully arming himself in the process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The fifth room, sixth room, preparation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">With each step, he continued to advance, undeterred and focused on his ultimate goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Seventh room, eighth room, ninth room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo and Da Sheng teamed up, resulting in a qualitative change in their overall combat power, making the challenges much easier than if he were alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Yuan Da Sheng’s inherent spirituality was not inclined to use spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">With Da Sheng positioned at the front, attracting and engaging enemies, Ning Zhuo stayed at the back, casting various spells opportunistically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Upon reaching the preparation room for the third time, Ning Zhuo entered the central hall and once again encountered the three doors of Buddha, Dao, and Demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">His highest record was when he and Da Sheng fought through the three Buddhist trials despite the losses, and once again arrived at the central hall to see the new three doors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Through interacting with the portals, Ning Zhuo obtained the fourth to sixth layers of the Mirror Platform Communication Technique, the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, and the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Currently, his Qi Refining cultivation had reached the late fourth layer, his Body Refining was at the peak of the fourth layer, and his Spiritual Refining was uniquely advanced to the early sixth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This cultivation status meant that Ning Zhuo’s best option was to make the Buddhist path his main route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo first opened the Demon Gate and received the blood energy it provided.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">With this blood energy boost, Da Sheng's strength increased significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the three trials behind the gate, Da Sheng absorbed as much blood energy from the puppets as possible, reaching his limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Like the Buddhist path, there was no reward for the second trial, but the third trial offered a plethora of rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">What caught Ning Zhuo’s attention the most was a mechanism component—a Blood Oil Bottle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This component could collect various types of blood energy, mix, process, and refine them into a blood-like oil substance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Blood oil could rival pure blood energy and could serve as a substitute in certain aspects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“The Blood Transformation Pool can consume living beings with blood, decomposing them into numerous blood liquids.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Combining the Blood Transformation Pool and the Blood Oil Bottle allows a mechanism puppet to sustain itself through battle, greatly extending the duration of intense combat.” Ning Zhuo chose the Blood Oil Bottle and received a component.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He then exited the door and returned to the central hall, facing the second set of three doors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">These doors required at least a peak sixth-layer cultivation to be opened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo turned to his side and saw the first set of Buddha and Dao doors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Approaching the Dao door, he tried to push it open, but it didn't budge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">My Buddha Heart Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo activated the seal, opened the door, and walked inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The mechanism puppets in the third Dao trial heard the commotion and turned, spotting Ning Zhuo and rushing at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo pointed his finger, summoning Da Sheng with a roar to the front lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Dao trial puppets, each surrounded by five elements, continuously cast spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Under the onslaught of various spells, Da Sheng quickly fell into a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This demonstrated the strength of spellcasters—their short-term offensive power was exceptionally high, with significant burst potential! Ning Zhuo immediately intervened, supporting with various spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">His ample supply of spirit stones quickly helped stabilize the situation for Da Sheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Once in a stalemate, Da Sheng's excellent solo combat capabilities allow him to take down the spellcasting puppets one by one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">When the number of spellcasting puppets decreases to a certain point, Ning Zhuo orders Da Sheng to slow down its attacks while he casts spells to freeze these puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“I can move them to the third room and let Meng Chong have a taste of this,” he thinks, then changes his mind, “better move them to the sixth room.” Since Da Sheng defeated Meng Chong, Meng Chong has not entered the Immortal Palace again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">However, the City Lord's team, which Ning Zhuo secretly monitors, has recorded multiple explorations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo has a strong premonition that when Meng Chong reappears, he will have a new look, with his combat power at least one level higher!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">In such a scenario, more spellcasting puppets won’t be very effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Only entities like the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Da Sheng, can deal with Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Even Ning Zhuo himself, with his full armor, finds it challenging to contend against Meng Chong's ferocious thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo proceeds from the third trial, retracing his steps through the second and first trials of the Dao Gate, finally arriving at the first central hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This marks his first time successfully passing the three trials of both the Demon and Dao Gates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Overall, the design of the gates is quite similar; both have no rewards in the second trial and concentrate the rewards in the third trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">From the Dao Gate’s rewards, Ning Zhuo chooses the Five Elements Chaos Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This technique specifically targets the five-elemental magic power, disrupting and scattering the ordered five elemental powers, causing them to run chaotically and contradict each other, thus rendering the mechanism puppet internally disordered and immobilized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“The Demonic Blood Vein Technique strengthens control over the mechanism puppet through blood vessels and elemental power. By focusing on these two aspects, I will have a means to restrain Da Sheng if it loses control again in the future. Perhaps this was the intention of the three grandmasters. They created spiritual mechanisms and therefore designed three techniques to be used in conjunction with the mechanism puppets.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo opens the Buddha Gate and reenters the coffin room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He does not receive any message and finds that he cannot choose a second coffin to create another mechanism puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Shaking his head in disappointment, he continues his journey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, seeing him shake his head, grinds his teeth in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo fights his way to the final portal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">When claiming his reward, he chooses the Illusionary True Lotus Seed without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's expression relaxes, and he cannot help but feel joyful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo opens the door and steps out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">My Buddha Heart Demon Seal! Opening the door to return, he receives the Illusionary True Lotus Seed as a reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit bursts into laughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo pushes the door open and steps out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">My Buddha Heart Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Opening the door to return, he received the Illusionary True Lotus Seed as a reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit lay back on the throne, so delighted that its dragon legs kicked in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo went in and out repeatedly, always choosing the Illusionary True Lotus Seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The mocking and ridiculing expression on Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's face gradually disappeared, replaced by bewilderment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">It found it extremely strange! Each time Ning Zhuo exited the gate, he needed to expend soul power to invoke the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">But he was going in and out far too many times, far more than Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit remembered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">What was going on?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo's cultivation had indeed advanced rapidly, allowing him to draw more from the artifact's power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">More importantly, as the embryonic form of his divine ability strengthened, the transmission loss of the seal’s power through the Life-Thread Divine Ability significantly decreased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">This improvement made Ning Zhuo's performance in and out of the gates much stronger than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's eyes gradually widened, an ominous feeling growing stronger in its heart, even causing it some alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">A terrifying suspicion surfaced in its mind: could Ning Zhuo have mastered the Life-Thread Divine Ability? But it had no proof.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The spirit could use the Life-Thread Divine Ability only by leveraging the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">It had no innate ability to see the life-threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Eventually, Ning Zhuo had to stop going in and out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He had reached his limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">His soul power was nearly depleted, and he missed Han Ming intensely. "After this period, Han Ming should have mostly recovered," he thought. "If my soul power continues to increase, I can enter and exit more times and quickly collect all the Illusionary True Lotus Seeds."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">At this point, Ning Zhuo's soul power had a final reserve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He could have retrieved one more Illusionary True Lotus Seed, but he chose not to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He needed to conduct a critical experiment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo retreated through the gates, returning to the first central hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Once again, he faced the three gates of Buddha, Dao, and Demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"The Buddha and Demon gates are my vulnerabilities! The Demon gate holds the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, which Da Sheng once tried to display, arousing Zhu Xuanji's suspicion. If others learn the Demonic Blood Vein Technique and it reaches Zhu Xuanji's ears, he will undoubtedly reassess everything that happened during the Lava Fruit Festival. And I, who ultimately obtained Da Sheng's corpse, will become the prime suspect. The Buddha gate’s flaw lies in the first trial! If others obtain the special mechanism puppet from this gate, they will realize they can freely bring this puppet in and out of the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Da Sheng's presence will be suspected once again. If only the Demon and Buddha gates could be hidden!" This had always been Ning Zhuo's thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He had tried before, but his previous attempts had all failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">This time, he wanted to try again. "Because I am stronger now. I have mastered the embryonic form of the Life-Thread Divine Ability. My cultivation has also improved significantly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">My Buddha Heart Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo activated it with all his might, his soul power plummeting at that moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In return, the stone wall gradually rose, eventually completely covering the Buddha gate.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
