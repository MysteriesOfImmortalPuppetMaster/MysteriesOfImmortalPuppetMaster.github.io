<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 521: Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In a valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“All soldiers, listen to orders, form the Iron Bucket Formation!” Xu Dali stood under the general’s banner, urging the use of military tactics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Military tactics —speed is of the essence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Under the bolstering of this tactic, the speed throughout the Barbarian Demon Camp immediately increased by more than double.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">However, the time required to form the battle formation was not significantly reduced; many even, unaccustomed to the sudden acceleration, ran to the wrong positions, causing errors in their coordination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Just as the intelligence said, the Barbarian Demon Camp’s level of training is the worst. Hahaha!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Brothers, hit them hard for me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“If we do not eliminate these isolated troops today, when they merge in the future, we will be reduced to a chopping board.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Cultivators, with barbarian cultivators as the main and demon cultivators as the supplement, frequently appeared in the mountains and forests, casting various spells and concentrating their fire on the Barbarian Demon Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Rolling stones, each the shaoe of a wheel, tumbled down the mountain’s slope, smashing into the soldiers of the Barbarian Demon Camp and leaving their heads bloodied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">One poisonous needle after another, as fine as an ox’s hair and impossible to defend against, caused soldiers of the Barbarian Demon Camp to occasionally fall to the ground, foaming at the mouth and convulsing to death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Also, vines suddenly burst out from beneath the ground, immediately strangling the unsuspecting soldiers on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Barbarian Demon Camp paid with the lives of hundreds before finally forming the Iron Bucket Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">At the instant the formation succeeded, the entire army’s defenses were greatly enhanced, and their situation changed from dangerous to secure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">A carriage concealed itself invisibly, speeding through the high sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The coachman, seeing below the battle between the Barbarian Demon Camp and the native cultivators of the Thousand Peaks Forest, immediately transmitted his divine sense to the people inside the carriage: “Sir, our army below is at a disadvantage; shall we come to assist?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Based on the strength of the several cultivators in the carriage, once they took action, they would undoubtedly subvert the entire battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">But as the backbone of the force, Zhao Xi snorted coldly, “Xu Dali is a useless fellow; the Barbarian Demon Camp’s poor training might have been forgivable, but the key is that he directly formed the Iron Bucket Formation and became nothing but a meat target.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Simply ridiculous!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“If he had formed an attacking formation, the opponents being merely scattered soldiers and vagabonds with no proper army, how could they be resisted?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Xu Dali has forced himself into such a predicament; what is there for us to save?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“At this moment, the most important thing is for me to hurry to the frontline main camp to take command of the situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“General Du, severely injured and in seclusion, and I, as the overseer personally appointed by the Sovereign, must quickly go to take charge of the overall situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“There is a reason why these troops have been eliminated.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Once I get to the main camp, the main forces will naturally pay attention and dispatch troops to support. That is the decision a general should make. Let’s go!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The coachman, inwardly disdainful but outwardly respectful, said, “As you command, sir!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Two Note Nation Frontline Main Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo returned to his own residence, entered the Mechanical Dragon, and tinkered with various materials around the three mechanism pedestals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">On the Xuanyuan Nine Work Platform, chunk after chunk of blue electric current silver was swiftly processed, transforming into strands of flexible metallic silver wires. Each silver wire intermittently swirled with sparks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo gathered up the electric silver wires and took out the Dragon Scale Gold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">With his palm pressed against the Xuanyuan Nine Work Platform, he operated it continuously. Piece by piece, the Dragon Scale Gold was carved into extremely sharp hook shapes; with each cut, the curvature and sharpness of the hook had to be just right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">After producing hundreds of pieces, Ning Zhuo inspected them while nodding, feeling very satisfied: “If I were to process them one by one, it would take at least three days and three nights, and the final products would have many defects —how could they compare to these perfect ones?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo then took out a large heap of half-alive, half-dead beads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Chen Cha…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo’s gaze flickered for a moment as he recalled the old good man in his memory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The half-alive, half-dead beads were the original creation of Chen Cha. He had used the formation collection of Bai Lin Jushi as a foundation, combining his own experience with a momentary flash of inspiration, to design this mechanical component.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">They were mainly used in the joints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Each spherical bead was divided into two sides —one pitch black and one pure white. On the pitch black side was the character for “death,” and on the white side was the character for “life.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">When the bead flipped to its white, “life” side, the joint moved freely; when it flipped to its black, “death” side, the joint was accordingly locked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">There was also a hidden connection between the beads. If a cultivator carved formation patterns onto the main mechanism, it could constitute one or more living formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the wooden beads that Chen Cha provided to Ning Zhuo were of too low a grade. The beads Ning Zhuo was now using had all been specially hastened into production —of Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo worked diligently, using these half-alive, half-dead beads as a foundation. He wrapped and drawn with the electric silver wires to construct a snake body woven from a metallic network. Afterwards, he used the Dragon Scale Gold to forge scales, which he laid over the metal grid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">In this way, a prototype of a mechanical creation was formed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Next, Ning Zhuo employed his divine sense, magical power, and mechanical tools to further process it —adding talismans, constructing formations, and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">After more than two hours, a mechanical creation resembling a golden snake lay quietly on the surface of the mechanism pedestal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Mechanical Beast —Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This mechanical snake gleamed with golden light and was exquisitely crafted. Its body was covered with sharp, saw-toothed scales. With its mouth open, it could extend a pair of hook-shaped fangs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">When Ning Zhuo attempted to activate it, he saw the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake slithering on the surface of the mechanism pedestal, its movements agile, uncoiled, and quite natural.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo then took out an iron tree stump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake suddenly lunged, so fast that it left a golden shadow in Ning Zhuo’s field of vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Its body extended and coiled around the iron tree stump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Mechanism Technique —Golden Scale Winding Saw Kill!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo activated this self-created mechanical technique. The scales of the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake stood upright, embedding into the iron tree stump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Each scale rotated rapidly, as if slicing tofu, directly cutting into the interior of the iron tree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">As the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake wound tighter and tighter, the iron tree stump —thick as a washbasin —was effortlessly cut into two segments, with no capacity to resist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Very good, very good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up. “Next, it’s time for real combat, to gather experience for manufacturing the staff head.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Once the subsequent work on the staff head is completed, this Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake will be fully finished.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo did not halt his progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Next, he still had to design two more mechanical creations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Because relying solely on the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake, it obviously would not be a match for the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and would be difficult to achieve results in real combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo worked through the entire night, and by the next morning, three brand-new mechanical creations lay before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In addition to the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake, there was also a set of seven rolling electric ball cages and a root-drilling, ground-piercing hammer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">When Liu Er and Guan Hong found Ning Zhuo, he showed them his results and gave them a brief introduction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Guan Hong did not understand mechanical arts, but he knew well that Ning Zhuo was not an ordinary person, and he immediately expressed his anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Liu Er sincerely exclaimed, “Before having met the military advisor, I could hardly have imagined that there would be such a genius youth in the world.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Military Advisor, you primarily cultivate mechanical arts, while those Five Elements spells are only secondary studies.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Ah, once this secret is revealed, the number of people who will be amazed is countless.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Liu Er looked earnestly at Ning Zhuo, “Military Advisor, your future is truly limitless; in time, you could very well ascend to the Young Master List!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo immediately waved his hand, humbly dismissing Liu Er’s praise, “The Young Master encompasses the entire cultivation world —what virtue or merit do I have to be selected among them?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Guan Hong then said, “Based on all I have seen in my life, you, Military Advisor, are the most likely to ascend to the Young Master.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Deep underground, there was a Dragon King Temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The entrance to the temple was a stone door. The stone door was covered with the marks of time, thick and ancient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Pushing open the stone door, one found the temple hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">More than twenty giant pillars supported the dome. The pillars were made of millennia-old ancient wood, and each was inlaid with golden dragon scale patterns, with dragon heads held high and dragon tails winding, vividly lifelike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Inside the temple, the light was dim, and the surrounding stone walls emitted a faint yellow glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The air was filled with a damp scent, mixed with water vapor and the mysterious fragrance of medicinal herbs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">At the very center of the temple hall was the main altar, about three zhang tall, surrounded by a rich dragon aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">On the altar was enshrined a special Dragon King statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">It had no claws or scales, with its dragon head held high and its dragon whiskers spread out —exactly in the appearance of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">At this moment, the statue of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King had dull eyes and was gasping for breath, revealing that its true form was in a very bad state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Beneath the altar, there was a huge incense table on which burned three large incense sticks. Each incense stick was as thick as a washbasin and as tall as one zhang, and the smoke that emanated from them rose gracefully around the Dragon King statue, slowly being absorbed by it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">In addition to the large incense sticks, there were also a large number of sacrificial offerings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Long Ye, as one of the temple priests, was organizing the sacrificial rites together with four other temple priests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">As the sacrificial rites progressed, the offerings were quickly consumed, transforming into streams of nourishment and power that were channeled to the true form of the Dragon King hidden in an unknown location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">When the sacrifice paused, the temple priests sat cross-legged on the floor tiles, all competing against time to recover as much as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The heavy, labored breathing gradually subsided, and the originally pale faces gradually regained a trace of color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Conducting a sacrifice was not such a simple, easy matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Even Long Ye felt the hardship, more exhausted than he had been during the fierce fight in the ambush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">At that moment, a flying message drifted over, bringing the latest military intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The temple priests quickly projected their divine sense; after reading it, one of the old temple priests looked at Long Ye and said, “Ah Long, you should go back and take charge of the battle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Without you, the people in the frontline camp will all run away.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“A few of us old fellows here will suffice.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Long Ye’s face showed difficulty as he looked toward the Dragon King statue and said with utmost worry, “Those outsiders are not worth dying over; my heart belongs only to the deity.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The old temple priest immediately replied, “Precisely for that reason, you should go back and take charge of the overall situation. You need to lead the allied forces to intercept and encircle the armies of the Two Note Nation —kill as many as possible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“Only in this way can we win more time for our master to recuperate and recover!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Long Ye gritted his teeth, hesitated for a moment, and finally slowly nodded, “Understood, I will go back and take charge of the overall situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He knelt in obeisance, turning his head every three steps, reluctantly leaving the Dragon King Temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Once he used the Earth Escape, his speed increased greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“Lu Hongtu, that guy, was very slippery. He was always wooing people’s hearts and never obstructed those who went out, to the extent that many of our high cultivators were killed by military weapons while picking up spoils.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“Those Ghost Cultivators were also not of good will, inciting our high-level cultivators to probe the enemy’s firepower for the two of them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“The most critical is still the Old Stone Monster!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Even until now, he still has not appeared. What patience…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Like Lu Hongtu, Long Ye also deeply understood that the Old Stone Monster was the most crucial factor. As long as he did not appear, the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and Du Tiechuan would never risk everything to fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Long Ye secretly returned to the military camp, but did not immediately appear in the main discussion tent; instead, he found Sheng Xu Gongzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“Your previous quote, our side has agreed to it,” Long Ye said with a solemn expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">But Sheng Xu Gongzi shook his head, “That was then; this is now, Long Ye.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Now, my quote needs to double.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Huh?!” Long Ye glared, fury rising in his heart, “You’re taking advantage of the situation to rob us!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Sheng Xu Gongzi smiled slightly, “My name appears on the Young Master List, and now your side and the Two Note Nation’s Soul Formation cultivators are all severely injured. My action this time will very likely change the final outcome of this great war. Therefore, I am completely worth this price!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Long Ye shook his head, “What you say makes sense. But even if I wanted to pay, I don’t have the ability. You must understand, you require cash on the spot. The Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance is, after all, an alliance; relying on my Dragon King Temple lineage, even if I emptied our treasury, I could not produce your remuneration. After all, there are too many places that need money.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Sheng Xu Gongzi, having foreseen this outcome, said, “Rest assured, ahem ahem, I accept treasure as deduction.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">A glint flashed in Long Ye’s eyes, “What is it that you want?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Sheng Xu Gongzi straightened his back slightly and slowly uttered four characters, “Sheng Hai Dragon Spring.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Long Ye, so angry that he almost had to strike, resolutely rejected, “That is absolutely impossible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Two Note Nation Frontline Main Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">A carriage descended from the sky; after quietly landing, it then dispelled its spells and gradually became visible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The generals had long been waiting; when they saw the overseer Zhao Xi dismount from the carriage, they all saluted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Zhao Xi, holding the identity-representing baton, with his head held high and chest out, scanned the surroundings and only gave a slight nod, his demeanor very dignified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">“I have already reported the previous battle; the Monarch is very concerned. How is General Du now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Immediately, a general reported that Du Tiechuan had entered deep seclusion, and the specific military affairs had been handed over to others for joint handling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Zhao Xi was pleased in his heart, “Very well, serving the nation and toiling is the duty of a subject; let me take on this heavy responsibility.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The generals looked at each other; constrained by their positions, they had no choice but to comply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Zhao Xi immediately rushed to the Commander's Mansion, inquiring about the situation in the main camp all along the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The generals reported: almost all of the army had removed their iron-plated flesh armor and were currently actively resting and recuperating; their condition was quickly recovering, and in another three or four days there would be troops available for mobilization and deployment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">And during this period, it was mainly the generals of the Golden Core and Nascent Soul levels who were roaming around the battlefield, carrying out cleanup tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">They further reported that on the Thousand Peaks Forest side, many petty criminals also wanted to pick up spoils and were taught a lesson by the heavy military weapons —many were killed or injured, and the loot was considerable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Hearing this, Zhao Xi’s heart pounded, and he immediately inquired about the matter of the spoils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Then someone took out a jade slip and handed it to Zhao Xi, “Sir, this is the complete record of the spoils captured so far.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Zhao Xi’s divine sense swept through it and discovered that there was also a battle merit ranking list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">At the top of the ranking was none other than Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">He was evidently displeased, “That mere mixed-blood, occupying the top spot? What about the others?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">One of the generals explained, “Overseer, this Liu Er just squeezed into the ranking last night. Perhaps by noon today, when the ranking is rearranged, he will drop out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The other generals concurred, saying it was an accident —previously, Liu Er had been ranked outside of the top five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Zhao Xi slowly nodded, but inside his heart he grew anxious, “This Liu Er is an outsider, with no power or influence, yet he occupies the top spot. This indicates that he has indeed scooped up a lot.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">“These spoils are all battle merits, after all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">“I have come here with great difficulty; if I can’t get battle merits, how can I justify this very adventure of mine?”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
