<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>In the past, Ning Zhuo used to see his mother, Meng Yaoyin, several times a year. But as time passed, it became once every two or three years.<br/>
<br/>
One year, two years, three years passed like this.<br/>
<br/>
The intervals between when Buddha Doctor Meng Yaoyin regained her consciousness became longer and longer.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo buried himself in studying mechanical arts, completely absorbed, to the point of neglecting sleep and food. Ning Ze and others tried to dissuade him, and even the elders of the school advised him to balance his efforts. But he brushed them all off, making excuses—what could be more important than his mother?<br/>
<br/>
One deep night, Buddha Doctor Meng Yaoyin appeared.<br/>
<br/>
After testing Ning Zhuo’s mechanical skills, Meng Yaoyin smiled in relief: “My son has worked diligently, his foundation in mechanical arts is solid. Although your cultivation is low, it’s enough to help your mother.”<br/>
<br/>
“Mother, what should I do?” Ning Zhuo asked eagerly.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin explained, “I’m already dead. Only my spirit remains. Now, my spirit is fading due to Dao injuries. Only by sealing myself can I maintain my existence for a longer time.”<br/>
<br/>
“Normally, with your current stage of Qi Refinement, it would be impossible for you to control a puppet of Golden Core level.”<br/>
<br/>
“But with the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, this can be overcome.”<br/>
<br/>
“By using the Heart Seal, combined with the mechanical components I’ve modified, and the natural connection between my spirit and you, you’ll be able to barely control Buddha Doctor.”<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin then taught Ning Zhuo the method of control.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo learned quickly, his eyes glowing faintly as he started influencing the Buddha Doctor's movements.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin was pleased and gave him her final instructions: “Zhuo'er, I’ve already modified Buddha Doctor so it won’t completely return to the Immortal Palace.”<br/>
<br/>
“Once I seal myself, Buddha Doctor will act according to its own restrictions and my lingering spirit. It will remain in Fire Persimmon Mountain, constantly slaying the Scarlet Flame Beasts to defend the Immortal Palace.”<br/>
<br/>
“I won’t be able to regain my consciousness anymore; you’ll need to wake me from the outside. I’ve already devised a solution for that.”<br/>
<br/>
“Since I’m from Feiyun Country, I’ve improved the sealing techniques and set everything up... using cultivators exploring Fire Persimmon Mountain, trading them strings of fortune... when you need me, you can blend in special cloud silk…”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo listened intently, not daring to miss a single word.<br/>
<br/>
When she finished, Ning Zhuo asked, “Mother, I’ve recently reread The Essentials of the Lava Immortal Palace, and both the Serpent Scythe and you went through the Golden Furnace. Why does the Golden Furnace refine spirits? Is this restriction from some scripture? If I obtain it, could it help restore your spirit?”<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin smiled faintly, “I had considered this. It’s indeed possible.”<br/>
<br/>
“When you enter the palace in the future, you might try it.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, spirit is spirit, memory is memory. Much of my memory is already lost, with only the most crucial parts remaining.”<br/>
<br/>
“Even if I seal my spirit, I can’t prevent the Dao injuries from eroding my memories.”<br/>
<br/>
“Zhuo’er, I…”<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin choked up, her voice trembling slightly, “I... might not remember you in the future. My spirit will act on instinct alone, so please, don’t be sad.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes reddened, and with a hoarse voice, he replied resolutely, “Mother, I will definitely find a way! Don’t worry, I will claim the Immortal Palace, and I will save you!”<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin reached out, stroking Ning Zhuo’s face, her gaze filled with love: “Of course I believe in you, Zhuo'er. How fortunate I am to have such a good child.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ve accompanied you for so many years, and I’m already satisfied.”<br/>
<br/>
“Seizing the Immortal Palace isn’t important.”<br/>
<br/>
“Neither is your mother.”<br/>
<br/>
“You need to live your own life and walk your own path…”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo interrupted, “Mother! Don’t say that…”<br/>
<br/>
He embraced his mother tightly. Now grown, he rarely wept, but tears fell this time.<br/>
<br/>
At sixteen.<br/>
<br/>
“Mother, the situation has changed! The Lava Immortal Palace has lowered its entry requirement to Qi Refinement level… we may never get another chance in this lifetime!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo made up his mind to blow up the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
He "coincidentally" encountered Ning Chen and Ning Yong.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen provoked him, “If your uncle and aunt saw you struggling to survive in some small workshop, how would they feel?”<br/>
<br/>
“They’d probably think: Look, Ning Zhuo didn’t know his limits. Without our help, he’s fallen into poverty, destined to be at the bottom of the cultivator ranks!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pretended to be furious on the surface, but inside, he grew cautious: “Something’s not right with Ning Chen!”<br/>
<br/>
Little did Ning Chen know, Ning Zhuo was merely playing along.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo later met Ning Zhanji. He and the family’s cultivators delved deep into Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhanji lectured him, “You’re still young. Don’t get lost chasing money. Investing in yourself is the best way to succeed.”<br/>
<br/>
“Once you reach Foundation Establishment, your life will be very different.”<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Zhuo confirmed: “Ning Zhanji is the one plotting against me. Though there’s someone behind him... hmph, trying to ambush me? I’ll deal with him first.”<br/>
<br/>
After entering Fire Persimmon Mountain, Ning Zhuo used his Heart Seal to connect with the Buddha Doctor.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes gleamed with that faint glow as he remotely controlled Buddha Doctor, cutting down Scarlet Flame Beasts, quickly setting up a simple formation as bait.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family cultivators soon fell into the trap—<br/>
<br/>
“A Lava Flame Demon Ape ahead!” A warning came from a scout.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family team ventured deeper, under attack from surrounding beasts, forming defensive formations.<br/>
<br/>
Buddha Doctor approached the Lava Immortal Palace, provoking an attack from Zheng Shuangou.<br/>
<br/>
“Foolish thief, you dare covet the Immortal Palace? Leave your life behind!” Zheng Shuangou roared.<br/>
<br/>
The shadowy figure of the Buddha Doctor, controlled by Ning Zhuo, let out an eerie, old laugh: “The treasures of the cultivation world belong to those with fate. You think your Fire Persimmon City can monopolize the Lava Immortal Palace? Dream on!”<br/>
<br/>
During the battle, the shadowy figure struck down Ning Zhanji.<br/>
<br/>
“Lord Ning Zhanji!” The Ning family cultivators shouted in shock. But Ning Zhanji fell, eyes wide open, dead.<br/>
<br/>
The explosion that freed the Immortal Palace sent shockwaves throughout the city, completely catching Ning Zhuo off guard.<br/>
<br/>
He, along with the other Ning family cultivators, was arrested and taken to prison for questioning.<br/>
<br/>
To be safe, Ning Zhuo had Buddha Doctor follow at a distance, ready to rescue him if needed.<br/>
<br/>
Though Ning Zhuo passed the interrogation smoothly, an unexpected complication arose when leaving the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun’s warning bell detected Buddha Doctor, leading him to find it.<br/>
<br/>
A battle erupted between two Golden Core cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family cultivators panicked and fled, fearing to be caught in the crossfire.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen and Ning Yong tried to pull Ning Zhuo away.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo said, “Why run? The dungeon is the safest place!”<br/>
<br/>
The two were stunned.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo grabbed their hands, saying, “Trust me.”<br/>
<br/>
So, the three returned to the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen and Ning Yong were restless.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pretended to be relaxed, eating fruit and drinking tea while secretly focusing on controlling Buddha Doctor, engaging in battle while retreating.<br/>
<br/>
At the critical moment, he thought of Fei Si and boldly controlled Buddha Doctor to rush into the fire persimmon forest.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si’s reaction was just as Ning Zhuo had expected—he turned back and stopped Chi Dun.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, under the alias “The Boy in Tresses,” gathered Sun Lingtong and Han Ming and successfully looted the Purple Sun Courtyard’s pills.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then deceived Han Ming successfully.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suggested testing the pills and keeping them.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head, “I strongly advise against that.”<br/>
<br/>
“This time, we accidentally encountered Meng Chong. He’s a grandson of a Nascent Soul cultivator, and our actions might be seen as an attempt against him.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo snorted, “Isn’t it simple? Just throw them into the Fire Persimmon Forest.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong blinked, then his eyes gleamed as he clapped his hands, “Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!”<br/>
<br/>
It truly was brilliant.<br/>
<br/>
The pills were delivered to Buddha Doctor, effectively severing ties between “The Boy in Tresses,” Sun Lingtong, and the shadowy Buddha Doctor.<br/>
<br/>
And with the purifying power of Buddha Doctor’s mechanisms, even if Foundation Establishment cultivators like Sun Lie had planted tracking methods in the pills, they would be cleansed completely.<br/>
<br/>
At the Fire Persimmon Festival, Chen Cha praised Yuan Dasheng’s reliability.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said nothing, his eyes gleaming with faint light.<br/>
<br/>
He laughed coldly to himself: “Reliable?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ve plotted until now, waiting for this moment.”<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, several mechanical monkeys broke free of their handlers and attacked Yuan Er.<br/>
<br/>
The assassination attempt failed.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng returned to picking persimmons.<br/>
<br/>
On the mountainside, Ning Zhuo’s eyes glowed brighter, reaching their peak.<br/>
<br/>
“Come on, come on.” He whispered in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
The earlier assassination had drawn the attention of the Golden Core cultivators, and the explosion that followed shifted almost everyone’s focus.<br/>
<br/>
Taking advantage of this, Buddha Doctor shrank and slipped into a storage array within one of the explosive monkeys.<br/>
<br/>
Once the mechanical monkeys had stored enough fire persimmons, they were remotely controlled to return.<br/>
<br/>
They stood in a large formation circle, spitting out the stored fire persimmons, piling them on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever the pile reached a height of one zhang, the formation activated, teleporting the fire persimmons straight to the city lord’s granary.<br/>
<br/>
In this way, the shadowy Buddha Doctor disappeared without a trace!<br/>
<br/>
All the Golden Core cultivators looked grim.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family patriarch questioned Zhu Xuanji’s golden vision talent.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji arrogantly replied, “I’ll only tell you this: my golden vision talent is close to divine power. In over ten years with the Divine Constabulary, I’ve only met three Golden Core cultivators who could withstand my golden vision. Below the Golden Core level, nothing escapes my eyes!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s spirit entered the Immortal Palace, and during the reward stage, he directly chose The Fire Cremation Prajñā Scripture!<br/>
<br/>
The Buddhist scripture’s contents quickly poured into Ning Zhuo’s mind.<br/>
<br/>
“As expected, it’s just as I thought!” Ning Zhuo was excited, but then froze.<br/>
<br/>
The scripture’s teachings moved him deeply!<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, he almost wept with joy.<br/>
<br/>
“Mother, The Fire Cremation Prajñā Scripture can refine spirits and strengthen your spirit.”<br/>
<br/>
“It must be the restriction in the Golden Furnace.”<br/>
<br/>
“Mother, I’ve found it!”<br/>
<br/>
The city lord’s mansion sent assassins to attack the three family geniuses.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, in his secluded training chamber, was surrounded by floating clouds that obscured his vision.<br/>
<br/>
He turned his head, staring in a certain direction, his brows furrowed, his eyes gleaming with faint light.<br/>
<br/>
Buddha Doctor was hidden, always protecting Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Through Buddha Doctor, Ning Zhuo swiftly killed the assassins, his heart stirring: “Isn’t this the perfect chance to enhance mother’s spirit?”<br/>
<br/>
Buddha Doctor stored the assassins’ corpses, hiding in a carriage.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the Fire Cremation Prajñā Scripture secretly refined the small courtyard, drawing out points of spiritual light, channeling them into Buddha Doctor.<br/>
<br/>
Buddha Doctor regained its agility.<br/>
<br/>
Its spirit increased, allowing it to display its innate immortal abilities and divine powers, further restoring its strength.<br/>
<br/>
“Mother!” Ning Zhuo choked up as he reunited with his mother in the midst of the fire.<br/>
<br/>
“Who... are you?” Buddha Doctor Meng Yaoyin asked.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo froze completely.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yaoyin’s voice was soft, “Why do you feel so familiar to me? You must be someone very important to me, right?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes reddened, his voice trembling, “Mother, I’m your son, Ning Zhuo.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ning... Zhuo?” Meng Yaoyin’s expression was filled with confusion.<br/>
<br/>
She couldn’t remember.</div></body></html></div>
