<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div><paragraph index="0">In the past, Ning Zhuo used to see his mother, Meng Yaoyin, several times a year. But as time passed, it became once every two or three years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="2">One year, two years, three years passed like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">The intervals between when Buddha Doctor Meng Yaoyin regained her consciousness became longer and longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="6">Ning Zhuo buried himself in studying mechanical arts, completely absorbed, to the point of neglecting sleep and food. Ning Ze and others tried to dissuade him, and even the elders of the school advised him to balance his efforts. But he brushed them all off, making excuses—what could be more important than his mother?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">One deep night, Buddha Doctor Meng Yaoyin appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">After testing Ning Zhuo’s mechanical skills, Meng Yaoyin smiled in relief: “My son has worked diligently, his foundation in mechanical arts is solid. Although your cultivation is low, it’s enough to help your mother.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">“Mother, what should I do?” Ning Zhuo asked eagerly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">Meng Yaoyin explained, “I’m already dead. Only my spirit remains. Now, my spirit is fading due to Dao injuries. Only by sealing myself can I maintain my existence for a longer time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">“Normally, with your current stage of Qi Refinement, it would be impossible for you to control a puppet of Golden Core level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">“But with the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, this can be overcome.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">“By using the Heart Seal, combined with the mechanical components I’ve modified, and the natural connection between my spirit and you, you’ll be able to barely control Buddha Doctor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">Meng Yaoyin then taught Ning Zhuo the method of control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">Ning Zhuo learned quickly, his eyes glowing faintly as he started influencing the Buddha Doctor's movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">Meng Yaoyin was pleased and gave him her final instructions: “Zhuo'er, I’ve already modified Buddha Doctor so it won’t completely return to the Immortal Palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">“Once I seal myself, Buddha Doctor will act according to its own restrictions and my lingering spirit. It will remain in Fire Persimmon Mountain, constantly slaying the Scarlet Flame Beasts to defend the Immortal Palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">“I won’t be able to regain my consciousness anymore; you’ll need to wake me from the outside. I’ve already devised a solution for that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">“Since I’m from Feiyun Country, I’ve improved the sealing techniques and set everything up... using cultivators exploring Fire Persimmon Mountain, trading them strings of fortune... when you need me, you can blend in special cloud silk…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">Ning Zhuo listened intently, not daring to miss a single word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">When she finished, Ning Zhuo asked, “Mother, I’ve recently reread The Essentials of the Lava Immortal Palace, and both the Serpent Scythe and you went through the Golden Furnace. Why does the Golden Furnace refine spirits? Is this restriction from some scripture? If I obtain it, could it help restore your spirit?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">Meng Yaoyin smiled faintly, “I had considered this. It’s indeed possible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">“When you enter the palace in the future, you might try it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">“However, spirit is spirit, memory is memory. Much of my memory is already lost, with only the most crucial parts remaining.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">“Even if I seal my spirit, I can’t prevent the Dao injuries from eroding my memories.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">“Zhuo’er, I…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">Meng Yaoyin choked up, her voice trembling slightly, “I... might not remember you in the future. My spirit will act on instinct alone, so please, don’t be sad.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Ning Zhuo’s eyes reddened, and with a hoarse voice, he replied resolutely, “Mother, I will definitely find a way! Don’t worry, I will claim the Immortal Palace, and I will save you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">Meng Yaoyin reached out, stroking Ning Zhuo’s face, her gaze filled with love: “Of course I believe in you, Zhuo'er. How fortunate I am to have such a good child.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">“I’ve accompanied you for so many years, and I’m already satisfied.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">“Seizing the Immortal Palace isn’t important.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">“Neither is your mother.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">“You need to live your own life and walk your own path…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">Ning Zhuo interrupted, “Mother! Don’t say that…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">He embraced his mother tightly. Now grown, he rarely wept, but tears fell this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">At sixteen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">“Mother, the situation has changed! The Lava Immortal Palace has lowered its entry requirement to Qi Refinement level… we may never get another chance in this lifetime!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Ning Zhuo made up his mind to blow up the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">He "coincidentally" encountered Ning Chen and Ning Yong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">Ning Chen provoked him, “If your uncle and aunt saw you struggling to survive in some small workshop, how would they feel?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">“They’d probably think: Look, Ning Zhuo didn’t know his limits. Without our help, he’s fallen into poverty, destined to be at the bottom of the cultivator ranks!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">Ning Zhuo pretended to be furious on the surface, but inside, he grew cautious: “Something’s not right with Ning Chen!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Little did Ning Chen know, Ning Zhuo was merely playing along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">Ning Zhuo later met Ning Zhanji. He and the family’s cultivators delved deep into Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Ning Zhanji lectured him, “You’re still young. Don’t get lost chasing money. Investing in yourself is the best way to succeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">“Once you reach Foundation Establishment, your life will be very different.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">At this moment, Ning Zhuo confirmed: “Ning Zhanji is the one plotting against me. Though there’s someone behind him... hmph, trying to ambush me? I’ll deal with him first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">After entering Fire Persimmon Mountain, Ning Zhuo used his Heart Seal to connect with the Buddha Doctor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">His eyes gleamed with that faint glow as he remotely controlled Buddha Doctor, cutting down Scarlet Flame Beasts, quickly setting up a simple formation as bait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">The Ning family cultivators soon fell into the trap—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">“A Lava Flame Demon Ape ahead!” A warning came from a scout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">The Ning family team ventured deeper, under attack from surrounding beasts, forming defensive formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">Buddha Doctor approached the Lava Immortal Palace, provoking an attack from Zheng Shuangou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">“Foolish thief, you dare covet the Immortal Palace? Leave your life behind!” Zheng Shuangou roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">The shadowy figure of the Buddha Doctor, controlled by Ning Zhuo, let out an eerie, old laugh: “The treasures of the cultivation world belong to those with fate. You think your Fire Persimmon City can monopolize the Lava Immortal Palace? Dream on!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">During the battle, the shadowy figure struck down Ning Zhanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">“Lord Ning Zhanji!” The Ning family cultivators shouted in shock. But Ning Zhanji fell, eyes wide open, dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">The explosion that freed the Immortal Palace sent shockwaves throughout the city, completely catching Ning Zhuo off guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">He, along with the other Ning family cultivators, was arrested and taken to prison for questioning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">To be safe, Ning Zhuo had Buddha Doctor follow at a distance, ready to rescue him if needed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Though Ning Zhuo passed the interrogation smoothly, an unexpected complication arose when leaving the dungeon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Chi Dun’s warning bell detected Buddha Doctor, leading him to find it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">A battle erupted between two Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">The Ning family cultivators panicked and fled, fearing to be caught in the crossfire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Ning Chen and Ning Yong tried to pull Ning Zhuo away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">But Ning Zhuo said, “Why run? The dungeon is the safest place!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">The two were stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">Ning Zhuo grabbed their hands, saying, “Trust me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">So, the three returned to the dungeon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Ning Chen and Ning Yong were restless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Ning Zhuo pretended to be relaxed, eating fruit and drinking tea while secretly focusing on controlling Buddha Doctor, engaging in battle while retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">At the critical moment, he thought of Fei Si and boldly controlled Buddha Doctor to rush into the fire persimmon forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">Fei Si’s reaction was just as Ning Zhuo had expected—he turned back and stopped Chi Dun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Ning Zhuo, under the alias “The Boy in Tresses,” gathered Sun Lingtong and Han Ming and successfully looted the Purple Sun Courtyard’s pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Ning Zhuo then deceived Han Ming successfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Sun Lingtong suggested testing the pills and keeping them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Ning Zhuo shook his head, “I strongly advise against that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">“This time, we accidentally encountered Meng Chong. He’s a grandson of a Nascent Soul cultivator, and our actions might be seen as an attempt against him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Ning Zhuo snorted, “Isn’t it simple? Just throw them into the Fire Persimmon Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">Sun Lingtong blinked, then his eyes gleamed as he clapped his hands, “Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">It truly was brilliant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">The pills were delivered to Buddha Doctor, effectively severing ties between “The Boy in Tresses,” Sun Lingtong, and the shadowy Buddha Doctor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">And with the purifying power of Buddha Doctor’s mechanisms, even if Foundation Establishment cultivators like Sun Lie had planted tracking methods in the pills, they would be cleansed completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">At the Fire Persimmon Festival, Chen Cha praised Yuan Dasheng’s reliability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">Ning Zhuo said nothing, his eyes gleaming with faint light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">He laughed coldly to himself: “Reliable?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">“I’ve plotted until now, waiting for this moment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">Suddenly, several mechanical monkeys broke free of their handlers and attacked Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">The assassination attempt failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">Yuan Dasheng returned to picking persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">On the mountainside, Ning Zhuo’s eyes glowed brighter, reaching their peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">“Come on, come on.” He whispered in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">The earlier assassination had drawn the attention of the Golden Core cultivators, and the explosion that followed shifted almost everyone’s focus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Taking advantage of this, Buddha Doctor shrank and slipped into a storage array within one of the explosive monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Once the mechanical monkeys had stored enough fire persimmons, they were remotely controlled to return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">They stood in a large formation circle, spitting out the stored fire persimmons, piling them on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">Whenever the pile reached a height of one zhang, the formation activated, teleporting the fire persimmons straight to the city lord’s granary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">In this way, the shadowy Buddha Doctor disappeared without a trace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">All the Golden Core cultivators looked grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">The Zhou family patriarch questioned Zhu Xuanji’s golden vision talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Zhu Xuanji arrogantly replied, “I’ll only tell you this: my golden vision talent is close to divine power. In over ten years with the Divine Constabulary, I’ve only met three Golden Core cultivators who could withstand my golden vision. Below the Golden Core level, nothing escapes my eyes!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Ning Zhuo’s spirit entered the Immortal Palace, and during the reward stage, he directly chose The Fire Cremation Prajñā Scripture!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">The Buddhist scripture’s contents quickly poured into Ning Zhuo’s mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">“As expected, it’s just as I thought!” Ning Zhuo was excited, but then froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">The scripture’s teachings moved him deeply!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">At that moment, he almost wept with joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">“Mother, The Fire Cremation Prajñā Scripture can refine spirits and strengthen your spirit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">“It must be the restriction in the Golden Furnace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">“Mother, I’ve found it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">The city lord’s mansion sent assassins to attack the three family geniuses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Ning Zhuo, in his secluded training chamber, was surrounded by floating clouds that obscured his vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">He turned his head, staring in a certain direction, his brows furrowed, his eyes gleaming with faint light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Buddha Doctor was hidden, always protecting Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Through Buddha Doctor, Ning Zhuo swiftly killed the assassins, his heart stirring: “Isn’t this the perfect chance to enhance mother’s spirit?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Buddha Doctor stored the assassins’ corpses, hiding in a carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Meanwhile, the Fire Cremation Prajñā Scripture secretly refined the small courtyard, drawing out points of spiritual light, channeling them into Buddha Doctor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Buddha Doctor regained its agility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">Its spirit increased, allowing it to display its innate immortal abilities and divine powers, further restoring its strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">“Mother!” Ning Zhuo choked up as he reunited with his mother in the midst of the fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">“Who... are you?” Buddha Doctor Meng Yaoyin asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Ning Zhuo froze completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Meng Yaoyin’s voice was soft, “Why do you feel so familiar to me? You must be someone very important to me, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">Ning Zhuo’s eyes reddened, his voice trembling, “Mother, I’m your son, Ning Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">“Ning... Zhuo?” Meng Yaoyin’s expression was filled with confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">She couldn’t remember.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
