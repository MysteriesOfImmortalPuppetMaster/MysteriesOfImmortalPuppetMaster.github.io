<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Returning to the mechanical dragon’s cabin, Ning Zhuo immediately began repairing his and Sun Lingtong's Sky Iron Heroic Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Due to their extreme usage, both sets of armor had sustained varying degrees of damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Simply repairing these damaged parts gave Ning Zhuo invaluable insights. Every weakness of the entire mechanical armor became vividly clear to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The weakest point was undoubtedly the Golden Wings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Due to their triple-folded design, the wings' structural integrity was significantly compromised. Each rapid change of direction during high-speed flight imposed tremendous stress upon the entire wing structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"The material of these Golden Wings must be upgraded even further!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Yet, these weren't his only gains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“My flying skills lag far behind the boss; I must practice harder.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“My spiritual sense perception also pales in comparison, though with my Divided Spirit Mirror, I can exceed him in that regard. It would be wise to modify my Mechanical Golden Swallows to carry small magical mirrors, amplifying my spiritual perception.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Relying solely on eyesight was severely limiting in aerial combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The area requiring observation in aerial battles was far broader than ground battles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Under these circumstances, spiritual perception became the ultimate reconnaissance tool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique Ning Zhuo cultivated had a distinct characteristic: his natural spiritual perception was modest, but with external tools, he could leverage remarkable power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Extreme speed flight places stringent demands on physical toughness as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“If I hadn't significantly enhanced my physical condition through the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, my body couldn't withstand such intense flight.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Additionally, the Five Organs Temple Divine Technique has induced mutations in my organs, greatly easing the strain they can endure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Despite these adaptations, once Ning Zhuo removed the Sky Iron Heroic Armor, he found numerous bruises newly adorning his body, alongside considerable internal bleeding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Although his five organs had mutated, the human body comprised more than just these; the so-called "five viscera and six bowels" still had their vulnerable points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Immersed in the improvement of mechanical creations, Ning Zhuo was suddenly interrupted two days later by Sun Lingtong, who summoned him to the dragon's head cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">They had finally reached the Ghostly Black Marshlands!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Ten-Thousand Li Traversing Dragon slipped out from the void, shrinking to its smallest size as it glided silently high above.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Looking down from the heights, the Ghostly Black Marshlands resembled the torn entrails of an ancient deity, scattered like rotten fragments carelessly discarded upon a dark, swampy ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">A thin veil of green mist drifted lazily over the entire marshland.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Hundreds of floating islands lingered or slowly drifted atop the water, primarily formed from decaying vegetation and pale skeletal remains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Thick layers of corpse moss blanketed these islands, emitting eerie phosphorescent glows in structured networks resembling ghostly veins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Between these floating islands, colossal Soul-Ferrying Lotus flowers had been repurposed into unique Soul-Ferrying Lanterns specific to the Ghostly Black Marshlands. Their spectral blue flames turned the pitch-black water into an ethereal galaxy, within which faintly glowing souls drifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Wandering Dragon moved quietly through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">With their expansive field of vision, Sun and Ning easily spotted the main channel - the Dark Flood Dragon River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This river resembled an enraged, dark-green centipede, running from southeast to northwest, piercing through the heart of the marshlands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The river was deep but calm, bordered by pale, bone-exposed banks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Legend held this river to be transformed from a Dark Flood Dragon deity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Numerous bone-like spikes floated ominously upon its surface, belonging to the Spinepiercing Crocodiles, undisputed apex predators inhabiting the river. They excavated nests along the banks, burrowing deep into the white bones beneath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Look over there," Sun Lingtong indicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Following his direction, Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up - he discovered a hidden village.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The village was obscured in the shadow of a corpse-moss-covered floating island, constructed intricately from ship planks, masts, and enormous ribs resembling those of giants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The fortress walls absorbed the surrounding light, shimmering faintly like a slick coat of oil gliding across the surface - clearly the product of extraordinary forging methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Countless corpses piled high at the base of the walls, while atop the battlements sat myriad skulls from all kinds of creatures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">As the fortress gates swung open, several sleek ships crafted from reddish hardwood burst forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Of the cultivators piloting these vessels, only a small fraction were human; the majority belonged to the Ghostman Tribe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Members of the Ghostman Tribe were intelligent beings, half-human and half-ghost. The males typically had fierce and horrifying appearances, while the females were stunningly beautiful. Their skin varied wildly, spanning shades of crimson, emerald, sapphire, ebony, ivory, and golden hues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Their eyes were particularly striking, with black sclera surrounding eerily pale pupils - an attribute that allowed them to clearly perceive spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Each hardwood vessel was etched with intricate forbidden runes, fashioned as formidable warships, each propelled by twenty lengthy oars. Both bow and stern curved dramatically upwards, sculpted into the likeness of dragons’ heads and tails.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The human cultivators aboard remained silent and grim-faced, anxiety clearly visible. In stark contrast, the Ghostman Tribe cultivators loudly shouted, their wild hair whipping in the wind, limbs exposed, and heads crowned with sharp horns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The three warships sped uniformly across the river, creating an intriguing spectacle that drew the curiosity of Sun and Ning. Where could these local cultivators be rushing off to so urgently?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Initially, Sun Ning's plan had been cautious: slowly infiltrating the town before heading toward White Paper City, carefully assuming the identities of local cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">However, seeing this unexpected urgency, the pair swiftly deliberated and chose instead to direct their Ten Thousand Li Dragon, soaring swiftly through the skies, tracking the direction of the warships below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">From their lofty vantage point, it wasn’t long before they spotted signs of recent battle. The river ahead was strewn with the wreckage of numerous ships and the massive carcasses of Bone-Chilling Crocodiles, several as large as war elephants, each radiating the oppressive aura of Foundation Establishment-level beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Most conspicuous among them was one crocodile corpse, belly-up and drifting on the current. It was enormous, easily two or three times the size of the warships dispatched from the Ghostman Tribe’s village. Its hide was ravaged by wounds, its blood staining the river red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This scene unmistakably spoke of a fierce battle, with catastrophic losses on both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo quickly noticed several weary cultivators resting on the shore, desperately rescuing comrades from the deadly waters, while surviving Bone-Chilling Crocodiles feasted indiscriminately upon floating corpses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“A perfect opportunity, Little Zhuo!” Sun Lingtong whispered eagerly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Big brother, do you mean...” Ning Zhuo immediately grasped his companion’s intent, their bond of understanding unshakeable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Their tiny Ten Thousand Li Dragon slipped quietly amidst the chaos unnoticed - these cultivators, mere Foundation-stage at best, would never detect it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Carefully selecting two corpses whose injuries were less severe and whose garments were plain, they swiftly stashed them inside their dragon construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Within moments, Sun Lingtong skillfully invoked his Thief Art, meticulously molding their appearances to match the deceased. Shortly afterward, Ning Zhuo had transformed into a freckled, yellow-faced human youth, while Sun Lingtong took the guise of a stout and diminutive Ghostman Tribe member.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Exiting the dragon construct, Ning Zhuo feigned unconsciousness as Sun Lingtong, pretending to barely hold on, struggled through the water clutching Ning Zhuo. They were quickly spotted by the exhausted cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“There's a Ghostman Tribe member over here!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“That boy is the Jia family’s third son, Jiao Ma!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Together, the survivors swiftly pulled the disguised Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong to safety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Feigning continued unconsciousness, Ning Zhuo lay unmoving while Sun Lingtong retched dramatically, expelling mouthfuls of river water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Concerned cultivators immediately approached, examining them carefully. One clapped Sun Lingtong encouragingly on the back. “You two got lucky; your injuries are minimal!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Another roughly shook Ning Zhuo awake: “Freckles, Freckles, wake up!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Feigning pain, Ning Zhuo reluctantly opened his eyes, appearing dazed and unfocused. He parted his lips as though to speak, yet remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Impressive acting skills,” Sun Lingtong silently applauded from the corner of his eye, proud of his younger brother’s performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">And indeed, Ning Zhuo’s act was flawless. Having been meticulously trained by Sun Lingtong since childhood, fooling even formidable figures like Meng Kui, deceiving mere village cultivators was a simple feat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Meanwhile, thanks to the Evil God's Bone Marrow, Sun Lingtong's Thief Art had greatly increased in potency, making their impersonation seamless and utterly convincing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo, disguised as Scorched Numbskin, was warmly greeted by many who recognized him, showering him with care and concern. However, Sun Lingtong, who portrayed a member of the Short-legged Ghostman Tribe, was completely ignored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">In any case, the surrounding cultivators quickly accepted them without the slightest hint of suspicion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Shortly after, three reinforcement warships arrived, rescuing the survivors. The leader, a Golden Core-level ghostman cultivator, wore a grim expression. "This river section has always been safe. How could a swarm of Bone-Chilling Crocodiles suddenly appear?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He sent scouts to investigate but found nothing suspicious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Golden Core ghostman cultivator then personally questioned the survivors, including Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, but learned nothing of value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">When questioning Ning Zhuo, the leader personally cast a healing spell on him and offered words of comfort. Ning Zhuo quickly sensed that he and this ghostman leader shared a significant relationship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Proactively, Ning Zhuo suggested returning to the village to reconsider the situation. The Golden Core leader stared at him thoughtfully, noticing something unusual in Ning Zhuo's tone but didn't suspect much, only shaking his head gravely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He stepped onto a nearby rock, surveying the area, and announced, "Your trip was to deliver a bride to Whitepaper City, but you've encountered an ambush halfway. Although we've found no clues, similar incidents have occurred frequently across various villages recently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"We cannot turn back; we must continue toward Whitepaper City. This time, I'll personally lead you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">With his high prestige and status as the only Golden Core cultivator present, no one dared object. Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong exchanged covert, disappointed glances - they had hoped to return to the village for better cover. Ironically, their disguises had trapped them into proceeding immediately to Whitepaper City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Delivering a bride? What's this about? Was the village forming an alliance through marriage, prompting enemies to strike?" Ning Zhuo wondered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun Lingtong added, puzzled, "But where’s the bride? I don't see any woman ready for marriage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"This isn't our concern. Should we sneak away later?" Ning Zhuo suggested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong nodded subtly. "Sounds good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">They secretly communicated through divine sense while outwardly following the group onto the warship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Scorched Numbskin, come here," the Golden Core ghostman leader suddenly beckoned to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Curious, Ning Zhuo approached him. The leader handed him a treasure, sighing softly, "You risked your life picking a Ghost-faced Banyan fruit for my daughter. Unfortunately, you've been chosen as the male consort for Whitepaper City's lord. Our village is too weak to defy White Paper City's orders."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Fate does not favor your union with my daughter. Accept this - a Golden Core-level Bone-Chilling Crocodile's stomach I've personally refined for you. Later, you must let your soul enter and endure its corrosion before recovering. It will greatly enhance your soul's resilience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Shocked by this revelation, Ning Zhuo remained speechless. The leader gently patted his shoulder. "Don't think about returning to the village or escaping midway. From now on, stay beside me; I'll guide you personally through the crocodile bag cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo felt helpless under such close surveillance. Escaping alone would be impossible without Sun Lingtong's thievery techniques. However, Sun Lingtong found the situation hilarious, silently chuckling, "Little Zhuo, you're incredibly lucky. We should continue with this plan; there's no need to create another fake identity elsewhere."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Lingtong, sensing Ning Zhuo's hesitation, coaxed further, "This identity, though accidental, is very valuable. You've already gained a Golden Core-level crocodile bag without effort. Plus, the White Paper City lord is a Nascent Soul cultivator; she certainly wouldn't mistreat her male consort. Your cultivation method benefits from dual cultivation. Imagine dual cultivating with a Nascent Soul-level female cultivator!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo grew thoughtful, "Well, that's true..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong continued enticingly, "Of course, it depends on how the dual cultivation happens. If it’s harmful, we simply leave. After all, we possess the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon technique. Besides, even if we don’t dual cultivate, this identity alone can reap plenty of benefits."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Gradually persuaded, Ning Zhuo began to see merit in Sun Lingtong's words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong playfully transmitted through divine sense, "Doesn't this sound thrilling?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Previously, Ning Zhuo might have disagreed, but after witnessing Elder Long's heroic sacrifice and countless deaths during the Two Note Kingdom war, his heart brimmed with newfound courage and ambition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Finally, Ning Zhuo silently agreed, "Indeed, this could become a fascinating adventure. According to the leader, others were similarly ambushed, meaning there's a force targeting Whitepaper City's lord. Moreover, if the city lord is gathering many consorts, I can easily blend in and fish in troubled waters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong excitedly chimed in, "Who knows? Maybe we’ll even sneak into the City Lord’s treasury!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
