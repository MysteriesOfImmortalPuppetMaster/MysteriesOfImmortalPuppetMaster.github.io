<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 83: Yuan Dasheng vs Meng Chong</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Room 3.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Meng Chong’s puppet body was wreathed in lightning as he rushed toward the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The moment their paths crossed, Dasheng seized a fleeting opportunity and grabbed Meng Chong’s arms with its large hands, following through with an over-the-shoulder throw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Meng Chong slammed into the floor tiles, and his world spun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Then he saw Dasheng’s broad foot stomping down toward him, carrying a fierce whistling wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Meng Chong’s heart trembled and inwardly called out, "Ferocious Rushing Thunder!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Lightning flared around him, and he vanished from his original spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In the next moment, Dasheng’s right foot stomped down hard, shattering the floor tiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Meng Chong had pulled away, spirit power surging around him. His heart was heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He had already been thrown over Dasheng’s shoulder twice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"This is a formidable opponent!" Meng Chong quickly adjusted his mindset.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Yuan Dasheng’s attack missed, but it didn’t make another move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The scene entered a brief stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Outside the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a meditation mat in his private underground workspace. His eyes were shut tight, and his mind was fully focused on the battle inside the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">On one side was Meng Chong, on the other was Yuan Dasheng. Both possessed immortal talent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Meng Chong’s puppet body, in terms of materials and structure, is far inferior to Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng. This hampers his combat performance, but his immortal talent of Ferocious Rushing Thunder still lets him pose a significant threat. He is also a living person; his battle intelligence far exceeds that of the spirituality-driven Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng’s advantage lies in its mechanical body, which was crafted specially by the Lava Immortal Palace. Its materials and construction are far superior to Meng Chong’s puppet body. The drawback is that its spirituality is only 80%. It's not truly alive, and its thinking is much less adaptable than Meng Chong’s.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"According to the Lava Immortal Palace, even with 80% spirituality, it can still activate its immortal talent of Righteous Bone Golden Hardness. I wonder what it will look like when actually used."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo was constantly evaluating both sides' strength in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He placed great importance on this battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The result of this fight would heavily influence his future decisions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Ferocious Rushing Thunder." Meng Chong silently called out in his heart and abruptly charged at Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng for a third time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He quickly closed the distance and was almost right in front of Dasheng’s face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">When he saw Dasheng stretch out both hands, his spirit soared and he went all out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">In an instant, lightning blazed from his puppet body, further boosting Meng Chong’s speed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This was the fruit of his recent special training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">His vision blurred and he zipped behind Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Success!" Meng Chong was overjoyed and moved to strike Dasheng’s back. But the next moment, something yanked his legs, his body rapidly lost balance, and his attack collapsed completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">As Meng Chong fell, he caught sight of the culprit that sabotaged him. "Damn it, it’s the tail!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Yuan Dasheng’s tail had wrapped around Meng Chong’s left leg like a whip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Then Yuan Dasheng let out a low growl and turned around. Stepping forward, it raised its fist high and smashed it toward Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Meng Chong was still suspended in midair as darkness enveloped his vision. Yuan Dasheng was like a looming mountain bearing down, covering his whole field of view.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Yuan Dasheng’s raised fist ripped through the air like a falling meteor, bringing with it a chilling wind that shook Meng Chong to the core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Ferocious Rushing Thunder!" Meng Chong used all his strength to activate his immortal talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Lightning erupted, allowing him to break free from the monkey tail and regain his freedom. He narrowly dodged the strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the next moment, Yuan Dasheng’s fist smashed against the floor like an iron hammer, shattering the tiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">A flicker of lightning flashed to a corner of the room, dispersing to reveal the puppet-bodied Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Seeing Yuan Dasheng’s fist embedded in the floor, Meng Chong couldn’t help but suck in a sharp breath. If he had been hit, his fragile puppet body would’ve been completely destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">But this kind of danger only stirred Meng Chong’s fighting spirit even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Hahaha.” He laughed heartily. “Now this is a challenge. This is fun!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He shrouded himself in azure lightning once more and rushed out again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Although his immortal talent was activated repeatedly, he didn’t recklessly approach Yuan Dasheng this time. Instead, he turned into a bolt of lightning that flickered all around Room 3.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This bolt of lightning was extremely fast, leaving behind streaks of electricity in Yuan Dasheng’s vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">As time passed, the lingering lightning in the room grew more numerous, crisscrossing until it formed a giant net with Yuan Dasheng at the center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred as he watched. “So Meng Chong has withstood the pressure and made a breakthrough in the heat of battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“He’s able to continuously maintain his maximum speed, and is even slightly faster than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“This is the power of a super-grade innate talent!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Witnessing it firsthand left Ning Zhuo deeply moved. It truly was worthy of the name “immortal talent”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Room 3 was now filled with crisscrossing lightning, while Yuan Dasheng stood silently like an ancient tree rooted to the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">All it could do was defend itself passively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Meng Chong was far too fast. Yuan Dasheng’s spirituality told it that stillness was the best response to all change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Suddenly, a bolt of lightning veered toward Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yuan Dasheng raised a hand to block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A heavy boom sounded out as it was pushed back one large step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Meng Chong’s lightning form bounced off the wall, quickly regaining its lost speed to continue blitzing through the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">From time to time, Meng Chong would launch surprise attacks. Yuan Dasheng couldn’t match his speed, and as it kept defending passively, its body began accumulating wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Meng Chong laughed loudly, knowing he had gained the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"This mechanical ape’s close combat ability is too strong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Its martial arts skills are at least master level. No, it very well may be a martial arts grandmaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"But it can’t keep up with my speed. As long as I keep rushing, I’ll wear it down for sure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Just as Meng Chong thought this, his expression suddenly changed drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Crack crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The lightning around his body flickered twice, then dimmed significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He had exposed a fatal opening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Almost instantly, Yuan Dasheng let out a long roar and took several rapid strides forward. After just two or three steps, it had already closed the distance to Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Yuan Dasheng hunched its shoulders and rammed forward. Meng Chong’s momentum had suddenly weakened, and he couldn’t dodge in time. He was struck head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The puppet-bodied Meng Chong was like a giant projectile as he slammed into the wall. His right leg was torn off from the impact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After crashing into the wall, he bounced forward slightly. He lifted his head only to feel a powerful gust sweep over him as Yuan Dasheng pressed forward like a dark mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Yuan Dasheng lifted its thigh, and its knee whistled forward like a steel spike spearing through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Meng Chong instinctively raised both hands and crossed them in front of his chest to block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">In the next moment, his puppet hands and forearms were shattered by Yuan Dasheng’s strike, crushed like dried twigs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Meng Chong’s chest suffered a heavy blow, and more than half of it caved in. His whole body blasted upward toward the ceiling through the immense impact force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">As his back slammed against the ceiling, a web of cracks spread out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Meng Chong gritted his teeth silently. After such a savage beating, his fury and fighting spirit were greater than ever before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">But he couldn’t activate his Ferocious Rushing Thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Twisting in midair, he adjusted himself so that his head was down and his feet were up. He kicked off the ceiling with one foot and launched himself diagonally to avoid being caught by Yuan Dasheng’s follow-up blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But Yuan Dasheng remained standing in place, watching as Meng Chong shot off at an angle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The mechanical ape’s chest swelled noticeably, as if it had just taken a deep breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Its right palm trembled slightly, and the talisman runes engraved there began shining with a radiant glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
