<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Nine Layers Peak!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt unprecedentedly powerful.<br/>
<br/>
When he was at the eighth layer, he had frantically purified himself, completely eliminating any foreign qi within his body, solidifying his foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Now that he had reached the ninth layer, he realized that the purification of the Three Treasures cultivation still needed to continue.<br/>
<br/>
His cultivation had advanced too quickly and needed to be consolidated.<br/>
<br/>
In this regard, he had to slow down.<br/>
<br/>
As the saying goes, sharpening the axe does not delay the work of chopping firewood.<br/>
<br/>
Haste makes waste!<br/>
<br/>
"While refining and purifying the ninth layer of mana, I need to find a method for Foundation Establishment. There should be one in the Lava Immortal Palace!" According to Ning Zhuo's speculation, after pushing open the third Buddha Gate and passing through three checkpoints, the method for Foundation Establishment should be there.<br/>
<br/>
"Just having the method for Foundation Establishment seems insufficient. From what I've read, many people seek Foundation Establishment materials to maximize their success rate." Not everyone can successfully establish their foundation.<br/>
<br/>
For someone like Ning Zhuo, who cultivates three dantians simultaneously, the difficulty of Foundation Establishment is far greater than usual.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was not very confident.<br/>
<br/>
His confidence largely came from the Three Sect Masters.<br/>
<br/>
According to Ning Zhuo's thinking, since the Three Sect Masters left behind these three cultivation methods, they wouldn't have left behind immature techniques just to harm future generations.<br/>
<br/>
"Given their nature, they should have left many auxiliary items for Foundation Establishment as rewards." Ning Zhuo had already arranged for the purification of the ninth layer of mana.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, when he was at the eighth layer, he hadn't used up the number of times he could use the Profound Ice Pure Snow Talisman, saving it for the ninth layer.<br/>
<br/>
"Plus, with the Pure One Pill, formations, Clear Source Treasure Mirror, and Tornado Windmill, the purification and refinement of mana can be completed quickly!" Preparing for Foundation Establishment, crafting Golden Core Stage mechanical apes, and exploring the Lava Immortal Palace were the three major tasks before Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
After some thought, he decided to focus on exploring the Immortal Palace!<br/>
<br/>
The reason was simple.<br/>
<br/>
Whether it was Foundation Establishment or crafting Golden Core Stage mechanical apes, these two tasks, if done solely by Ning Zhuo, would yield low results.<br/>
<br/>
Exploring the Immortal Palace, if fruitful, would greatly advance both tasks.<br/>
<br/>
He then summoned layers of floating clouds to cover himself and entered the Immortal Palace with his soul.<br/>
<br/>
By now, even if he entered the palace alone and was discovered, he wouldn't be highly suspected.<br/>
<br/>
However, this time, after entering the Immortal Palace, he didn't find anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
This was one of the purposes of Ning Zhuo's previous active selling of subsequent cultivation methods!<br/>
<br/>
Almost everyone was frantically cultivating, striving to reach the peak of the sixth layer as soon as possible to push open the second Dao Gate.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, alone, passed through more than a dozen checkpoints.<br/>
<br/>
The entire Immortal Palace was empty, as if time had turned back to when he first explored the palace.<br/>
<br/>
When he arrived at the third transfer hall, he chose the third Buddha Gate without hesitation and pushed it open.<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace, main hall.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit saw Ning Zhuo pushing open the Buddha Gate and was so shocked that it fell off its throne, landing on the floor with a thud.<br/>
<br/>
It never expected Ning Zhuo to have cultivated to the peak of the ninth layer.<br/>
<br/>
How could he be so fast?!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit fell into extreme disbelief.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit hadn't observed this secret.<br/>
<br/>
Since Ning Zhuo used the Floating Cloud Cloak to conceal himself, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had consciously reduced its observation of him.<br/>
<br/>
Its insight came from the Lava Immortal Palace, very domineering, able to see through the floating clouds and see Ning Zhuo's true state.<br/>
<br/>
But doing so would cause the floating clouds to consume rapidly, making Ning Zhuo suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit didn't want to be so blunt; it was very worried that this little monster, Ning Zhuo, would discover its presence.<br/>
<br/>
So, it only now truly understood Ning Zhuo's real cultivation level.<br/>
<br/>
However, what shocked it even more was yet to come!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pushed open the third Buddha Gate and, upon entering the first checkpoint, found the process cumbersome and time-consuming.<br/>
<br/>
So, Ning Zhuo used the Buddha Heart Seal to retreat from the checkpoint and returned to the transfer hall.<br/>
<br/>
From the transfer hall, he continued, pushing open the third Dao Gate and the third Demon Gate.<br/>
<br/>
The checkpoint behind the Dao Gate was very difficult, and Ning Zhuo didn't have confidence for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
The first room behind the Demon Gate was a special checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators could use the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to pass through layers of tests and ultimately obtain blood path diagrams of varying quality.<br/>
<br/>
After some consideration, Ning Zhuo returned to the Buddha Gate route.<br/>
<br/>
From beginning to end, this route was still the most suitable for him!<br/>
<br/>
Essence Sea Ninth Layer Peak!<br/>
<br/>
Qi Sea Ninth Layer Peak!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit saw Ning Zhuo entering and exiting the three gates as easily as drinking water and was utterly stunned!<br/>
<br/>
"What exactly happened to Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
"Could it be the previous dual cultivation?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had paid attention to the battle in the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, the ghostly mist vortex hadn't completely obscured its insight.<br/>
<br/>
However, even though the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew that Ning Zhuo had interacted with the Golden Core Stage Yang Chanyu, Ning Zhuo's current rapid advancement in cultivation was still abnormal.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was in the know; it knew the detailed content of the Three Sect Masters' techniques.<br/>
<br/>
From the seventh layer to the ninth layer, the Three Sect Masters' techniques highly emphasized the accumulation of powerful mana.<br/>
<br/>
The degree of cultivation accumulation was three times that of the early and middle stages combined!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Yang Chanyu had generated the Two Elements Qi, but the process hadn't lasted long.<br/>
<br/>
"Why is the effect so good?"<br/>
<br/>
"Is it because of Ning Zhuo's innate talent, or because it was Yang Chanyu's first dual cultivation?" However, these speculations were no longer that important.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit fell into a panic.<br/>
<br/>
It got up and paced anxiously in the main hall.<br/>
<br/>
The fruits of its labor over so many years were almost being destroyed recently!<br/>
<br/>
A large number of cultivators with mechanical expertise had entered the Immortal Palace, frantically working for the Lava Immortal Palace, accumulating more and more contributions.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji had even retrieved the damaged Mechanical Demon General.<br/>
<br/>
One must know that back then, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had tried countless times and spent a lot of effort to make the Mechanical Demon General fall outside.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's fear grew day by day.<br/>
<br/>
It longed for freedom and wanted to control its own spiritual life.<br/>
<br/>
But currently, its hope of breaking free from its shackles and regaining freedom was getting smaller and smaller.<br/>
<br/>
It roared unwillingly, spewing flames into the sky.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace erupted into chaos again!<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators within the Immortal Palace were immediately in danger.<br/>
<br/>
Massive fire energy rampaged everywhere, and huge tides of magma surged back into the Lava Immortal Palace, alarming the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts, which reappeared around the palace.<br/>
<br/>
Even Golden Core Stage cultivators had to give their all to protect themselves and their lives at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
"Come on, come and fight me!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit desperately hoped Meng Kui would attack it, roaring in its heart.<br/>
<br/>
But Meng Kui sat quietly in the depths of the smoke and clouds, overlooking the palace's chaos.<br/>
<br/>
He didn't act immediately.<br/>
<br/>
He waited until many mechanical cultivators in the palace had suffered heavy casualties before using the Fire Persimmon Immortal City's Grand Formation to start suppressing the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't hear the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's roars and maintained the current situation as usual, striving for stability!<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Kui, you fool!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so angry it spewed fire.<br/>
<br/>
While others were frantically cultivating the subsequent techniques, Ning Zhuo was fully focused on passing the checkpoints.<br/>
<br/>
The third Buddha Gate, the first checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
The teleportation light group spat out a damaged kung fu puppet onto the workbench.<br/>
<br/>
The countdown began.<br/>
<br/>
The invisible barrier in front of Ning Zhuo disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
He stepped forward to the workbench and immediately examined the kung fu puppet.<br/>
<br/>
"Cracks in the chest array, leg joints stuck, right arm missing." Ning Zhuo summarized in his mind and then asked himself, "How should I repair it?" There were many ways to repair it, but the tools and materials on the workbench were very limited.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed.<br/>
<br/>
The first checkpoint of the third Buddha Gate tested the trial disciple's repair ability.<br/>
<br/>
The challenger would face various damaged mechanical constructs and had to repair them using limited time, materials, and tools.<br/>
<br/>
This was the twelfth mechanical construct Ning Zhuo had repaired consecutively.<br/>
<br/>
"The provided materials allow me to make an arm to replace the missing one on the kung fu puppet."<br/>
<br/>
"I should try to replicate its intact left arm."<br/>
<br/>
"No, that's wrong."<br/>
<br/>
"This might be a trap! I should first examine the internal array." Ning Zhuo took out the mechanical tool, the Array Sound Hammer.<br/>
<br/>
He carefully tapped the puppet's chest with the hammer.<br/>
<br/>
Each tap was followed by a pause, listening intently to the clear sound the hammer produced.<br/>
<br/>
The sound entered his ears, and in his mind, thoughts arose, stimulated by the sound, quickly condensing into a corner of the array.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's repeated tapping gradually completed the array diagram in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
From the complete diagram, he quickly identified the missing and damaged parts.<br/>
<br/>
He also determined the type of array.<br/>
<br/>
"Indeed, it's a trap!"<br/>
<br/>
"This array integrates the puppet's limbs. The puppet has a left arm, but its right limb is a drill." If Ning Zhuo had replicated the left arm and forged a right arm, he would have fallen into the trap and failed this task.<br/>
<br/>
"So, the Three Sect Masters want to teach us that repairing mechanical constructs shouldn't be preconceived. Making judgments first is wrong; we should conduct thorough investigations and observations." Ning Zhuo understood the painstaking efforts of the Three Sect Masters.<br/>
<br/>
After repairing the kung fu puppet, he smoothly entered the next task.<br/>
<br/>
After repairing thirty-three mechanical constructs consecutively, Ning Zhuo reached the second checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Roar!<br/>
<br/>
A living Fire Fusion Demon Ape appeared before him, startling Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly noticed that this Fire Fusion Demon Ape was injured, able to stand only on one leg.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully observed, "Oh, it has an arrow in its knee."<br/>
<br/>
The checkpoint's explanation was transmitted to his mind through the Life-Hanging Thread.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo understood: the second checkpoint required him to work on living beings, creating mechanical prosthetics to benefit those with disabilities!<br/>
<br/>
The second checkpoint's difficulty was much higher than the first.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo failed several times, consulted various texts, and even used some of his pavilion credits at the All-Book Pavilion to exchange for relevant mechanical blueprints to improve his skills before finally passing the checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
The third checkpoint of the Buddha Gate was even more challenging.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn't control the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and could only let it fight freely.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo acted as the repairman after each fierce battle.<br/>
<br/>
However, during the checkpoint, he could collect the defeated demon beasts and mechanical puppets, repair them, and use them to assist Dasheng in battle.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo struggled, barely winning each small checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Dasheng was very intelligent, but the checkpoint's difficulty was too high! Ning Zhuo exhausted all his efforts, racking his brains to collect, repair, and add auxiliary combat power for it.<br/>
<br/>
The battle damage was too high!<br/>
<br/>
Often, the auxiliary combat power collected in the first battle was entirely consumed by the second battle.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's best record was once stuck at the fifth small checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Until a flash of inspiration revealed the correct path to pass the checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that although he couldn't participate in the battle or directly control the constructs or demon beasts, he could still use his repair tools during the fight.<br/>
<br/>
"The Three Sect Masters want to train and test our ability to repair constructs during intense battles." Realizing this, Ning Zhuo's record soared.<br/>
<br/>
He reached the thirty-third checkpoint, where the difficulty was at a commercial level.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn't keep up with the repairs, and his hard-earned auxiliary combat power was quickly overwhelmed by the massive enemy forces, leaving him no chance to repair during the battle.<br/>
<br/>
After failing three times, Ning Zhuo reached the thirty-third small checkpoint for the fourth time.<br/>
<br/>
Determined, he didn't withdraw the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Dasheng, following Ning Zhuo's pre-battle instructions, fiercely activated the Immortal Bone Golden Firmness!<br/>
<br/>
The immortal power made it invincible.<br/>
<br/>
With the strength of a single ape, it slaughtered the numerous opponents.<br/>
<br/>
Dasheng was battered and paid a heavy price, but it pushed Ning Zhuo through the third checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo had guessed, he pushed open the third checkpoint's door and reached the end of this trial route!<br/>
<br/>
The method for Foundation Establishment was transmitted to his mind, along with other rewards placed before him.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's weak voice reached Ning Zhuo's ears, "Little... Little Spirit greets Master."<br/>
