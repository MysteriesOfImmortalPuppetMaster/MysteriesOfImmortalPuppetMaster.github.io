<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Nine Layers Peak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo felt unprecedentedly powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">When he was at the eighth layer, he had frantically purified himself, completely eliminating any foreign qi within his body, solidifying his foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Now that he had reached the ninth layer, he realized that the purification of the Three Treasures cultivation still needed to continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">His cultivation had advanced too quickly and needed to be consolidated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In this regard, he had to slow down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">As the saying goes, sharpening the axe does not delay the work of chopping firewood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Haste makes waste!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"While refining and purifying the ninth layer of mana, I need to find a method for Foundation Establishment. There should be one in the Lava Immortal Palace!" According to Ning Zhuo's speculation, after pushing open the third Buddha Gate and passing through three checkpoints, the method for Foundation Establishment should be there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Just having the method for Foundation Establishment seems insufficient. From what I've read, many people seek Foundation Establishment materials to maximize their success rate." Not everyone can successfully establish their foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">For someone like Ning Zhuo, who cultivates three dantians simultaneously, the difficulty of Foundation Establishment is far greater than usual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo was not very confident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">His confidence largely came from the Three Sect Masters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">According to Ning Zhuo's thinking, since the Three Sect Masters left behind these three cultivation methods, they wouldn't have left behind immature techniques just to harm future generations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Given their nature, they should have left many auxiliary items for Foundation Establishment as rewards." Ning Zhuo had already arranged for the purification of the ninth layer of mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Previously, when he was at the eighth layer, he hadn't used up the number of times he could use the Profound Ice Pure Snow Talisman, saving it for the ninth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Plus, with the Pure One Pill, formations, Clear Source Treasure Mirror, and Tornado Windmill, the purification and refinement of mana can be completed quickly!" Preparing for Foundation Establishment, crafting Golden Core Stage mechanical apes, and exploring the Lava Immortal Palace were the three major tasks before Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After some thought, he decided to focus on exploring the Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The reason was simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Whether it was Foundation Establishment or crafting Golden Core Stage mechanical apes, these two tasks, if done solely by Ning Zhuo, would yield low results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Exploring the Immortal Palace, if fruitful, would greatly advance both tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He then summoned layers of floating clouds to cover himself and entered the Immortal Palace with his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">By now, even if he entered the palace alone and was discovered, he wouldn't be highly suspected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">However, this time, after entering the Immortal Palace, he didn't find anyone else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This was one of the purposes of Ning Zhuo's previous active selling of subsequent cultivation methods!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Almost everyone was frantically cultivating, striving to reach the peak of the sixth layer as soon as possible to push open the second Dao Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo, alone, passed through more than a dozen checkpoints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The entire Immortal Palace was empty, as if time had turned back to when he first explored the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">When he arrived at the third transfer hall, he chose the third Buddha Gate without hesitation and pushed it open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Lava Immortal Palace, main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit saw Ning Zhuo pushing open the Buddha Gate and was so shocked that it fell off its throne, landing on the floor with a thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">It never expected Ning Zhuo to have cultivated to the peak of the ninth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">How could he be so fast?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit fell into extreme disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit hadn't observed this secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Since Ning Zhuo used the Floating Cloud Cloak to conceal himself, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had consciously reduced its observation of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Its insight came from the Lava Immortal Palace, very domineering, able to see through the floating clouds and see Ning Zhuo's true state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">But doing so would cause the floating clouds to consume rapidly, making Ning Zhuo suspicious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit didn't want to be so blunt; it was very worried that this little monster, Ning Zhuo, would discover its presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">So, it only now truly understood Ning Zhuo's real cultivation level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">However, what shocked it even more was yet to come!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo pushed open the third Buddha Gate and, upon entering the first checkpoint, found the process cumbersome and time-consuming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">So, Ning Zhuo used the Buddha Heart Seal to retreat from the checkpoint and returned to the transfer hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">From the transfer hall, he continued, pushing open the third Dao Gate and the third Demon Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The checkpoint behind the Dao Gate was very difficult, and Ning Zhuo didn't have confidence for the time being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The first room behind the Demon Gate was a special checkpoint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Cultivators could use the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to pass through layers of tests and ultimately obtain blood path diagrams of varying quality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">After some consideration, Ning Zhuo returned to the Buddha Gate route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">From beginning to end, this route was still the most suitable for him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Essence Sea Ninth Layer Peak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Qi Sea Ninth Layer Peak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit saw Ning Zhuo entering and exiting the three gates as easily as drinking water and was utterly stunned!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"What exactly happened to Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Could it be the previous dual cultivation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had paid attention to the battle in the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">At that time, the ghostly mist vortex hadn't completely obscured its insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">However, even though the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew that Ning Zhuo had interacted with the Golden Core Stage Yang Chanyu, Ning Zhuo's current rapid advancement in cultivation was still abnormal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was in the know; it knew the detailed content of the Three Sect Masters' techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">From the seventh layer to the ninth layer, the Three Sect Masters' techniques highly emphasized the accumulation of powerful mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The degree of cultivation accumulation was three times that of the early and middle stages combined!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo and Yang Chanyu had generated the Two Elements Qi, but the process hadn't lasted long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Why is the effect so good?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Is it because of Ning Zhuo's innate talent, or because it was Yang Chanyu's first dual cultivation?" However, these speculations were no longer that important.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit fell into a panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">It got up and paced anxiously in the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The fruits of its labor over so many years were almost being destroyed recently!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">A large number of cultivators with mechanical expertise had entered the Immortal Palace, frantically working for the Lava Immortal Palace, accumulating more and more contributions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhu Xuanji had even retrieved the damaged Mechanical Demon General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">One must know that back then, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had tried countless times and spent a lot of effort to make the Mechanical Demon General fall outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's fear grew day by day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">It longed for freedom and wanted to control its own spiritual life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But currently, its hope of breaking free from its shackles and regaining freedom was getting smaller and smaller.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">It roared unwillingly, spewing flames into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Lava Immortal Palace erupted into chaos again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Cultivators within the Immortal Palace were immediately in danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Massive fire energy rampaged everywhere, and huge tides of magma surged back into the Lava Immortal Palace, alarming the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts, which reappeared around the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Even Golden Core Stage cultivators had to give their all to protect themselves and their lives at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Come on, come and fight me!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit desperately hoped Meng Kui would attack it, roaring in its heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">But Meng Kui sat quietly in the depths of the smoke and clouds, overlooking the palace's chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He didn't act immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He waited until many mechanical cultivators in the palace had suffered heavy casualties before using the Fire Persimmon Immortal City's Grand Formation to start suppressing the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He couldn't hear the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's roars and maintained the current situation as usual, striving for stability!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Meng Kui, you fool!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so angry it spewed fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">While others were frantically cultivating the subsequent techniques, Ning Zhuo was fully focused on passing the checkpoints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The third Buddha Gate, the first checkpoint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The teleportation light group spat out a damaged kung fu puppet onto the workbench.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The countdown began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The invisible barrier in front of Ning Zhuo disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He stepped forward to the workbench and immediately examined the kung fu puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Cracks in the chest array, leg joints stuck, right arm missing." Ning Zhuo summarized in his mind and then asked himself, "How should I repair it?" There were many ways to repair it, but the tools and materials on the workbench were very limited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Indeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The first checkpoint of the third Buddha Gate tested the trial disciple's repair ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The challenger would face various damaged mechanical constructs and had to repair them using limited time, materials, and tools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">This was the twelfth mechanical construct Ning Zhuo had repaired consecutively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"The provided materials allow me to make an arm to replace the missing one on the kung fu puppet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"I should try to replicate its intact left arm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"No, that's wrong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"This might be a trap! I should first examine the internal array." Ning Zhuo took out the mechanical tool, the Array Sound Hammer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He carefully tapped the puppet's chest with the hammer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Each tap was followed by a pause, listening intently to the clear sound the hammer produced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The sound entered his ears, and in his mind, thoughts arose, stimulated by the sound, quickly condensing into a corner of the array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo's repeated tapping gradually completed the array diagram in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">From the complete diagram, he quickly identified the missing and damaged parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He also determined the type of array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Indeed, it's a trap!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"This array integrates the puppet's limbs. The puppet has a left arm, but its right limb is a drill." If Ning Zhuo had replicated the left arm and forged a right arm, he would have fallen into the trap and failed this task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"So, the Three Sect Masters want to teach us that repairing mechanical constructs shouldn't be preconceived. Making judgments first is wrong; we should conduct thorough investigations and observations." Ning Zhuo understood the painstaking efforts of the Three Sect Masters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">After repairing the kung fu puppet, he smoothly entered the next task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">After repairing thirty-three mechanical constructs consecutively, Ning Zhuo reached the second checkpoint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">A living Fire Fusion Demon Ape appeared before him, startling Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He quickly noticed that this Fire Fusion Demon Ape was injured, able to stand only on one leg.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo carefully observed, "Oh, it has an arrow in its knee."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The checkpoint's explanation was transmitted to his mind through the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo understood: the second checkpoint required him to work on living beings, creating mechanical prosthetics to benefit those with disabilities!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The second checkpoint's difficulty was much higher than the first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo failed several times, consulted various texts, and even used some of his pavilion credits at the All-Book Pavilion to exchange for relevant mechanical blueprints to improve his skills before finally passing the checkpoint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The third checkpoint of the Buddha Gate was even more challenging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo couldn't control the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and could only let it fight freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo acted as the repairman after each fierce battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">However, during the checkpoint, he could collect the defeated demon beasts and mechanical puppets, repair them, and use them to assist Dasheng in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo struggled, barely winning each small checkpoint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Dasheng was very intelligent, but the checkpoint's difficulty was too high! Ning Zhuo exhausted all his efforts, racking his brains to collect, repair, and add auxiliary combat power for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The battle damage was too high!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Often, the auxiliary combat power collected in the first battle was entirely consumed by the second battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo's best record was once stuck at the fifth small checkpoint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Until a flash of inspiration revealed the correct path to pass the checkpoint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">It turned out that although he couldn't participate in the battle or directly control the constructs or demon beasts, he could still use his repair tools during the fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"The Three Sect Masters want to train and test our ability to repair constructs during intense battles." Realizing this, Ning Zhuo's record soared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">He reached the thirty-third checkpoint, where the difficulty was at a commercial level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo couldn't keep up with the repairs, and his hard-earned auxiliary combat power was quickly overwhelmed by the massive enemy forces, leaving him no chance to repair during the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">After failing three times, Ning Zhuo reached the thirty-third small checkpoint for the fourth time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Determined, he didn't withdraw the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Dasheng, following Ning Zhuo's pre-battle instructions, fiercely activated the Immortal Bone Golden Firmness!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The immortal power made it invincible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">With the strength of a single ape, it slaughtered the numerous opponents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Dasheng was battered and paid a heavy price, but it pushed Ning Zhuo through the third checkpoint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">As Ning Zhuo had guessed, he pushed open the third checkpoint's door and reached the end of this trial route!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The method for Foundation Establishment was transmitted to his mind, along with other rewards placed before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's weak voice reached Ning Zhuo's ears, "Little... Little Spirit greets Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
