<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 36: Joint Attack on Purple Sun</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Sun Lie looked at Meng Chong and said unhappily, “Your grandfather ordered me to help you disperse your magical power as quickly as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“Using my method, you can get rid of all your cultivation in a single night. Or what, are you scared?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Meng Chong immediately raised his eyebrows and puffed out his chest. “I’m not scared! Let’s go!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Lie laughed. “Good. I didn’t misjudge you after all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Changing the subject, he said, “In fact, cultivating with the help of a furnace isn’t some new concept.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“You must have heard about the divine ability of Fiery Eyes, Golden Pupils[^1], right?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“To cultivate this divine ability, a cultivator first needs either the Fiery Eyes or Golden Pupils immortal talent. Then, they have to get into an ancient furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“After the refining process starts, they must persevere for 49 days without closing their eyes, suffering under the smoke and fire and enduring the pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Now that you’re entering a furnace, you should be mentally prepared.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Meng Chong nodded solemnly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sun Lie opened his storage bag and took out a large bowl and a small glass bottle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The bowl contained a viscous substance that looked like amber, orange in color and crystal clear. As for the small bottle, it contained a red and yellow powder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Sun Lie instructed, "Come, take off all your clothes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Smear yourself with the contents of this bowl, then sprinkle the powder in the bottle all over your body.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Meng Chong made a sound of acknowledgment. He took off his clothes and accepted the large bowl and small bottle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He smeared the substance in the bowl first, then evenly sprinkled the powder in the bottle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Gradually, he felt like something was wrong. Sniffing himself, he said, “Old Sun, is it just me or is this stuff honey and cumin?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lie raised his head took a big sip of wine, and laughed. “Haha, you just noticed now? Your grandfather said that you know nothing of any of the hundred arts of cultivation. He was right!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Meng Chong’s expression darkened. “I’m no good at alchemy, but I’ve eaten a lot of spirit food.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Sun Lie nodded. “Since ancient times, food and medicine have been connected. Food is the best medicine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“In the end, there’s not much difference between a spirit chef’s spirit food and an alchemist’s spirit pills.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">At this point, he gave Meng Chong a wink. “Are you worried that I’m planning to kill you? That I’m cooking you up to be nice and tasty?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Although he hadn’t met Meng Chong many times, he had a solid grasp of the boy’s personality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Despite his looks as an eighteen or nineteen-year-old young man, Meng Chong was actually only fourteen, even younger than Ning Zhuo. He was full of the ambition and competitiveness of youth, and he was extremely proud of his Meng Clan heritage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Don’t underestimate me.” Meng Chong glared at Sun Lie and jumped straight into the Purple Sun Furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun Lie let out a burp before closing the furnace door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The sound of the furnace door swinging shut made Meng Chong’s heart jump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Although the furnace was now sealed, there was still some dim illumination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Meng Chong glanced around at his surroundings, immediately finding that the bottom of the furnace was littered with various medicinal materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Seeing this, Meng Chong felt a bit more confident, feeling that Sun Lie was well prepared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“The way he slathered me in honey and cumin made him seem a bit unreliable, but Sun Lie is a master alchemist, after all. This, too, must have a purpose behind it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Without hesitation, Meng Chong to the center of the furnace and sat down cross-legged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Outside the Purple Sun Furnace, Sun Lie tilted his head and took big gulps of wine, then puffed his cheeks and blew it outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">As the wine fell on the Purple Sun Furnace, flames immediately ignited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Soon, the temperature in the furnace rose rapidly. The redness of the fire illuminated Sun Lie’s face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Here it comes.” Meng Chong’s heart pounded as he noticed the soaring temperature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The interior of the furnace, which had been dim before, suddenly became bright with red light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Meng Chong’s body temperature rose rapidly. The honey on his skin began to melt, the cumin exuded a rich fragrance, and huge amounts of magical power flowed out of his pores in the form of mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">At this moment, outside, the Purple Sun Villa, Sun Lingtong’s eyes flashed with a strange light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">His Spirit Eyes penetrated the multiple walls to see a blurry scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“Very good, Sun Lie is concocting pills. This is a great opportunity to make a move.” He was full of excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">After starting to concoct pills, an alchemist often wouldn’t move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This meant that Sun Lie, a fighter in the peak of Foundation Establishment, was temporarily out of commission!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Formation Breaking Talisman, go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sun Lingtong didn’t hesitate and directly played his strongest card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Sensing the attack, the formation protecting the Purple Sun Villa immediately activated, forming a dome-shaped barrier of light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The small and insignificant-looking Formation Breaking Talisman shattered the moment it touched the barrier, dissipating into motes of light that directly dissolved the formation’s power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The formation around Purple Sun Villa was nullified!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Go.” Ning Zhuo had been waiting for a long time. At this moment, he opened his cloak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">A flock of Silent Thunderbirds flew out, drawing arcs of lighting through the air as they descended on the front yard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Wee-woo, wee-woo!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Blaring alarms rang out in the Purple Sun Villa.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo’s heartbeat accelerated slightly. He untied the two storage bags on his waist, turned them upside down, and shook out everything inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Mechanical constructs fell out one by one, growing from tiny to large. By the time they hit the ground, they had all returned to their true size.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Twenty brass mechanical men and forty red-copper mechanical beasts arranged themselves in orderly ranks and rushed toward the Purple Sun Villa.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Of course, the Purple Sun Villa had guards. Four early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators and eighteen late-stage Qi Refining cultivators were alerted by the alarms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Foundation Establishment cultivators cast spells to clean up the Silent Thunderbirds. As for the eighteen Qi Refining cultivators, they formed a battle formation, bursting out with power beyond the middle stage of Foundation Establishment and standing steady on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">As mechanical constructs poured over like a tide, the battle formation was like a reef, unmoved even in the face of the flood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Brother, Sun Lie is concocting pills in the alchemy room!” Sun Lingtong’s voice transmission arrived secretly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo’s thoughts turned, and he immediately diverted a portion of his mechanical constructs to charge toward the villa’s alchemy room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Attack the enemy in the place they must defend!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Damn it!” The four early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators cursed, but didn’t move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">A middle-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator suddenly appeared out of nowhere. They swung a magical mirror, and the mirror’s light enveloped all the mechanical constructs rushing over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The mirror shook again, and suddenly revealed the hidden figure of Hanging-Hair Traveler.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“He’s over there!” The mirror-holding cultivator in the middle stage of Foundation Establishment shouted to his companions, pointing out Ning Zhuo’s specific location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Then, another figure appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Another hidden middle-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator!” Ning Zhuo’s pupils contracted slightly. Silent Thunderbirds circled around him, and the Hanging-Hair Hooks reared their heads like black pythons ready for battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Soon, a fierce battle broke out in the dark alley where Ning Zhuo was hiding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Hmph! I hope he’s as good as Sun Lingtong says.” Han Ming glanced in Ning Zhuo’s direction before taking action herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Surrounded by yin wind, she moved swiftly and soundlessly, just like a ghost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">First, she flew over to the alchemy room, but seeing another Foundation Establishment cultivator at the door, she decisively turned and rushed over to the medicine storage room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">But before she could get there, a flash of sword light appeared, and a flying sword forced the ghost-form Han Ming to stop in her tracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">A peak-level Foundation Establishment cultivator slowly stepped forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Tonight I’m only here to take away the pills. I don’t want to hurt anyone.” Han Ming narrowed her eyes and spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">What came in response was a sharp sword light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">[^1]: Fiery Eyes, Golden Pupils – This refers to a power of Sun Wukong from Journey to the West. At one point, Laozi traps Wukong in the Eight Trigrams Furnace and tries to refine all the immortal elixirs he’d eaten out of him. Wukong hides beneath one of the trigrams, and the smoke from the furnace irritates his eyes and turns them into the Fiery Eyes, Golden Pupils. He emerges forty nine days later when Laozi opens the furnace. The Fiery Eyes, Golden Pupils are capable of seeing through all illusions (except for the ones they can’t) and are used by Sun Wukong throughout the story to see through the disguises of demons scheming to devour Tang Sanzang’s flesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
