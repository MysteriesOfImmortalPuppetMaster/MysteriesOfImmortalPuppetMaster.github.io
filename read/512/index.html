<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“Chen Zhi…” Including Ning Zhuo, everyone remembered this name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">It was evident that this was a talent who, having undergone the elimination and selection of the helm battles, had emerged outstanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Liu Er immediately took Chen Zhi aside for a detailed talk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He left Guan Zhangning to look after the other soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Guan Hong stroked his beard and transmitted his thoughts with his spiritual sense to express his concern: “These more than thirty people were chosen from the elite of my Three Generals Battalion; they were just gathered together and can be considered the very best seedlings.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Whether it be in cultivation, combat strength, or in their own willpower, they were all outstanding individuals.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Even so, it was still so difficult for them to cultivate the Iron Skin and Flesh Armor Technique.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Without our assistance, at least nearly ten of them would have failed midway —suffering backlash, being severely injured, or even dying.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zhang Hei also, uncommonly, became grave-faced: “Judging by this situation, it would be even more difficult for the others to succeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Damn it! Even though we clearly already had enough heavy armor, in the end so few people could successfully cultivate it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Hmm? Military Advisor, you still had the mood to laugh?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Guan Hong’s heart stirred; with his spiritual sense he transmitted his thoughts: “It seems that the Military Advisor has already thought of a solution?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo denied, “For now, I can’t think of any method.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhang Hei glared, “What, the Military Advisor is grinning foolishly for no reason; that’s not acceptable!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo changed the subject and said, “Although I have no method, it does not mean that others have no way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhang Hei, a bit impatient, said, “Who else? Oh come on, Military Advisor, at this point, don’t keep us in suspense!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo then pointed in the direction of Wooden Wheel Town: “I believe that Marshal Du Tiechuan must have a method.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“I am not very familiar with the Iron Skin and Flesh Armor Technique, but I have already deduced something of Marshal Du’s character and temperament.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sure enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">That night, new news came from the Commissary’s office.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Commissary’s office had launched several kinds of pills, talismans, and even array platforms; these items were all excellent auxiliary supplies that could greatly help the soldiers in cultivating the Iron Skin and Flesh Armor Technique, improving efficiency and success rate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zhang Hei immediately exclaimed, “Military Advisor’s divine calculation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo, however, shook his head, “It is still Marshal Du’s meticulous methods —endless in succession.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Having experienced this event, Ning Zhuo also gained some insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Although he had not seen with his own eyes Du Tiechuan fighting or the scene of him deploying his military tactics, from Marshal Du’s series of methods Ning Zhuo could already glimpse the latter’s military demeanor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">While the entire army was scrambling to cultivate the Iron Skin and Flesh Armor Technique, Ning Zhuo quietly left the military camp and went to an uninhabited valley to begin cultivating the Five Organs Temple Divine Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Boss, I’m going to start.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on the ground, his face full of solemnity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Among the most perilous aspects of this divine technique was none other than the Fiery Heart Temple that Ning Zhuo was about to perform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Sun Lingtong immediately transmitted his thoughts: “Don’t worry, I’ve got my eyes on it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Upon hearing Sun Lingtong’s voice, Ning Zhuo’s mood relaxed greatly, knowing that he had the most reliable person in the world by his side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, took out a dagger, and stabbed at his own chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After the dagger had penetrated one inch, it abruptly stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo only felt a slight sting; the blood from the wound was only a few threads, and then it stopped bleeding on its own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Oh, I almost forgot.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“I had utilized the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat to increase the foundation of my flesh; now my own defensive capability was already incomparable to before.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">It was mainly that during this period, too many things had happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo not only had to mass-produce mechanical puppets, but also had to repair Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yegu, and look after the Three Generals Battalion and the Red Flower Battalion, helping them purchase heavy armor, etc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo had not spent many days cultivating with the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The key was that this cultivation method was truly Sun Lingtong’s genius idea. It maximized the exploitation of the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat itself, utilizing conditions that were difficult to replicate, possessing extremely high cultivation efficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo’s foundation of his flesh was rapidly climbing, to the point that he had not yet adapted to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Also, the Eternal Fire Spirit had suddenly been delivered into his hands, and he did not spend too much time contemplating the cultivation matters related to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">As a result, errors occurred in these trivial details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Boss, my dagger is not very good. Let me borrow yours.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Lingtong: “Oh, no problem.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“No, no, no, no —it won’t do!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“In order to cope with the great battle, I had already coated my dagger and other blades with poison.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“This poison almost all came from that guy Yang Chanyu.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Cold sweat nearly broke out on Ning Zhuo’s forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yang Chanyu’s poison was really formidable, and Ning Zhuo did not want to take the risk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">With no other way, Ning Zhuo had to temporarily suspend his cultivation, and with the help of the Mechanical Dragon, he returned near Wooden Wheel Town.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He found Mu Lan on the training ground and straightforwardly stated that he needed help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Mu Lan was training the soldiers, and upon seeing Ning Zhuo come for aid, immediately had the soldiers rest in place, and she herself hurried over to Ning Zhuo’s side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">This action immediately sparked widespread discussion among the soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Look over there, quickly look over there! That fellow is the husband of the General!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“White as snow, he indeed had a handsome appearance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Hmph, he’s nothing but a pretty face; how can he be worthy of our General?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“I don’t think so. The very fact that he dared to marry our General is proof enough of his courage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Hiss… that is indeed so.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Don’t underestimate Master Ning Zhuo. In the battle at Yue Gou Mountain earlier, if it weren’t for his timely aid, the outcome of that battle would have been hard to predict.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The soldiers were all watching the spectacle, discussing among themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Several Golden Core female deputy generals of the Red Flower Battalion were also gossiping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Up to now, only Master Ning Zhuo could immediately call off the training and summon the General aside, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Is there some urgent matter?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Quick, look—the General has given her personal Golden Knife to Master Ning Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This personal golden knife was extremely sharp and was the General’s most cherished substitute. It appeared that the rumors about the General and Master Ning Zhuo being an alliance of interests were true; now it seemed that hidden affections had long existed between the two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The main function of this personal golden knife was to allow a female cultivator, in desperate situations, to prevent herself from being humiliated —either by fighting to the death or by committing suicide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">It could be considered Mu Lan’s last trump card; therefore, she kept it on her person, imbuing it with extraordinary significance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Mu Lan and Ning Zhuo exchanged only a few words before turning around to resume training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo, holding the golden knife, left Wooden Wheel Town and went to another uninhabited valley to continue the cultivation he had just begun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Mu Lan’s golden knife had not been coated with poison; Ning Zhuo used it on himself and quickly carved a hole in his chest, severed the meridians near his heart, and removed his own heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">At the same time, he activated the Demon-Stained Blood Vein Technique, condensing a mass of blood veins in the void where his heart had been, temporarily substituting for the heart’s function.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath; his chest felt cold and empty —a feeling that made him very uneasy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He gently tossed his heart into mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">His spiritual sense grasped the object.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The heart therefore floated in mid-air and did not fall to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo began to activate the Five Organs Temple Divine Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The technique formed a mass of blood-colored radiance that enveloped the heart and slowly refined it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Within the dense blood light, a gradually emerging crimson hue was emitted. This was because among the five organs and six bowels, the heart belonged to the fire element, and the fire element was radiating red light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">At the same time, Sun Lingtong also executed the Fire Cremation Prajna Spirit-Resolving Sutra, igniting a great fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo directly threw the medicine bottle into the great fire and broke its seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The sealed Eternal Fire Spirit, as soon as it rushed out of the bottle’s mouth, was brutally cremated by the fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">It felt extremely perplexed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Clearly, although it was a Fire Spirit, it was unable to merge with the flames and was even burned and melted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In order to survive, it quickly dove back into the medicine bottle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">As a result, in the next moment, Ning Zhuo detonated the medicine bottle, causing the poor Eternal Fire Spirit to once again be plunged into a sea of fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Eternal Fire Spirit thrashed about in all directions, but was blocked by the combined efforts of Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo. Soon, it was burned beyond recognition —like a candle that had been half-melted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Realizing that it was about to perish, the Eternal Fire Spirit fell into a hysterical state and crazily broke out in an attempt to escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, with cold expressions, intercepted it every time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">In the end, the Eternal Fire Spirit was completely refined, transformed into a mass of crimson spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo’s heart fell into the sea of fire and merged with the spiritual energy of the Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo continuously activated the Five Organs Temple Divine Technique, gradually refining the merged spiritual energy into a ball of light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Within the ball of light, everything was crimson, and a vague temple could be seen, faintly visible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“It’s refined!” Ning Zhuo displayed a trace of joy on his face. Using his spiritual sense to grasp the Fiery Heart Temple, he drew it into his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The blood veins that had temporarily served as the heart automatically retracted, vacating the space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The Heart Temple settled into its original position, and once again transformed into a heart, automatically connecting with the surrounding meridians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thump, thump, thump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The heart beat, once again pumping into the meridians, providing the driving force for blood to supply Ning Zhuo’s body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sun Lingtong no longer maintained the Fire Cremation Prajna Spirit-Resolving Sutra; he immediately cast a healing spell to treat Ning Zhuo’s wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The injuries on Ning Zhuo’s chest, under the full exertion of Sun Lingtong, healed very quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo infused his spiritual sense, reaching directly to his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">In a daze, he found himself in a temple, sitting upright on a divine seat, becoming the image of the Fire God enshrined within the temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">From outside the temple, a vast amount of blood, like a long river, flowed in torrents, washing over the base of the Fire God Temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo attempted to mobilize the power of the Fire God Temple, gradually increasing its intensity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Fire God Temple began to emit raging light and heat, full of vitality, suddenly heating the great river of blood, then quickly boiling it until it vaporized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Thus, a large amount of blood qi, like an upward rushing waterfall, surged skyward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">It surged upward from the base of the Fire God Temple, all the way through, piercing the firmament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo’s flesh immediately experienced an upsurge of blood qi; his entire body was like a lobster, his breathing grew coarse, he broke into a cold sweat, and his life force surged vigorously —continuously rising and rising!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo felt that his physical strength and power had greatly increased, and even his mental processes were more than twice as fast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The function of the heart is blood circulation; by enlarging the blood vessels and making them vigorously erupt, it can, from the inside out, comprehensively enhance a cultivator’s abilities —greatly increasing the cultivator’s vitality, surging mightily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">However, when Ning Zhuo halted the power of the Fire God Temple, he immediately felt a strong exhaustion enveloping his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The state he had just experienced could not last; he had explosively unleashed the inner foundation beyond his limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo then immediately felt a wave of hunger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">His stomach rumbled furiously!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He hurriedly took out some spiritual food, stuffed it into his mouth, and fiercely swallowed several large bites.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The spiritual food he swallowed was rapidly digested by him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">A thought stirred in Ning Zhuo’s heart; this time he infused his spiritual sense into the Earth Element Spleen Temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He became the divine image within the Earth God Temple, presiding over the absorption and digestion of external substances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">And the few impurities in the spiritual food were also accepted into the divine temple, accumulating continuously —just as the earth collects everything, forming the accumulation of the Earth Element Spleen Temple itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">After an eternal period, this accumulation would one day undergo a qualitative change, turning waste into treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Fire Temple intensified consumption while the Earth Temple helped with absorption. The two were each responsible for one aspect and could cooperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In the future, once the Water Temple, Metal Temple, and Wood Temple were built, the five elements would merge, forming a complete mysterious cycle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo’s thoughts became boundless, and he couldn’t help but envision a beautiful future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Dragon King’s Giant Pillar Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">In the council hall, people were gathered densely, and the atmosphere was solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ever since Du Tiechuan built the Dragon Shadow Nine Pillar Parade Platform, some cultivators in the council hall had suggested raising an army to directly strike Wooden Wheel Town.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">But this proposal was strongly rejected by Lu Hongtu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">So that when Du Tiechuan’s tactical intentions were exposed, the cultivators’ criticism of Lu Hongtu surged rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Now, yet again, a cultivator proposed, “This is the last chance! The might of the Iron Flow and Leveling Strategy has long been passed down—everyone knows what kind of power it is!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">“Fortunately, the troops under Du Tiechuan’s command are newly established and newly recruited; thus, they lack training and require time for preparation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">“This is a huge flaw left by the enemy —a victory opportunity bestowed upon us by heaven.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">“But what are we doing now? We are actually sitting idly by, letting the enemy casually and leisurely organize themselves, ultimately allowing their strategy to succeed?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">These words immediately garnered the agreement of many.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">In an instant, voices of assent clamored noisily, filling the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The gazes of these cultivators were almost all focused on Lu Hongtu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Lu Hongtu, with a stern expression, said, “Hmph, I still maintain my previous words. You all underestimate Du Tiechuan too much.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">“Observing his past battles —with meticulous, rigorous, gradual deployments —he always left neither side any room to maneuver, forcing both to act according to his arrangements.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">“If we were to raise an army, abandoning the advantageous terrain of Thousand Peaks Forest, it would be like sacrificing the long for the short, plunging headlong into the enemy’s ambush —which would be extremely unwise!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Lu Hongtu also had supporters, though few in number, but after his speech, they spoke up one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">In no time, the sounds of quarrels and insults filled the entire hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">“Sigh!” Lu Hongtu deeply sighed in his heart, knowing that this meeting, like previous ones, would end in a clamor without any result.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“The drawback of alliances is just like this. In truth, only a few can decide this war.” Leaving behind a clone phantom, Lu Hongtu quietly departed to pay respects to Lord Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Lord Long was receiving guests; upon learning of Lu Hongtu’s visit, he immediately dispatched servants to lead him into a secret chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">As soon as Lu Hongtu entered the room, he saw Lord Long hosting two ghost cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">One ghost cultivator was clad entirely in white, with both eyes red and surrounded by swirling moisture. The other was as black as a lump of coal, and with each breath, red fiery aura vaguely emanated from the cracks on his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Upon seeing Lu Hongtu arrive, Lord Long smiled and introduced, “You two, this is our Chief Military Advisor, the sect leader of the Liudong Sect, Lu Hongtu! He has had a hard time presiding over the discussions these days.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">“Hongtu, these two are from the Shihun Sect, named Tian Shuang and Di Hui.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Lu Hongtu’s heart was immediately shaken; he saluted with one hand and said, “So you are the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth —I've long admired you, long admired you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The white-clad ghost cultivator Tian Shuang nodded slightly: “The two of us have been assigned two tasks by our sect; one is to assist you in battle, and the other is to capture alive a certain person —a kid named Ning Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
