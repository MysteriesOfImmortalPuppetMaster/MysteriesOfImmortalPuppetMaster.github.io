<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 178: How Arrogant Can a Branch Family Be?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the combined team of three families, the five Qi Refining Stage geniuses were the undisputed leaders and the core figures in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Any combat plan essentially revolved around these five individuals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo's ability to conceal his true strength proved advantageous at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He resolved to listen carefully, remember everything, and then devise countermeasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo and the other four entered a secret chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The chamber was arranged like a classroom, with a middle-aged cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Stage standing at the front.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The five found their seats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"I am Zheng Hua," the middle-aged cultivator introduced himself. "Today, I will explain the general strategy for this joint operation." Ning Zhuo immediately recalled Zheng Hua's background information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zheng Hua was a mid-Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator who had already become an elder of the Zheng family despite his relatively young age.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This was mainly due to his innate talent—Golden Stone Opening—which allowed him to handle many difficult-to-refine materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Moreover, Zheng Hua was highly skilled in artifact crafting, having reached the level of a grandmaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He was one of the top artifact refiners in the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Zheng Hua released his mana, which condensed in mid-air to form the lifelike image of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"This mechanical ape should be familiar to everyone, or more accurately, it should leave a deep impression," Zheng Hua said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Zhou Zeshen, Zhou Zhu, Zheng Di, and others all wore solemn expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Xiaohui's face was even more grim, while Ning Zhuo furrowed his brows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zheng Hua continued, "Based on the current intelligence, this mechanical ape is primarily a close-combat construct. Its body is likely made of Vermilion Fire Glazed Glass, a material refined from Vermilion Flame Stone. Ice techniques are the best countermeasure against this material."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Its skeleton likely contains Crimson Gold Black Iron, with defensive inscriptions on its surface. Judging by the inscriptions and its combat performance, it probably employs the Vajra Body Protection Technique. Therefore, using lightning techniques to erode these inscriptions is also a viable tactic."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"The mechanical ape's head likely houses a specialized computational component. If we can destroy this, it would greatly impact its combat effectiveness. The ape's combat prowess mainly stems from its sophisticated martial techniques, which require high computational capabilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"If we can't destroy its head, then its hands are the next target. Its palms likely conceal multiple martial arts talismans. Destroying these talismans would also weaken its combat abilities." Zheng Hua's analysis eased the tension among the five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Next, Zheng Hua's mana condensed again, transforming from Yuan Dasheng into the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"This mechanical puppet, although it appears less frequently, is even more threatening than the mechanical ape," Zheng Hua said, his expression growing more serious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Its skeleton is made of Nether Blue Dark Iron, and parts of its bones are replaced with Soul Wood. While we can't determine the exact age of the Soul Wood, it should be at least a hundred years old, judging by the mechanical ape's specifications."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"However, these materials alone wouldn't allow the puppet to control so many ghosts. It must have other crucial components aiding in ghost manipulation. This puppet can weaken souls with its attacks, resembling the Soul Devouring Technique based on its mana fluctuations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Its neck contains a component that can emit sound waves, causing severe soul tremors. Once activated, it's difficult to defend against with just our own abilities. Its eyes are a critical design element, made of mixed materials with unknown powers. I suspect they hide some kind of trump card."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"The puppet's body has numerous ejection ports that can rapidly spray Yin-attributed silk. This silk can instantly form a protective black robe with excellent defensive capabilities. To counter this, we might use mud techniques to block these ejection ports."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Lastly, this ghost puppet has at least two arrays and eighteen talismans, making it a long-range combat construct. Close-quarters combat is strongly recommended." The five's expressions grew serious again, realizing the limited intelligence on the ghost puppet made it a formidable opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo's brows furrowed further as he thought, "Too much information has been leaked. Zheng Hua's analysis is almost spot-on, truly worthy of being one of the Zheng family's top artifact refiners."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Regarding the Soul Devouring Technique, although it was identified, no one linked it to the Soul Devouring Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Due to the existence of various modified versions, the technique wasn't exclusive to the sect, though its disciples wielded it more powerfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In fact, the Soul Devouring Technique existed long before the sect's founding, rumored to originate from one of the ten ancient beasts, the Ghost Devouring Soul Swallowing Beast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Ghost Devouring Soul Swallowing Beast was thirty zhang long, resembling a lion-tiger hybrid with a massive, muscular body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Its limbs were powerful, and its claws sharp as blades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Its body was covered in dark scales that emitted a faint glow at night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The beast had three eyes, with the central one capable of seeing ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Its wide mouth and sharp teeth could easily tear apart any soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Its tail was snake-like, ending in a head that held a blue-glowing pearl, capable of storing endless soul power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The beast's back had large black wings, resembling bat wings, allowing it to fly swiftly and easily catch fleeing ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zheng Hua dispersed his mana and looked seriously at the five. "These are just our current intelligence estimates. We can't rule out the possibility that our full mobilization might increase the difficulty, making these constructs even stronger. We also can't rule out the appearance of a third or even fourth construct. Any questions?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhou Zeshen was the first to ask, "These are mechanical constructs. Why not target this aspect? Have we discovered the control methods for these constructs?" Zheng Hua shook his head. "No."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Classic control methods like strings, rods, or divine sense don't fit these constructs' situations. We suspect they are controlled by spiritual means."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"The Lava Immortal Palace has the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, capable of controlling mechanical puppets. Previously, during a demonic beast siege, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit allegedly deployed a humanoid puppet to control the battlefield. Here is the related battle footage for everyone to review." Zheng Hua handed a jade slip to the five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">When it reached Ning Zhuo, he pressed it to his forehead, seeing the defensive battle at the volcano's peak and the deployment of a Golden Core Stage puppet master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"This must be when Brother Sun and I fought Cheng Bai. Who recorded this footage? To operate under Meng Kui's nose is impressive! This angle seems to be from a distant view?" Ning Zhuo immediately thought of Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He guessed correctly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhu Xuanji had indeed provided the jade slip to the three families' Golden Core ancestors, who then copied and distributed it to their respective families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">While the others reviewed the jade slip, Zheng Hua continued, "If these constructs are indeed spiritually controlled, then the mechanical ape and ghost puppet can be considered spiritual treasures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Spiritual treasures?!" Zheng Jin couldn't help but exclaim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">From talismans to magical artifacts, to spiritual treasures, the latter were the highest quality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The ultimate treasures of super sects, families, and cultivation nations were invariably spiritual treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"This person seems to be my family's Golden Core ancestor?" Ning Zhuo saw the scene of the Ning family ancestor being forced to retreat by a walnut, but he remained expressionless as he passed the jade slip to the next person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"The three families' understanding of Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai is already quite deep. They even guessed the truth of spiritual control! As expected, families that can become major forces in an Immortal City have deep foundations and strength, not to be underestimated. However, they only guessed part of it; they are still some distance from the truth." This wasn't their fault; they simply lacked crucial intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Once they had it, they could quickly piece together the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"If they had reached the coffin chamber and learned the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra, they would soon suspect Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai's true identities. But I've already raised all the stone walls of the Buddhist and Demonic Gates." Previously, Ning Zhuo had a flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">In the second transfer hall, the Buddhist and Demonic Gates were still visible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">However, with the Life Thread Divine Ability nearing perfection and Ning Zhuo's significant progress in cultivation and soul power, he finally managed to fully block the Buddhist and Demonic Gates with stone walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo deliberately said, "With only this intelligence, I don't think we have a high chance of defeating the mechanical ape and ghost puppet. I suggest postponing the action, continuing our investigation, and gathering more comprehensive intelligence. Once fully prepared, we can then explore the Lava Immortal Palace in force."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zhou Zeshen immediately looked at Ning Zhuo with admiration, thinking, "Ning Zhuo shares my thoughts; we're both thinkers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly, "Ning Zhuo, why are you so cowardly before the battle? You want to gather intelligence? We can use this opportunity to fight the damned mechanical ape properly! By dismantling it, we can gather crucial information!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo retorted, "Ning Xiaohui, I know you've often been defeated by the mechanical ape and are eager for revenge. But that doesn't mean you can fight recklessly. Your rashness will only lead to more failures!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"You!" Ning Xiaohui glared, filled with anger and disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">No one, especially not a peer, had ever spoken to her so rudely before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo was the first, and he did so in front of outsiders, directly mocking her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"You, a mere branch family member..." Ning Xiaohui gritted her teeth, her eyes practically spitting fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo interrupted mercilessly, "You, a main family member, can't even achieve half of my accomplishments. What does that make you?" Ning Xiaohui stood up abruptly, her body emanating cold air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">A ghostly figure, as white and cold as snow, rose from her body, glaring at Ning Zhuo with a sinister expression. "When did the Ning family branch become so arrogant?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo's pupils contracted as he quickly leaped back, maintaining distance and keeping a close eye on the ghost. "What are you?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The ghost trembled with rage, "I am also of the Ning family main branch!!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
