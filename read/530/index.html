<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The mechanized army, stepping in unison, suddenly halted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">At the center of the formation, Ning Zhuo looked into the distance: “Is that the Fire Crown Divine Cedar?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Without any doubt, the Fire Crown Divine Cedar located at the very center of the Ten Li Burning Forest was the heart of this place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Its robust trunk was as straight as a pillar to the heavens, immovable. The reddish-copper bark was covered with molten lava patterns, as if a thousand fire dragons were winding and roaming beneath it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Seven hundred and twenty main branches radiated outward like spikes toward the firmament, and each branch split into nine layers of bronze-colored secondary branches, with layer upon layer of flame-like leaves piled up to form a red-gold crown enveloping an area of thirty mu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">And each of its leaves was shaped like a phoenix’s tail, quietly burning with an unextinguishable orange-red flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Majestic!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Divine!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This was the strongest impression Ning Zhuo received from his distant observation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo did not continue forward but instead stationed his troops on the spot, waiting for the assembly of the Three Generals Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ever since he had captured Yan Jin alive, the fire curtain no longer appeared, and the towering blaze in the Burning Forest had mostly subsided, with only the burning timber quietly aflame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo, with his keen mind, immediately deduced that his clash with Yan Jin had alleviated a great deal of pressure on the Three Generals Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Three Generals Battalion must have immediately advanced and smashed the Great Forest Defense Formation, which resulted in the present state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The big-headed youth touched his mechanical ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The ring was silent, yet Ning Zhuo still decided to wait until the Three Generals Battalion attacked together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Because the mechanical ring could alert during life-or-death crises, but if his life was not in danger, it might also cause significant losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo, with his cautious nature, would not easily make the mistake of rashness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Advisor!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Advisor!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Not long after, the Three Generals Battalion rapidly marched and arrived at Ning Zhuo’s side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Is this… Yan Jin?” the Three Generals quickly discovered Yan Jin lying at Ning Zhuo’s feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Indeed,” Ning Zhuo nodded and smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zhang Hei scratched his head: “My three brothers, joining forces, merely beheaded that Flowing Flame Fairy. Advisor, how did you manage to capture Yan Jin alive? Impressive!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The two sides quickly communicated with each other, and upon learning of the situation after their separation, found it to be roughly as they had surmised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Liu Er’s gaze fell onto Yan Jin, and he said to Ning Zhuo, “Advisor, could you partially remove his seal so that I might persuade him a bit?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo: “Of course.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">A talisman was torn off from Yan Jin, and instantly his divine sense could once again spread outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Liu Er then began to persuade him, but Yan Jin immediately cut him off with one sentence: “You are merely a prisoner-capturing general, one of the assorted generals; how can you possibly be in command?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Liu Er’s expression froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He added, “Though I cannot take command, I do possess some ability to reduce your penalty.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Right now, you have the opportunity to earn merit despite your crimes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This time, Yan Jin’s expression froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Liu Er promptly said, “I know that having you persuade Luo Chen to surrender is an unrealistic proposition.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“But what if you persuade him to retreat on his own accord?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Our army’s orders were to seize this stretch of the Ten Li Burning Forest, not to engage in a fight to the death with you all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Yan Jin displayed a thoughtful expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Liu Er continued, “Releasing you is absolutely out of the question. After all, capturing a Golden Core cultivator alive is a war merit!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Moreover, Yan Daoyou is a great craftsman of the Ten Li Burning Forest, renowned far and wide, so the war merit achieved because of you would at least be doubled.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“If you can persuade Luo Chen to withdraw, it would be good for everyone.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Firstly, both sides would avoid bloodshed. Secondly, you could have your penalty mitigated.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“The previous grand battle had already completely proven that the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King was by no means a match for Marshal Du. Furthermore, the Thousand Peak Forest will eventually belong to both nations, and your defection from darkness to light is nothing but a life-changing opportunity, isn’t it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Yan Jin glanced at Liu Er, and in his heart he thought, “The intelligence didn’t mention that this human–demon hybrid Golden Core cultivator would be so eloquent!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Yan Jin was persuaded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He transmitted his thoughts with his divine sense, “I can only try it out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Liu Er immediately broke into a smile and encouraged warmly, “Even if you just try, Yan Daoyou, your action will win favor, and your penalty can be appropriately reduced.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Third brother, why are you just standing there? Hurry and help Yan Daoyou up.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Zhang Hei uttered a couple of “ohs,” as if waking from a dream, and hoisted Yan Jin up by his neck so that he stood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Yan Jin felt like a kitten or a puppy, and under such humiliation, he couldn’t help but glare fiercely at Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhang Hei immediately glared back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yan Jin coughed twice, and communicated via divine sense, “Let me come closer to facilitate the transmission of our divine senses.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">However, Ning Zhuo shook his head: “Coming closer is acceptable, but the transmission of divine sense is not allowed. Who knows what you and Luo Chen might be muttering about?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Let me make a small mechanism.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Liu Er nodded in agreement, then led the Three Generals Battalion, escorting Yan Jin, carefully advancing towards the Fire Crown Divine Cedar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">As they drew nearer, the oppressive presence of the Fire Crown Divine Cedar grew stronger for everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo also saw the scene beneath the trunk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The roots of the Fire Crown Divine Cedar coiled like a twisted dragon, forming a bulging high platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">On the raised platform, at the spot nearest to the trunk, sat a cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">It was Luo Chen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Luo Chen suddenly opened his eyes wide, and sparks of lightning flashed in them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">While moving, Ning Zhuo crafted a small mechanism, and at this moment, having succeeded, he threw the palm-sized device to Yan Jin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Yan Jin imbued it with his divine sense, and the mechanism emitted a sound, persuading Luo Chen to withdraw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Luo Chen snorted coldly, “The Dragon King Temple has entrusted me with a heavy responsibility to guard this place; how could I escape without a battle?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Besides, I am at the Nascent Soul level, and the strongest among you are nothing more than Golden Core cultivators. How dare you be so shameless as to ask me to retreat voluntarily? Ridiculous!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Let me gauge your strength and see if you are just blowing hot air!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Having said that, Luo Chen stood up and looked up at the sky: “Fellow Taoists in the heavens, are you going to be mere bystanders? No matter what schemes you may have, why not come and fight as well?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Hidden within the clouds, Lin Bufan’s heart stirred: “I have the One-Leaf Obscuring Eyes technique to conceal myself; how could I be detected?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Is this Luo Chen tricking me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lin Bufan still chose to hold his ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning were all taken aback, each looking upward toward the sky, their divine senses scanning chaotically, but they discovered nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sun Lingtong promptly reminded Ning Zhuo, “Ha, I have spotted him. I didn’t expect that Lin Bufan had not left yet, but was hiding in that cloud.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Upon learning that our side had strong reinforcements, Ning Zhuo’s heart was immediately delighted, yet also filled with some doubts: “How could Lin Bufan return like this? Or perhaps he has been lingering nearby all along? This sect leader, being cautious and profound, may well have ulterior motives?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">In any case, given the relationship between the Ning family and the Myriad Medicine Sect, Lin Bufan’s appearance now served as an insurance, lending Ning Zhuo more confidence in the upcoming battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo thought about it, but did not reveal this secret to the Three Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Although the three generals-Liu, Guan, and Zhang-had some suspicions, none of them showed it on their faces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Liu Er’s thoughts turned: “Luo, dear friend of the Way, with your fine stratagem, deliberately concocting others -are you trying to make it so that we cannot fight with all our hearts?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Luo Chen sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He especially hoped that Lin Bufan would step forward and fight against him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">In that case, his reputation would be much improved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">But having been repelled by the Three Generals Battalion, Liu, Guan, and Zhang were ultimately only at the Golden Core stage, while Ning Zhuo was even only at the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Yan Jin’s persuasion attempt appeared ineffective, yet it had already yielded tremendous results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Luo Chen had already decided to withdraw, but this withdrawal had to be done with dignity, so that he could later account for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“If I can capture the Wood-in-Fire, then I can retreat immediately. There’s no need to start fidgeting now. Sigh…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Luo Chen secretly sighed, but his face remained resolute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He declared loudly, “Three Generals Battalion, watch this!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In the next moment, his sleeves fluttered, and with swift finger formations and incantations, he unleashed four fire dragons, stirring up boundless waves of heat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The scorching fire dragons flew in mid-air, then together howled as they swooped down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Coming,” Liu Er softly uttered, and then promptly raised the Xuanhuang Sword, holding it horizontally in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Military strategy: Defending the homeland and strengthening one’s foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Military power was expended by twenty percent; a yellow light enveloped the entire army, enhancing their defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Guan Hong raised the Blood Dragon Blade, continuously slashing in four directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Military strength was abruptly expended by forty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Blade technique -Four Calamities Blood-Slaughter Slash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">In an instant, the bloody slaughter energy soared, condensing into four blade shadows that struck the four fire dragons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Of these, two were directly dispersed, while the other two evaded the blade shadows; though their bodies shrank considerably from injuries, their speed did not diminish but instead increased, and they continued their assault, meeting Zhang Hei’s Serpent Spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Military strength was further expended by twenty percent, and under the added enhancement, the Black Serpent Spear’s power surged, crushing the remaining two fire dragons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The three generals acted in succession, and altogether, eighty percent of their military strength was consumed, successfully countering the fire dragon spell that Luo Chen had long been brewing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Luo Chen had already initiated the next wave of his attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He flipped his sleeve and produced a magical artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The artifact was like a disc, within which lay a large number of copper coins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The copper coins whirled in mid-air, coalescing into a formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">In a moment, blue electric light intertwined to form a majestic stag, dashing toward the Three Generals Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The stag thundered forward, and with each kick, emitted a roar like thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Even from a short distance away, the hairs on the soldiers’ bodies in the Three Generals Battalion stood on end, as though thousands of fine needles in the air were continuously pricking them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Formation artifact -Thunderclap Stag-Chasing Disc!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The three generals, remaining unruffled in the face of danger, acted one after another, and finally Liu Er raised the Xuanhuang Sword and fiercely slashed, shattering the Thunder Stag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Luo Chen silently nodded, acknowledging the combat capability of the Three Generals Battalion, thinking, “They are indeed a force capable of capturing Ma Feitui alive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">At present, with the three generals joining forces, they could indeed rival a Nascent Soul cultivator, but it depended on the specifics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">If it were a Nascent Soul True Lord with mastery over divine abilities, they would most likely be defeated. The battle prior to the grand war -when the Three Generals Battalion was ordered to invade the Thousand Peak Forest and clashed with Tu Ming -was a case in point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Luo Chen had already intended to retreat; upon seeing that the Three Generals Battalion had exceptional combat strength, he felt not worry but rather delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“After one more skirmish, I shall withdraw,” he thought silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Not having obtained the Wood-in-Fire, there was no other alternative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Under the circumstances, Luo Chen could not possibly defend this place to the death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He turned, his back toward the Three Generals Battalion, took a few steps forward, stood before the Fire Crown Divine Cedar, and extended his hand to give it a gentle pat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">At the same time, he murmured, “Divine Cedar, Divine Cedar, grant me the Fire Crown to assist in this battle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The Fire Crown Divine Cedar trembled slightly, and firelight fell from its branches and leaves onto Luo Chen’s head, coalescing into a crown of flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The flame crown was limited to Luo Chen’s hair, burning quietly, while his entire skin was enveloped in a layer of fiery red radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">His entire aura suddenly soared, reaching a peak state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“Fire Crown!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The three generals displayed expressions of gravity, but were not astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">It was common knowledge that the Fire Crown Divine Cedar could bestow a Fire Crown; it was not a secret matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Many cultivators who ventured to the Ten Li Burning Forest to refine artifacts, in order to improve their chances of success and to ensure that their state remained optimal throughout the refining process, would come to the Fire Crown Divine Cedar to offer prayers, requesting a Fire Crown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">This Fire Crown was capable of drastically depleting a cultivator’s spiritual power, energy, and divine sense, ensuring that the cultivator’s state remained at its peak during the entire refining process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Its disadvantages, apart from the burning sensation, were that it consumed energy so intensely that it verged on destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">In an extremely brutal manner, it rapidly consumed the cultivator’s inner strength, unleashing a dazzling brilliance akin to flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Any cultivator who donned the Fire Crown for a prolonged time would subsequently need a long period of recuperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Generally speaking, for a cultivator to obtain a Fire Crown, they had to offer sacrifices and perform a series of prayer rituals, only then would there be a possibility of being bestowed with the Fire Crown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">As the leader of the forest, Luo Chen naturally possessed different privileges and treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">He merely needed to softly call out a few times to obtain a Fire Crown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Upon wearing the Fire Crown, Luo Chen’s heart was filled with an intense sense of urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">He advanced and once again clashed with the Three Generals Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">This time, the three generals alone could hardly hold their own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo also promptly made his move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Pooling the power of the four, they repelled Luo Chen’s attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Unable to press his attack, Luo Chen immediately ceased his assault, saying, “The offensive of the Three Generals Battalion is so formidable; indeed, impressive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">“I, Luo, will keep this grudge in mind.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">“Someday, I shall surely return to this place by force and reclaim what was lost.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">After saying these parting words, Luo Chen voluntarily extinguished the Fire Crown upon his head, withdrew, and flew into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">In the next moment, a sudden anomaly occurred!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">“Forest Chief Luo, wait a moment before retreating; with me here, defeating this army will be a trivial matter!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">A hoarse voice resounded across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“Who is it?!” Luo Chen exclaimed in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">He immediately turned his gaze to the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">In the clouds, Lin Bufan was likewise startled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">As he surveyed the battlefield, it was only at this moment that he discovered that a Nascent Soul-level existence was still concealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Gao Cuo, who had been hiding in the dark, was also shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Old Sword was also taken aback, and then suddenly realized, “So the Fire Crown Divine Cedar has become a deity!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">In the next moment, the Fire Crown Divine Cedar swayed its body and condensed into a flaming dharma body that floated in mid-air, obstructing Luo Chen’s path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">The flaming dharma body was anything but ordinary. After Luo Chen discerned it, he exclaimed in amazement, “So, the Wood-in-Fire has indeed been taken by you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The Fire Crown Divine Deity nodded, “I was enlightened by the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, arranged by his will, and secretly ascended to a deity. This Wood-in-Fire was originally bestowed upon me by the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="298">“Luo Chen, you must not shrink back in battle. With you and me joining forces, we will undoubtedly wipe out the entire Three Generals Battalion!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="300">Luo Chen, in astonishment, said, “This…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="302">The Fire Crown Divine Deity coldly sneered, “Just behold my Dao Field!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="304">Fire Crown Dao Field!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="306">In the next moment, the Dao Field instantly unfolded, and the Burning Forest around the Three Generals Battalion completely disappeared, leaving behind only a piece of barren ground engulfed in flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="308">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and the rest, including all of Ning Zhuo’s soldiers, found that a flame crown was burning above their heads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="310">In an instant, the entire army’s condition soared to its peak state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="312">Luo Chen, looking at the Fire Crown reigniting above his head, said, “Fire Crown Divine, first remove the crown from my head.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="314">But the Fire Crown Divine Deity coldly sneered, “You and I shall attack with all our strength, and we must annihilate them in the shortest possible time! If we win this battle, only then will I remove the Fire Crown from your head; otherwise, you shall await being burned to death!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
