<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 338: The Fox God's Four Generals</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent">The white mist seeped into every corner of the room, penetrating from outside, surrounding Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
Hearing the Fox God's demand for the flower petals, Sun Lingtong immediately became furious: "What kind of damn god was this! Luring us into her house, suddenly raising the price, and then using force to intimidate us!"<br/>
"Do you think we're made of clay?"<br/>
"Come on, I'll beat your ass until they bloom, and tear down this broken temple. Do you really think that becoming a deputy mountain god allows you to throw your weight around?!"<br/>
Seeing Sun Lingtong roll up his sleeves, revealing a pair of plump little arms, his aura bursting forth, the Fox God coldly snorted: "Little boy, you’re quite headstrong, aren't you?"<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled: "I think you, Fox God, are quite headstrong."<br/>
"Do you know that our clan has two Golden Core cultivators? Yet you dare to trouble us two?"<br/>
"If you were a demon cultivator, that would be one thing. But now you're just a mountain god. When my master comes to teach you a lesson, you'd better have the ability to move Mist Concealment Mountain away and hide with it."<br/>
"Oh, I forgot. You're just a deputy mountain god, not even an official one."<br/>
"Even if the official mountain god agrees, do you have the divine ability to move mountains?"<br/>
The white mist suddenly stagnated.<br/>
The Fox God smiled foolishly: "Young friend, you've truly misunderstood me. I never intended to trouble you, I was just a bit too eager."<br/>
"You should know that searching the entire Mist Concealment Mountain has its intricacies. If it's just a superficial search, even ordinary birds could do it. If you want to search through the forests, bushes, and streams, the divine power consumed is no small amount. If you want to search eight feet underground, the consumption of divine power is extreme, and it would take at least three to five months to replenish."<br/>
"I wonder what kind of search the young friend wants?"<br/>
Sun Lingtong snorted coldly: "After saying so much, you're still just trying to bargain."<br/>
Ning Zhuo raised his hand, gesturing to Sun Lingtong to stop: "When my mother assigned me this task, she indeed gave me some things to help me travel far and wide."<br/>
"Is this the flower petal you're talking about?"<br/>
As he spoke, Ning Zhuo curled up his tongue, revealing a flower bud pattern at the base of his tongue.<br/>
The pattern emerged and turned into a physical form, transforming into a small flower bud.<br/>
The pure white bud, entirely made of clouds and mist, had wisps of cloud gently dispersing at its edges.<br/>
It was indeed a Cloud Concealment Bud!<br/>
Ning Zhuo curled his tongue downward, wrapping the bud once, and peeled off a petal from it.<br/>
He pressed his tongue down, and the Cloud Concealment Bud turned back into a talisman pattern, imprinted at the base of his tongue. Only the petal remained on the tip of his tongue.<br/>
He opened his mouth and spat out the petal.<br/>
The white mist immediately surged forward, and the Fox God spoke eagerly: "That's it, that's it!"<br/>
Ning Zhuo opened his mouth and sucked the petal back in: "Fox God, go search the mountain."<br/>
But the Fox God giggled: "Young master, why not give the petal to this servant first? This servant can then serve you more wholeheartedly."<br/>
Once the Cloud Concealment petal appeared, the Fox God's attitude and tone changed dramatically.<br/>
Sun Lingtong couldn't help but get goosebumps, rubbing his arms and shouting in a low voice: "Speak properly!"<br/>
Ning Zhuo maintained his smile: "Fox God, there's no need to worry. After the task is completed, I will certainly present this petal to you with both hands. My surname is Ning, given name Zhuo, just so you know, I am from the Ning family of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. My name and reputation stand, and I swear on the honor of the Ning family, as long as the Fox God gives it your all, I won't renege on our deal."<br/>
The Fox God was silent for a moment before saying: "Very well, I'll do as you say, young master."<br/>
The mist in the room slowly retreated, though it still blocked the door and windows.<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn't mind, he took out a set of cups and placed them on the table in the room. After inviting Sun Lingtong to sit, he began to brew tea.<br/>
As the two sipped tea and chatted, their leisurely and composed demeanor exuded strong confidence, leaving the Fox God unable to gauge their true strength.<br/>
The Fox God used her divine power, and mist enveloped the mountain.<br/>
He had previously had contact with Meng Yaoyin and knew the route of the Ning family caravan from years ago. Following this route, she searched and found quite a lot.<br/>
"Young master, I've brought you what you're looking for. Take a look."<br/>
After saying this, the Fox God opened the door, and the mist spread out, forming a blank space.<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong looked out and saw a pile of junk in the courtyard.<br/>
There were old iron pots, yellowed bedding, fragments of tents, and discarded wagon wheels.<br/>
Ning Zhuo examined them with his divine sense, pretending to check carefully, and collected all the junk. He then said to the Fox God: "Not enough, not enough, please continue searching, great Fox God."<br/>
The Fox God giggled: "Young master, please wait a moment."<br/>
This time, the Fox God exerted all her strength, searching eight feet underground along the route of the Ning family caravan, and gathered another pile of old objects.<br/>
The old objects were wrapped in thick mist and quickly delivered to the courtyard of the temple.<br/>
"Young master, take a look," the Fox God panted. "Now can you give me that flower petal?"<br/>
Ning Zhuo inspected the items, putting the old things into his bag while saying: "It's still not quite enough, please continue your efforts, great Fox God."<br/>
The Fox God was annoyed: "Young master, if you're looking for something specific, please just say so."<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly: "If I could say it directly, I would have done so long ago. It's just that my mother's instructions were like this, please forgive me, great Fox God."<br/>
The Fox God mustered her divine power again, raising rolling thick mist that almost covered the entire Mist Concealment Mountain.<br/>
This extraordinary sight shocked the villagers of Mist Concealment Village. Many people knelt on the spot, calling it a divine miracle and continuously praising the name of the Fox God.<br/>
This time, the Fox God brought back fewer items.<br/>
His voice revealed exhaustion: "This god has already done their utmost, greatly depleting divine power. Even if the official Mountain God personally took action, the result would be the same. Give me that flower petal."<br/>
Ning Zhuo checked again, collecting broken ceramics, spoiled herbs, damaged mechanisms, and some gold, silver, and agate jewelry.<br/>
"Great Fox God, what I'm looking for isn't here," Ning Zhuo said.<br/>
"Hmm?!" The Fox God's voice turned cold, "Young boy, didn't you hear what I just said?"<br/>
Ning Zhuo insisted: "I heard very clearly. But although there are many things here, the target item is not among them."<br/>
The Fox God was very displeased: "What exactly did your mother ask you to find? How can I help you if you don't tell me? You're still hiding something even now?"<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: "Great Fox God, I'm not trying to deceive you. My mother didn't specify, she only said that if I could come into contact with this item, I would surely sense it. I hope the great Fox God can make one more effort. When I return to my mother, there will certainly be a reward."<br/>
The Fox God laughed angrily: "Boy, are you playing games with me?"<br/>
"Who has the patience to help you collect this pile of junk!"<br/>
"Give me the flower petal quickly, and this god will overlook your offense."<br/>
"If you don't give it... hehe, don't blame this god for being impolite to you!"<br/>
Sun Lingtong snorted and beckoned to the mist covering the mountain: "Come on then! You little hairy god, you really think you're something special."<br/>
The Fox God was furious: "Little boy with no manners, I'll discipline you in place of your elders."<br/>
The mist rushed towards them, but Ning Zhuo dispersed it all with a wave of his hand.<br/>
"Fox God, please calm your anger. We are only searching for some old artifacts. We have no intention of excessively troubling you," Ning Zhuo said.<br/>
Fox God: "If you're not causing trouble, then hand over the flower petal!"<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly and shook his head, indicating he couldn't do that.<br/>
The Fox God was so angry her  teeth chattered. She barely squeezed out a cold laugh through her teeth: "You two little brats, do you really think that gods are servants of your great clan, so easily ordered around? Today I'll teach you a profound lesson, to let you know the right attitude to have towards gods!"<br/>
Whoosh.<br/>
A gust of wind swept up the mountain mist, rushing towards Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo in the courtyard.<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong were fearless in the face of danger, having been prepared.<br/>
In the next moment, Rudie Niang appeared, letting out a delicate shout. A layer in her butterfly wings flickered slightly, releasing a defensive formation.<br/>
The mountain mist surged like a tsunami, but was blocked by an invisible wall, unable to advance an inch further.<br/>
Not only that, as the formation expanded rapidly, the mist retreated step by step, being pushed back.<br/>
The Fox God let out a light snort, then released her divine might, invoking the power of heaven and earth.<br/>
As the deputy mountain god, Mist Concealment Mountain was her domain, giving her a strong home field advantage.<br/>
The next moment, the pressure of heaven and earth enveloped the formation from all directions.<br/>
The rapid expansion of the formation came to an abrupt halt. Rudie Niang let out a muffled groan, her body trembling slightly.<br/>
The two sides fell into a stalemate.<br/>
The Fox God's cold voice resonated throughout this misty battlefield: "Where are my generals?"<br/>
"Old Stinky is here, you two little thieves, eat my axe!" From the east came a demon cultivator centipede over nine feet tall, with human legs and hands, wielding two axes. It broke through the mountain mist, chopping towards them.<br/>
From the west came a demon scorpion, its whole body covered in black iron armor, holding a steel spear, delivering a powerful thrust!<br/>
From the north rushed out a sharp-nosed pangolin, as big as a carriage, its body a grayish silver color, charging forward with powerful momentum.<br/>
From the south appeared a yellow weasel, normal in size, baring its teeth and howling strangely. It continuously casted spells that kicked up a cloud of gold and stone, spraying out with a pitter-patter.<br/>
These were the Centipede Axeman, the Scorpion Spearman, the Sharp-nosed Pangolin, and the Gaping Yellow Weasel, the four divine generals Ning Zhuo had seen in the front hall earlier.<br/>
They were also the Fox God's four capable fighters.<br/>
The four generals launched a barrage of fierce chops and thrusts at the defensive formation maintained by Rudie Niang. The trembling of Rudie Niang's body intensified as a result, making it increasingly difficult to sustain the formation.<br/>
Sun Lingtong naturally wouldn't stand idly by. Holding two daggers, he charged into the fray.<br/>
His figure flickered in and out of sight as he pounced towards the Yellow Weasel General.<br/>
At first, the Yellow Weasel General planned on using his spells to counterattack Sun Lingtong, hoping to repel him.<br/>
But Sun Lingtong's movements were too agile. Using the Void Traversing Technique, he arrived beside the Yellow Weasel General and launched a flurry of stabs with his small dagger.<br/>
The Yellow Weasel General only felt a numbing chill all over his body.<br/>
Then, intense pain came. Blood spurted from his body and he was severely wounded on the spot.<br/>
Frightened, he let out a bizarre cry and fled hurriedly.<br/>
Sun Lingtong didn't intend to let him off and was about to deliver the final blow when suddenly the mountain mist surged forth, enveloping the Yellow Weasel General before Sun Lingtong could kill him.<br/>
Sun Lingtong snorted coldly, not daring to venture deep into the mist.<br/>
He turned and charged towards the Sharp-nosed Pangolin.<br/>
His choice of attack target was deliberate. Among the Fox God's four divine generals, all were demon cultivators. Among them, the Centipede Axeman and the Scorpion Spearman both had roughly human forms, with a higher degree of transformation, and their combat power was clearly superior to the other two divine generals.<br/>
