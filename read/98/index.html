<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“Brother Ning Zhuo, over here!” Zheng Jian laughed heartily. When he saw Ning Zhuo stepping off the carriage, he quickly hurried forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo immediately cupped his fists in greeting. “Brother Zheng.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“No need for formalities!” Zheng Jian grabbed Ning Zhuo’s arm to stop him from bowing any further. “Come on, let’s head up to the second floor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Behind them, Ning Xiaohui disembarked from the carriage, using the back of clan servant as a step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Seeing Zheng Jian pulling Ning Zhuo along without even glancing at her, a frosty expression spread over her face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ever since their successful foray into the immortal palace, the higher-ups of the three great clans had taken full notice of Ning Zhuo’s value, and his status had risen rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In order to better win him over, Ning Xiaoren had accelerated the fabrication of evidence and framing of Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">It had to be said that Ning Ze had served Ning Xiaoren for many years. Even if he hadn’t made any great achievements, he had certainly suffered hardship to carry out his liege’s orders; and so Ning Xiaoren’s actions left Ning Zhuo feeling both contemptuous and vigilant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo and Zheng Jian walked side by side into a garden courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Three words were engraved on the plaque hanging above the gate: Children’s Care Center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Children's Care Center was bustling with people. In all the various conversations, a single name was repeated over and over – Li Leifeng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Li Leifeng’s lifespan had finally run out. In accordance with his will, the Children’s Care Center was holding a bequest ceremony to distribute his belongings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Unexpectedly, Elder Li is really gone. I always watched his puppet shows when I was young.” Zheng Jian sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo also let out a sigh. “Elder Li was truly a respectable man. Who knows how many orphans and street children he saved after taking over the Children’s Care Center?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Zheng Jian patted Ning Zhuo on the back. “Elder Li passed peacefully of old age. Just looking at how many people showed up today, you can tell how highly regarded he was. He lived a worthy life!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo gave a slight nod and said nothing more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Most people had gathered in a five-story pavilion, which was to be the venue of the bequest ceremony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo and the others also entered the building.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The pavilion was built like a ring, with a courtyard in the middle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">After climbing the stairs to the second floor and entering one of the private rooms, Ning Zhuo saw the brothers of the Zhou Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Come and sit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"The food at the Children's Care Center today still tastes like it used to. Brings back memories."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Yeah, I remember how I loved watching puppet shows when I was a kid. I usually went in that private room across from here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"I used to lean on the railing while watching the shows."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo stayed silent, gaze settling on a corner of the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">As a child, he would always sneak in when the ticket-checkers weren’t paying attention. Hiding in a corner or behind a pillar, he could watch the shows, and sometimes after the crowd dispersed and the courtyard hadn’t been cleaned yet, he would pick up leftover cakes or fruit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Even though Ning Zhuo was born with Early Wisdom, he still liked to play.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">His aunt and uncle were hard on him. Often, Ning Ji would chow down on snacks right in front of him without offering him so much as a single piece of candy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo was a child and had his own cravings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He remembered once when he was caught and was full of fear. At that moment, Li Leifeng came to him and gently patted his head, taking him by the hand and leading him backstage. There, he gave the boy his own untouched share of fresh fruit and pastries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">People passed in and out around them, but no one was surprised at the scene. Many looked at Ning Zhuo with kind gazes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In Ning Zhuo’s memories, the fine details had already blurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">But he felt that the entire experience was filled with gentle light. Every time he thought back to it, a warm current would rise in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">That’s why, after Li Leifeng passed away, nearly the whole city came to pay respects. Those participating in this bequest ceremony were, almost without exception, famous and well-known cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"With Li Leifeng gone, who knows what’s next for the Children's Care Center?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"I heard the next director still hasn’t been decided."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“I know why. Li Leifeng asked Divine Investigator Zhu Xuanji to choose his successor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zheng Jian and Zhou Zeshen’s casual chatting revealed valuable information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo quietly took note.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"By the way, how’s your soul recovery going?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Almost fully healed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Me too, just about there."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"When are we exploring the Lava Immortal Palace again?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As soon as this was asked, everyone instinctively glanced at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">It was all thanks to Ning Zhuo that they had achieved a breakthrough last time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">But Ning Zhuo wasn’t eager for another trip. He had already obtained the techniques and now planned to focus on intensive cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Of course, the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation and the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique couldn’t be cultivated casually. The aura given off by the fourth through sixth levels was completely different compared to the first through third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But he could at least cultivate the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Any activity would be completely hidden by the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. Thus, although Ning Zhuo often seemed dazed recently, he was actually cultivating his divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo said, “For now, I haven’t thought of a good plan. If we continue exploring the immortal palace, we might just fall victim to the pit traps again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zheng Jian and the others all shuddered inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Last time, after falling into the pit traps, they could neither live nor die. Their senses were all sealed off, and they endured it through sheer willpower until their souls reached the limit and they were finally ejected from the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">That nightmarish experience was something none of them wanted to go through ever again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“You don’t have any promising strategies in mind?” Zheng Jian asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhou Zhu sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But Zhou Zeshen had some news that lifted everyone’s spirits. “I’m almost at the peak of the third level. Once I break through, let’s get together and explore the Lava Immortal Palace again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Everyone nodded, making a promise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">At that moment, the bequest ceremony officially began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">All kinds of belongings from Li Leifeng’s life were publicly displayed for anyone to choose from. Whoever wanted something could take it directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Some lower-level cultivator were overjoyed with what they got, clearly benefiting greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Some clans or powerful cultivators also took some things, usually trivial items. They would then return the favor by donating a large number of spirit stones or supplies to the Children's Care Center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zhou Zeshen suddenly let out a soft exclamation and stretched out his hand. An invisible force drew a wooden mechanical board up to the second floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He took it, played with it for a moment, and laughed. "So it really is this one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"I remember when I was little, my father brought me here. I wouldn't stop crying, and Elder Li took out this toy to cheer me up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"This mechanical toy is extremely complex. You have to assemble and shift each piece to unlock bits of information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"When all the information is pieced together, it forms an immortal tale."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">As he spoke, Zhou Zeshen handed the mechanical toy to Zheng Jian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zheng Jian played with it for a bit, but quickly lost interest and passed it on to the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Zhou Zhu grabbed it and asked curiously, “Did you manage to complete it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Of course," Zhou Zeshen said. "It took an entire summer. But in the end, the immortal tale I got was only a part of the whole. I was so frustrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"But I still copied the story down and wrote it into a jade slip, which I always carry with me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“This experience taught me patience. Whenever I feel restless, I take out the jade slip and run my fingers over it a few times. That always calms my mind.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">As he spoke, Zhou Zeshen took out the jade slip and let everyone take turns looking at it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo played with the mechanical board for a bit, then looked at the story in the jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The jade slip recorded an immortal tale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">According to the tale, a Holy Immortal Master was weary after crossing the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Thus, he took out a chaos pouch, held it open by the mouth, and began shaking it fifty times. But after forty-nine shakes, he was too tired to continue and loosened his grip, opening it and releasing a mechanical world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Within the mechanical world, the heavens were jumbled, the land and water mixed together, and smoke and fire swirled everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Holy Immortal Master then took out a five elements control rod and threw it into the mechanical world, allowing the five elements to begin circulating. The heavens settled on high with the earth falling below, seas formed and rivers spread across the land, and everything became orderly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Holy Immortal Master entered the mechanical world to rest. Desiring servants, he pulled out three thousand puppet strings and flicked them three times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The first flick struck immortal qi and created an immortal puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The second flick struck demonic qi and formed a demonic puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The third flick struck divine qi and produced a divine puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The three puppets served the Holy Immortal Master with utmost care.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">When the Holy Immortal Master had rested enough and was about to leave the mechanical world to continue on his journey, the three puppets begged to follow him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">But the Holy Immortal Master told them that, rather than him not wanting to bring them, they simply could not go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">If he forcibly brought them along, they would just perish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The three puppets didn’t believe him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">So the Holy Immortal Master pointed and told them to look at the strings on their bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The puppets were dazed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The immortal puppet saw strings of ideals, wisdom, freedom, betrayal...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The demonic puppet saw strings of power, chaos, desire...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The divine puppet saw strings of principles, order, fairness...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In that instant, Ning Zhuo’s heart was shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He suddenly thought of himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He thought of all the historical texts he had studied, the figures in those texts, and the many times he had tried to understand their thoughts and choices at key moments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">As he grew older, he gradually realized: regardless of strength, these people all followed patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He thought of Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Though Yuan Dasheng was powerful, there was a string above its head tied tightly to loyalty and righteousness. Didn’t Ning Zhuo only manage to entrap it because he grabbed hold of that string?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He thought of his uncle Ning Ze, of Ning Xiaoren. They also had strings controlling them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He thought of Han Ming. Even this demonic cultivator had a string named greed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"As long as I can grasp these strings, I can control people like mechanical constructs. Can’t I?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Then...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Do I have strings on me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">At that thought, Ning Zhuo felt a sudden, inexplicable chill down his spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He slowly looked up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Slowly raised his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">And in a daze, he saw it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He saw an almost completely transparent, massive string. That was the Life-Hanging Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">At that moment, deep within his divine sea, the Illusory True Lotus Seed quietly sprouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit awoke from its slumber. Pressing a claw to its chest, it was puzzled by a sudden and inexplicable sense of fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The Life-Hanging Thread disappeared from Ning Zhuo’s vision, gone without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo lowered his head, his expression blank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"An interesting little story." Ning Zhuo smiled and handed the jade slip back to Zhou Zeshen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"It has a certain charm to it." Zhou Zeshen took the jade slip, replying offhandedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He could never have guessed just how great of an opportunity he had unwittingly handed Ning Zhuo just now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
