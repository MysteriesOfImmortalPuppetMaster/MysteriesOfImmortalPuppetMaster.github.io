<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This was the tallest, upright mountain peak in the entire Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">It was as high as a thousand zhang, standing between heaven and earth, having endured the honing of wind and rain and the erosion of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">When it began to tilt, the entire world seemed to lose its balance in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The mountain‚Äôs ridge was as straight as if carved by a knife, the cliff walls were precipitous, the cliffs were rugged, and every rock and every crevice of the mountain had accumulated countless years of buildup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In addition to the rocks, there were tens of thousands of temples on the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">These temples came in various sizes; the small ones were nothing more than niches, while the large ones could cover a hundred mu, clustered around the mid-mountain, like a gigantic belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">However, all this splendor was ultimately unable to withstand the sudden twist of fate and the ferocity of war.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Boom‚Äî!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">At the foot of the mountain, it was directly crushed by the Iron Flow strategy, and the entire mountain body toppled, with a force of billions of jin crashing onto the mountain ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The tremendous noise was deafening, resounding throughout heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The dust swept up by the raging wind soared into the air, rising to several hundred zhang, like a layer of thick black fog that almost swallowed the entire sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The dust in the air spread for several miles, covering all around, and between heaven and earth everything turned a dull yellow, with even the brilliance of the sun being obscured at that moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The collapse of the mountain propelled countless rocks and chunks of earth to fall, with dust swirling in the air and fragments flying about, and the ensuing mudslide swept crazily, as a massive amount of soil, sand, and vegetation rolled down like a flood, and countless dull sounds emanated from the valleys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The surrounding mountains and vegetation, which had once been lush with greenery, were rendered non-existent in the face of this earth-shattering disaster. Clusters of trees were knocked down and torn apart, falling like straw under the fierce impact of the collapsing mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Those shattered stone blocks, numbering in the millions, poured down from the sky like a torrential rain, and the impact force generated when they struck the ground made everyone shudder with fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Every stone that fell brought with it a storm, raising dust and scattering hundreds to thousands of fragments in every direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The nearby mountain masses shook violently, and some connected peaks also collapsed, or were struck and broken in half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Boom, boom, boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Yet again, a series of roaring sounds erupted, and the land within a hundred-mile radius trembled violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The mountain's outline was no longer complete, the piled-up rocks completely obscured the valleys and forests. The air was filled with the smell of earth and dust, unbearably choking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">And amidst the smoke and debris, the heavy-armored main force continued to march proudly, their charge never pausing for a moment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">‚ÄúCrush the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain!‚Äù Du Tiechuan ordered in a cold voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Although the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain had collapsed, countless Dragon King temples on the mountain radiated divine light, enveloping the mountain and providing heavy protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Therefore, while the surrounding peaks were ravaged into complete ruin, the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain itself remained relatively intact. At least on the sides that had not collided with the ground, it was basically unscathed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">At the command of Du Tiechuan, countless heavy-armored soldiers were filled with fervor, united as one, charging towards their target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">If they were truly to charge through, the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain would absolutely be unable to withstand them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">At the critical moment, the Whiskered Dragon King had no choice but to take action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Countless dragon whiskers pierced through the mountain, heedless of sacrifice, launching an unending encirclement attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Although the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King was powerful, the Iron Flow Levels the Plains military strategy was like an integrated whole, showing no sign of disintegration in a short time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As it appeared that the Iron Flow was about to sweep through the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">At that moment, an overwhelmingly powerful pressure suddenly spread, and even heaven and earth seemed to dim a bit; the air was torn by a tremendous force, and almost every cultivator had their heart skip a beat, feeling an inexplicable fear and sense of crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The ground suddenly rose steeply!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">A few breaths later, the surface of the earth suddenly burst open, and the massive main body of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King broke through the soil!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The dragon head, as mighty as a mountain, resembled a fortress; its dragon pupils were of a golden-orange hue, exuding a terrifying pressure, such that anyone could feel His overwhelming roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The sturdy dragon body, lacking metallic dragon scales and not as agile or slender as a normal dragon, instead appeared bloated and corpulent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Hundreds upon hundreds of Ginseng whiskers tore through the air, dancing wildly in midair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">A surging wave of qi surrounded Him, sweeping out in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Dragon King's body kept rising, standing proudly on the battlefield, and his gigantic dragon body gave an overwhelming sense of oppression, as if it could block out the sky and the sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Roar‚Äî!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He opened his mouth and exhaled a stream of earthy-yellow dragon breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Great Earth Breath!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Soul Formation level dragon breath, carrying the terrifying power of the earth, hit the Iron Flow military strategy dead center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Countless soldiers, including Ning Zhuo, simultaneously let out a painful groan, feeling the incomparable heavy pressure suddenly strike them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The jet-black steel torrent came to an abrupt halt, stirring up thousands of ripples, as the part struck by the dragon breath rapidly spread out in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">And the large groups of heavy-armored soldiers that were hit head-on by the dragon breath were all turned into stone statues, and then shattered into the finest fragments of soil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Du Tiechuan and the others had already withdrawn from the forefront, and upon seeing this scene, their pupils contracted in alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The combat power of the Iron Flow had long been at the Soul Formation Level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Now, with morale as high as a rainbow, their combat power soared, reaching the high end of the Soul Formation Level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Even so, they were still struck by the Whiskered Dragon King's full-force blow, which immediately wiped out 30% of their troops on the spot!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Du Tiechuan did not act to protect the main force, but instead was formulating military strategies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He held his sharp sword, unleashing a brilliant sword light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Military Strategy ‚Äì Swords Drawn and Crossbows Bent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Sword Technique ‚Äì Ten Thousand Zhang of Sharpness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sword Technique ‚Äì One Sword Seals the Throat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">A move in which military strategy and sword technique intermingled; this was Du Tiechuan's full-force strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The sword light, though seemingly slow, was actually fast, and in an instant, hit the main body of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Dragon King let out a wail; although at the critical moment he tilted his head to avoid the vital point, there was still a huge sword wound on his neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Du Tiechuan's sword cut through more than half of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King's neck!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The earthy-yellow dragon blood gushed out like a waterfall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Wherever the dragon blood reached, it quickly solidified and formed a scab, rapidly healing the wound on the neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Although the Dragon King suffered a heavy blow, at that moment he demonstrated the formidable healing power of his true body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King gasped for breath, then once again exhaled the Great Earth Breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Du Tiechuan still did not choose to protect the main force, and unleashed a second sword light, continuing his full-force attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Boom‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The heavy-armored main force was once again reduced, instantly losing 10% of its troops, and with the bonus from military strategy nullified, the jet-black iron flow's afterimage suddenly disintegrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Countless soldiers reverted to their true form, fell to the ground, with sounds of painful groans and agonized screams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Everyone was injured, and some were mortally wounded on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">On the body of the Whiskered Dragon King, another terrifying wound was added.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Du Tiechuan nearly cut him in half at the waist!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">‚ÄúPrepare to die!‚Äù Du Tiechuan roared as he broke away from his troops and lunged forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He raised his sword high and brought it down overhead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King's aura was now less than half of what it had been before, and he suddenly leaned forward, with countless dragon whiskers attaching themselves to the body of the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Dao Field ‚Äì Earth Dragon Nest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">In an instant, the battlefield within a hundred-mile radius was tainted, becoming a world of earthy yellow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The earth rolled, and giant dragons formed from converging rocks and soil burst out of the surface, charging towards the diminutive Du Tiechuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Du Tiechuan wanted to take flight, but was soon sucked back down to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The gravity of this Dao Field was altered and targeted according to the Whiskered Dragon King's will.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Not only was it difficult for Du Tiechuan to take a step, but even raising his hand, speaking, and other movements, he felt as if he were being dragged by an invisible enormous force, making every action extremely laborious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Du Tiechuan snorted coldly, not surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The intelligence collected by the two nations had long since detailed the might of the Whiskered Dragon King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He was originally a demon cultivator, and his true body was extremely powerful. He had also become the indigenous deity of the Thousand Peaks Forest, enjoying worship, possessing a Dao Field, making him even more formidable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Du Tiechuan took out his command seal and threw out a token: ‚ÄúCome out and fight!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Accompanied by his command, the dispatched military order token suddenly emitted a dazzling brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In the next breath, the brilliance completely dissipated, and out of thin air appeared a monstrous demon beast as huge as a small mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Soul Formation level National Beast ‚Äî Two-Headed Badger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Its body length was a full three zhang, with a shoulder height of about two zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Both of its heads, one on the left and one on the right, had huge fangs that shimmered with a cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Its neck was sturdy, with layers of fleshy ridges, and its muscles were as firm as a crescent moon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Its limbs were like four gigantic pillars, solid and powerful; each claw was like a sharp steel pincer, with nails about one foot long, capable of easily slicing through steel armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Its tail was extremely robust, about two zhang in length, and at the end of its tail were spikes, resembling hundreds of long spears gathered together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Once the Two-Headed Badger was released, it immediately went into battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">One head spewed fire, the other exhaled frost, targeting the main body of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, scorching the left side of his dragon body to jet black, and freezing the right side into an icy layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Boom, boom, boom‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Du Tiechuan, the Two-Headed Badger, and the main body of the Whiskered Dragon King engaged in the most intense battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">No one dared to enter the Dao Field to participate in this battle. The mere aftershocks alone caused all the Nascent Soul-level cultivators to shrink back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Du Tiechuan was bolstered by both military might and national strength, while the Whiskered Dragon King also had the advantage of his powerful Dao Field. From the very beginning, the attack and slaughter between both sides was fought with utmost effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Every move was executed with all-out effort, aiming precisely at the vital points. If a single move could kill the opponent, a second strike would never be used!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Two-Headed Badger howled in agony, and soon fell from grievous injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Although it was aided by national strength, its overall combat ability was not on par with Du Tiechuan or the Whiskered Dragon King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Even at the Soul Formation Level, there was a gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Demon Technique ‚Äì Dragon Whisker Bind the Heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Divine Technique ‚Äì Dragon King Divine Prison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Demon God Technique ‚Äì Burial Life Dragon Abyss!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Countless dragon whiskers in the Dao Field transformed into innumerable talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The talismans connected one after another, forming chains that bound Du Tiechuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">For a moment, Du Tiechuan was as if trapped like a tiny mosquito in a vast spider‚Äôs web.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Du Tiechuan snorted coldly, his body covered in blood, and mustered his remaining strength to unleash his final strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Sword Technique ‚Äì Heaven-Cleaving Sword Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Sword Technique ‚Äì Thunderous Azure Edge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Military Strategy ‚Äì Tian Gang Dao Soldier Battle Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Military Strategy ‚Äì The Empty City Ruse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">His sword qi surged towards the heavens, accompanied by azure lightning. The aura of his robust energy erupted all around him, transforming into thirty-six Tian Gang Dao Soldiers, who swiftly formed a battle array around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In the end, the three powers merged under the Empty City Ruse military strategy, transforming into a martial battle sword ‚ÄîTian Gang Slash the Empty Thunder!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Thunder roared, breaking countless talisman chains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The dragon whiskers shattered, scattering earthy-yellow dragon blood all over the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The semi-transparent sword light struck the main body of the Whiskered Dragon King, causing a terrifying internal explosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">On the spot, it blew a huge hole in the Whiskered Dragon King, and his dragon body was nearly split into two pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">His dragon body was shattered in countless ways, and from hundreds and thousands of wounds, extremely sharp martial sword qi was ejected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Whiskered Dragon King let out a wail, transformed into a streak of yellow light, and escaped underground!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">On Du Tiechuan‚Äôs body, there still remained a dozen or so talisman chains, and he did not have time to pursue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">He could only strike again, severing the Whiskered Dragon King‚Äôs Dao Field.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">As the Dao Field disintegrated into pieces, from deep underground, another pained roar of the Dragon King resounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The roar quickly faded, indicating that the Dragon King was retreating deeper underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">‚ÄúWe have won!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">‚ÄúWe won!!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">‚ÄúQuickly retreat, quickly retreat.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The two national armies cheered in unison, while on the side of the Thousand Peaks Forest allied forces, they retreated without a fight; even some Nascent Soul-level cultivators looked dismal and their hearts were in panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Countless adoring gazes converged upon Du Tiechuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">This Soul Formation level general, with a face like iron and a determined expression, dragged along a dozen or so talisman chains, and floated above the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">He ordered loudly that a military camp be established right here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Over forty formation masters floated into the air, brandishing the talismans in their hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Countless talismans fell like raindrops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Beams of light interwove in the air, quickly converging into a massive three-dimensional formation array. The array covered over a hundred mu, and was extremely magnificent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Then, over sixty artifact refiners, paying out of their own pockets, took out the semi-finished treasure materials that they had already refined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">They threw the treasure materials into the formation array, fitting each light point or ray, and filled various magical treasures, weapons, and military flags in places like the array‚Äôs foot and the array‚Äôs eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Soon, the formation array turned from illusion into reality, becoming a gigantic military camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Though it was called a military camp, it looked more like a small city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The main structure of the city used Canghai wood, Shendiao stone, and Qingcheng iron, with an overall bronze-like hue, solemn and dignified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">There were numerous watchtowers along the edges of the city, and military flags fluttered on the walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Inside the city, there were numerous barracks, as well as open spaces and training fields.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">At the very center was the Commander-in-Chief‚Äôs main hall; on the red-copper pillars around the hall, there were totems of the Four Symbols‚Äîthe Black Tortoise, the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, and the Vermilion Bird‚Äîcarved separately, exuding majestic grandeur.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Du Tiechuan landed in the Commander-in-Chief‚Äôs main hall, and threw out a series of military order tokens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The city‚Äôs gates on all sides opened wide, emanating a strong suction force, which, according to the markings on the military order tokens, sucked in each heavy-armored main force unit into the city for detailed arrangement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Meanwhile, the formation masters continued to set up fortifications.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">They first set up a Blue Sea Soldier Tide Array around the small city. Then, in the middle ring, they set up a Thunder Net Locking-the-Sky Array. Finally, in the outer layer, they formed an integrated offensive and defensive Blue Moon Flying Shield Array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">The three layers of formation complemented each other, forming a complete defensive barrier with no blind spots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Once the formation array was set up, it was successfully activated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The cultivators in charge of logistics then left the city and began to clean up the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Du Tiechuan gathered all the main generals into the command hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">He coughed a few times, spat blood in front of everyone, and stated plainly: ‚ÄúThe Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and I fought to the death, resulting in mutual grievous injuries. In a short time, we must actively recuperate and strive for a swift recovery.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">‚ÄúYou must actively sweep through every mountain top, and with all your might, exterminate the Dragon King‚Äôs followers, raze the mountains and destroy the temples, severing the source of their worship.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">‚ÄúOnly in this way, by accumulating little by little and gathering advantages, can we ultimately achieve victory!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">The main generals exchanged glances, and for a moment there was silence in the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Du Tiechuan snorted coldly and immediately announced that in the upcoming battles, rewards and promotions would be given based on merit without delay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">The generals were greatly encouraged and responded in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
