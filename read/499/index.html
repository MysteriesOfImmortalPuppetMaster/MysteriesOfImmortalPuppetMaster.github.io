<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Having survived a great calamity, blessings were sure to follow!<br/>
<br/>
After Sun and Ning had a thorough talk, both of them felt similar emotions.<br/>
<br/>
“This time was really too perilous.” Ning Zhuo thought of how Sun Lingtong had narrowly escaped death just now, and he still felt his heart pounding.<br/>
<br/>
His gaze became more resolute, and he subconsciously clenched his fist. “Our cultivation is too weak. We must raise it at full speed, raise it again!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong placed both hands behind his head, his face showing an excited smile and his tone brimming with lingering excitement. “That was too thrilling. It was really a lot of fun.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately grew serious, pointing at the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat. “Boss, don’t act recklessly. The Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat is already in pieces like this.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong walked up to the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat and inspected the cracks and gaps all over the ship. The excitement on his face subsided a lot. “We have to find a way to repair it.”<br/>
<br/>
“I was able to escape and survive this time, all thanks to it.”<br/>
<br/>
“It didn’t just help me suppress the void fissure, it also contributed greatly before that.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I hadn’t borrowed it earlier to refine my physical body, relying solely on my previous body-refining foundation, I’m afraid I’d only have lasted a few breaths under the infiltration of the void fissure!”<br/>
<br/>
After pausing for a moment, Sun Lingtong added, “Little Zhuo, you will also need to increase your body’s toughness in the future, and you’ll have to rely on it as well.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded.<br/>
<br/>
The two discussed for a while longer and reached a new division of tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo went to the dragon-head cabin to control the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, while Sun Lingtong slipped into another cabin to attempt cracking the storage pouch that the transport officer had lost.<br/>
<br/>
Both Sun and Ning were filled with strong anticipation for this storage pouch.<br/>
<br/>
The reason was simple.<br/>
<br/>
The storage pouch emanated starlight, which had attracted a terrifying hunt from a Soul Formation–level foe.<br/>
<br/>
Since the other side was so furious, going to such lengths, the contents of this pouch were surely of great importance —worth a fortune!<br/>
<br/>
“This is a Nascent Soul–level storage pouch!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong rubbed his hands, his eyes shining.<br/>
<br/>
He himself was only at the Foundation Establishment realm.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, he would never have had the confidence to crack a Nascent Soul–level storage pouch. But now, he had risked his life to absorb the bone marrow of the Void Evil God, and the Void mark in his Sea of Consciousness had undergone a qualitative change.<br/>
<br/>
And the path of void was best suited for cracking storage-type artifacts.<br/>
<br/>
“I really have to give it a try!”<br/>
<br/>
While Sun Lingtong wrestled with the storage pouch, Ning Zhuo controlled the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, left the void, and returned to the present world.<br/>
<br/>
Because the storage pouch no longer emanated starlight, there was no starlight assaulting them from the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Out of caution, Ning Zhuo stayed outside for quite some time without any incident.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, the mechanism ring on his finger remained perfectly calm.<br/>
<br/>
Only after making sure everything was safe did Ning Zhuo return to the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp was stationed in Dice-Bone Giant Wood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er had just ended his training for the day. His sweat had soaked his clothes more than once, leaving him physically and mentally exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
A mountain breeze blew by. Liu Er’s body trembled slightly, and he sneezed.<br/>
<br/>
He was walking at the time, and that sneeze disrupted his stride. His left foot caught his right, his knee buckled, and he nearly fell.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he was at the Golden Core stage and possessed some body-refining foundation.<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, he steadied himself and stood upright.<br/>
<br/>
Plop.<br/>
<br/>
A tiny splat of semi-liquid bird droppings fell on his shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er looked at the bird droppings and activated his spiritual power, banishing it.<br/>
<br/>
He frowned and muttered to himself, “I’ve felt uneasy lately, strangely off.”<br/>
<br/>
Just then, a subordinate came running over to report that Ning Zhuo had returned.<br/>
<br/>
When Liu Er heard this, though displeased at heart, he suppressed the negative emotion, let a smile surface on his face, changed direction, and hurried to the entrance of the camp.<br/>
<br/>
“Advisor, haha, you’ve finally come back.” Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, Liu Er grabbed his arm, shook it a few times, looking overjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
“General,” Ning Zhuo responded with a broad smile as well.<br/>
<br/>
When he left camp before, he had naturally reported to Liu Er, since it had been a departure to do battle, rather than a typical training exercise at the army camp.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er accompanied Ning Zhuo to the Advisor’s tent, asking questions about his welfare along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Once inside, Liu Er sighed, revealing a worried expression as he described the current plight of the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
After this deployment —especially in seizing Dice-Bone Giant Wood Mountain —the Three Generals Camp had suffered numerous casualties. To treat the wounded and reinforce training, the daily cost of spirit stones was rapidly climbing, and their war funds were running low.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo listened carefully. In the end, he smiled and nodded. “Please don’t worry, General. Here are one hundred thousand mid-grade spirit stones. Take them first and use them to fill the war budget.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was overjoyed and immediately clasped his hands in thanks. “Having you as our advisor truly is the good fortune of the Three Generals Camp.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly acted humble. “General, you flatter me. A young man like me feels unworthy. I can only rely on the General’s might to march into the Thousand Peaks Forest in search of opportunities to avenge my family. Being able to meet the General is truly the greatest luck of my life!”<br/>
<br/>
Having gotten what he wanted, Liu Er left the Advisor’s tent. Halfway down the road, the smile on his face finally faded.<br/>
<br/>
His feelings were complicated.<br/>
<br/>
He really disliked Ning Zhuo in many ways —especially when the Dice-Bone Demon God had publicly submitted to Ning Zhuo before. That had left him with a rather sour taste.<br/>
<br/>
Yet he had to endure it!<br/>
<br/>
Because at the moment, the Three Generals Camp really could not do without Ning Zhuo, their benefactor.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing Liu Er off, Ning Zhuo instructed the guards to refuse any visitors and declared that he was going into seclusion to cultivate.<br/>
<br/>
When he was alone, Ning Zhuo took out the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon from his waist.<br/>
<br/>
He moved with great care, because the mechanical dragon was in even worse shape this time than before.<br/>
<br/>
First, he held the miniaturized Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon in his hand and examined it closely.<br/>
<br/>
After a few moments, he let out a deep sigh, put it down, and went straight inside.<br/>
<br/>
In the cabin, he found Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong looked exhausted, his hair messy and eyes bloodshot.<br/>
<br/>
Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, he reflexively pouted and, with a note of disappointment, said, “I didn’t expect this storage pouch’s anti-theft measures to be so thorough.”<br/>
<br/>
“I used every method, but there wasn’t the slightest progress.”<br/>
<br/>
He had relied on the Void mark, still hoping for a chance. But now, he had suffered a total defeat.<br/>
<br/>
He sighed to Ning Zhuo, “I overestimated myself.”<br/>
<br/>
“I compared national-level anti-theft measures to those of the civilian world.”<br/>
<br/>
“The storage pouch’s seal has both official and military scripts, and the power of the nation is poured into it to an extreme degree.”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s also of the Nascent Soul level, two entire major realms higher than my own cultivation. Maybe when I reach Golden Core, I’d have a slim chance. I could borrow the power of the void to steal out part of its contents.”<br/>
<br/>
“If nothing unexpected happens in the short term, we won’t be able to open it.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. “All right then.”<br/>
<br/>
“When our abilities improve in the future, we’ll try again.”<br/>
<br/>
At present, Ning Zhuo had enough money for expenses, and plenty of precious materials on hand. He had just given Liu Er two hundred thousand mid-grade spirit stones, which didn’t even cover half of what it had cost to repair the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon this time.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo called for Sun Lingtong to help him.<br/>
<br/>
Again, they planned to spare no expense in materials to get the Traveling Dragon back in proper shape.<br/>
<br/>
He still felt deeply fearful whenever he recalled the recent void turbulence.<br/>
<br/>
“If not for the warning from my mechanism ring earlier, I would surely have chosen the cost-effective repair method.”<br/>
<br/>
“And if that was really how I chose, both Boss Sun and I would have perished in the void’s upheaval. The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon wouldn’t have been able to hold out!”<br/>
<br/>
While Sun and Ning poured resources into repairing the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, news of what happened on Bikuang Mountain also spread among the upper ranks of the Thousand Peaks Forest alliance.<br/>
<br/>
Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
Dragon King Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng had been making an impassioned accusation for a while now.<br/>
<br/>
Along with him were Gu Ya and others.<br/>
<br/>
They were all condemning a single person —or more precisely, a single demon.<br/>
<br/>
The Old Monster in the Stone!<br/>
<br/>
“For his own selfish gain, this demon robbed us of almost all our spoils of war.”<br/>
<br/>
“In the end, all we managed to get was a mere five thousand mid-grade spirit stones.”<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng spread his hands wide, revealing a rare sense of helplessness and frustration for a Golden Core expert.<br/>
<br/>
To a considerable degree, this drew sympathy from the other cultivators present.<br/>
<br/>
They began voicing their opinions:<br/>
<br/>
“If a demon cultivator like that isn’t punished harshly, who can fight wholeheartedly in the future?”<br/>
<br/>
“Had everyone not been charging and fighting on the front lines, would that Old Monster in the Stone have had the chance to plunder all over? Impossible!”<br/>
<br/>
“The Old Monster in the Stone is so detestable. The sooner we remove such a malignant presence from our ranks, the better.”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu had remained silent all along, a sharp contrast to his usual tendency to speak with great fervor.<br/>
<br/>
His odd quietness attracted the attention of some observant individuals, prompting one of them to ask, “What does Chief Advisor Lu think?”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu thought to himself, “I’m just here to watch your show!”<br/>
<br/>
He was secretly pleased; very few people knew the Old Monster in the Stone’s actual cultivation. Even Lord Long only had guesses.<br/>
<br/>
Only he could be absolutely certain!<br/>
<br/>
He thought fast, considering how to help the Old Monster in the Stone cover things up.<br/>
<br/>
Right then, urgent intelligence arrived.<br/>
<br/>
As the alliance’s Chief Military Strategist, Lu Hongtu examined the information in the jade slip for a long time without a word.<br/>
<br/>
This report came from Gao Cuo and the others, who had witnessed everything firsthand and escorted the data back. They had even recorded relevant footage!<br/>
<br/>
After Lu Hongtu saw the spell-projection within, his heart sank.<br/>
<br/>
“This starlight is very subdued, but absolutely powerful —it’s reached the Soul Formation level.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Old Monster in the Stone was able to stand up to such an attack, so his Soul Formation cultivation is now out in the open!”<br/>
<br/>
“There’s no concealing this intel anymore. Now, not only me, but Lord Long and the higher-ups also can’t hide it.”<br/>
<br/>
For Lu Hongtu, this was not good news.<br/>
<br/>
In future operations, he would lose the advantage of this information gap.<br/>
<br/>
He gave a soft sigh, feeling quite helpless, and thought, “So be it. This isn’t something I can control now.”<br/>
<br/>
At that, he handed the jade slip containing the report to the others. “All of you, take a look.”<br/>
<br/>
The news was quickly passed around.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng appeared completely stunned.<br/>
<br/>
Gu Ya and the rest looked at each other, all visibly shaken and fearful.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in the great hall changed expressions, and they began to revise their statements:<br/>
<br/>
“Excellent! Old Monster in the Stone is indeed worthy of being our leader in the Thousand Peaks Forest—he stood up to the national power attack from two countries, so mighty and unstoppable, truly an inspiration to us all.”<br/>
<br/>
“Old Monster in the Stone truly is a role model for us all. Ah, to be in the same Thousand Peaks Forest as him —I am truly fortunate!”<br/>
<br/>
“Hahaha! I see now, I understand! Old Monster in the Stone is undoubtedly a master. Every single move he makes has profound meaning. He worried that if we carried those spoils, we’d suffer from the enemy’s pursuit and punishment, so he took all those spoils onto himself.”<br/>
<br/>
All eyes turned to the person who had just said all that —none other than Chen Lingfeng.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng laughed heartily, patting his own chest. “It was my shallowness, all my shallowness!”<br/>
<br/>
“I judged a gentleman with a petty mind.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Old Monster in the Stone has done so much for us —too much. He has incredible integrity. If I had carried the storage pouch, I’d be nothing but ashes by now—completely dead!”<br/>
<br/>
“From this perspective, Old Monster in the Stone is my savior!”<br/>
<br/>
Silence filled the hall.<br/>
<br/>
Those present all stared at Chen Lingfeng. Many of them had a teasing look in their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng coughed, swept a glance around, then looked behind him.<br/>
<br/>
Gu Ya and the others snapped out of their daze and quickly echoed Chen Lingfeng, declaring that Old Monster in the Stone had borne all the risks himself. Fighting under such a mighty expert was truly their good luck!<br/>
<br/>
When they were done, the great hall erupted in chatter.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators were mostly excited, and their talk focused on one point: Old Monster in the Stone!<br/>
<br/>
At such a critical juncture —just before the war —a Soul Formation–level presence had suddenly appeared on Thousand Peaks Forest’s side. It was truly uplifting and a huge boon.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion went on for two or three hours before Lu Hongtu finally stood up, quieting the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
After all, their talk was growing more and more absurd.<br/>
<br/>
Old Monster in the Stone was basically a recluse. There were few records of his exploits. But with so much speculation and exaggeration flying around, legends of him arose right under Lu Hongtu’s nose.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, Old Monster in the Stone had swallowed fragments of the Treasure-Distributing Cliff. Yet in the words of these cultivators, Old Monster in the Stone’s true body was actually a ten-thousand-year earth-spirit that had been born in the Treasure-Distributing Cliff!<br/>
<br/>
That origin story was dozens of times grander than the real thing!<br/>
<br/>
Then came claims that the Heaven-Pillar Giant Wood Mountain where Old Monster in the Stone resided had almost collapsed at one point and that he had singlehandedly suppressed and rebuilt it. The countless living beings on the Stone Monster Giant Wood Mountain owed him an immense debt.<br/>
<br/>
That was utterly ridiculous!<br/>
<br/>
Stone Monster Giant Wood Mountain was a barren place; there were no living creatures. Most likely, the only occupant was Old Monster in the Stone himself!<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu truly couldn’t stand any more of it. He halted the discussion and forcibly changed the subject. “We must now convene for a military conference. How shall we exterminate the four armies that have made their incursion?”<br/>
<br/>
This was indeed a significant topic. The cultivators fell silent, each thinking hard.<br/>
<br/>
Before long, someone snorted coldly, “All four of those armies are just cannon fodder. Let’s simply treat them as such —deploy our troops and wipe them out!”<br/>
<br/>
“No good,” someone immediately objected. “If we deploy our forces, our entire distribution of troops will be exposed. Then Du Tiechuan’s scheme will have succeeded.”<br/>
<br/>
Another continued, “So we should send specific experts or deploy some special means to destroy those four armies!”<br/>
<br/>
“I believe with the talent gathered in Thousand Peaks Forest, there’s no way we can’t handle four armies.”<br/>
<br/>
Bikuang Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan gazed into the distance at Bikuang Mountain, frowned, and did not advance.<br/>
<br/>
He gripped a jade slip in his hand, newly delivered through special means at the cost of national power—urgent military intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
“Old Monster in the Stone, Soul Formation level?!”<br/>
<br/>
“And he last vanished right here on Bikuang Mountain?”<br/>
<br/>
“What kind of joke is this!”<br/>
<br/>
Just then, his deputy came over. “General, we’ve already rested here for half a cup of tea. Shall we proceed to capture Bikuang Mountain?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan let out a cold snort, put the jade slip in his breast pocket, and issued a frosty command. “Go around it.”</div>
