<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Having survived a great calamity, blessings were sure to follow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After Sun and Ning had a thorough talk, both of them felt similar emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“This time was really too perilous.” Ning Zhuo thought of how Sun Lingtong had narrowly escaped death just now, and he still felt his heart pounding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">His gaze became more resolute, and he subconsciously clenched his fist. “Our cultivation is too weak. We must raise it at full speed, raise it again!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Sun Lingtong placed both hands behind his head, his face showing an excited smile and his tone brimming with lingering excitement. “That was too thrilling. It was really a lot of fun.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo immediately grew serious, pointing at the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat. “Boss, don’t act recklessly. The Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat is already in pieces like this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong walked up to the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat and inspected the cracks and gaps all over the ship. The excitement on his face subsided a lot. “We have to find a way to repair it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“I was able to escape and survive this time, all thanks to it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“It didn’t just help me suppress the void fissure, it also contributed greatly before that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“If I hadn’t borrowed it earlier to refine my physical body, relying solely on my previous body-refining foundation, I’m afraid I’d only have lasted a few breaths under the infiltration of the void fissure!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After pausing for a moment, Sun Lingtong added, “Little Zhuo, you will also need to increase your body’s toughness in the future, and you’ll have to rely on it as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The two discussed for a while longer and reached a new division of tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo went to the dragon-head cabin to control the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, while Sun Lingtong slipped into another cabin to attempt cracking the storage pouch that the transport officer had lost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Both Sun and Ning were filled with strong anticipation for this storage pouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The reason was simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The storage pouch emanated starlight, which had attracted a terrifying hunt from a Soul Formation–level foe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Since the other side was so furious, going to such lengths, the contents of this pouch were surely of great importance —worth a fortune!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“This is a Nascent Soul–level storage pouch!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Sun Lingtong rubbed his hands, his eyes shining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He himself was only at the Foundation Establishment realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">In the past, he would never have had the confidence to crack a Nascent Soul–level storage pouch. But now, he had risked his life to absorb the bone marrow of the Void Evil God, and the Void mark in his Sea of Consciousness had undergone a qualitative change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">And the path of void was best suited for cracking storage-type artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“I really have to give it a try!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">While Sun Lingtong wrestled with the storage pouch, Ning Zhuo controlled the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, left the void, and returned to the present world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Because the storage pouch no longer emanated starlight, there was no starlight assaulting them from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Out of caution, Ning Zhuo stayed outside for quite some time without any incident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Most importantly, the mechanism ring on his finger remained perfectly calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Only after making sure everything was safe did Ning Zhuo return to the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Three Generals Camp was stationed in Dice-Bone Giant Wood Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Liu Er had just ended his training for the day. His sweat had soaked his clothes more than once, leaving him physically and mentally exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">A mountain breeze blew by. Liu Er’s body trembled slightly, and he sneezed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He was walking at the time, and that sneeze disrupted his stride. His left foot caught his right, his knee buckled, and he nearly fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">After all, he was at the Golden Core stage and possessed some body-refining foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">In the next instant, he steadied himself and stood upright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Plop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">A tiny splat of semi-liquid bird droppings fell on his shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Liu Er looked at the bird droppings and activated his spiritual power, banishing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He frowned and muttered to himself, “I’ve felt uneasy lately, strangely off.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Just then, a subordinate came running over to report that Ning Zhuo had returned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">When Liu Er heard this, though displeased at heart, he suppressed the negative emotion, let a smile surface on his face, changed direction, and hurried to the entrance of the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“Advisor, haha, you’ve finally come back.” Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, Liu Er grabbed his arm, shook it a few times, looking overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“General,” Ning Zhuo responded with a broad smile as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">When he left camp before, he had naturally reported to Liu Er, since it had been a departure to do battle, rather than a typical training exercise at the army camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Liu Er accompanied Ning Zhuo to the Advisor’s tent, asking questions about his welfare along the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Once inside, Liu Er sighed, revealing a worried expression as he described the current plight of the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After this deployment —especially in seizing Dice-Bone Giant Wood Mountain —the Three Generals Camp had suffered numerous casualties. To treat the wounded and reinforce training, the daily cost of spirit stones was rapidly climbing, and their war funds were running low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo listened carefully. In the end, he smiled and nodded. “Please don’t worry, General. Here are one hundred thousand mid-grade spirit stones. Take them first and use them to fill the war budget.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Liu Er was overjoyed and immediately clasped his hands in thanks. “Having you as our advisor truly is the good fortune of the Three Generals Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo hurriedly acted humble. “General, you flatter me. A young man like me feels unworthy. I can only rely on the General’s might to march into the Thousand Peaks Forest in search of opportunities to avenge my family. Being able to meet the General is truly the greatest luck of my life!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Having gotten what he wanted, Liu Er left the Advisor’s tent. Halfway down the road, the smile on his face finally faded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">His feelings were complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He really disliked Ning Zhuo in many ways —especially when the Dice-Bone Demon God had publicly submitted to Ning Zhuo before. That had left him with a rather sour taste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Yet he had to endure it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Because at the moment, the Three Generals Camp really could not do without Ning Zhuo, their benefactor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">After seeing Liu Er off, Ning Zhuo instructed the guards to refuse any visitors and declared that he was going into seclusion to cultivate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">When he was alone, Ning Zhuo took out the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon from his waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He moved with great care, because the mechanical dragon was in even worse shape this time than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">First, he held the miniaturized Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon in his hand and examined it closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">After a few moments, he let out a deep sigh, put it down, and went straight inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">In the cabin, he found Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong looked exhausted, his hair messy and eyes bloodshot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, he reflexively pouted and, with a note of disappointment, said, “I didn’t expect this storage pouch’s anti-theft measures to be so thorough.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“I used every method, but there wasn’t the slightest progress.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He had relied on the Void mark, still hoping for a chance. But now, he had suffered a total defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He sighed to Ning Zhuo, “I overestimated myself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“I compared national-level anti-theft measures to those of the civilian world.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“The storage pouch’s seal has both official and military scripts, and the power of the nation is poured into it to an extreme degree.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“It’s also of the Nascent Soul level, two entire major realms higher than my own cultivation. Maybe when I reach Golden Core, I’d have a slim chance. I could borrow the power of the void to steal out part of its contents.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“If nothing unexpected happens in the short term, we won’t be able to open it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo nodded. “All right then.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“When our abilities improve in the future, we’ll try again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">At present, Ning Zhuo had enough money for expenses, and plenty of precious materials on hand. He had just given Liu Er two hundred thousand mid-grade spirit stones, which didn’t even cover half of what it had cost to repair the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo called for Sun Lingtong to help him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Again, they planned to spare no expense in materials to get the Traveling Dragon back in proper shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He still felt deeply fearful whenever he recalled the recent void turbulence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“If not for the warning from my mechanism ring earlier, I would surely have chosen the cost-effective repair method.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“And if that was really how I chose, both Boss Sun and I would have perished in the void’s upheaval. The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon wouldn’t have been able to hold out!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">While Sun and Ning poured resources into repairing the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, news of what happened on Bikuang Mountain also spread among the upper ranks of the Thousand Peaks Forest alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Dragon King Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Chen Lingfeng had been making an impassioned accusation for a while now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Along with him were Gu Ya and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">They were all condemning a single person —or more precisely, a single demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The Old Monster in the Stone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“For his own selfish gain, this demon robbed us of almost all our spoils of war.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“In the end, all we managed to get was a mere five thousand mid-grade spirit stones.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Chen Lingfeng spread his hands wide, revealing a rare sense of helplessness and frustration for a Golden Core expert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">To a considerable degree, this drew sympathy from the other cultivators present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">They began voicing their opinions:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“If a demon cultivator like that isn’t punished harshly, who can fight wholeheartedly in the future?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Had everyone not been charging and fighting on the front lines, would that Old Monster in the Stone have had the chance to plunder all over? Impossible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“The Old Monster in the Stone is so detestable. The sooner we remove such a malignant presence from our ranks, the better.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Lu Hongtu had remained silent all along, a sharp contrast to his usual tendency to speak with great fervor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">His odd quietness attracted the attention of some observant individuals, prompting one of them to ask, “What does Chief Advisor Lu think?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Lu Hongtu thought to himself, “I’m just here to watch your show!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He was secretly pleased; very few people knew the Old Monster in the Stone’s actual cultivation. Even Lord Long only had guesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Only he could be absolutely certain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He thought fast, considering how to help the Old Monster in the Stone cover things up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Right then, urgent intelligence arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">As the alliance’s Chief Military Strategist, Lu Hongtu examined the information in the jade slip for a long time without a word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">This report came from Gao Cuo and the others, who had witnessed everything firsthand and escorted the data back. They had even recorded relevant footage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">After Lu Hongtu saw the spell-projection within, his heart sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“This starlight is very subdued, but absolutely powerful —it’s reached the Soul Formation level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“The Old Monster in the Stone was able to stand up to such an attack, so his Soul Formation cultivation is now out in the open!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“There’s no concealing this intel anymore. Now, not only me, but Lord Long and the higher-ups also can’t hide it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">For Lu Hongtu, this was not good news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">In future operations, he would lose the advantage of this information gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He gave a soft sigh, feeling quite helpless, and thought, “So be it. This isn’t something I can control now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">At that, he handed the jade slip containing the report to the others. “All of you, take a look.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The news was quickly passed around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Chen Lingfeng appeared completely stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Gu Ya and the rest looked at each other, all visibly shaken and fearful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Everyone in the great hall changed expressions, and they began to revise their statements:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“Excellent! Old Monster in the Stone is indeed worthy of being our leader in the Thousand Peaks Forest—he stood up to the national power attack from two countries, so mighty and unstoppable, truly an inspiration to us all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“Old Monster in the Stone truly is a role model for us all. Ah, to be in the same Thousand Peaks Forest as him —I am truly fortunate!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“Hahaha! I see now, I understand! Old Monster in the Stone is undoubtedly a master. Every single move he makes has profound meaning. He worried that if we carried those spoils, we’d suffer from the enemy’s pursuit and punishment, so he took all those spoils onto himself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">All eyes turned to the person who had just said all that —none other than Chen Lingfeng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Chen Lingfeng laughed heartily, patting his own chest. “It was my shallowness, all my shallowness!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">“I judged a gentleman with a petty mind.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">“The Old Monster in the Stone has done so much for us —too much. He has incredible integrity. If I had carried the storage pouch, I’d be nothing but ashes by now—completely dead!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“From this perspective, Old Monster in the Stone is my savior!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Silence filled the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Those present all stared at Chen Lingfeng. Many of them had a teasing look in their eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Chen Lingfeng coughed, swept a glance around, then looked behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Gu Ya and the others snapped out of their daze and quickly echoed Chen Lingfeng, declaring that Old Monster in the Stone had borne all the risks himself. Fighting under such a mighty expert was truly their good luck!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">When they were done, the great hall erupted in chatter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The cultivators were mostly excited, and their talk focused on one point: Old Monster in the Stone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">At such a critical juncture —just before the war —a Soul Formation–level presence had suddenly appeared on Thousand Peaks Forest’s side. It was truly uplifting and a huge boon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The discussion went on for two or three hours before Lu Hongtu finally stood up, quieting the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">After all, their talk was growing more and more absurd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Old Monster in the Stone was basically a recluse. There were few records of his exploits. But with so much speculation and exaggeration flying around, legends of him arose right under Lu Hongtu’s nose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Indeed, Old Monster in the Stone had swallowed fragments of the Treasure-Distributing Cliff. Yet in the words of these cultivators, Old Monster in the Stone’s true body was actually a ten-thousand-year earth-spirit that had been born in the Treasure-Distributing Cliff!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">That origin story was dozens of times grander than the real thing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Then came claims that the Heaven-Pillar Giant Wood Mountain where Old Monster in the Stone resided had almost collapsed at one point and that he had singlehandedly suppressed and rebuilt it. The countless living beings on the Stone Monster Giant Wood Mountain owed him an immense debt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">That was utterly ridiculous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Stone Monster Giant Wood Mountain was a barren place; there were no living creatures. Most likely, the only occupant was Old Monster in the Stone himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Lu Hongtu truly couldn’t stand any more of it. He halted the discussion and forcibly changed the subject. “We must now convene for a military conference. How shall we exterminate the four armies that have made their incursion?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">This was indeed a significant topic. The cultivators fell silent, each thinking hard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Before long, someone snorted coldly, “All four of those armies are just cannon fodder. Let’s simply treat them as such —deploy our troops and wipe them out!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“No good,” someone immediately objected. “If we deploy our forces, our entire distribution of troops will be exposed. Then Du Tiechuan’s scheme will have succeeded.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Another continued, “So we should send specific experts or deploy some special means to destroy those four armies!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“I believe with the talent gathered in Thousand Peaks Forest, there’s no way we can’t handle four armies.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Bikuang Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Sun Gan gazed into the distance at Bikuang Mountain, frowned, and did not advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">He gripped a jade slip in his hand, newly delivered through special means at the cost of national power—urgent military intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">“Old Monster in the Stone, Soul Formation level?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">“And he last vanished right here on Bikuang Mountain?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">“What kind of joke is this!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Just then, his deputy came over. “General, we’ve already rested here for half a cup of tea. Shall we proceed to capture Bikuang Mountain?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Sun Gan let out a cold snort, put the jade slip in his breast pocket, and issued a frosty command. “Go around it.”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
