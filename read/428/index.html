<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 428: Ning Zhuo gains Wisdom</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Life Hanging by a Thread!" Zhu Xuangji's heart tightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">If Ning Zhuo had mastered this kind of divine power, he would certainly not spare him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">However, in the next moment, Shen Lingshu's tone shifted: "But the situation where Ning Jufan's fortune is high could also be due to his own reasons."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"When a person's fortune plummets to the bottom, after enduring this low period, it will inevitably rise." "A strong external force will also make Ning Jufan's fortune surge and climb steadily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"In terms of fortune, there is a saying of 'extreme misfortune turning into good fortune.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Shen Lingshu continued: "There is another reason, which is external assistance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"For example, our treatment of Ning Jufan in Jade Steel Mountain has influenced the current town chief of Jade Steel Mountain, making his attitude towards Ning Jufan, and even the Ning family, more enthusiastic."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"We also added a layer of official magic to his official seal, allowing him to use the power of the state to assist in his cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"There is an even more important factor, which is Elder Ape."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Since Ning Jufan was rescued, Zhu Xuangji had taken the initiative to teach Ning Jufan the methods of demonic cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Jufan immediately passed this knowledge on to Elder Ape and has been assisting her in cultivation diligently over the past few days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Elder Ape was originally a demonic beast, and because she belonged to the ape family, her intelligence surpasses that of most demonic beasts but was still weaker than that of humans. She could still be controlled by emotions and instincts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Meng family hired assassins to set traps, preparing methods to target this weakness of demonic beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But as long as Elder Ape started cultivating and transitioning from a demonic beast to a demonic cultivator, her intelligence would sprout and continue to rise, at least reaching the level of an ordinary person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In this way, the methods targeting demonic beasts would no longer be effective, which greatly enhanced Ning Jufan's strength, and even the strength of the entire Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">From this perspective, it is reasonable for Ning Jufan's fortune to be strong. Zhu Xuangji was a bit confused: "So, doesn't this mean that it still cannot be proven that Ning Zhuo has mastered the Life Hanging by a Thread divine power?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Shen Lingshu nodded: "Do you think divination is so easy to determine results? The more special the target with strong fortune, and the more significant the events related to oneself, the harder it is to predict accurately. Sometimes, the results of the divination might even lead you to take wrong actions, resulting in more unfavorable consequences."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"This is the backlash of divination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Moreover, what we want to divine is Ning Zhuo's background, but the real target is not in front of us. We can only approach it indirectly, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zhu Xuangji was speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He looked at the Mysterious Mechanism Qi Pouch in Shen Lingshu's hand and asked, "When will the fortune in here be returned to Ning Jufan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"The time limit is approaching. Ning Jufan is about to leave for Fire Persimmon Immortal City to participate in the contest for the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Under these circumstances, it is better to let him give his all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Jufan was very crucial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Even more crucial than Elder Ape!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Without Elder Ape, the Southern Bean Kingdom still had other methods to support his combat power. Of course, this came at a cost. The Ning family would have to pay for it via contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Ning family was like a nail, driven into Fire Persimmon Immortal City, helping the royal family resist Meng Chong and prevent the Meng family from annexing this city in the shortest ammount of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A city often involved enormous profits. Fire Persimmon Immortal City, with its Fire Persimmon Mountain, generated continuous benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">According to its potential, it could become the strongest refining treasure city in the entire Southern Bean Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">However, at present, it had not been further developed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This city was in the midst of intense competition between the Zhu family and the Meng family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Zhou family and the Ning family had already become the tentacles of the royal Zhu family. The Zhou family was a local family and had shown weakness in the previous Lava Immortal Palace contest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Therefore, the Zhu family valued the Ning family more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">In Zhu Xuangji's view, Ning Jufan himself had considerable combat power, especially since Ning Zhuo left a deep impression on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">With just Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment periods, he dared to plot for the Lava Immortal Palace, planning for his mother for more than ten years, enduring and scheming, and finally standing up fearlessly at the critical moment. This kind of loyalty and courage showed the family spirit of the Ning clan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zhu Xuangji's impression was also the impression of the Zhu family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Southern Bean Royal Family generally believed that the Ning family had a strong backbone and was the best choice to resist and counter the Meng family's encroachment on Fire Persimmon Immortal City!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Is the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence really something that appeared on its own? Could it be a secret plot by Meng Chong?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Even if it was a coincidence for him, he would surely set up a plan to compete against Ning Jufan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Ning Zhuo is out and his cultivation is weak. He can only be said to have a promising future. Ning Jufan, with his Golden Core, is the key figure at present."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zhu Xuangji explained the importance of Ning Jufan to Shen Lingshu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Shen Lingshu nodded: "Rest assured, Xuangji."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"How could I not know the value of Ning Jufan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"But his fortune, I will still keep in my hands for now and not release it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"On one hand, I can further calculate his fortune and whether Ning Zhuo has mastered the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability. On the other hand, this is actually a strategy against Meng Chong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Meng Chong is also skilled in divination and will surely divine Ning Jufan before the battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"If Meng Chong divines Ning Jufan's fortune, he will surely underestimate him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"At the critical moment, I will suddenly release the fortune, and with the help of my magic, Ning Jufan's fortune will surge more than tenfold!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"At that time, it will surely catch Meng Chong off guard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Zhu Xuangji, upon hearing this plan, immediately understood that Shen Lingshu had already planned ahead and felt relieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">------------------------------------------</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Two Note Country, Celestial City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The blazing flames gradually extinguished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Jin Li looked exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He sat cross-legged in front of the refining furnace for several days. During this time, he did not sleep, occasionally making hand gestures and casting spells, his mind focused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and Zhang Zhongyi stood behind Jin Li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Jin Li shouted, "Open!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Hissâ€”â€”!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The furnace door slowly opened, and a large amount of hot air suddenly gushed out, turning into steam and filling the entire room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Jin Li raised his little finger, lightly waved, and a gust of wind appeared out of nowhere, sweeping away all the steam.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong could already sense the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In the next moment, the miniature mechanical dragon was slowly pulled out by an invisible force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo could see with his naked eye that the Dragon was even more dilapidated than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong activated his talent, and his eyes glowed with spiritual light, carefully observing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Before entering the refining furnace, the mechanical dragon already had been damaged by thirty percent and had not been repaired. Now, the damage had increased to at least fifty percent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Especially the rear half of the mechanical dragon's body, which was covered in cracks, and some dragon scales had disappeared, revealing the outer shell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">But since they needed to rush and remove the Blood Trace Shadow Technique, paying this price was also their choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong took the dragon with both hands, looked at it for a moment, and then nodded slowly at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo then took out the treasures and handed them to Jin Li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">These treasures, of course, came from the Stone Monster and were of Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Jin Li smiled satisfactorily and nodded at Ning Zhuo, "Little friend Ning Zhuo, your mechanical dragon needs repairs, and I can also help."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly and explained that his funds were tight, and dealing with the Blood Trace Shadow Technique already violated his family's trade mission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He said that in the future, when he had more funds, he would come back to Jin Li for help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Jin Li tossed the treasures in his hand, "Little friend Ning Zhuo, don't be restrained. You can repair the Mechanical Dragon now. You just need to sign a contract with me, and in the future, you can pay me a little more for these treasures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo laughed it off and evaded the topic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The treasures taken from the Stone Monster were of too high quality, and Jin Li was very eager for them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">After dealing with Ning Zhuo a few times, Jin Li had a good impression of him. After this cooperation, he trusted Ning Zhuo more and could make advance payments to a certain extent, allowing Ning Zhuo to borrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong discussed and finally politely declined this tempting offer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">After solving the tracking technique, Sun and Ning did not return to the Three Generals Camp but sent a flying letter and left the immortal city, entering the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo went to the dynamic furnace compartment, poured out a large number of spirit stones, and fed them to the smelting furnace in the mechanical dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"This time, it's really a risky move," Ning Zhuo sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The fire essence storage was depleted, and the mechanical dragon could not return to the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo could only use all his spirit stones for this adventurous journey. But this was only enough to barely buy a one-way ticket, so...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He also embezzled public funds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He managed the accounts of the Three Generals Camp and took a batch of spirit stones from it, mixing them with his own and sending them all into the smelting furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong licked his lips and smiled, "This is exciting!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo sighed again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He was under tremendous financial pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Just looking at the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, which was fifty percent damaged, it was clear that it could not be repaired. He was really in a difficult situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">On the surface, he seemed prosperous, and everyone thought he was a young master from a wealthy family with astonishing wealth, casually taking out Nascent Soul level treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">But in reality, these treasures all had problems and had not yet reached the point of exploding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo's foundation had always been weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The branch family behind him was established by him and had just started, needing a lot of support. It was difficult for them to provide much assistance to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo's strategy to deal with the Six Caves Sect and retrieve the mechanical carriage and other items was to join the Two Note Country's side and use their strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He was on the right path and had achieved many results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">For example, he cured Sun Lingtong and removed the Blood Trace Shadow Technique. He achieved these with the help of Zhang Zhongyi and Jin Li. If Ning Zhuo had to do it alone, he would not have been able to achieve such results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">But at this stage, he had reached his limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Most of the Stone Monster's treasures had been consumed, and spirit stones were severely lacking. He could barely support himself, but in the future, he might need to support the Three Generals Camp!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Three Generals Camp needed to be maintained so that Ning Zhuo could find opportunities and seize the mechanical carriage on the front line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Liu, Guan, and Zhang, the three generals, were currently worth investing in and maintaining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo knew that Liu Er also had high expectations for his investment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">But Ning Zhuo was almost out of money.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Without money, he would find it difficult to participate in this venture with a high status. Leaving the Three Generals Camp, even if he joined the Red Flower Camp, according to Mu Lan's strict military rules, he would not be able to become a military advisor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Status was very important, affecting the distribution of spoils and the extent to which he could borrow strength. This, in turn, affected whether he could achieve his goal of retrieving the mechanical carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">In a sense, Ning Zhuo was in a desperate situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The Stone Monster had become his last hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"This time, I must succeed!" Ning Zhuo encouraged himself. He returned to the dragon's head compartment with Sun Lingtong and officially started the spatial teleportation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon quickly disappeared from its original position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">In the darkness, countless silver lights drew straight lines, quickly passing by the mechanical dragon's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Cracks slowly spread across the dragon's body. From time to time, pieces of the outer shell broke off and fell into the darkness, disappearing in the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The void itself was very dangerous for physical objects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Even Nascent Soul cultivators found it difficult to traverse the void with their physical bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Nascent Soul level bodies also found it difficult to resist the erosion and wear of the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Only the Nascent Soul itself could barely manage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The true value of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was revealed again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The darkness dispersed, the view suddenly brightened, and the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon arrived directly at the bottom of the cave, in front of the stone ball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The mechanical dragon's map was not precise, but any place it had traveled to had a record and the most accurate markers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">With markers, it could teleport through the void and reach the destination directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"I'm back, haha, Sun Lingtong is back!" Sun Lingtong stood with his hands on his hips, his expression excited and arrogant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo's eyes were also burning with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He had mastered the method to treat Dao injuries and had succeeded once, so he was no longer afraid of the "trap" here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Before coming, he had asked Zhang Zhongyi to prepare some herbs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong applied the herbs all over their bodies, turning into two black, herb-covered figures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Through the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon's detection, there were no other living beings in the cave besides Sun and Ning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The two flew out of the mechanical dragon, each carrying a mirror, and fiercely mined the stone ball at the bottom of the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">During the time they were away, the stone ball had "grown" back to its original state. The stone skin was still very fragile and was easily broken and destroyed, with large pieces falling off, revealing the inner layer again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Treasures gleamed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Various treasures piled together, dazzling Sun and Ning, making their hearts race.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">With so many treasures, they would suddenly become rich, escape poverty, have plenty of funds, and have a bright future!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The stone ball trembled slightly, like a naked body, beginning to absorb the surrounding earth-element spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The spiritual energy attached to its surface, constantly solidifying, turning into new stone skin, wrapping around the inner stone ball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Sun and Ning would not let this happen. They immediately swung their pickaxes and shoveled away the stone skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">But when they hit the inner layer of the stone ball, whether it was a pickaxe or a magical tool, even Sun Lingtong's knife technique, they could not shake the inner stone ball at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Let alone knocking off these treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Sun Lingtong was still excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">They had come prepared this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"Little Zhuo, it's your turn now," Sun Lingtong stepped back slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ning Zhuo nodded and smiled, "Boss, just watch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">He took out the staff heads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Ning Zhuo surrounded these staff heads and began to draw symbols and design formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Sun Lingtong assisted, preventing the earth-element spiritual energy from forming new stone skin and covering Ning Zhuo's formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">After a while, Ning Zhuo completed his task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">After checking for errors, he stretched out both arms, spread his ten fingers, and released the Life Hanging by a Thread technique from his fingertips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">The Life Hanging by a Thread technique connected to the most crucial ten staff heads. As Ning Zhuo slowly infused his magical power, the staff heads activated one by one, serving as the eyes and hearts of the formation, and then activated the surrounding symbols, fully utilizing the entire formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The formation emitted the light of the five elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Thanks to Ning Zhuo's understanding of the five elements, he was able to design such a formation in a short time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Of course, the magical power cultivated by the Five Elements Qi Technique was also very suitable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Last time, through Zhang Zhongyi's silver needles, he felt the principle of petrification, which was also a very important experience, giving Ning Zhuo great inspiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The reason why the stone ball was difficult to mine was that the divine power Stone Forging Earth Treasure was continuously being released.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Ning Zhuo closed his eyes tightly, fully feeling the principles within the inner layer of the stone ball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Divine Power â€” Stone Forging Earth Treasure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Ning Zhuo felt deeply and continuously gained insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Even though it was a divine power, he had no understanding barriers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">He had no choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">His profound understanding of the earth element made him have no barriers to understanding the divine power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">He knew the principles, and divine powers and spells were applications of principles, a certain exquisite combination of magical power and principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">"I've learned it, I've learned it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">The joy of learning made the corners of Ning Zhuo's mouth curl up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">In his mind, the embryonic form of the Stone Forging Earth Treasure divine power had already formed and was rapidly growing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
