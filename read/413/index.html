<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 413: The Sky Pillar Giant Trees</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Sun Lingtong kept reminiscing, trying to find a way to help Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Then he realized -</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">It was his countless injuries, many times life-threatening!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">It was the countless sleepless nights over more than ten years!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">It was the long suffering and endurance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Indeed, Sun Lingtong had also been overly ambitious before, trying everything possible, recklessly wanting to improve his cultivation, wanting to enhance his combat power regardless of consequences, all to find his master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sometimes, the physical pain and wounds actually gave him a bit of comfort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The countless times when injuries forced him to interrupt cultivation, lying idle in bed all day, actually became rare opportunities for rest and recovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">If a person's heartstrings are pulled too tight, they will eventually snap completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Sun Lingtong knew deeply that physical pain could sometimes become an outlet for mental anguish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Little Zhuo, he's been suppressing himself too harshly, for too long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"If his mother had died completely, that would have been the end of it. But Meng Yaoyin still exists in the form of a mechanical construct. Sigh, a mother transformed herself into a mechanical construct for her son. Now, the son recklessly practices other cultivation methods for his mother's sake, how foolish!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"But if it were me and my master, I would do the same. Sigh... actually, Little Zhuo saved me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Looking back, Sun Lingtong suddenly realized that it was the constant growth of those around him, constantly occupying his life, that diverted his energy to focus on Ning Zhuo, preventing Sun Lingtong from going down a dead end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Over these ten-plus years, Sun Lingtong gradually adjusted, becoming less extreme. On the scale in his heart, through Ning Zhuo on one end, it gradually balanced out the weight of his master on the other end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">From Ning Zhuo's perspective, Sun Lingtong brought him tremendous help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">From Sun Lingtong's perspective, Ning Zhuo's very existence prevented him from going astray!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Because of this, when the competition at the Magma Immortal Palace concluded and Meng Kui became the palace master, Sun Lingtong could calmly accept that he still couldn't find answers about his master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Seeing Ning Zhuo like this, Sun Lingtong empathized deeply, which is exactly why he punished Ning Zhuo with confinement, forbidding any cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This way, mimicking his past experiences of being bedridden and immobile from injuries, he hoped to force Ning Zhuo to rest, hoping the latter would understand Sun Lingtong's good intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Little Zhuo's pain has lasted too long. He's both luckier and unluckier than me! Because there's still hope preserved in his mother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"But in this mess called life, sometimes hope can make people suffer even more. As his senior, I can't just stand by and watch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Sun Lingtong kept part of his attention on the Ten Thousand Li Dragon's forward progress, then took out a jade slip and began to study the "Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing" recorded in it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Soon, Sun Lingtong's eyebrows raised slightly: "This cultivation method is indeed excellent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo returned to his solitary cabin, also contemplating the problems that had appeared in himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Just now when Sun Lingtong reprimanded him and punished him with confinement, it made him feel like he was back in the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, over the past ten-plus years, he hadn't been without mistakes. Whenever the mistakes were particularly serious, Sun Lingtong would reprimand him just like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">In each reprimand, Ning Zhuo felt Sun Lingtong's care for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This time was no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"I went too far," Ning Zhuo sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Once the dantian is established, one cannot practice other methods... this is the most basic common sense, yet I stubbornly ignored it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Thinking back to his state at that time, Ning Zhuo felt he had made a terrible mistake!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"My mindset was wrong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The journey to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley benefited me greatly, my close combat shortcomings were greatly compensated, reaching the standard of my peers. My ability to use magic in ranged combat has also increased rapidly, growing immensely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"I also developed two sets of mechanical source techniques as new trump cards. The encounter with the Linglong Mirror Wall even gave my Five Elements realm an unimaginable, heaven-shocking growth! This gives me huge bonuses in combat, refining, and other aspects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"I also learned that I indeed had a hidden second talent, and it's even immortal-level talent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"So I became arrogant and proud, with a bit of recklessness in my heart. Therefore, when comprehending the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing', my first thought was of the Spirit Concealment Willow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"This kind of thinking already contained my impetuousness. When it came to comprehending the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing', impatience disturbed me, making me lose my rationality, and I actually started practicing it myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"It was utterly foolish to the extreme!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">After deep reflection, Ning Zhuo concluded: "I got carried away! Forgot about Senior Sun's constant care for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"What am I?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"What do I have to be proud of?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Even if I have immortal-level talent, don't others have it too? Meng Chong has it, Yuan Dasheng also had it, but what happened to them? Immortal talent doesn't mean everything."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Even if I have profound Five Elements realm understanding, so what? It's not like I accumulated it step by step through my own efforts. I was supported by ancient masters and pushed forward by the Spirit Concealment Willow, what is there to be proud of?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"I must be humble and cautious!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Several days later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The silver lines in the void gradually thinned, and light appeared again in the darkness ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"We're about to reach our destination." Seeing this, Sun Lingtong quickly put away the jade slip in his hand and stared ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The light expanded rapidly, almost instantly swallowing the Ten Thousand Li Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sun Lingtong's view suddenly changed, positioned high in the sky, overlooking the entire forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Here, giant trees towered like peaks, known as Sky Pillar Giant Trees. Each giant tree stood majestically on the earth, reaching into the clouds, their trunks piled with rocks, like mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Thousands of Sky Pillar Giant Trees combined to form an enormous forest. Beneath the sun, it was dark and shadowy, with an eerie atmosphere that affected people's minds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Thousand Peaks Forest, we've arrived!" Sun Lingtong thought to himself, becoming cautious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Sky Pillar Giant Trees originated from the Construction Wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The latter was a famous wood-attribute merit treasure. Growing in the midst of heaven and earth, a hundred ren tall, with no branches for a hundred ren, it had nine suns, nine roots below, fruits like hemp, leaves like lingzhi mushrooms, and various gods climbed it to reach heaven.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Construction Wood was even taller than the Sky Pillar Giant Trees, connecting heaven and earth, serving as a ladder between the mortal and divine realms. Climbing up it could take one from earth to heaven.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Sky Pillar Giant Trees' origin was the Construction Wood. The Construction Wood was sacred, and the Sky Pillar Giant Trees shared this characteristic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Therefore, these giant trees were excellent places for nurturing divine spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Additionally, since the two nations were established relatively late, aboriginal tribes had long existed in the Thousand Peaks Forest. Natural cultivation combined with people's worship led to numerous divine spirits here, as numerous as stars in the night sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The tribal divisions numbered over a hundred, fighting among themselves. Divine spirits were supported and led wars, fighting each other for worship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Therefore, the Thousand Peaks Forest had historically been in a state of constant conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Today you fight me, tomorrow I fight you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In such a state, it was naturally very chaotic. Thus it became the first choice for many serious criminals to hide from pursuit, and a lawless place where evil cultivators lingered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"There are people below." Sun Lingtong, controlling the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, discovered a group of cultivators active on the nearest Sky Pillar Giant Tree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">These cultivators all wore black robes, their faces hidden in hoods, moving like ghosts with chilling wind, giving people an eerie feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Let's take a look." Sun Lingtong became curious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Ten Thousand Li Dragon was already in a small state, very inconspicuous, and flew straight down to begin tracking them.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
