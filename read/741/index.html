<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The cave abode's massive green jade doors stood tightly sealed, their restrained spiritual light separating the worlds within from the world without.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Before the cave abode lay a small platform carved from a single slab of mountain rock, its surface smooth and level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Night had fallen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The cold moonlight bathed the stone platform in an eerie blue-green glow, making it resemble a frozen, bottomless pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">At the platform's edge, a sheer cliff plunged into the abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The wind howled like a sob.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Chen San stood at the center of the platform, wary of approaching the cave abode's entrance too closely lest he displease its master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Under the moonlight, he seemed to be immersed in that frigid pool. His lean frame was rigid, yet his back habitually hunched slightly, his head bowed like a stone statue frozen in shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The flying message had already pierced the doors and vanished without a trace. Chen San had no way of knowing whether any cultivator within the cave abode had received his message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The night wind, carrying the mountain's chill, swirled up from the cliff below, howling and moaning, raising goosebumps on his bare neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The cold seeped into his bones, yet he remained oblivious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Each time the wind momentarily subsided, he instinctively held his breath, straining his ears to catch any sound from within the cave abode - footsteps, a faint cough, or even the subtle hum of circulating spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">But all he received was deeper silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The cave abode's entrance loomed before him like a cold, indifferent maw, devouring all his hopes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Then I'll wait until dawn to show my sincerity", he sighed inwardly. His hands and feet grew numb with cold, and his gaze drifted from the entrance to wander aimlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Beside the cave abode, he noticed a cluster of remarkably resilient vines clinging to a crack in the cliff face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Their dark brown roots, gnarled and twisted, clung desperately to the meager patch of damp soil wedged between the rocks. Most of the vines were pinned beneath a massive, jagged boulder, leaving only a few slender tendrils to struggle out from the edges and bottom of the crevice, reaching downward in search of soil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">A few strands of moonlight, subtly cast, illuminated the tip of one tendril. Beneath it, two tender, newly unfurled leaves pressed against the vine, their delicate forms radiating a humble vitality in the moonlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Chen San's gaze gradually froze on those two green leaves, and memories of his past experiences flooded his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In the mine, his young, insignificant body huddled like a rat in a dark corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Only the hole above cast a single ray of sunlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Chen San wasn't born into a cultivation family, nor even an ordinary household. He was the illegitimate son of a mine slave, having lived in the Spirit Stone mines since childhood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">To survive a few extra days in the harsh environment, the veteran miners had secretly learned many incomplete and crude breathing techniques, along with folk methods to enhance strength and pain tolerance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Chen San, like a parched sponge, greedily absorbed these "scraps" of knowledge, secretly growing stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The brutal survival conditions had honed his senses from a young age, making him acutely aware of every change in his surroundings. He learned to exploit every available resource to its fullest potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"I pushed my cognitive abilities to their limits, racking my brains and even risking my life for a piece of mineral slag brimming with potent spiritual energy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Before his father died, he pointed at the hole shedding sunlight: "Kid, you have bad luck, being my child. I am a mining slave, so are you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"You have low-grade spiritual roots, just like me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Hah, it's useless. Our lives, at best, will only reach the Qi Refining stage. At the very most, we can only reach Foundation Establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"See that vine?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Learn from it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"On your own, you'll always be at the bottom of the cultivator hierarchy. But if you can attach yourselves to a powerful faction or organization, you can climb to heights you never thought possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Take that fat, idiotic overseer, for example. His cultivation is barely adequate, but he's a distant relative of Manager Zhao. That's how he became an overseer!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Hear me, big boy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Chen San gritted his teeth, his bloodshot eyes fixed on the deeply rooted vine. Raising his voice to a hoarse shout, he roared, "I hear you, Dad!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">In a large forest, you find all kinds of birds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Among countless cultivators, there are high levels, naturally there are middle and low levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Chen San possessed no innate talent for cultivation; his aptitude was so poor it ranked at the very bottom. He also lacked any resources for cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He was like a vine, like a leaf, straining upward with all its might, reaching toward the towering cliff face above.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">But the cliff was too high, too steep, too unyielding. The vine's tip brushed against it in vain, like a pilgrim extending trembling fingers, never able to truly cling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Chen San had tried to attach himself to the powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He once presented Manager Zhao with a meticulously drawn treasure map. Manager Zhao threw the map to the ground and crushed it under his boot. The piercing mockery and unrestrained laughter of the surrounding crowd stabbed into Wu Mei's eardrums like countless needles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He had also crafted a mechanical flying bird for nighttime surveillance and offered it to Captain Wang of the City Guard as a means of advancement. Instead, the bird was used as evidence to falsely accuse Chen San of being the culprit in a major case. The stench of the prison, the agony of the lashes, and the forced confession followed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His luck ran out when he rescued a young master from a prominent family. In the end, he stood inside the modest vermilion gate of their estate, clutching a light bag of low-grade Spirit Stones. From within, Young Master Lin's voice drifted out, laced with disdain: "What a misfortune..." The steward's gaze toward Chen San was icy yet condescending, as if he were looking at a stray dog begging for scraps on the street.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">At the auction, he had risked nearly all his savings to purchase a treasure at a bargain price, only to publicly present it to a young master. The young master brushed aside the Magic Artifact he offered with a dismissive flick of his folding fan, as if swatting away a buzzing fly. Looking down at Chen San from his superior position, his face was twisted with undisguised contempt: "What are you? Do you even deserve to offer me Rites? What a waste of that treasure - it's tainted now that your hands have touched it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Each humiliation seared Chen San's memory with a burning pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Yet even the most intense pain couldn't extinguish his burning desire to climb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Alone, even if he exhaust his entire life, he'll only ever writhe and struggle in the filthy, muddy cracks of the lowest depths, sprouting a few insignificant leaves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He could be crushed at any moment by a pebble or trampled by a deliberate foot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Relying solely on himself was doomed to failure. But there was still hope!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He was born a weed. Only by clinging to towering mountains can a humble vine reach greater heights, bask in more sunlight, and behold wider vistas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"They look down on me because I lack value. Who would recruit a low-Grade Spiritual Root - a weed vine with no potential - as a subordinate?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"How can I make myself more valuable?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Perhaps being rooted in the depths was both his weakness and his strength...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The vine named Chen San had gradually grown from the sunlit mine of his childhood to this place - the crevice between the massive boulders beside the Hidden Stone Cave Abode, bathed in the clear moonlight, its leaves trembling in the night breeze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">What would be the outcome of this attempt to cling?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Would the person behind that door be another Manager Zhao or Captain Wang? Would the young master at the auction once again brush him aside with his fan?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yet, hope flickered like a firefly in the darkness, a fragile yet persistent flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">What if? What if this time is different?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">What if the master of the Hidden Stone Cave Mansion truly needs a sharp-eared spy, an assistant who can move in the shadows?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Worry, anticipation, relief, and a hint of panic coiled around Chen San's heart like tangible vines, tightening their grip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In the howling night wind, his body tensed, accumulating a bone-chilling cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The clamor persisted, a boundless cacophony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The jade door remained motionless, as unyielding as ten-thousand-year-old Profound Ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Chen San unconsciously glanced at the ordinary vine clinging to the rock crevice outside. He seemed to see his destined fate, complete and unyielding in the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Just then, from within the cave abode, came an almost imperceptible click, the sound of jade grinding against stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Chen San's pupils constricted, every muscle tensed, and he unconsciously held his breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The door gradually opened a sliver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Under Chen San's intense gaze, the gap gradually widened, revealing the figure of an elderly cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Chen San greets his junior," Chen San immediately bowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Old Chef sized Chen San up and down, then nodded slightly. "Since the Young Master has summoned you, you may come in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">A surge of joy coursed through Chen San's heart. In the past, only weak subordinates had ever given him perfunctory treatment. He never imagined he would receive a personal audience with Ning Zhuo himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Although Ning Zhuo had attended Chen San's banquet at the restaurant earlier, the difference between public and private... For someone who had struggled at the bottom of society his entire life, the vast gulf between the two was all too clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Thump-thump-thump...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">As his anticipation intensified, so did his nervousness, his heart pounding faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">A gate opened in the Martial Arts Formation. Ning Zhuo stepped inside and immediately bowed respectfully when he saw Chen San meditating in the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Chen San," Ning Zhuo asked, his tone lacking any warmth, "how have you performed the task I assigned you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Despite the impolite tone, Chen San felt even more indignant. After all, the way one treats fellow cultivators and subordinates should be different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Chen San succinctly reported Huo Wa'er's performance and other relevant details to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo didn't respond immediately, falling into a brief silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Chen San stared at the floor tiles near his feet, his heart pounding faster and faster. His mouth felt dry, and each moment stretched into an eternity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo pulled out a pouch of Spirit Stones and tossed it at Chen San's feet. "You've seen his intelligence reports. He's also participating in the Flying Cloud Assembly, so the Myriad Manifestations Sect conducted a more thorough investigation into his background. As a result, you now know quite a bit about him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Since you're skilled at gathering intelligence, use this money to handle a task for me first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Chen San's face lit up with joy, and he immediately dropped to one knee. "Young Master, please give your orders. Your subordinate will spare no effort to fulfill them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo instructed, "I want you to spread some news about the Great Dao..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Chen San listened carefully, memorizing every word instantly. He then repeated the instructions to Ning Zhuo, his recitation nearly flawless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">His exceptional memory was essential for his intelligence work. After all, having grown up in the mines, how else could he navigate the complex, nearly identical tunnels and shafts without an extraordinary memory?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. "Go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Chen San bowed. "Your subordinate withdraws."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Before him, the Formation opened a doorway-sized passage. He bowed respectfully, took a few steps forward, and then turned to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Old Chef stood within the Formation. Seeing Chen San emerge, he extended his arm and said, "This way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The two walked out of the cave abode, one behind the other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Chen San bowed again to Old Chef in farewell. "Many thanks, senior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Old Chef nodded with a hint of emotion. "Since the Young Master values you, do your best."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Your subordinate will spare no effort!" Chen San replied, finally daring to raise his voice slightly as he made his pledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Old Chef closed the cave abode's entrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Chen San turned to leave, but stopped at the edge of the stone platform. He turned back to face the cave abode and bowed deeply once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">As he rode the clouds away, the night wind gradually intensified, blowing relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Chen San shook his head slightly, still feeling somewhat unreal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Recalling the recent encounter, it felt like a dream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He had expected Ning Zhuo to lecture me at length, but instead, he had simply given me a new task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Is this another test from Young Master Ning Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">With that thought, Chen San finally used his divine sense to probe the storage pouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">So many Spirit Stones? The number of Spirit Stones far exceeded my expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He had already prepared to fund the project himself. Ning Zhuo's investment far exceeded the project's actual needs - a situation Chen San had never encountered before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Are you afraid I'll take the money and run?" Chen San wondered inwardly. "Or is it because of my humble origins? Do they think I'm too ignorant to know how much to spend on spreading rumors?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Chen San shook his head again, his gaze wavering. "Regardless, I must seize this opportunity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ban Clan Ancestral Shrine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Creak... creak...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Clan Elders gathered around the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain, their faces grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The chain shifted and transformed once more, revealing hidden aspects of Ning Zhuo's destiny.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"That fellow has indeed gained the Mandate of Heaven!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Before he even obtained it, he suppressed Ban Ji. Now that his destiny is even stronger, how can we allow this to continue?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Ban Ji's Royal Mandate needs to be activated step by step, but Ning Zhuo is blocking him - effectively blocking the entire Ban Clan's path to advancement!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"We must resolve Ban Ji's Human Tribulation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"But we can't afford to provoke the Myriad Manifestations Sect..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"We need a long-term strategy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Let's start by using the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain to create some trouble for his destiny. We've only measured half of that brat's destiny, but what we've seen is already alarming. We must suppress him in this regard!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"I can tolerate this much, but it's not yet truly alarming. We must curb him in this aspect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">One day later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ban Ji met with Mad Monk, Rust Disaster Artisan, Liu Qingyan, and five others in his cave abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">His face turned ashen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"What are they doing? Scared witless by Ning Zhuo?!" Ban Ji sneered, glaring at the eight Demonic Cultivators behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Mad Monk pressed his palms together in a prayerful gesture. "Ning Zhuo has already obtained the Stone Tablet. He's an even greater prodigy than Ban Ji himself, and he's backed by a mysterious and formidable power. Your paltry reward is utterly insufficient to pit us against such a chosen one of heaven."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ban Ji's expression softened slightly. "Ning Zhuo's strength indeed exceeds our initial estimates. If it's money you want, that's easily solved! I'll increase the payment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">But the response was three shaking heads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Rust Disaster Artisan spoke, "We fear we'd earn the money only to die before we could spend it. Lady Spiderweb has been missing for quite some time. We previously used her to target Ning Zhuo, but now there's no trace of her. The odds are overwhelmingly against her survival."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Liu Qingyan added, "Even if we could defeat Ning Zhuo now, how would we face the retaliation from the powerful forces backing him in the future?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Even more frightening is that he has already obtained Qing Huangzi's top ranking, and now holds four top rankings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"And you, Ban Ji?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ban Ji's face flushed crimson, his anger palpable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">He roared, "I was just thrown off my rhythm! If Ning Zhuo hadn't been meddling, I would have already gotten the Stone Tablet!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Don't you know my true strength?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The eight fell silent, exchanging uneasy glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Rust Disaster Artisan: "Precisely because we know your strength and potential, we agreed to help you deal with Ning Zhuo in the first place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"But the conflict between you and Ning Zhuo is something we can't interfere with."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Mad Monk: "A large-scale rumor has surfaced, claiming that the eight of us were acting under your orders to obstruct Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"If we continue to harass Ning Zhuo, it would be too obvious. The Myriad Manifestations Sect might intervene and punish us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ban Ji fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
