<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 335: Misty Hidden Mountain</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The great journey began! The technique was in progress.<br/>
Ning Zhuo sat in a meditative posture, floating mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was cultivating three supreme techniques of his dantians:<br/>
First was the Mirror Stage Technique,<br/>
Then the Five Element Qi Regulations art,<br/>
Finally, the Demonic Blood Muscle Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, he would appear with a Buddha-like glow, sometimes the five elements would circulate, making him seem immortal, and at other times, a bloodthirsty aura exuded from him with a demonic intensity.<br/>
Using divine sense, Sun Lingtong observed the three Dantians in Ning Zhuo's body.<br/>
The upper Dantian was vast and boundless. Its top and bottom were smooth and flat, resembling two giant mirrors, representing the heavens and earth.<br/>
<br/>
In between these mirrors, smaller mirrors floated silently. Thoughts were born rapidly in these mirrors, only to be instantly erased.<br/>
This was the "Bright Mirror, Tree of Light" Dantian.<br/>
In the middle Dantian, a five-colored vortex spun, resembling a celestial tornado, connecting heaven and earth. The five elements alternated between distinct separation and chaotic fusion, demonstrating the mystery of their cyclical creation and destruction.<br/>
<br/>
This was the "Heavenly Pillar of Five Elemental Qi" Dantian.<br/>
In the lower Dantian, thick blood Qi filled the space, forming a crimson landscape. Upon this landscape, layers of blood vessels twisted like vines, crisscrossing to form an interconnected web.<br/>
Within the blood vessels, blood Qi surged like a river, pulsing with Ning Zhuo‚Äôs heartbeat, rising and falling like ocean tides.<br/>
<br/>
This was the "Demonic Blood Technique" Dantian!<br/>
Ning Zhuo had already reached the Foundation Establishment stage, and his three Dantians were beginning to solidify, marking significant progress in his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
After completing his cultivation, Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes. Sun Lingtong also withdrew his palm and relaxed.<br/>
The magical formation deactivated, and both of them descended gently to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong praised him, "Marvelous! Truly marvelous! These three supreme methods are truly exquisite. Even if you only practiced one of them, it would be a top-tier technique."<br/>
<br/>
"If I hadn‚Äôt seen it with my own eyes, I could never have imagined that someone could practice all three at the same time. The Master of the Three Sects was truly extraordinary!"<br/>
<br/>
"Such accomplishments‚Äîit's as if you can move mountains and shake the heavens."<br/>
<br/>
"It was totally worth hiding behind the scenes for 10 years to get this Lava Immortal Palace technique. What a wise decision!"<br/>
<br/>
"You keep cultivating like this, little brother, and your future is limitless!" Sun Lingtong said with deep admiration.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, "Unfortunately, the transmission jade only contains the Foundation Establishment techniques. I‚Äôll have to return to the Lava Immortal Palace to receive the Golden Core stage methods."<br/>
<br/>
Liao Zhutong sighed, "Yes, that will be troublesome. We‚Äôll need to be cautious of the Meng family from now on."<br/>
<br/>
"Big brother, there‚Äôs a part of the Demonic Blood Vein technique that I don't quite understand. It‚Äôs the section about the unity of the heart and technique, as well as the connection between thunder and flesh." Ning Zhuo sought guidance.<br/>
<br/>
Liao Zhutong stroked his chin, "I‚Äôve never practiced the Three Supreme Methods, so I only observed with my divine sense while you cultivated. I can offer my opinion, but I can't guarantee it's entirely correct."<br/>
<br/>
"Understanding a technique isn't just about contemplating its principles in your mind‚Äîyou also need personal insights. Cultivating will help you deepen your understanding."<br/>
<br/>
"You‚Äôre only at the Foundation Establishment stage, so guidance from others can still be useful. But once you reach the Golden Core stage, it‚Äôll mostly rely on your own comprehension."<br/>
<br/>
"So, do you still want my help?"<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately grasped Liao Zhutong's point.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, personal comprehension would be crucial for mastering techniques. If he didn‚Äôt develop his ability to interpret methods during the early stages of cultivation, it would become a significant obstacle later on.<br/>
<br/>
"I think I'll try to understand it myself first," Ning Zhuo said.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong clapped his hands, laughing, "Haha, that‚Äôs the right choice!"<br/>
<br/>
"Come on, let‚Äôs explore this Ten Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon a bit more."<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon was centered around a dragon‚Äôs spine, with many compartments on either side.<br/>
The cultivation chamber where Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were was just one of these compartments.<br/>
<br/>
There were also a dragon head chamber, a refining chamber, a storage chamber, a workshop chamber, and even a nursery chamber.<br/>
As they explored, they discovered that the storage chamber held an abundance of fire essence, and the workshop chamber was filled with overwhelming heat, making it hard to approach. <br/>
The refining chamber could actually pilot the vessel, but neither dared to take the risk. The nursery chamber, on the other hand, was completely empty.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, they arrived at the dragon head chamber, where they found a fiery crystal dragon core.<br/>
It had shrunk to the size of a small pearl and nestled inside a pearl-like orb.<br/>
<br/>
The orb was the size of a millstone and semi-transparent, with a perfectly smooth and lustrous surface.<br/>
Ning Zhuo reached out and touched the pearl. Instantly, intricate patterns of magical symbols appeared, spreading from the pearl to the surface of the table, illuminating the walls, and activating the mechanisms within the Ten Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo experimented with one of the mechanisms, and the ceiling opened up to reveal a round hole. A hissing sound followed as air was sucked out, only to be replaced by fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
This was the Air Circulation Mechanism.<br/>
Once activated, it could regulate the airflow between different chambers. In case of a fire, the simplest method would be to evacuate all the air from the affected chamber, suffocating the flames.<br/>
<br/>
"This is so fun! Let me have a turn!" Sun Lingtong couldn't contain his excitement as Ning Zhuo played with various mechanisms.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon was a highly sophisticated construct.<br/>
Its combat power wasn‚Äôt particularly strong, but it was excellent for long-distance travel. The chambers not only fulfilled various functional purposes but also provided the occupants with a relatively stable and safe environment for cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
When Sun Lingtong activated the observation mechanism, they could see projections of the outside world.<br/>
All around was pitch-black darkness, and streaks of silver lines pierced through the void, moving swiftly past the Ten Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
The silver lines varied in density‚Äîsometimes sparse, sometimes thick. Occasionally, they formed blocks of condensed silver light.<br/>
<br/>
"So this is what it feels like for a Nascent Soul cultivator to traverse the void?" Both of them were amazed.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon was at the Nascent Soul level, and its greatest feature was its ability to mimic a Nascent Soul cultivator's void-traveling technique, allowing it to cover great distances through directed teleportation.<br/>
As they neared their destination, the speed of the Ten Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon gradually slowed down. The silver lines thickened and coalesced, finally merging into the real world.<br/>
<br/>
The process was brief.<br/>
They felt a slight jolt as the vessel landed, and suddenly, they were in the middle of a mountainous region.<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately pulled out a map and used his divine sense to check their surroundings. He realized that the terrain was different from what was described on the map.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon was newly crafted, and its navigation data was empty. Ning Zhuo had to rely on external maps to guide their way.<br/>
<br/>
The map was something Ning Zhuo had acquired from Ning Jiufan, containing details of the route Ning's family had taken during their journey.<br/>
But the map wasn‚Äôt entirely accurate, so Ning Zhuo adjusted the Dragon, flying it around the area to get a better sense of direction.<br/>
<br/>
There was no need to re-enter the void now.<br/>
The Soaring Dragon glided in the sky, small and unnoticeable like a butterfly, with its presence masked.<br/>
After flying around for about an hour, Ning Zhuo finally spotted their destination‚ÄîHidden Mountain!<br/>
The mountain was towering and majestic, shrouded in layers of mist.<br/>
<br/>
In the dusk, amidst the gaps in the clouds, the green pines stood tall, fresh and vibrant. Streams cascaded down the rocks, producing a clear, melodious sound.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family had once been trapped in this place during their travels, as the mountain‚Äôs fog had confused them, making it seem like a maze. They were lost for three days and nights before finally finding their way out.<br/>
Ning Zhuo intended to cure the poison afflicting Meng Yaoyin, but to do so, he needed to address both the symptoms and the root cause.<br/>
<br/>
As for the root cause, he currently had no clues.<br/>
However, he had a plan to treat the symptoms. He would retrace the Ning family‚Äôs journey, gathering elixirs along the way that could potentially extend Meng Xun‚Äôs life and buy more time for a proper cure.<br/>
Ning Zhuo controlled the Soaring Dragon to fly around Hidden Mountain.<br/>
The vessel shrank to the size of a butterfly and remained undetected.<br/>
At the foot of the mountain, Ning Zhuo found a small village.<br/>
<br/>
A moment later, he shrank the Soaring Dragon slightly and wore it around his waist like a belt.<br/>
He and Ning Zhuo disguised themselves and walked into the village.<br/>
The village‚Äôs female guards spotted them and immediately stopped them with quiet but stern warnings.<br/>
Both Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo emanated the aura of Foundation Establishment cultivators.<br/>
The guards, only at the Qi Refining stage, felt the pressure but stood their ground, trying to block their way.<br/>
Sun Lingtong spoke kindly, explaining their purpose.<br/>
<br/>
The guards, sensing his sincerity, gradually relaxed. "Oh, are you looking for the Mountain God Temple? Do you want to go to the real temple or the fake one?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was puzzled, "This is Southern Bean Kingdom territory, and as far as I know, the Southern Bean Kingdom long ago outlawed mountain temples and banned superstitions. How can there still be fake temples?"<br/>
To search for the cure for Meng Yaoyin, relying solely on the Thousand Mile Soaring Dragon, Sun Lingtong, and Ning Zhuo wouldn‚Äôt be enough.<br/>
<br/>
After all, the Hidden Mountain was vast.<br/>
So, the best way was to consult the local Mountain God.<br/>
<br/>
The female guard hurriedly explained, "The fake temple is also real. The Mountain God there has been formally recognized by the royal family, so there‚Äôs no need to worry. We just call them the real temple and the fake temple because one is more responsive, while the other is less so."<br/>
Sun Lingtong asked for more details.<br/>
<br/>
The female guard explained, "The real temple is the Lonely Mountain Temple, dedicated to the deputy Mountain God, while the fake temple is the Tiger God Temple, dedicated to the main Mountain God. They are located on the southern and northern sides of Mist-Hidden Mountain."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was puzzled, "There‚Äôs a saying, ‚ÄòBetter the tiger than the lonely,‚Äô but here in Mist-Hidden Mountain, the Lonely Immortal is more responsive, while the Tiger God isn‚Äôt. How did it end up the other way around?"<br/>
<br/>
"We‚Äôll know once we go and take a look," Sun Lingtong replied. Before leaving, he handed a spirit stone to the female guard as a reward.<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you for the information." Sun Lingtong smiled kindly.<br/>
<br/>
The female guard took the spirit stone, but seeing them leave, she hesitated and hurriedly stopped them. "Wait, let me go inform the village chief and see if you can spend the night here. It‚Äôs not safe to enter the mountain at night."<br/>
<br/>
"At night, the mountain fog becomes thick, and many villagers have lost their way and perished in the dense fog."<br/>
<br/>
"If you wait until daylight, it will be much safer to climb the mountain."</div>
