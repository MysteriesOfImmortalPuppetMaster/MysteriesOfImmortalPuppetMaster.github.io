<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">An impenetrably dense crimson aura, thick as congealed blood, erupted from Ning Zhuo's body in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The scarlet radiance, carrying the murderous intent of clashing weapons, pierced through layers of black clouds to strike the Formless Pivot marked by Snowlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Simple, brutal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ruthless force shattering cunning!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Time seemed to freeze for a fraction of a second.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Then - everything shattered!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Rumble... Rumble... Rumble...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Black Cloud Space convulsed as if countless bolts of lightning had crashed into the Abyss, unleashing an unprecedented cacophony of terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Deafening!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">It wasn't a single sound, but a symphony of destruction: countless restrictions collapsing, spatial structures warping, infinite talismans tearing apart, and energy currents colliding chaotically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo's vision suddenly became a surreal, otherworldly spectacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Centered around the Formless Pivot, Snowlight Literary Qi surged outward, blood-saturation boiling, as dark and pale hues interwove into expanding ripples across the space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Wherever they reached, the pivots - whether discovered or hidden - were utterly exposed. Like fragile soap bubbles, they burst silently one after another! The released Literary Qi transformed into Snowlight, but before it could spread, it was instantly devoured and distorted by the violent spatial ripples.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The space folded, then tore apart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Spatial rifts erupted one after another, like grotesque scars marring the entire horizon. Countless chaotic energy currents, like wild horses freed from their reins, surged wildly through these fissures and distortions, colliding, annihilating each other, and exploding in a frenzy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The entire Grand Formation collapsed in an unstoppable chain reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yet Ning Zhuo remained unscathed, standing in an eye of the storm. Outside was a scene of cataclysmic disaster, while inside, it was as calm as a still lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The young man's expression mirrored his grave mood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He stared intently at the Formless Pivot before him, astonished to discover that despite the violent impacts that had twisted and distorted it, driving the entire Grand Formation to tear and collapse, the pivot itself remained resilient. It was gradually absorbing the shock and rapidly restoring its original form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"The Formless Pivot!" A bolt of lightning seemed to strike Ning Zhuo's divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">In that instant, he understood without instruction, gaining sudden enlightenment of one of the Formless Pivot's greatest advantages: its formlessness!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">This rendered it impervious to many conventional methods of destruction!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">It was like the moon's reflection on water. Even if Ning Zhuo stirred the water, distorting the reflection beyond recognition, once the surface calmed, the moon's image would simply return to its original full moon reflection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">As for the tangible pivots, even if they were utterly destroyed, as long as the Formless Pivot remained intact, the true foundations of the Grand Formation would remain unshaken. At worst, the formation would merely become dilapidated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">His mastery of formation arts paled in comparison to that of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. He simply lacked the ability to directly dismantle the Formless Pivot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He had to give his all, unleashing a torrent of baleful energy while simultaneously invoking Military Power Amplification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The crimson baleful energy erupted like ignited flames, transforming into a vast crimson light that engulfed the Formless Pivot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">With the Qing-Jiao Army's Military Might now amplifying Ning Zhuo alone, it made him even more formidable, like a tiger gaining wings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo's painstakingly accumulated baleful energy was being recklessly depleted, quickly dwindling. Yet the Formless Pivot remained intact, suffering no true damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Could I have made a wrong choice? Ning Zhuo's resolve wavered. Hmm? What's that?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Amidst the endless billows of black clouds and the tempestuous spatial storms, he glimpsed a massive silver-gray sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">A branch of the Wangchuan River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart skipped a beat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo didn't recognize the silver-gray sphere, but the Prefecture Lord knew it all too well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">It was the result of his spell, the Profound Nether Water Dragons, where he had been forced to use the Lord's Seal to finally seal the Nirvana Buddha Phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Originally, he had hidden this silver-gray sphere deep within the Grand Formation. But now, with Ning Zhuo's interference causing the formation to sway like willow branches in a gale, the sphere was completely exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">I hope this brat doesn't notice it, the Prefecture Lord thought. But the moment the thought formed, Ning Zhuo's head snapped up, his hawk-like gaze locking onto the silver-gray sphere, his expression a mix of surprise and sharp intensity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart skipped a beat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He never imagined that, as a Soul Formation-level powerhouse, the ruler of the Underworld Prefecture - a sovereign of a realm - would find himself so deeply concerned about a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"But Qi Luck..." The Prefecture Lord nearly groaned to the heavens, the sense of impending doom intensifying within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Suddenly, his pupils contracted to pinpoints as he remembered another critical element:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Void Return Black Sphere!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This was another masterpiece of the Soundless Ghost Monk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Soundless Ghost Monk specialized in the Nirvana Zen Sutra, and this sphere embodied its terrifying killing technique - the Void Return Finger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">To counter the Void Return Finger's destructive power, the Prefecture Lord had once exhausted all his strength, channeling the power of a Branch of the Wangchuan River. Yet even this supreme effort could only result in a stalemate, a battle of attrition. Completely annihilating the Void Return Black Sphere would be no overnight task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Therefore, the Prefecture Lord had redirected the Wangchuan Soul Stream, pushing both the Void Return Black Sphere and the Profound Nether Silver Orb away from the Sacrificial Altar, hiding them deep within the layers of dark clouds and the depths of the Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"The Profound Nether Water Dragons, combined with my Lord's Seal, have sealed the Nirvana Buddha Phantom - the manifestation of the Soundless Ghost Monk's Lifebound Buddha Wheel."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"But the Void Return Black Sphere is also the Soundless Ghost Monk's creation. If their Qi resonances ever align, it will have catastrophic consequences!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord could already imagine the two spheres colliding, the Void Return Finger dissolving the surface seal's power and releasing the Buddha phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He absolutely couldn't let this happen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord gritted his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He could only rely on himself and his Divided Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">But the Divided Spirit was locked in a difficult struggle with Luo Si, and more importantly, it remained closely linked to the Earth Aspect Formation, preventing him from controlling the Heavenly Aspect Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Grand Formation surrounding the sacrificial altar comprised the majority of the Heavenly Aspect Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Therefore, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had no choice but to act with his True Form!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He had also been hoping to seize the opportunity to risk entering a trance, to catch his breath and gather some more combat power. The current situation left him no room for thought; he could only exhaust his spirit to control the Heavenly Aspect Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Silver-Gray Giant Sphere had already been exposed, but the Void Return Black Sphere remained hidden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He had to keep this black sphere concealed at all costs, and he would spare no effort to prevent the two spheres from colliding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">After just a few breaths of attempting to control the Heavenly Aspect Formation, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's face already showed signs of exhaustion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">This was too difficult!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo was wreaking havoc on the Formless Pivot, and the entire Heavenly Aspect Formation was like a runaway carriage. The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had to struggle to maintain its balance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He felt as weak as a newborn infant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">His spirit was being violently drained!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">At this moment, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was drawing upon his deepest reserves, showcasing his far richer experience than Ning Zhuo's, and was actually managing to temporarily stabilize the situation and conceal the black sphere's movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This was incredibly difficult!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">It was like walking a tightrope on the edge of a cliff during a raging storm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo remained completely unaware of it all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He had no idea that he was subtly locked in a contest of wills with the lord of an entire prefecture, a Soul Formation-level existence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">What did he know of the Void Return Black Sphere?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He didn't even understand the origins of the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo stared at the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, his thoughts racing through his divine sea like lightning: "A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot... north? Could it be that 'north' here refers to a location even further north of the Formless Pivot?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">At that moment, the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere was positioned directly north of the Formless Pivot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo didn't know if this interpretation was the standard answer to the prophetic poem, but even if he wanted to act against the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, he was utterly powerless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The reason was simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He was currently at the Formless Pivot, the eye of the storm. While the surrounding battlefield was fraught with danger, this place was relatively stable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">To approach the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, he would have to cross a battlefield raging like a hurricane - a move that would be tantamount to suicide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">A ranged attack?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo resolved to try.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He maintained the Confucian technique "Scholar Meets Soldier" while activating his Five Elements Spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Fortunately, "Scholar Meets Soldier" was relatively simple, allowing Ning Zhuo to multitask while sustaining it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Yet even with the Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art and Military Power Amplification, his Five Elements Spells were destroyed halfway, with no hope of reaching the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord observed this with a cold smile. "This brat still thinks he can attack from a distance and break the seal? Hmph, wishful thinking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">After a few attempts, Ning Zhuo immediately stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">His spiritual energy was limited, and casting multiple spells simultaneously drained his mind rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This wasn't the time for reckless bombardment. His Foundation Establishment cultivation was already insufficient; every ounce of power must be used sparingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">What should I do?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo knew brute force wouldn't work. He racked his brain, desperately searching for a way to break the deadlock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">North... north...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Shine?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Shine?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">In that instant, a spiritual light flashed through his divine sea like lightning, dispelling the fog in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">His eyes lit up with sudden clarity, his spirit surging!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Noticing Ning Zhuo's sudden change in expression, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart skipped a beat again, the sense of impending danger intensifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"So the 'shine' in this poem has a second meaning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"I understand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo produced a Mechanical Treasure Mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This was his Lifebound Treasure - the Spirit Communication Mirror!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Crafted from precious materials such as cold iron, flowing cloud sand, Great White Golden Essence, celestial crystal, and abundant earth, its physical form was forged using a Mechanism Platform. Finally, Ning Zhuo inscribed the Spirit Communication Mirror Spell Talismans into the Formation Core, completing its refinement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The Spirit Communication Mirror could transport both people and objects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">In the past, when Sun Lingtong was trapped within the Dragon Pool Hidden Scales Dao Field, Ning Zhuo had used a two-pronged approach - combining the Life Hanging by a Thread technique with the Spirit Communication Mirror - to rescue him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">While transporting Sun Lingtong had been somewhat awkward, the mirror was perfectly suited for deploying mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">This was no surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The Spirit Communication Mirror, as a Lifebound Treasure, originated from the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual - one of the Three Sects' Supreme Methods - and was inherently one of the world's foremost Mechanical Art Manuals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo activated the Confucian technique Scholar Meets Soldier while drawing the Spirit Communication Mirror, holding it in one hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He aligned the mirror's surface with the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, restraining himself from activating it immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">This simple action alone made the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart leap with anxiety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo waited for the perfect moment, watching for a relatively stable interval in the sphere's movements. When the opportunity presented itself, he abruptly activated the Spirit Communication Mirror, unleashing a beam of mirror light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The pillar of mirror light, though struck mid-flight, still managed to strike half of the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">In the next instant, Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu materialized out of thin air, crouching atop the massive sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">This was the new Meng Yehu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">After the war between the Two Note Kingdoms, Ning Zhuo had realized the need to replace Meng Yehu's materials entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The current Meng Yehu was three times more robust than before. Yet even so, compared to the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere, the mighty and brawny Meng Yehu seemed like a mouse at an elephant's feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Mechanism - Shadow Slaughter Claws!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Dull, lusterless blades suddenly extended from Meng Yehu's hands, stabbing viciously at the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Clang! Clang! Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Sparks flew, and then the Shadow Slaughter Claws snapped completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo's pupils constricted in surprise at the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere's formidable defense. After all, the newly retooled Meng Yehu was now entirely composed of magic treasures!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">This was the fruit of Ning Zhuo's immense war profits from the Two Note Kingdoms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Despite this, the Shadow Slaughter Claws had only managed to scratch the surface of the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Is that all?" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord raised an eyebrow slightly, then quickly composed himself. "Did I perhaps make too much of this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Suddenly, a fissure split open on the surface of the silver-gray giant sphere, releasing a torrent of steam mixed with a desolate Buddhist light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">This phenomenon wasn't caused by the Nether Slaughter Claw, but by the turbulent, tearing Formation Space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">However, under Ning Zhuo's watchful gaze, the crack on the silver-gray giant sphere swiftly began to heal itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The primary seal restraining the Nirvana Buddha Phantom was the Lord's Seal, a National Artifact! Reinforced by several Profound Nether Water Dragons, the seal's power remained remarkably resilient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord felt a slight sense of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo, however, noticed something amiss. Without hesitation, he activated the Spirit Communication Mirror and recalled Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"This is the power of the Water Element, beyond my immediate reach. Now, I must rely solely on the Fire Seed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Fire Within Wood!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">When decisive action was required, Ning Zhuo never hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">He retrieved the Fire Seed, cast a spell, and placed it in Meng Yehu's mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">This sight made the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord tense up again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"That brat is only at the Foundation Establishment Stage! How can he possess a Fire Seed?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Fire Within Wood!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"Even with this, he can't break through the Profound Nether Water Dragons' seal alone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"But what kind of Fire Element Spell did he actually use?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">This question was crucial!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">At its core, a spell is a method of wielding power. This power could be a cultivator's own spiritual energy, a precious material, or a magic artifact or treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">While Fire Within Wood couldn't directly counter the Profound Nether Water Dragons' seal, if the right spell was used, it could still break it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">This was the wisdom of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"How could this brat have learned a spell specifically targeted against my Profound Nether Water Dragons?" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord tried to reassure himself, but the thought only made him more anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">After all, this opponent was a Human Tribulation chosen by the Living Realm's Heaven and its Heavenly Mandate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">How many strange coincidences and hidden agendas had already manifested in his life?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">What the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord didn't realize was that Ning Zhuo hadn't learned any targeted spell at all. The truth was even worse than he imagined - Ning Zhuo's profound mastery of the Five Elements allowed him to create a new spell on the spot!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The Spirit Communication Mirror flashed, projecting Meng Yehu onto the Silver-Gray Giant Sphere once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">With all his strength, Meng Yehu climbed to the fissure, opened his mouth, and spat out a fiery orb, arching it directly into the orb's interior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Centered around the Fire Seed, the power of Fire Element Spells was boundless!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
