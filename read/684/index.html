<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Sun Lingtong's voice trembled with excitement. "The mountain's tremors stirred the lake, revealing a glimpse of the corridor's true formation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Hahaha! Our luck is incredible! Niu Cheng indirectly did us a huge favor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo, connected to Sun Lingtong through the Life Hanging by a Thread technique, felt as if he were witnessing the scene firsthand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He immediately recognized the significance and exclaimed, "I see it too! The formation within the corridor is deeply connected to the outside world!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"My mother didn't make this place transparent solely for the scenic views."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"The formation here harnesses sunlight to create real-time variations. No wonder our previous studies found it so obscure, defying any known formation patterns - it was utterly bizarre!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Some formations follow fixed patterns, while others exhibit far more complex variations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">During their discussions, Shen Xi had consistently emphasized the Nine Palaces Formation's preeminent status among the ten major formations. A key reason for this was the Nine Palaces Formation's Formation Core, which possessed immense computational and deductive capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This allowed the Nine Palaces Formation to evolve far beyond the capabilities of the other nine major formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The formation within the Jade Cleansing Pavilion's corridor lacked the Nine Palaces Formation's computational power. Instead, it cleverly leveraged external factors, using the variables of the outside world as its own. This was a cunning shortcut.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo sighed, "If Niu Cheng hadn't caused such a commotion, creating massive waves on Jade Lake, we never would have noticed this anomaly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Jade Lake was usually as smooth as a mirror, its surface undisturbed by even the slightest ripple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Sun Lingtong tilted his head back, gazing intently at the sky for a long moment. "No, it's not the sunlight. It's a change in the Cloud Manifestation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo blinked in surprise, studying the sky again, but still couldn't discern the subtle shift. It wasn't until Sun Lingtong had traversed half the corridor that he finally realized Sun Lingtong was right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The stark difference in their mastery of the Formation Dao was now glaringly apparent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Having deciphered the Formation's intricacies, Sun Lingtong navigated the corridor with remarkable ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He pushed open the door ahead, stepping into a courtyard paved with jade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">At the center of the courtyard stood an artificial mountain, cradling a spring of living water. Within the spring, crimson-scaled goldfish danced like shimmering silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">A pavilion perched atop the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Inside the pavilion, an elegantly simple table and chairs were arranged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">A plaque above the pavilion bore three characters: Fish Dance Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sun Lingtong cautiously ascended the artificial mountain, testing each step as he climbed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">As he stepped into the pavilion, the wind chimes suddenly began to chime without a breeze, their delicate notes ringing through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Paper People. Twelve paper figures drifted down from the pavilion's ceiling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The paper figures glowed mid-air, transforming into eight dancers and four tea masters upon landing - all as lifelike as real people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The dancers began to dance, their sleeves fluttering gracefully, while the tea masters tended their stoves, brewing fragrant tea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">For a moment, the pavilion was filled with the gentle sounds of trickling spring water, the tinkling of wind chimes, and soft, melodious singing, creating a soothing and joyful atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong strolled around the pavilion, confirming its safety before settling down casually. He took a sip of tea and grinned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He telepathically messaged Ning Zhuo, "Looks like this is where Auntie entertains guests."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">As Sun Lingtong left the pavilion, another crisp chime echoed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The paper figures reverted to their original forms, riding the tea-scented Qi back to the pavilion's ceiling, where they merged into the mural.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Sun Lingtong approached the artificial mountain and glanced at the living spring. "Those red-skirted goldfish are quite impressive. They're Foundation Establishment-level demon beasts - so beautiful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo glanced at them. "Just ornamental creatures, Boss. Nothing worth lingering over."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong nodded and retraced his steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This time, he easily returned to the Formation Core Chamber via the corridor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Navigating the central region, however, proved far more arduous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Overall, the challenge didn't prove insurmountable for Sun Lingtong, allowing him to open another door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Beyond the door lay another corridor, but Sun Lingtong and Sun Ning immediately recognized it as a new passage, distinct from the previous ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">After traversing the corridor, Sun Lingtong entered a workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The room was filled with the pungent aroma of bamboo pulp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The workshop's layout was simple: a long table and chairs occupied the center, while rows of low cabinets lined the lower sections of the four walls, their numerous drawers all closed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Above the cabinets, twelve shadow puppets materialized on the previously blank wall surfaces. Upon closer inspection, Sun Lingtong identified them as the Twelve Zodiac Shadow Puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He paused at the entrance, refraining from rashly entering, and instead activated his Spirit Eye to meticulously scan the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Under the Spirit Eye's gaze, the shadow puppets shifted from solid to ethereal, revealing their true forms. The tattered ear of the Xu Dog exposed golden filigree veins, the claws of the Yin Tiger were chipped and broken, and the Dragon's form was crafted from living silkworm silk, its bamboo frame supporting a soaring posture...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">These were the guardians of this place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Had Sun Lingtong recklessly entered, he likely would have triggered the Twelve Zodiac Shadow Puppets, subjecting himself to a coordinated assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"The key to breaking this lies on the long table," Sun Lingtong finally concluded, his gaze settling on a square seal platform resting on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He employed his Theft Path Methods, making repeated attempts until he finally managed to steal the seal platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He activated the seal platform, neutralizing the hidden traps and killing intent, allowing him to move freely within the chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sun Lingtong opened each drawer in the low cabinet, finding them meticulously organized with precious materials for crafting Paper Puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Approaching the central table and chairs, he examined the tools laid out there: a cold jade paper-cutting knife, a yin-yang eye-dotting brush, and other Magic Artifacts of modest grade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">This must have been where my mother crafted Paper Puppets in her lifetime, Ning Zhuo thought to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A scene flashed through his mind: Meng Yaoyin seated at the table, meticulously folding paper and assembling Paper Puppets. When she needed a particular material, she would flick her finger, remotely opening a drawer and summoning the material to float out and land on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Sun Lingtong glanced at the Twelve Zodiac Shadow Puppets before leaving the Paper Puppet workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He returned to the Formation Core Chamber and pushed open another door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Passing through another corridor, they arrived at a different room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo's spirits lifted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Clearly, this was a storage chamber, its precious materials neatly arranged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">On shelves along the north wall, Cloudtear Crystals rested in jade bowls, ethereal mist rising from within like miniature cloud seas. Beside them, Mirage Tower Shells were stacked in a pile, their iridescent surfaces shifting with each opening and closing of the shells...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Water Thornwood hung from jade hooks along the west wall, its grain shimmering in the light. Crystal Urns were suspended nearby, mysterious sands swirling within them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">On a stone platform to the east, a vial of adhesive glowed with ethereal light within a cold jade box. A full bowl of Golden Essence shimmered with a golden radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Leaning against the southwest corner stood a half-human-height jade pillar. Sealed within it was a three-foot-long segment of Sunken Lake Jade Marrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Most of these treasures were at the Foundation Establishment level, with only a few reaching Golden Core grade. There were no Nascent Soul-level materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After examining the collection, Sun Ning and Sun Lingtong's initial excitement faded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Both had seen grander sights. Compared to Tian Shuang's entire fortune or the treasures within the Forgetful River Manor, the Jade Cleansing Pavilion's offerings paled in comparison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Moments later, Sun Lingtong entered the fourth room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The light here was dreamlike and ethereal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A millennia-old Mirage Pearl embedded in the ceiling filtered the light into a soft, gauze-like glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The bed was a massive, open clamshell. Scattered around its edges, amidst the bedding, lay three hundred and sixty Dreamwalking Pearls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Mirage Pearl, combined with the Dreamwalking Pearls and the formation here, allowed one to design their dreams and experience whatever they desired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo sighed, "Mother was always so diligent at the Myriad Manifestations Sect. With this setup, she didn't even waste her sleep time, continuing her arduous cultivation in her dreams."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong replied, "This method has a drawback: it can exhaust the soul. But since we both have Million-Man-Souls, and this place, aside from being a bit feminine, is actually quite suitable for our cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun Lingtong searched the room thoroughly and discovered a jade box hidden beneath the pillow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Inside the box were only two items:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">One was a God's Contract, proving Meng Yaoyin's ownership of a Talisman Crafting Workshop during her lifetime.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The other was a talisman crafted from a jade token, engraved with dragon patterns and as white as snow. Its purpose remained unknown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong left the living quarters, returned to the Formation Core Chamber, and entered the fifth door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Soon after, he pushed open the door and found himself in a courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The high, arched ceiling resembled a luminous dome, beyond which lay the waters of Jade Lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The lake's crystal-clear waters shattered the sunlight into countless shimmering silver fragments that cascaded down silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Dappled sunlight danced across the courtyard, its shimmering reflections coalescing into countless droplets that cascaded down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">At the heart of the courtyard lay a pond, or perhaps more accurately, a water pit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The pit's uneven interior was strewn with rough jade stones of various shapes and colors: dull gray-green jade, muddy yellow Xiuyan jade, pristine white jade, blood-streaked jade...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">As the droplets landed on the stones, extraordinary transformations unfolded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">On the rough, gravel-like surface of the gray-green jade, the path traced by each droplet smoothed and refined at a visible pace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The dull, earthy yellow Xiuyan jade seemed to shed its dusty cloak. Under the water's touch, its color shifted from murky to clear, from dark to luminous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Some cracked jade stones even showed signs of repair. As droplets filled the fissures, the edges blurred, contracted, and gradually merged into soft, flowing patterns resembling natural leaf veins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Every grotto possessed its unique specialty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Jade Cleansing Pavilion's specialty was jade cleansing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sun Lingtong surveyed his surroundings, understanding dawning in his eyes. "This must be the Jade Rinse Courtyard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Here, the waters of Jade Lake were refined and purified, transforming into droplets that cleansed the jade stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The jade stones' flaws were washed away, their imperfections mended, and their inherent jade nature awakened and nourished by the water droplets, rendering them lustrous and translucent. Grayish-white, lifeless jade materials were ultimately transformed into radiant gemstones, their surfaces glowing with a warm, precious luster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Having been unattended for so long, the jade pit was now overflowing with cleansed jade stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong bent down and began picking them up directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Among them was Mutton Fat White Jade, its texture as smooth and flawless as cream, its spiritual light radiating from within, and its surface warm to the touch. Pure spiritual Qi flowed slowly within it, making it a rare and invaluable material for crafting Talismanic Cuisine and formation plate cores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">There was also Frost Marrow Ice Soul, as clear as Ten-Thousand-Year Profound Ice, its cold energy contained within. Approaching it brought a refreshing clarity to the mind, making it a top-tier material for forging Ice-attribute magic treasures and mind-clearing artifacts. At its core lay a deep blue marrow light, which, when Sun Lingtong saw it, reminded him of the azure evening sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Finally, there was Golden Scale Fire Jade, its jade material warm and golden-yellow, yet within it flowed intricate fire patterns resembling golden scales, brimming with pure Fire Element essence. This was an ideal material for setting up Great Fire Formations and forging Supreme Yang magical artifacts, combining the hardness of metal and stone with the heat of molten flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This time's harvest was truly substantial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The latter three types of jade were all Nascent Soul-level treasures, and their exceptional quality would undoubtedly fetch high prices on the market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Little Zhuo, next time we come, be sure to bring plenty of low-grade jade to fill this pit!" Sun Lingtong said reluctantly as they left the Jade Rinse Courtyard. After navigating through several corridors, they arrived at the final chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The moment they saw the three characters on the door, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo grew excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Divination Chamber?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Could this be where my mother practiced divination? If so, there might be divination tools inside!" Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sun Lingtong's imagination ran wild. "Perhaps there are even divination texts hidden here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">But when Sun Lingtong opened the door, they were met with a scene of utter devastation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The mica walls had long since crumbled to dust, leaving only the Formation's protective barrier to hold back the waters of Jade Lake. Most of the ceiling and floor remained intact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">In the center of the chamber floated a swirling vortex of deep blue water, its size dominating the room and its rotation fluctuating between rapid and sluggish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"What on earth happened here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Was this place attacked?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Unlikely. If enemies had invaded, why is the rest of the cave untouched?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Perhaps the enemy triggered the defenses here and met their end."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"That's certainly possible. If so, they must have been acting alone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Sun Lingtong surveyed the ruins, finding them utterly devastated, as if struck by some catastrophic event. Only the mysterious water vortex remained, the rest utterly worthless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Approaching the vortex, Sun Lingtong's expression suddenly shifted. "Wait, there's something inside the vortex!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Activating his Spirit Eye, he discovered within the vortex twisted and broken bronze Stellar Tracks from an Armillary Sphere, fragmented Mystic Turtle shell pieces carved into incomplete counting rods, and shattered Purple Sandalwood abacus frames...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Sun Lingtong's eyes blazed with spiritual light, pushing his Innate Talent to its limits. His gaze pierced deep into the vortex's core, where ancient and profound radiance shimmered. Within that radiance, something faintly materialized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"It looks like a page of paper," Sun Lingtong murmured, his expression puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">But the next moment, as the image sharpened, a tremor ran through his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Heavens!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"This... this is a page from the Luoshu!!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Magic Artifacts, magic treasures, Spirit Treasures, Dao Treasures... the Luoshu was a Dao Treasure renowned throughout history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">According to historical records, the Luoshu was neither gold nor jade, neither silk nor stone, but woven from the fundamental mathematical principles of the cosmos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The moment Sun Lingtong activated his Spirit Eye to peer into the Dao Treasure, he triggered its power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Black and white dots materialized on the Luoshu's pages, appearing endlessly, swirling across the surface, suddenly freezing, then scattering again in chaotic patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">During this process, Sun Lingtong's divine sea rapidly drained, his mental energy plummeted, and even his Soul weakened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Yet, he gained an astonishingly deep understanding of the whirlpool before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"Boss!" Ning Zhuo sensed the danger and immediately activated a Spell, sending remote support through the Life Hanging by a Thread technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Startled awake, Sun Lingtong quickly closed his eyes, severing his connection with the Luoshu's pages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Blood trickled silently from his nose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Sun Lingtong ignored the blood, his expression alight with excitement. "This is truly a Luoshu page! A Dao Treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"By using the Luoshu to deduce, I've realized this whirlpool is actually a Formation, Little Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo's eyes widened in understanding. "I get it now. Dao Treasures can influence their surroundings. Since my mother left this place long ago, the Dao Treasure's inherent power has been disrupting the room and, by harnessing the environment, has formed a natural Formation!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
