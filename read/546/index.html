<paragraph index="1">Today was the appointed day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A Ten Thousand Li Traversing dragon soared through the void and arrived near the frontline camp of the Two Note Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Soon, Ning Zhuo contacted Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Advisor, we meet again!” Liu Er, upon meeting Ning Zhuo again, enthusiastically grabbed Ning Zhuo’s arm, his eyes welling up with emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Since the battle of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, I have thought of you day and night, Advisor; today, upon seeing you, you appear even thinner. Please take good care of your health.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo nodded, and with both hands he also grabbed Liu Er’s arm, moved as he said, “General, you worry about me; what virtue or ability do I possess?! To encounter a General in Two Note Nation is the fortune and destiny of a little fellow like me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“In this bag there are two hundred thousand mid-grade spirit stones; give them to the General, to serve as military supplies!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Liu Er immediately became energized, and took the bag full of spirit stones, saying, “Without the Advisor’s support, the Three-General Camp would have long collapsed!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo said, “Without the assistance of the Three-Generals Camp and the three Generals, I would not have come this far.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Liu Er also took out a storage bag, “This is a reward obtained through our battle merits. Zhao Xi originally wanted to put the Advisor in a bind; he was very much opposed to the Advisor not returning to the main camp...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Liu Er then immediately recounted Zhao Xi’s harassment in a very tactful manner to convey his own achievements to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Hearing this, Ning Zhuo immediately expressed his gratitude to Liu Er, “Many thanks for the General’s trust, and for persuading Zhao Xi at the critical moment, which saved a lot of trouble.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This gratitude indeed came sincerely from Ning Zhuo’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Liu Er burst into a laugh, indicating, “What relationship do I have with Ning Zhuo? We are on the same side; if I don’t help you, who else will?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Liu Er asked, “Advisor, are you not going to return to the main camp?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">After a sigh, Ning Zhuo nodded slightly and said, “In this battle of the Twin Ghosts, the danger was extraordinary; I had exposed my trump card, which aroused Zhao Xi’s covetousness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“But I cannot guarantee that the next battle will replicate the previous success.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Moreover, in the face of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, fleeing in advance was my optimal choice!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Returning to the main camp is impossible. Once I return, I am very likely to be placed under house arrest, or even be killed for my treasures.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“After all, I am merely a person from a foreign land.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo looked up at the sky and sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">His background and cultivation were indeed modest; the value he was now demonstrating completely undermined the previous cooperative relationship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Liu Er fully approved of Ning Zhuo’s decision and nodded in amazement, “The Advisor’s reputation has now spread throughout the entire frontline camp of Two Note Nation. In due time, it will undoubtedly be known across the nation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Even, his fame has spread far to other nations. After all, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth are renowned strong figures in many countries.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“To be able to contend with two Nascent Soul-level powerhouses using only foundation level cultivation is something that has not been seen for many years.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“In this way, after this battle, as I journey across the world, I need to use a different name.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">For Ning Zhuo, he was pleased to see his reputation growing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The greater his reputation, the easier it was for him to blend into the righteous world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Furthermore, these battlefield achievements were very difficult to hide - the difficulty in concealing them was truly too high!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">After their conversation had not lasted long, Ning Zhuo bid farewell to Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Seeing the Ten Thousand Li Traversing dragon soar through the void and depart, Liu Er stood in place for quite a while before finally sighing softly and turning to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In the previous battle of the Twin Ghosts, the Ten Thousand Li Traversing dragon had already been completely exposed to Liu, Guan, and Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Liu Er was not surprised; he only lamented that he had once been blind to the truth: “Ning Zhuo possesses such combat strength and such a mechanical trump card - no wonder the Ning family allowed him to travel the world.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“The disciples of a great clan are just different from us!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo, who was in the mechanical ship cabin, took out the contents of a storage bag to inspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">A golden pill had exchanged for three pieces, belonging respectively to the Fire Path, the Water Path, and the Earth Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">There were also eighteen National Power Bricks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In addition, there were two protective magical treasures - one, a Golden Light Necklace, and the other, a Qingbai Jade Ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">And the Nascent Soul that Sun and Ning previously anticipated was not obtained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the jade slip Zhao Xi gave to Ning Zhuo, he hinted that if the latter wished to exchange battle merits for a Nascent Soul, it was not impossible - but it required a face-to-face transaction!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">After all, such a transaction, if exposed, would greatly affect official reputation and Zhao Xi’s personal future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhao Xi’s proposal to conduct a secret, private transaction was quite reasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">But both Sun and Ning sighed in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Lingtong directly said, “Little Zhuo, do not trust Zhao Xi; he is no longer trustworthy!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo nodded, sensing the deeper implication behind Zhao Xi’s actions, and also fearing that if he met Zhao Xi in person, he might be surrounded and captured, thereby losing his personal freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Not obtaining the Nascent Soul was indeed a great regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Among the three golden pills, Ning Zhuo chose one of the Earth Path golden pills and inserted it into the Five Elements Golden Pill Wheel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He donned the Cang Iron Armor and once again took it for a test drive in the high sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sure enough, with the continuous supply of the golden pill, his spiritual energy was exceedingly abundant, and the Cang Iron Armor cut through the wind and flew wildly, carving a long trail of departing fire in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo fully enjoyed the exhilaration of speeding through the sky, which made Sun Lingtong’s eyes light up as he repeatedly shouted, “Let me have a try, let me play a bit!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Hey, you have already been playing for a long time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Don’t delay the serious matters, Little Zhuo; quickly let me have a play!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Being incessantly urged by Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo reluctantly stepped out of the mechanical battle armor and handed it over to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong piloted the Cang Iron Armor, drawing out in mid-air a series of extremely bizarre and irregular flight trajectories, which excited him to the point of exclaiming loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo then took out the mechanical Golden Swallow, attempting to command a large group of them to fly around in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong got so carried away with playing that, as Ning Zhuo repeatedly urged him, he eventually had the armor snatched back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Little Zhuo, you must custom-make a set of this for me!” Sun Lingtong made his request.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo did not hesitate in the slightest and immediately nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">A request from a good brother was never something he would consider refusing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">But Sun Lingtong then added, “No rush. You are currently pressed for time; once this great battle is over and you have free time, making one then will not be too late.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo donned the Cang Iron Armor and flew up into the air again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">While piloting the mechanical battle armor, he also simultaneously directed the mechanical Golden Swallows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Golden Swallows circled around him, sometimes gathering together like a school of fish, and sometimes dispersing like the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Their golden wings, under the sunlight, flashed with dazzling sharp brilliance, exuding an imposing aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">By evening, Ning Zhuo stepped out of the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, ending today’s physical cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He ate some spirit food, and no longer feeling famished, then entered the interior of a mountain cave to begin an important cultivation practice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong was the first to cast the Fire Cremation Prajna Spirit-Resolving Sutra, igniting flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo removed his own lungs and tossed them into the flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The void in his body was temporarily filled by false lungs formed by his blood-nerve bindings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The pair of lungs burned in the flames and quickly melted away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ten-Thousand-Year Golden Essence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo threw a piece of treasured material into the fireball to be refined together with his lungs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Ten-Thousand-Year Golden Essence came from battle merit rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">After pondering for a long time, Ning Zhuo ultimately decided to expend a portion of his battle merit rewards to exchange with the Two Note Nation for such a reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“I have already revised the terms of our cooperation; please ask Lin Bufan to bring back the Ten-Thousand-Year Water Essence for me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“The Ten-Thousand-Year Golden Essence has been exchanged from Two Note Nation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Then, only the Ten-Thousand-Year Wood Essence remains.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Although Ning Zhuo had many battle merits, he still needed to be frugal and calculate meticulously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">After all, the opportunity to exchange for National Power Bricks was too precious, so he exchanged most of his battle merits for National Power Bricks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">For a cultivator to use National Power Bricks, they must receive recognition and permission from a cultivation state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Otherwise, even if one managed to seize such treasures, they would be unusable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">National Power Bricks were allocated for exclusive use by individuals, as determined by the sovereign or high-level authorities; once regulated, not even one’s closest relatives could use any of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Unless the sovereign or other high-level authorities issue a decree with a broader usage scope covering more than one cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo already possessed the Earth Path, Fire Path, and Water Path; only the Metal Path and Wood Path remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He chose the Metal Path because the Ten-Thousand-Year Wood Essence was easier to come by in the current environment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Every high mountain in Thousand Peaks Forest was like a giant celestial pillar tree. The Wood Path environment here was exceedingly flourishing, and Ning Zhuo speculated that in the repositories of some large powers, it was very likely that Ten-Thousand-Year Wood Essence was stored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Completely focused, Ning Zhuo quickly refined his lungs and the Ten-Thousand-Year Golden Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Everything progressed smoothly, and the successful result had already become apparent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Suddenly, something stirred in Ning Zhuo’s heart; he thought of the Fire Within Wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The profound realm of the Fire Path at that moment reminded him that employing the Fire Within Wood could accelerate the refinement and save thirty percent of the effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo refrained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">By nature cautious, he decided not to take reckless risks. After all, the Ten-Thousand-Year Golden Essence was extremely precious; proceeding step by step was sufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">After a short while, Ning Zhuo achieved great success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He opened his mouth and lightly inhaled, drawing a mass of golden light into his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">When the golden light reached the position of his lungs, the previous blood-nerve cluster immediately disintegrated, making room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The golden light reconstituted a pair of lungs, reinserted them, and reconstructed a circulation and balance together with the other parts of his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Metal Path Lung Temple!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo’s strength increased once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">In a certain valley of Thousand Peaks Forest, Lord Long personally set out to pay a visit to Master Shengxu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Master Shengxu lay on his bed, as frail as a sheet of white paper, coughing twice, “What brings you here?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Lord Long was silent for a moment, then said heavily, “We have agreed to your request.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Master Shengxu: “Oh?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He raised his eyebrows slightly, revealing a trace of delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Then, he laboriously propped himself up, leaning against the headboard, and looked at Lord Long, “Is that truly so?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Lord Long had once invited Master Shengxu to intervene again to assist the Thousand Peaks Forest side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">But the latter had put forward a demand - namely, to obtain a mouthful of the Life Sea Dragon Spring. At that time, Lord Long had unhesitatingly and directly refused, with a very clear and resolute attitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Now, Lord Long’s attitude was also very clear, but it had completely reversed from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Life force - or rather, vitality - once accumulated too much, would form an ocean of vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">This was the Life Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">And as the Life Sea continued to accumulate, if its scale reached a certain point of qualitative change, a spring eye would form in the sea, from which new vitality would continuously emerge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Thousand Peaks Forest was a land of the Wood Dao, with abundant vitality. In several locations there, a Life Sea had formed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">But there might not necessarily be spring eyes in the Life Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">However, Master Shengxu knew that in one of the Life Seas, not only had a spring eye been nurtured, but there were more than one - and moreover, they were Dragon Springs imbued with dragon aura!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">That particular Life Sea was located within the body of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Master Shengxu proposed that he could act, but he demanded one spring eye of the Life Sea Dragon Spring from the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King. This, for the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, naturally would be a huge loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Therefore, at that time, as one of the temple attendants of the Dragon King Temple, Lord Long had unhesitatingly refused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">But now, with a great battle imminent, the higher-ups of the Dragon King Temple had urgently deliberated and still wanted to invite Master Shengxu to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">After all, they were unable to contact the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">In this war to pacify Two Note Nation, the most crucial contest was still a contest of Soul Formation powerhouses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Although Master Shengxu’s cultivation was not yet at the Soul Formation level, he possessed battle strength at that level! This had an extremely significant impact on the current state of the war.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Lord Long sighed, then directly took out a divine edict and, in response to Master Shengxu’s inquiry, said, “It is naturally true.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Master Shengxu merely glanced at the divine edict, and thereby confirmed Lord Long’s sincerity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The divine edict contained a strong aura of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, with demon qi and divine intent intermingling, making it very difficult to forge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">One who could issue such a divine edict had to be the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">This transaction involved the Life Sea Dragon Spring, and only with the approval of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King himself could it proceed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Master Shengxu used his divine sense to seize the object, suspending the divine edict in mid-air, and examined it carefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">After a moment, he nodded slightly, “Since you have agreed to my conditions, I am indeed prepared to act.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">“However, this one divine edict alone is not sufficient.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">“We also need to sign an additional one!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Saying this, Master Shengxu took out another divine edict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">On the back of the divine edict was the image of a deity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">He was draped in a moon-white, heavenly-silkworm cloud-patterned broad-sleeved Daoist robe, with a mysterious black dragon-shaped jade pendant hanging from his waist, and his feet were clad in Mountain-and-River Shoes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">His face was like crowned jade, and a third eye was open on his forehead. One hand held the Mirror of Preceding Causes, and the other held the Voucher for Binding the Outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">He rode a three-legged Qingyin Crane, whose feathers subtly revealed the maxims of the Dao; with each flap of its wings, contractual golden inscriptions were scattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Heavenly God-Contract!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">He was a rather ancient heavenly deity, in charge of contracts. Because of his authority, he remained unyielding through the ages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Upon seeing this, Lord Long’s eyes flashed with a fierce gleam, and he said expressionlessly, “So, Master Shengxu came prepared.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Master Shengxu paid no heed; using his divine sense, he grasped the object and unfolded the blank will of the Contract God, writing the document with his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">After writing, he handed it over to Lord Long for review.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Lord Long nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The two divine edicts met in mid-air and merged into a ball of radiant light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The radiance shot upward like lightning, and in the blink of an eye disappeared from in front of the two, soaring straight out of the nine heavens into the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">After a few breaths, Master Shengxu felt a constraint descend upon him. He silently recited a spell, confirmed that the divine edict had taken effect, and then nodded to Lord Long, “Thus, the contract is concluded. When do you want me to act?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Lord Long presented the Life Sea Dragon Spring with both hands, then said, “For now, please, conserve your strength and wait for the most opportune moment to strike.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Master Shengxu accepted the Dragon Spring, then lay down again, remaining immobile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Lord Long sighed inwardly and turned to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">His mission was successful, yet his mood was rather heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The Life Sea Dragon Spring could provide significant assistance in helping the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King recover from his injuries, but now, due to circumstances, only one spring could be extracted for reinforcements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Upon returning to the frontline camp, Lord Long immediately dispatched the army and marched towards Dragon King’s Giant Pillar Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">The allied forces of Thousand Peaks Forest advanced in vast numbers directly up to the frontline camp of Two Note Nation, only then coming to an abrupt halt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">The second grand battle was on the verge of breaking out!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
