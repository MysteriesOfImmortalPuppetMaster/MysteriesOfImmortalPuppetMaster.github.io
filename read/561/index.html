<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"I can’t believe I ended up falling into this brat’s hands!" The Demonheart Cave Master was filled with hatred and fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">His heart was full of unwillingness. If it hadn't been for the Divine Ability: Scarlet Heart Homing Arrow, if it hadn’t been for the fierce battles he had just gone through - how could Ning Zhuo have found an opening?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But reality was hard as iron. No matter how unwilling the Demonheart Cave Master was, all he could do was force his Nascent Soul to escape and flee through the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Ning Zhuo, the hatred between us is irreconcilable! Just you wait!” As he fled, his Nascent Soul let out a sharp and piercing screech.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo let out a deep sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He had truly wanted to keep the Demonheart Cave Master's Nascent Soul from escaping, but he simply had no means to do so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong remarked, “This man had quite the technique. He actually hid his Nascent Soul inside his heart, forming a strange kind of death-substitution art.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“In this way, it’s like he has multiple lives. Even after taking a hit from the Divine Ability Scarlet Heart Homing Arrow, he still managed to survive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In terms of combat power, the Demonheart Cave Master wasn’t as strong as Lord Long, but his life-preservation techniques far surpassed him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">No matter how strong Lord Long was, he only had one life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">On the battlefield’s edge, Lin Bufan, who had been concealing his presence, wore an expression of shock: “That brat Ning Zhuo… actually killed a Nascent Soul stage cultivator.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Though it was just the finishing blow, if he hadn’t acted in time and let the Demonheart Cave Master recover, the latter could’ve rallied once more.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“At that point, General Mu Lan wouldn’t have had the strength to unleash a second Scarlet Heart Homing Arrow. She would’ve fallen into a complete disadvantage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Ning Zhuo is only in the Foundation Establishment stage… Yet this achievement alone is something to be proud of.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The sight of Ning Zhuo slaying the Demonheart Cave Master was seared deeply into Lin Bufan’s memory, completely altering the impression he held of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">All this time, due to their cultivation gap, Lin Bufan had always felt a sense of superiority over Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But now, after personally witnessing the Demonheart Cave Master’s fate, something in Lin Bufan’s heart had fundamentally shifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“That kid Ning Zhuo… No wonder the royal family of the Southern Bean Kingdom took a liking to him,” Lin Bufan sincerely sighed, then turned his gaze to Zhu Xuanji beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zhu Xuanji gave a slight nod, thinking to himself: This is the true child of Destiny.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“He’s only just begun his journey through the world, still at mere Foundation Establishment… and yet he's already stirred up so much.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“At barely more than sixteen years old, he already has the life of a Nascent Soul cultivator under his belt.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Truly…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">In this respect, even Zhu Xuanji had to admit he fell short of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“What?! The Demonheart Cave Master was killed?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Killed by Ning Zhuo? Damn it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Retreat! Retreat now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Although the Demonheart Cave Master’s Nascent Soul had escaped, the fact that he was defeated and effectively killed had far-reaching consequences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Many cultivators who had witnessed it firsthand had already been demoralized - and now, they completely lost the will to fight and turned to flee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">If this were a proper allied army, there would’ve been a battle enforcement division to severely punish or even execute deserters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But first, the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance was still a newly formed coalition, its organization not yet complete. Second, the core high-level figures were all bogged down in the main battlefield and couldn’t spare attention elsewhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Once the first deserter appeared, it quickly triggered a wave - second, third…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Like a spreading plague, the number of deserters grew rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo’s slaying of the Demonheart Cave Master created a fundamental morale shift, setting off the collapse of the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Seeing the enemy troops fleeing in all directions, the morale of the Two Note Nation’s army surged, and they shouted with triumph.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">On the Thousand Peaks Forest side, some Nascent Soul cultivators tried to salvage the situation and shouted at the top of their lungs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But on a battlefield this vast, even Nascent Soul cultivators seemed small and insignificant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">They might be able to kill thousands, but altering the will of tens of thousands was another matter entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“The tide is lost!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“It’s over…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Damn it - who can turn the tide?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Like the receding waves, the core forces who remained on the battlefield stood out - they were prepared to fight to the death. In their hearts, they cried out: Where is the Dragon King? Has Lord Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King not yet made a move?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">In such a dire situation, only the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King, at the Soul Formation stage, could possibly reverse the tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Deep underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Dragon King’s Secret Shrine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">A grand sacrificial ritual had reached its climactic stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Incense smoke coiled in the air, offerings were piled like mountains, and the shrine’s priests chanted in unison:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“In the beginning was chaos split into light and dark, where even grass and trees gained spirit. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">From Thousand Peaks, essence coalesced. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">In the Nine Orifices dwelled the vital spark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Born from dragon beard, bearing the earth’s pulse, transformed to man to rule the mountain court. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">When his roots stir, rivers shift course; when his leaves sway, the stars realig...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“To the revered Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King: bearer of the Earthly Deeds of Wu and Ji, shaped by the true essence of Yang Wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Roots reach the Nine Netherworlds, crown touches the Purple Microcosm and Jade Purity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Drinking morning dew to cleanse the world’s miasma, absorbing moonlight to calm the evil stars of the seas…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Now the skies are shrouded in miasma, demon flames consume the forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Tamed beasts tear apart the land, the Snake Mother devours the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Old Stone Monster has stolen high office,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">brigands outside the woods boil mountain gods for soup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Springs run dry, the Five-Colored Earth turns foul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Foxes cry over bones on the cliffs, cranes weep into icy ravines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Beasts without homes, grasses with severed roots…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“We plead: let the Dragon King unfurl his beard to sweep across the world,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">wave his ginseng leaves to stabilize Heaven and Earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Where his roots rise, let the Old Stone Monster be torn asunder;</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">where his incense spreads, awaken the deluded evil spirits outside the cave…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Let the peach trees of the Eastern Ridge bloom again,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">the spirit springs of the Western Ravine run warm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Cranes return to the Southern Abyss,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">clouds once again root in the Northern Cliffs…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“With thousand-year-old Fo-Ti root as candles, ten-thousand-year Poria Frost as wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Offer three pairs of tiger eyes to forge divine lightning sight;</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">present nine eagle feathers to form a demon-slaying blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">With the blood from a child’s heart, write the Sacrificial Text of the Rivers and Mountains!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“We humbly beg the honored god to unleash the might of creation,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">exhale the breath of the Ginseng Origin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Restore the green ocean of Thousand Peaks’ forests,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">renew the sun and moon of Heaven and Earth!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“We bow a hundred times, kneel with bleeding hearts - our plea!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Blood sacrifice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">As the final words of the sacrificial prayer were uttered, the fresh, living offerings were all taken at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The surging vitality and the divine power provided by countless deities mixed together into a massive torrent, flowing downward - deeper and deeper - until it reached the earth’s ley lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After the first great war, the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King had been severely wounded and had hidden deep within the ley lines to recover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">A faint dragon’s roar echoed from within the earth veins. As earth energy surged and flowed, a vague dragon shape began to condense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">This was no ordinary sign!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King had toiled painstakingly, refining the earth veins with his own essence blood, dragon origin, and countless divine powers. Now, the earth veins had taken on the blurred form of a dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">If the time came when both form and spirit were fully realized, then the vast earth vein beneath this forest of a thousand peaks would be elevated into a true Dragon Vein!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">And whoever controlled the Dragon Vein - namely, the Ginseng Whisker Dragon King - would possess the foundational qualifications to establish a cultivation nation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">At this moment, nourished by the vast offerings of the blood sacrifice, the Dragon King’s aura surged dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He slowly opened his eyes. A thought stirred in his divine sea: “It’s time to set off.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Demonic Art – Earth Vein Traversal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Twelve green vine waterfalls cascaded down in succession. The mountain body rose in a spiral. Within the marshland, glowing fungal mats floated in great swathes, interwoven with fireflies and eerie green ghost flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">This was none other than Coiling Vine Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The once-quiet swamp was now buzzing with activity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The ghost flames surged into a sea of green fire. Fireflies swirled in all directions - countless in number.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The one behind all this was Gao Cuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">At this moment, he was casting a spell to harvest the Firefly Burial Shroud buried deep in the swamp mud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">At the bottom of Coiling Vine Peak’s rotting swamp lay countless decaying corpses and the dead roots of myriad green vines - fertile soil for the fireflies’ proliferation and survival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Through the continuous cycle of life activities, the fireflies had unconsciously transformed their breeding grounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">A thin, gossamer veil stretched across the surface of billions of corpses, serving as a habitat for the fireflies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This veil marked the boundary between life and death, imbued with a mysterious Dao rhythm that merged vitality and decay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The vast veil spread across nearly ten acres, almost invisible, but under the flickering light of the fireflies, it sometimes flickered between black and white.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Gao Cuo continued to extract the veil, storing it in his bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Got it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“Our plan was right. After disguising myself as the Old Stone Monster, the Azure Vine Healer Bi Tengyi didn’t dare to act rashly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“We’re basically pulling out the roots of Coiling Vine Peak by harvesting the Firefly Burial Shroud. But that Nascent Soul cultivator can only watch helplessly, holed up deep in her lair.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Gao Cuo was elated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">This treasure was extremely important to him. With proper refinement, he could disguise himself as a dead object - greatly expanding his means of survival and drastically improving his combat strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Failed twice before, but this time, luck is finally on my side, hahaha!” Gao Cuo laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Everything had gone smoothly from the moment he began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Once I harvest this patch, I’ll leave. Better to leave the Azure Vine Healer a piece of the swamp - if she gets angry and makes a move, the cost will outweigh the gain!” came Sword Elder’s reminder in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Gao Cuo nodded. “Sword Elder, you’re right. I was thinking the same. No need to be too ruthless - if we force the Azure Vine Healer into action, that’s going too far...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">As they spoke - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The ground shook violently!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“What’s going on?!” Gao Cuo was shocked. “Is the Azure Vine Healer making a move?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“No. It’s not her!” Sword Elder instantly denied it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">In the next moment, the green vine waterfall beside him trembled fiercely, accompanied by waves of draconic roars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">A surge of powerful dragon energy flooded the area, instantly transforming the countless green vines into vine drakes that lunged at Gao Cuo’s disguised stone form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Gao Cuo’s heart trembled violently. He hurriedly continued pretending to be the Old Stone Monster, trying to roll into the mountain and escape using Earth Escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">“Don’t! Something big is underground!” Sword Elder warned just in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Gao Cuo was shocked again. Still maintaining his disguise spell, he frantically flew upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">But in the very next moment, a torrential surge of earth energy erupted from the swamp, suppressing the sea of ghost flames and generating an unbelievably powerful suction force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Though Gao Cuo had already risen into the air, he was forcibly pulled back down to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“Who’s scheming against me...?” Gao Cuo's eyes widened in disbelief, his pupils shrinking to pinpoints as he violently trembled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">“The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King?!!” he cried out in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">He never imagined that the one ambushing him would be the strongest being in the Forest of a Thousand Peaks - the de facto overlord of the region’s allied forces!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">“The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">“A Soul Formation stage cultivator?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">“Here specifically to capture me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">“Don’t tell me... the Azure Vine Healer is his lover?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">In that moment, Gao Cuo nearly burst into curses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">This was absurd!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The mighty Dragon King, in the middle of a major battlefield, actually teleported himself to Coiling Vine Peak at great cost - just to deal with Gao Cuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">“What have I ever done to deserve this?!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">If he had known this was going to happen, he would never have come to Coiling Vine Peak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Trying to calm himself, Gao Cuo consoled: “Luckily, I’m still pretending to be the Old Stone Monster...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">In the next instant, a message rang out in his divine sense from the Ginseng Whisker Dragon King:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">“Old Monster. You lost to me once before. Today will be no different. Even if you've reached the Soul Formation stage, you stand no chance. Surrender now, and join me in hunting down Du Tiechuan. I will grant you the title of second-in-command of the Thousand Peaks Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Upon hearing this- </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Gao Cuo was utterly dumbfounded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Sword Elder, too, was left speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">So after all that, it wasn’t them, nor was it Bi Tengyi - it was the identity of the “ Old Stone Monster” that had attracted the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Gao Cuo wanted to shout, “Lord Dragon King, you’ve got it wrong! The ‘Old Freak Within the Stone’ in front of you is a fake, a fake!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">But he only dared to scream it in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">He wouldn’t dare tell the truth even if it killed him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">If he really told the truth, the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King - who had teleported here, abandoned the great battle, made such sacrifices and paid such a price - would find out it was all for a counterfeit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Would the mighty Dragon King, at the Soul Formation stage, go easy on Gao Cuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">That’s just wishful thinking!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Spell - Illusion Mirage Projection!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The phantom of a giant mirage beast emerged. The dragon-vine-like green tendrils weaving through the illusion were deceived and began tangling with each other, most of their attacks dissolving in internal conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">However, even though Gao Cuo poured all his strength into casting the spell, it still wasn’t enough to stop all the tendrils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Hundreds of green tendrils were about to pierce the “stone sphere” when the Sword Elder struck without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Sword Technique - Thousandfold Piercing Blades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Sword energy burst forth, condensing countless sword tips that struck thousands of times in an instant. The sword tips formed dense barriers, using offense as defense, piercing and annihilating the attacking tendrils entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">The Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King roared in fury: “You are not the Old Stone Monster!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">His low growl echoed throughout the entire Giantwood Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Just in the first round of offense and defense, the Dragon King had already seen through the illusion and realized the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">After all, he had fought the Old Stone Monster before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Gao Cuo’s face turned pale as paper in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">He was filled with regret, wanting nothing more than to slap himself hard across the face: “Why did I pretend to be the Old Stone Monster? Why, oh why did I do that?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Having uncovered the truth, the Dragon King roared again: “Well played! Du Tiechuan’s scheme is truly clever. And you - quite the guts! Daring to risk your life to carry out such a dangerous mission. Then this god shall fulfill your wish!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">“No, please, no…” Gao Cuo was weeping inside, “I wasn’t sent by Du Tiechuan, I really wasn’t…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">The Sword Elder shouted: “Xiao Gao, it’s time to go all out!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Gao Cuo was jolted awake, face solemn. The pressure of death shattered all illusions and hesitation: “Understood, Sword Elder. Possess my body!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">In the next instant, Gao Cuo lost control of his own body - it was fully taken over by the Sword Elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">Sword Technique - Dreamshatter Galaxy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">Sword energy surged, drawing upon the starlight of the heavens. Each strand of sword qi glowed with a brilliant blue aura, sweeping through the air like the shattered river of stars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">Sword Technique - Azure Lotus Tribulation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">The sword qi reversed course, forming into countless lotus-shaped projections that surrounded Gao Cuo on all sides, forming a full-spectrum defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">One sword technique for offense, one for defense - the Sword Elder unleashed his full power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">Boom rumble...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">The mountain rocks split apart as Qiu Vine Peak collapsed to the side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">The colossal true form of the Ginseng-Whisker Dragon King burst from the mountainside, casting an immense shadow over the land. Gao Cuo looked up, feeling as though the entire sky had been blocked out by the Dragon King!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">Even the Sword Elder had a brief moment of daze, awestruck by the Dragon King’s divine majesty.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
