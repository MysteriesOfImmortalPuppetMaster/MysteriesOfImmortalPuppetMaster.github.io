<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">It turned out that Lady Spiderweb's seductive techniques had never worked on Che Zhuzi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Void Spider was a eunuch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Lady Spiderweb stared at the Demon Cultivator before her, still unable to believe it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Look at his thick beard, his incredibly muscular physique - so overwhelmingly masculine. How could this be?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Following her gaze, Che Zhuzi stroked his beard and puffed out his chest proudly. "I know what you're thinking. I've been absorbing massive amounts of Yang Qi from the outside world. It cost me a fortune, but every penny was worth it. Compared to the seventeenfold increase in production, the investment in Yang Qi is a mere pittance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Lady Spiderweb: ......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Che Zhuzi produced a contract. "Come, sign it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He channeled spiritual energy into the document, causing it to unfurl completely before Lady Spiderweb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After carefully examining the contract, Lady Spiderweb struggled again, her voice a mix of shock and resentment. "This... this is a slavery contract?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">But no matter how fiercely she fought, she remained completely immobilized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In a fair fight, even if she couldn't defeat the Golden Core-level Che Zhuzi, she would have stood a good chance of escaping. Now, having fallen victim to his trap, her fate was utterly wretched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">I underestimated him! I saw Che Zhuzi as prey, never imagining I'd become the hunted - and willingly walked into his lair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Lady Spiderweb's expression was one of utter despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Realizing she couldn't break free, she pleaded, "Lord Che Zhuzi, are you truly going to take such drastic measures?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Let me be frank with you. My involvement in this scheme against Ning Zhuo was for the benefit of the Ban Clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"You must know what kind of power the Ban Clan wields!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Instead of mentioning Ban Ji directly, Lady Spiderweb strategically invoked the entire Ban Clan to pressure Che Zhuzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Che Zhuzi remained unmoved. "The Ban Clan is part of the Righteous Path. Would they really hire a Demonic Cultivator like you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"You misunderstand," Lady Spiderweb retorted. "I have no desire to be entangled in this mess. If you have any secret information, take it to Ning Zhuo yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Lady Spiderweb tried to evade him, but her face paled. "W-what do you mean? Are you going to - "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">A chilling premonition surged through her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Che Zhuzi's smile turned sinister. "Ah, yes. I'm just an outsider, dragged into this by the Boundless Realm. My only interest is making money. Who has time for your petty squabbles? I'm a businessman; neutrality is all that matters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">His status as a disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect gave him this confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Your affairs are your own to settle!" Che Zhuzi emphasized, his voice final.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Could it be... I'm going to become Ning Zhuo's dog? No! Never! A wave of intense absurdity and shame washed over Lady Spiderweb, draining the color from her face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Che Zhuzi suddenly ceased communicating, sensing something amiss. He turned his gaze, piercing through the Grand Formation to focus on a specific point within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo was retreating while fighting!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">There was simply no other choice. Facing two opponents in a two-on-one battle, the numerical disadvantage was overwhelming. Ning Zhuo's fists couldn't match four hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">If his opponents had been novices or lacked skill in controlling their mechanical constructs, there might have been a chance. But the reality was that the two cultivators blocking Ning Zhuo's path had no weaknesses whatsoever. They were even more adept at manipulating mechanical constructs than Ning Zhuo himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">In truth, Ning Zhuo's opponents were two elderly cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Having been allies for years, they had already agreed to eliminate Ning Zhuo, the "outsider," first, and then settle their own rivalry afterward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">They relentlessly pursued Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Under these circumstances, the outcome of the battle seemed inevitable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Then, Che Zhuzi suddenly intervened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Rumble...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Maze underwent another dramatic transformation. Walls shifted, mechanisms activated, and traps erupted, intercepting Ning Zhuo's two pursuers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Walls sliced through space, swiftly cutting Ning Zhuo off from his pursuers' sight and granting him a precious moment to catch his breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">A chance to catch his breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Then, under Lady Spiderweb's wide-eyed gaze, Che Zhuzi lightly tapped his finger, instantly teleporting a brand-new Mystic Iron Puppet into the heart of the Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Cheating! Someone is cheating here!" Lady Spiderweb wanted to shout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"What's going on?!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed, overjoyed at the sight of the pristine Mystic Iron Puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">This wasn't just a chance to catch his breath; it was a golden opportunity to turn the tide!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo immediately swapped out his Iron Puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He had long coveted this replacement, eager to discard his worn-out, near-obsolete puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Continue resting?" Ning Zhuo shook his head, decisively rejecting his previous plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"What I need to do is seize this moment and immediately counterattack to eliminate the enemy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">A fierce battle intent blazed in Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He reasoned that the Maze's recent transformation must have introduced numerous new Mystic Iron Puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"It's impossible that I'm the only one getting a replacement!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"The other two enemies might also have encountered new puppets and swapped out their old ones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"I must seize this opportunity, striking while they're at their weakest, to fully exploit our advantage!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In a two-on-one situation, relying solely on Mystic Iron Puppet and Void Spider Silk, Ning Zhuo was at a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The longer this drags on, the less advantage I have."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Where are you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"I'm coming!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo desperately wished he could teleport right in front of his opponents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Che Zhuzi and Lady Spiderweb observed Ning Zhuo's latest movements with keen eyes. They knew the truth: the only brand-new Mystic Iron Puppet in the entire arena was in Ning Zhuo's possession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Without exchanging a word, they watched silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The distance between Ning Zhuo and his two opponents continued to shrink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Unseen by either side, Che Zhuzi manipulated the Grand Formation, altering the Maze's layout. After several adjustments, he drastically reduced the distance between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Again, again!" Lady Spiderweb, despite being a Demonic Cultivator with vast experience, couldn't contain her frustration. She turned to Che Zhuzi, her voice sharp with suspicion. "Why are you so eager for Ning Zhuo to win? Why? Have you known him all along?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Of course not," Che Zhuzi replied, shaking his head. He then glanced at Lady Spiderweb with a hint of amusement. "I'm doing all this because of you, aren't I?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Lady Spiderweb froze, momentarily stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">She wasn't stupid, and soon understood: "So that's how it is. Che Zhuzi wants to clear himself of suspicion and withdraw from this affair. If he wants Ning Zhuo to deal with me, he needs to show sincerity to Ning Zhuo first!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"This time, Che Zhuzi secretly manipulated events, covertly helping Ning Zhuo secure first place. This was his way of laying the groundwork for future interactions with Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"So... I actually helped Ning Zhuo win the trial?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Realizing this, Lady Spiderweb's mouth fell slightly open, her heart twisting with unbearable anguish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo's strength had been glaringly evident during the recent chase. On his own, he would have struggled to claim first place. But now, thanks to Lady Spiderweb's actions and Che Zhuzi's machinations, Ning Zhuo had gained the organizers' covert assistance and was ascending to the throne of first place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Because of me, that little rabbit Ning Zhuo is going to become number one?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"And what's even more infuriating is that I might end up as his slave?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Where was the justice in this?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Lady Spiderweb trembled with rage, feeling utterly humiliated. It was truly unbearable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Under the organizers' deliberate arrangements, Ning Zhuo smoothly encountered his two rivals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Their first reaction was shock. Their second was elation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Found you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Why aren't you running this time... huh?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"That's wrong!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"What's going on? How did he get a brand-new Profound Iron Puppet?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The two Profound Iron Puppets suddenly froze mid-charge, realizing the reality of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The scene was momentarily absurd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">In contrast, Ning Zhuo charged forward like a fierce tiger descending from the mountains, his momentum unstoppable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Retreat was no longer an option.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The two cultivators exchanged a silent, knowing glance: "We'll cover each other and wear him down together!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Their Profound Iron Puppets had already sustained significant damage from previous battles. While they hadn't lost limbs, their joints were jammed, their armor was warped, and their movements were sluggish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo's eyes burned with determination as he adopted the most effective strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Piloting his Profound Iron Puppet, he charged straight at his opponents, unleashing a relentless barrage of attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He prioritized offense over defense, guarding only vital areas and joints. Then, he relentlessly targeted the weaker of the two puppets, enduring blows to land devastating strikes on his chosen target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Like Ning Zhuo, his opponents relied on limited techniques and hoped to exploit their coordinated positioning to drag the battle into a war of attrition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">But Ning Zhuo immediately threw caution to the wind, launching a reckless assault with moves that would inflict a thousand points of damage on his enemies while costing him eight hundred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo's newly equipped Mystic Iron Puppet was quickly battered and scarred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">But the price he paid yielded its reward - he had successfully reduced a fully operational Mystic Iron Puppet to scrap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Excellent. Now it's one-on-one," Ning Zhuo growled, his gaze fixed on his last opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">After a tense silence, both sides launched simultaneous attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Clang...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Mystic Iron Puppets clashed like two heavily armored melee cultivators, their legs and arms moving in a relentless dance of offense and defense, a blur of motion too fast for the eye to follow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In terms of mechanical control, Ning Zhuo remained at a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">His opponent lunged forward, aiming a strike at Ning Zhuo's puppet's knee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo's Iron Puppet ducked and retreated, but when evasion proved impossible, he braced his left shoulder to absorb the blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Thud!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The enemy's powerful, decisive strike crushed Ning Zhuo's puppet's left shoulder, rendering the entire arm useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Seizing the opportunity, Ning Zhuo withdrew, creating distance between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Despite landing a successful blow, the enemy immediately turned and fled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The battle's outcome was now clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Puppet held a distinct advantage and pursued relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Its superior speed allowed it to steadily close the gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The opponent's full-force strike had been aimed at breaking Ning Zhuo's Mystic Iron Puppet's leg, but Ning Zhuo had chosen to sacrifice his own arm rather than let the enemy succeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">This crucial detail, meticulously controlled, further diminished the enemy's chances of turning the tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo caught up to his opponent and, with a flying leap from behind, stomped him to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Caught in the trap, the enemy cultivator's back visibly caved in. Yet instead of turning to fight, he rolled forward along the ground, continuing his desperate escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">His combat experience was considerable; he knew that a direct confrontation would be disastrous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">He executed the most rational tactic, maintaining his composure: "If the opponent obtained a new Mystic Iron Puppet, it means there must be a second, a third... hidden somewhere in this maze."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"All I need to do is find one, exchange it for a new one, and turn the tide!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The strategy was sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The logic behind his deduction seemed flawless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Lady Spiderweb watched the cultivator's frantic flight within the formation, feeling a pang of sorrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">For there was truly only one brand-new Profound Iron Puppet in the entire maze - a puppet Che Zhuzi had prepared specifically for Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"There is none."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"No, no!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Damn it! Why haven't I found a new Mystic Iron Puppet yet?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The cultivator sprinted frantically, desperate for a chance to turn the tide. Lacking any will to fight, he was repeatedly ambushed by Ning Zhuo, who mercilessly pummeled him, further damaging his Mystic Iron Puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Since I've chosen this path, there's no turning back now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Mystic Iron Puppet, where are you hiding?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">This was the cultivator's only hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">After observing for a moment, Che Zhuzi lightly tapped his finger, sending a new Mystic Iron Puppet to a spot just ahead of the cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Changing your mind?" Lady Spiderweb glared at Che Zhuzi, her eyes narrowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Che Zhuzi responded with a knowing smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The cultivator rounded a corner and suddenly froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"There! Finally, there it is!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"I've finally found a brand-new Mystic Iron Puppet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"It wasn't easy..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">At that moment, the cultivator nearly wept with joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">But in the next instant, Ning Zhuo pounced, delivering a flying kick that sent the newly arrived Mystic Iron Puppet crashing to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The cultivator tried to dodge, but his Mystic Iron Puppet was too damaged, leaving him no time to react before he was knocked sprawling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The Cultivator frantically manipulated his Mystic Iron Puppet, attempting to rise, but Ning Zhuo lunged forward, striking the Void Spider Silk with a palm strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The Cultivator swiftly maneuvered the Suspended Threads to evade the blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Seizing the opportunity, Ning Zhuo closed the distance and stomped down with his foot, crushing the puppet's head with a resounding thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">A fatal blow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ning Zhuo had won!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">His dedicated training and meticulous preparation had paid off in this final clash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The Cultivator remained frozen in place, letting out a long sigh after a long moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Clenching his fists, his face twisted with resentment, he muttered, "Damn it! Just a little more... just a little more, and I could have turned the tide!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Lady Spiderweb had observed the entire battle. Her gaze finally settled on Che Zhuzi, her understanding of him deepening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Che Zhuzi had played a cunning game. Sending in the second Mystic Iron Puppet was merely a trap, offering false hope and creating the illusion of fairness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">The Cultivator, seeing the new puppet, had finally stopped fleeing, falling right into Che Zhuzi's scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"How treacherous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"Who would have thought Che Zhuzi, with his hulking frame, could be so cunning and devious? If only I had known..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Lady Spiderweb couldn't bring herself to dwell on it any longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">If only I had known sooner!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Ning Zhuo exhaled a turbid qi. "I never imagined I would actually win in the end."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Through the Mystic Iron Puppet, he glanced at the second Mystic Iron Puppet, which was less than a foot away, and secretly marveled at his extraordinary luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">With the three trials completed, the victor had been decided.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Che Zhuzi formally entered the stage, dismantling all the mazes and gathering the cultivators in one place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">As promised, he awarded Jade Tokens of Identity to the top ten winners. These tokens would grant them a 20% discount on future purchases of Void Spider Silk here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Nearly every cultivator departed the cave dwelling with a length of Void Spider Silk and a complex mix of emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Though they had been manipulated, the Void Spider Silk was undeniably practical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Che Zhuzi had been orchestrating these Cloud-Raising Trials for years, boldly pushing the boundaries of others' psychological endurance to promote his products.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Finally, he turned to Ning Zhuo. "Young man, you've shown remarkable talent. Take your time selecting any magic treasure you desire."</paragraph><br/><br/>
