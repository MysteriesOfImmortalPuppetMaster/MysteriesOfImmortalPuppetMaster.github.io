<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 191: I, Ning Zhuo, Am the Hero of the Ning Family!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"What? You want me to offer up all my Night Wind Soft Iron?" Ning Zhuo's brows furrowed deeply upon hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"I'm just delivering the message," Zheng Hua waved his hand, indicating his innocence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"This is an order from your Ning family's Golden Core Patriarch. Ning Zhuo, my young friend, I don't think you have any room to refuse." "Sigh, according to our previous agreement, this Night Wind Soft Iron was meant for crafting." "Now that there's such a significant material shortage, will your Mechanical Ape still be forged?" Zheng Hua deliberately asked, provoking Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Oh, by the way, it was someone from your Ning family who informed the Golden Core Patriarchs about your possession of the Night Wind Soft Iron." "It was Ning Xiaohui!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Ning Zhuo, my young friend, I think you should yield to the main branch of your family. Otherwise, such schemes and soft knives will continue to come your way." Under Zheng Hua's expectant gaze, Ning Zhuo suddenly relaxed his brows, raised his head, and laughed heartily three times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Good, very good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"To serve the Golden Core Patriarchs of my clan is a blessing that I, Ning Zhuo, have cultivated over eight lifetimes." "Wonderful, truly wonderful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"I must thank Ning Xiaohui. Without her, how could I have such a great opportunity?" Seeing Ning Zhuo laugh so heartily, it was now Zheng Hua's turn to frown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">For a moment, he couldn't tell if Ning Zhuo was gritting his teeth in deep hatred or if he had genuinely come to terms with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zheng Family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Heaven-character Refining Room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Not bad, this Ning Zhuo kid is quite something." Zhu Xuanji put down the jade slip after examining it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Golden Core Patriarch of the Zheng family, standing beside him, picked up the jade slip and infused it with his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The divine sense revealed a list of materials that Ning Zhuo had voluntarily compiled, all of which were Golden Core Stage materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Upon learning that he had to offer up the Night Wind Soft Iron, Ning Zhuo was overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He immediately abandoned his tasks and, in front of the messenger Zheng Hua, listed the materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He expressed: It is his utmost honor to serve the Golden Core Patriarchs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Having luckily attained a high position, he feels as if walking on thin ice and is willing to offer all the Golden Core Stage materials in his possession for the Patriarchs' use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This attitude of absolute submission greatly disappointed Zheng Hua, who then felt a hidden sense of apprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zhu Xuanji and the others, however, were very pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Divine Constable pointed at the jade slip and jokingly scolded, "This Ning Zhuo kid, I know him." "This youngster is good at climbing the ranks; he'll definitely be a great asset in the officialdom in the future." "Ning Jiufan, your Ning family has produced a talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zhu Xuanji, deeply concerned with the Lava Immortal Palace, had an urgent need for the Zheng family's assistance in crafting mechanical weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo's full cooperation made him feel at ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The previous disgust caused by Yuan Dasheng also diminished significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Family's Golden Core Patriarch Ning Jiufan smiled slightly, "To catch the eye of Lord Zhu Xuanji is an honor for our young ones." Zhu Xuanji shook his head, "It's not just me; Fei Si also thinks highly of Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zhou Nongying suddenly said, "Ning Zhuo is indeed quite capable. I heard he, as a branch member, even pulled down the young patriarch of the main branch." His words carried a hint of provocation and mockery towards the Ning Family Patriarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Family Patriarch Ning Jiufan seemed not to notice and vaguely replied, "Hehe, let the young ones handle their own matters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhu Xuanji nodded, pondering, "Ning Zhuo's full support is commendable. He is loyal and dedicated to the family. Therefore, I will reward him with a mechanical construct from the royal treasury, worthy of the Night Wind Soft Iron he offered." "As for the other materials, they are his to keep and take back." "Our royal family has always been fair in rewards and punishments; we would never exploit the people's resources."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Zheng Family's Golden Core Patriarch Zheng Shuangjun laughed heartily, "This Ning Zhuo kid, I once saved his life on Fire Persimmon Mountain." "Now, he offers up the Night Wind Soft Iron to help our family forge mechanical weapons." "Such fateful encounters are truly delightful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Mechanical weapons belong to the Ning family, and they must be rewarded." "Someone,"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Check the treasury and compile a suitable list for Ning Zhuo to choose from as a reward." Zhou Nongying also nodded, "In that case, our Zhou family shouldn't be stingy either." "Let's reward him with a Foundation Establishment level Spirit Gathering Formation Disk."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">It was Ning Family Patriarch's turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Jiufan coughed, thought for a few breaths, then slowly stroked his beard, his expression calm, "Ning Zhuo is a member of our family, and it is his duty to contribute to the family." "Pass on my wordsâ€”Patriarch remembers his contributions to the family!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">As soon as these words were spoken, the other Golden Core cultivators' expressions changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Golden Core Patriarchs' orders were conveyed to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">At his residence, Ning Zhuo laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He thought to himself, "As expected!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He had anticipated the reactions of the Golden Core cultivators, especially Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Therefore, he took this risky move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Zhu Xuanji is a big figure. The actions of such a person are no longer entirely based on personal preferences; they may even go against their own likes and wishes!" In Ning Zhuo's mind, when Zhu Xuanji temporarily set aside the investigation and fully immersed himself in exploring the Immortal Palace, the pressure on him significantly decreased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">By not continuing the investigation, the pressure on Ning Zhuo lessened greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhu Xuanji revealing his true intentions to seize the Lava Immortal Palace made his actions predictable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Once Zhu Xuanji becomes the master of the Immortal Palace, he will become a significant force in Fire Persimmon Immortal City." "Therefore, he allied with the three families. According to future trends, the Meng family will also be a formidable political enemy for Zhu Xuanji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo not only offered up the Night Wind Soft Iron but also voluntarily presented all the Golden Core Stage materials (on the surface), a submissive gesture that Zhu Xuanji urgently needed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Zhu Xuanji was eager to see all three families submit to him, facilitating his current bid for the Immortal Palace master position and future control over the Meng family and Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">So, when Ning Zhuo presented himself as an example,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Even if Zhu Xuanji had many feelings of disgust towards Ning Zhuo, he had to hold his nose and greatly encourage and reward Ning Zhuo at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Zhu Xuanji needed to demonstrate his magnanimity and continue to win over the three families more deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo was a benchmark; by heavily rewarding Ning Zhuo, he could prove to the outside world what kind of person he was, encouraging others to follow Ning Zhuo's example and actively submit to him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Zhu Xuanji, this Divine Constable and outsider, is currently the leader of the three-family alliance." "As long as I win him over, once he takes a stand, the other three families' Golden Core Patriarchs will surely follow!" "Hahaha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Golden Core cultivators are nothing more than this, easily manipulated by me." "I am indeed most suited for the righteous path!" Ning Zhuo was quite pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">What made him happiest was not Zhu Xuanji's royal mechanical construct, nor the rewards from the Zheng and Zhou families, but Ning Family Patriarch Ning Jiufan's words!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In fact, Ning Zhuo believed that the most valuable reward from the Golden Core cultivators was that sentence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He immediately summoned his subordinates and instructed them to spread the wordâ€”Ning Zhuo had received recognition from the Ning Family's Golden Core Patriarch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"From now on, remember, I am a hero."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"I helped our family's Golden Core Patriarch, something not everyone can do. I am a great hero!" "I am the great hero of the Ning family!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The news spread like a whirlwind throughout the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Just a simple sentence caused a significant stir within the Ning family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The main branch was terrified, speculating on the Golden Core Patriarch's intentions behind those words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The branch members were elated, standing tall and proud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo being remembered by the Golden Core Patriarch indicated that the Patriarch favored this young talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">It suggested that the Patriarch expected Ning Zhuo to become an elder in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Previously, Ning Zhuo was highly regarded for his talent, character, and methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Additionally, the main branch's harsh suppression of the branch had accumulated a lot of pent-up energy, which Ning Zhuo cleverly utilized, allowing him to control a large number of Foundation Establishment subordinates, who were all elites of the same level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Now, Ning Zhuo had received recognition from the highest level of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He had gained the acknowledgment of the Ning Family's Golden Core Patriarch, making his future incredibly certain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">As long as he grew, he would undoubtedly hold a position in the Ning family's power structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">And Ning Zhuo was from the branch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The only future big figure from the branch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">This was extremely significant, causing many Ning family members to actively seek out Ning Zhuo the very day the news spread, wanting to serve him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Previously, Ning Zhuo had taken in a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators as subordinates, but that was due to the main branch's mistakes, which Ning Zhuo cleverly exploited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">If those former stewards had the freedom to choose, nine out of ten would prefer to serve as stewards within the family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">They had no choice but to make a living in the black market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">After all, the Ning family was a righteous path clan, and mingling in the black market was a gray area, a necessity of the current situation, not something the righteous path should do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators also wore masks while patrolling, using them as a layer of shame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But now, these Ning family members genuinely saw potential in Ning Zhuo, confirming that he had a bright future and promising prospects, so they actively sought to serve him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo arranged for all these people to work in the black market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Many felt troubled, expressing their willingness to disperse their cultivation and explore the Immortal Palace, following Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Some were willing to work in the mechanical workshop, helping Ning Zhuo create mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo insisted on the black market decision, explaining to them, "We are from the branch, ordinary people." "We are inherently humble, pressed into the dirt by the main branch." "Humility is not shameful; it is an opportunity." "Often, the soil is more nutritious!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"If you want to follow me, you must have this awareness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Go to the black market, experience humility, and step out of the mud, proving we are united."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Think of our former stewards from the branch; they are all Foundation Establishment elites, yet they work in the black market. What are you compared to them?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo's words were powerful and imposing, convincing everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">And this was just the beginning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
