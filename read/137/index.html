<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Cheng Bai's eyes widened with fury as he wildly shook the Soul Shaking Rattle Drum while summoning his Magical Treasure seal.<br/>
<br/>
Summoning Technique‚ÄîOx-Headed Ghost Soldier!<br/>
<br/>
A manifestation of the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier appeared, crashing onto the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
It had the body of a man and the head of an ox, towering over a zhang in height.<br/>
<br/>
With its head lowered and horns pointed forward, it charged towards the Tree Martial Ape.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly maneuvered the Mechanical Ape, narrowly avoiding the attack.<br/>
<br/>
Just as they brushed past the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier, it suddenly reached back and grabbed the tail of the Tree Martial Ape.<br/>
<br/>
The agility of its movements was startling, given its massive frame.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn't retract the ape's tail in time. <br/>
<br/>
Whoosh!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the Mechanical Ape was flung away by the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier, creating a powerful gust that cleared the dust from the collapsed buildings.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai slowly stood up, hiding behind the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier.<br/>
<br/>
His gaze was fixed on Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, primarily focusing on the Blue Azure Iron Armor.<br/>
<br/>
"Mechanical Puppet? Cowardly rats hiding in the shadows!" Cheng Bai's eyes were filled with deep-seated hatred.<br/>
<br/>
With each breath, his injuries healed a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
By the time he finished speaking, his condition had improved significantly, turning from severe injuries to minor ones.<br/>
<br/>
He had recovered!<br/>
<br/>
The crucial breath he fought so hard for had finally stabilized him. "I was so close, so close to being defeated!" The intense fear that filled his heart made his pulse race like never before.<br/>
<br/>
Anger, hatred, relief, and a mix of other emotions surged within him, ultimately causing Cheng Bai to break into a sinister smile. "Hehehe, very good, very good. Two Foundation Establishment rats almost took my life. You did well, very impressive, but also very unfortunate. After earning my praise, now you can die!"<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier and Cheng Bai split into two groups, attacking from both sides.<br/>
<br/>
"No chance left, Little Zhuo. You go, I'll cover!" Sun Lingtong urgently transmitted his voice.<br/>
<br/>
"One wrong move, how hateful!" Ning Zhuo clenched his fists, gritting his teeth, his heart in turmoil, unable to calm down.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai was overwhelmingly powerful, clearly in a different league in terms of combat strength.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo relied on the Immortal City environment, fighting on home ground, holding the geographical advantage.<br/>
<br/>
With the Immortal City Grand Formation, even external Golden Core cultivators were greatly weakened.<br/>
<br/>
At the start of the battle, Ning Zhuo deliberately turned it into a chase, using numerous underground bases to delay and exhaust Cheng Bai's strength.<br/>
<br/>
Although the traps successfully exploded, their practical effect was poor.<br/>
<br/>
If it were a Foundation Establishment cultivator, they would have long been reduced to bones.<br/>
<br/>
Even an ordinary Golden Core cultivator would have been left disoriented and in a sorry state.<br/>
<br/>
But Cheng Bai's combat strength remained intact, and even the golden light shield was unbroken.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Ning Zhuo immediately understood that even if he exhausted the remaining underground bases, it would have little effect.<br/>
<br/>
He decisively switched to ground combat.<br/>
<br/>
Facing Cheng Bai head-on, he fought with all his might, nearly depleting the accumulation of Mechanical Constructs from over a decade, only managing to stabilize the situation and maintain a stalemate.<br/>
<br/>
This was still under the premise that Cheng Bai, being confused by the fate energy field, was intent on capturing Sun and Ning alive, wanting to torture them for amusement.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's true combat strength had not been fully unleashed.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the unfavorable situation, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to blow up the Immortal Formation, triggering its passive defenses.<br/>
<br/>
Most Golden Core Stage cultivators would have been suppressed by now.<br/>
<br/>
However, Cheng Bai displayed immense combat strength, single-handedly resisting the Immortal City Grand Formation, actually wearing down the formation patterns!<br/>
<br/>
This led to Meng Kui's intervention.<br/>
<br/>
The appearance of the Peach Blossom Core met Ning Zhuo's expectations.<br/>
<br/>
This strike truly turned the tide of the battle for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai was severely injured and lost his clarity of mind.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's Chui Xu Ke's Death Whip struck Cheng Bai, but it couldn't break through the golden light shield.<br/>
<br/>
It was only when he pushed the Blue Azure Iron Armor to its limit that he gradually extinguished the protective golden light.<br/>
<br/>
However, when Cheng Bai regained consciousness, the time left for Ning Zhuo was minimal.<br/>
<br/>
Despite Ning Zhuo's desperate efforts, Cheng Bai's endless array of magical tools and treasures delayed him, allowing Cheng Bai to recover.<br/>
<br/>
When Cheng Bai summoned the ghostly avatar of the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier, he regained his footing.<br/>
<br/>
In just a few breaths, his severe injuries turned into minor ones.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's healing methods were astonishing.<br/>
<br/>
He was indeed a true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect, capable of being entrusted with such a mission, his combat strength formidable enough to handle everything on his own!<br/>
<br/>
A trace of despair spread in the hearts of Sun and Ning.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, with an unprecedentedly serious expression, transmitted his voice, "I have a mark planted by Cheng Bai on me, I can't escape. I'll stay behind to cover."<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, give me all your Mechanical Constructs. You go!"<br/>
<br/>
"No!" Ning Zhuo resolutely refused, controlling the Tree Martial Ape to block the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier.<br/>
<br/>
His left hand formed a seal, and a thunder talisman appeared in his palm.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
The thunder shot out from his palm, striking the approaching Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai let the thunder hit him, giving a sinister smile.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he transformed into a mass of ghostly mist, enveloping Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Both of them let out cold snorts, pain piercing their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
The ghostly mist, like a potent toxin, seeped into their mechanisms and bodies, making contact with their souls and causing severe corrosion.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was greatly affected, unable to control the Tree Martial Ape.<br/>
<br/>
The latter's movements slowed down, and it was immediately swept away by the Ox-headed Ghost Soldier.<br/>
<br/>
The Ox-headed Ghost Soldier let out a screech and charged into the ghostly mist.<br/>
<br/>
Its millstone-sized fist struck heavily on the Blue Azure Iron Armor.<br/>
<br/>
The Blue Azure Iron Armor flew backward like a cannonball, knocking down a dozen houses along the way before embedding into a wall.<br/>
<br/>
The Blue Azure Iron Armor was severely damaged, with Ning Zhuo's forearm almost completely exposed.<br/>
<br/>
A large chunk was missing from the chest, and the helmet was full of cracks.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't be surprising if it completely shattered in the next second.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss!" Ning Zhuo couldn't care less about his own injuries and immediately searched for Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong lay in the rubble of a house ahead, struggling desperately but unable to move, pinned down by bricks and a half-broken beam.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo moved the Blue Azure Iron Armor and hurried over.<br/>
<br/>
He bent down, trying to clear the debris and drag Sun Lingtong out.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, Sun Lingtong's face suddenly twisted in a grimace, his five fingers like blades, stabbing into Ning Zhuo's abdomen through the large gap in the armor.<br/>
<br/>
"Bo-Boss..." Ning Zhuo was caught off guard and severely injured.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's expression changed, alternating between ferocity and sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
"I-I've been possessed by a ghost, run, quickly run!" he shouted.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai stood on the shoulder of the Ox-headed Ghost Soldier, looking down at the two from above: "How does it feel to be betrayed by your brother?"<br/>
<br/>
"Chui Xu Ke, you excel in mechanical arts, while I excel in ghost control. Your brother is already under my control. Kill him quickly, or you'll be killed by him, hahaha!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's heart trembled violently.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, the toxic ghostly mist rose again, enveloping Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
The intense pain struck once more.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai took out the Soul Shaking Rattle Drum, beating it continuously.<br/>
<br/>
This caused Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong to bleed from their seven orifices, adding insult to injury, leaving them completely powerless to resist.<br/>
<br/>
"Ghost Soldier, go take their lives!" Cheng Bai called softly.<br/>
<br/>
The Ox-headed Ghost Soldier let out a low roar, charging forward like a meteor, its momentum terrifying.<br/>
<br/>
Its millstone-sized fist smashed down, a blow that would surely end the lives of Ning and Sun on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Strong, too strong!<br/>
<br/>
When Cheng Bai regained his composure and his mind was clear, he displayed extremely excellent tactical acumen.<br/>
<br/>
The Ox-headed Ghost Soldier applied pressure from the front, the toxic ghostly mist targeted the Blue Azure Iron Armor.<br/>
<br/>
The ghost possession left Ning Zhuo in a dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
His verbal threats were not meant to torment further but were a cover to smoothly execute his methods, creating an opportunity for the Ox-headed Ghost Soldier to deliver a fatal blow.<br/>
<br/>
The massive body of the Ox-headed Ghost Soldier cast a shadow of death, completely enveloping Ning and Sun.<br/>
<br/>
It was difficult for the two to even stand, let alone defend or dodge.<br/>
<br/>
In Ning Zhuo's perception, time suddenly slowed down significantly.<br/>
<br/>
This intense premonition of death was not the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Once, during a street battle in the black market.<br/>
<br/>
He was too young and made a grave mistake of negligence in the heat of battle, falling into a perilous situation and almost getting killed.<br/>
<br/>
It was Sun Lingtong who flashed out and, in a moment of desperation, used his own body to block the knife for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed in shock at that time, his face filled with panic.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong waved his hand, pulled out the dagger lodged in his chest, and blood immediately soaked his clothes: "It's nothing!"<br/>
<br/>
"Boss..." Ning Zhuo felt immense guilt and self-blame.<br/>
<br/>
If it weren't for his own carelessness, Sun Lingtong wouldn't have suffered such a severe injury.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong tapped his fingers to stop the bleeding: "Hehe, Little Zhuo, don't be sad. You call me boss, so what's it worth for the boss to take a knife for his brother?"<br/>
<br/>
Now.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's hand knife was deeply embedded in Ning Zhuo's abdomen.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes widened in anger, his spirit eyes bleeding, wishing he could kill himself immediately!<br/>
<br/>
A giant fist smashed down, the sinister wind howled, and the terrifying killing intent was suffocating.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo raised his head, glaring fiercely at the Bull-headed Ghost Soldier.<br/>
<br/>
The Bull-headed Ghost Soldier's attack was actually blocked.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a figure stood in front of Ning Zhuo like a mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes gradually widened, looking at the figure in front of him, his heart exclaiming: "Yuan Dasheng?!"<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical ape that intercepted the Bull-headed Ghost Soldier stood tall, its eyes emitting green light in all directions, its powerful spirit radiating in all directions, its imposing manner awe-inspiring and inviolable.<br/>
<br/>
It was precisely:<br/>
<br/>
Even if betrayed, the will remains unshaken, the righteous bones and golden resolve are hard to quell.<br/>
<br/>
Having experienced life and death, the spirit remains, returning only to fulfill the righteous act!<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng slightly turned, suddenly spoke, his voice low and powerful: "My lord... I have arrived!"<br/>
<br/>
As if traversing a lifetime, crossing life and death, at the critical moment, Yuan Dasheng was reborn, his spirit fully restored, coming to aid!<br/>
<br/>
"Yuan Dasheng can speak?!" Ning Zhuo was astonished.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, he felt that there was no longer any barrier between him and Yuan Dasheng, his control over it even clearer and more delicate than before.<br/>
<br/>
Without a doubt, this was a qualitative change!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo instantly understood: it was his full effort to save Sun Lingtong, disregarding his own life, that greatly aligned with Yuan Dasheng's spirit.<br/>
<br/>
"But how did it suddenly start speaking?"<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng spoke again: "My lord, what are your orders?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo suppressed his doubts and pointed at Cheng Bai, "Take him down!"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, sir!" Yuan Dasheng charged forward.<br/>
<br/>
A Minotaur Ghost Soldier roared and blocked his path.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng directly overturned the Minotaur Ghost Soldier, his momentum overwhelmingly fierce.<br/>
<br/>
"What is this mechanical puppet?" Cheng Bai sensed something was amiss and hurriedly retreated.<br/>
<br/>
Poisonous ghost mist sprayed along the way, attempting to hinder Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng pressed forward relentlessly, ignoring the ghost mist.<br/>
<br/>
He continued his charge!<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai frantically shook his Soul-Rattling Drum.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng remained unresponsive!<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's heart raced, his mouth dry.<br/>
<br/>
He activated his Innate Talent Nether Death Eye.<br/>
<br/>
What he discovered was that Yuan Dasheng‚Äîhad no soul!<br/>
<br/>
"How can it possess such intelligence without a soul?!" Cheng Bai couldn't comprehend.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng closed in, and Cheng Bai desperately activated numerous magical artifacts and treasures, striking Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's entire body surged with vigorous blood energy, thanks to the blood oil bottle Ning Zhuo had previously installed!<br/>
<br/>
He displayed exquisite martial arts, either blocking or deflecting, forcibly withstanding the various magical artifacts and treasures, and reached Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
He attacked fiercely and relentlessly, not caring for his own life.<br/>
<br/>
"The problem is‚Äîit's just a mechanical construct, what life does it have to care for?!" Cheng Bai was once again brutally beaten.<br/>
<br/>
But this time was different from before.<br/>
<br/>
His mind was clear, and although his combat power was suppressed, he could still fully exert his current limits.<br/>
<br/>
However, Yuan Dasheng, in life, could tear apart a half-step Golden Core Stage fire snake with his bare hands.<br/>
<br/>
Now, his mechanical body was even stronger than before, and with abundant blood energy, he could freely use the Demonic Blood Vein Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng possessed Golden Core Stage combat power! And he was less suppressed by the formation than Cheng Bai!<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai retreated step by step, unable to form a coherent defense.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it, the Golden Threaded Garment is shattered and can't protect me. How is this mechanical puppet stronger than those Golden Core Body Cultivators?!" The rhythm of the battle was firmly controlled by Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage gradually turned into a victory.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai spat blood, severely injured once again.<br/>
<br/>
He desperately wanted to escape Yuan Dasheng, but he couldn't.<br/>
<br/>
The Immortal City Grand Formation had already been activated, prohibiting all Void Traversing Talismans.<br/>
<br/>
Most of Cheng Bai's magical artifacts, treasures, and various spells were aimed at souls.<br/>
<br/>
This was extremely awkward when used against Yuan Dasheng!<br/>
<br/>
"Brother, is this mechanical ape your creation?" Sun Lingtong was dumbfounded.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo himself was also incredulous. "It seems... yes." He hadn't anticipated that Yuan Dasheng's true combat power would be so high!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought to himself, "This time, it seems not only has its spirit been awakened, but it has also reached a higher level. Yuan Dasheng's martial skills are more agile and natural than before, as if it had never died." Yuan Dasheng swung his fist, smashing Cheng Bai's forehead.<br/>
<br/>
He clung to Cheng Bai, twisted his body, and broke Cheng Bai's left arm backward.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's monkey tail coiled around Cheng Bai, causing him to lose balance.<br/>
<br/>
He extended his leg and struck horizontally, directly collapsing Cheng Bai's knee!<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's magical artifacts and treasures struck Yuan Dasheng, riddling him with wounds.<br/>
<br/>
The battle between the two sides was extremely fierce.<br/>
<br/>
But the problem was, Cheng Bai was of flesh and blood, while Yuan Dasheng was merely a mechanical shell.<br/>
<br/>
In such a prolonged fight, Cheng Bai was at a severe disadvantage!<br/>
<br/>
He tried to distance himself, making every effort, but all ended in failure.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai excelled at controlling ghost generals and using spells and magical artifacts for long-range attacks.<br/>
<br/>
This was his primary combat style.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn't a body cultivator; his main defense relied on the Golden Threaded Garment, but after Ning Zhuo's repeated attacks, it was already shattered.<br/>
<br/>
In the clash between Cheng Bai and Sun Ning, there were no weaknesses.<br/>
<br/>
But facing Yuan Dasheng, his weaknesses immediately became apparent.<br/>
<br/>
"If this continues, I'll die!"<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai never expected the situation to deteriorate so rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, he was forced to the edge of a cliff, with no choice but to fight desperately.<br/>
<br/>
Nether Fire Engulfment!<br/>
<br/>
His entire body ignited with pale blue Nether Fire, a flame so cold it could burn everything to ashes.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai frantically activated his Netherworld Death Eyes and cast the Yellow Springs spell upon himself.<br/>
<br/>
The Yellow Springs sizzled under the burning Nether Fire, producing a large amount of steam, temporarily protecting Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
But Yuan Dasheng did not have such protection; his entire body material quickly disintegrated under the fire.<br/>
<br/>
"Not good!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed, extremely tense.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's combat power was severely affected, rapidly declining.<br/>
<br/>
If Cheng Bai were allowed to recover, the previous scenario would inevitably repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng, however, let out a long howl to the sky!<br/>
<br/>
His entire skeleton suddenly shone brightly, emitting dazzling golden light.<br/>
<br/>
Under the protection of the golden light, Yuan Dasheng was almost reduced to a skeleton.<br/>
<br/>
But he still moved freely!<br/>
<br/>
Immortal Talent‚ÄîRighteous Bone Golden Firmness!!<br/>
<br/>
This was still Ning Zhuo's first time witnessing Yuan Dasheng display his immortal prowess.<br/>
<br/>
"Why can Yuan Dasheng still use his immortal prowess in this new mechanical body?" Ning Zhuo's curiosity was piqued.<br/>
<br/>
The terrifying Nether Fire couldn't burn Yuan Dasheng to ashes!<br/>
<br/>
He once again charged in front of Cheng Bai, their faces almost touching.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng fiercely unleashed his martial skill.<br/>
<br/>
He viciously reached forward.<br/>
<br/>
With his vital point grasped, Cheng Bai was utterly horrified, his heart filled with a chilling fear.<br/>
<br/>
"Wait..."<br/>
<br/>
Shattering Sun Hand!<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng had practiced countless times in his previous life, shattering wooden balls, stone balls, iron balls... and now, human balls!<br/>
<br/>
What does it matter if it's the Golden Core Stage? Even immortals would hold their heads in pain.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Cheng Bai wasn't a body cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets, his face turning deathly pale, and he let out a long, desperate howl: "Ohhh‚Äî!"<br/>
<br/>
If he were like Han Ming, who dual cultivated the Immortal Zombie Transformation Technique, it would be a different story.<br/>
<br/>
But now...<br/>
<br/>
Pain, excruciating pain, unbearable pain, pain beyond endurance!<br/>
<br/>
He directly fainted from the agony!!</div>
