<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Cheng Bai's eyes widened with fury as he wildly shook the Soul Shaking Rattle Drum while summoning his Magical Treasure seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Summoning Techniqueâ€”Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A manifestation of the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier appeared, crashing onto the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">It had the body of a man and the head of an ox, towering over a zhang in height.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">With its head lowered and horns pointed forward, it charged towards the Tree Martial Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo hurriedly maneuvered the Mechanical Ape, narrowly avoiding the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Just as they brushed past the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier, it suddenly reached back and grabbed the tail of the Tree Martial Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The agility of its movements was startling, given its massive frame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo couldn't retract the ape's tail in time. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In the next moment, the Mechanical Ape was flung away by the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier, creating a powerful gust that cleared the dust from the collapsed buildings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Cheng Bai slowly stood up, hiding behind the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">His gaze was fixed on Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, primarily focusing on the Blue Azure Iron Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Mechanical Puppet? Cowardly rats hiding in the shadows!" Cheng Bai's eyes were filled with deep-seated hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">With each breath, his injuries healed a bit more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">By the time he finished speaking, his condition had improved significantly, turning from severe injuries to minor ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He had recovered!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The crucial breath he fought so hard for had finally stabilized him. "I was so close, so close to being defeated!" The intense fear that filled his heart made his pulse race like never before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Anger, hatred, relief, and a mix of other emotions surged within him, ultimately causing Cheng Bai to break into a sinister smile. "Hehehe, very good, very good. Two Foundation Establishment rats almost took my life. You did well, very impressive, but also very unfortunate. After earning my praise, now you can die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In the next moment, the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier and Cheng Bai split into two groups, attacking from both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"No chance left, Little Zhuo. You go, I'll cover!" Sun Lingtong urgently transmitted his voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"One wrong move, how hateful!" Ning Zhuo clenched his fists, gritting his teeth, his heart in turmoil, unable to calm down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Cheng Bai was overwhelmingly powerful, clearly in a different league in terms of combat strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo relied on the Immortal City environment, fighting on home ground, holding the geographical advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">With the Immortal City Grand Formation, even external Golden Core cultivators were greatly weakened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">At the start of the battle, Ning Zhuo deliberately turned it into a chase, using numerous underground bases to delay and exhaust Cheng Bai's strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Although the traps successfully exploded, their practical effect was poor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">If it were a Foundation Establishment cultivator, they would have long been reduced to bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Even an ordinary Golden Core cultivator would have been left disoriented and in a sorry state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But Cheng Bai's combat strength remained intact, and even the golden light shield was unbroken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo immediately understood that even if he exhausted the remaining underground bases, it would have little effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He decisively switched to ground combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Facing Cheng Bai head-on, he fought with all his might, nearly depleting the accumulation of Mechanical Constructs from over a decade, only managing to stabilize the situation and maintain a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">This was still under the premise that Cheng Bai, being confused by the fate energy field, was intent on capturing Sun and Ning alive, wanting to torture them for amusement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Cheng Bai's true combat strength had not been fully unleashed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Seeing the unfavorable situation, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to blow up the Immortal Formation, triggering its passive defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Most Golden Core Stage cultivators would have been suppressed by now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">However, Cheng Bai displayed immense combat strength, single-handedly resisting the Immortal City Grand Formation, actually wearing down the formation patterns!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">This led to Meng Kui's intervention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The appearance of the Peach Blossom Core met Ning Zhuo's expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This strike truly turned the tide of the battle for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Cheng Bai was severely injured and lost his clarity of mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo's Chui Xu Ke's Death Whip struck Cheng Bai, but it couldn't break through the golden light shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">It was only when he pushed the Blue Azure Iron Armor to its limit that he gradually extinguished the protective golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">However, when Cheng Bai regained consciousness, the time left for Ning Zhuo was minimal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Despite Ning Zhuo's desperate efforts, Cheng Bai's endless array of magical tools and treasures delayed him, allowing Cheng Bai to recover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">When Cheng Bai summoned the ghostly avatar of the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier, he regained his footing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In just a few breaths, his severe injuries turned into minor ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Cheng Bai's healing methods were astonishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He was indeed a true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect, capable of being entrusted with such a mission, his combat strength formidable enough to handle everything on his own!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">A trace of despair spread in the hearts of Sun and Ning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Sun Lingtong, with an unprecedentedly serious expression, transmitted his voice, "I have a mark planted by Cheng Bai on me, I can't escape. I'll stay behind to cover."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Little Zhuo, give me all your Mechanical Constructs. You go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"No!" Ning Zhuo resolutely refused, controlling the Tree Martial Ape to block the Ox-Headed Ghost Soldier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">His left hand formed a seal, and a thunder talisman appeared in his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The thunder shot out from his palm, striking the approaching Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Cheng Bai let the thunder hit him, giving a sinister smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The next moment, he transformed into a mass of ghostly mist, enveloping Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Both of them let out cold snorts, pain piercing their hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The ghostly mist, like a potent toxin, seeped into their mechanisms and bodies, making contact with their souls and causing severe corrosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo was greatly affected, unable to control the Tree Martial Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The latter's movements slowed down, and it was immediately swept away by the Ox-headed Ghost Soldier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Ox-headed Ghost Soldier let out a screech and charged into the ghostly mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Its millstone-sized fist struck heavily on the Blue Azure Iron Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Blue Azure Iron Armor flew backward like a cannonball, knocking down a dozen houses along the way before embedding into a wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Blue Azure Iron Armor was severely damaged, with Ning Zhuo's forearm almost completely exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A large chunk was missing from the chest, and the helmet was full of cracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">It wouldn't be surprising if it completely shattered in the next second.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Boss!" Ning Zhuo couldn't care less about his own injuries and immediately searched for Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Sun Lingtong lay in the rubble of a house ahead, struggling desperately but unable to move, pinned down by bricks and a half-broken beam.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo moved the Blue Azure Iron Armor and hurried over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He bent down, trying to clear the debris and drag Sun Lingtong out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">But in the next moment, Sun Lingtong's face suddenly twisted in a grimace, his five fingers like blades, stabbing into Ning Zhuo's abdomen through the large gap in the armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Bo-Boss..." Ning Zhuo was caught off guard and severely injured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong's expression changed, alternating between ferocity and sorrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"I-I've been possessed by a ghost, run, quickly run!" he shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Cheng Bai stood on the shoulder of the Ox-headed Ghost Soldier, looking down at the two from above: "How does it feel to be betrayed by your brother?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Chui Xu Ke, you excel in mechanical arts, while I excel in ghost control. Your brother is already under my control. Kill him quickly, or you'll be killed by him, hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo's heart trembled violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The next moment, the toxic ghostly mist rose again, enveloping Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The intense pain struck once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Cheng Bai took out the Soul Shaking Rattle Drum, beating it continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">This caused Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong to bleed from their seven orifices, adding insult to injury, leaving them completely powerless to resist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Ghost Soldier, go take their lives!" Cheng Bai called softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Ox-headed Ghost Soldier let out a low roar, charging forward like a meteor, its momentum terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Its millstone-sized fist smashed down, a blow that would surely end the lives of Ning and Sun on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Strong, too strong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">When Cheng Bai regained his composure and his mind was clear, he displayed extremely excellent tactical acumen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Ox-headed Ghost Soldier applied pressure from the front, the toxic ghostly mist targeted the Blue Azure Iron Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The ghost possession left Ning Zhuo in a dilemma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">His verbal threats were not meant to torment further but were a cover to smoothly execute his methods, creating an opportunity for the Ox-headed Ghost Soldier to deliver a fatal blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The massive body of the Ox-headed Ghost Soldier cast a shadow of death, completely enveloping Ning and Sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">It was difficult for the two to even stand, let alone defend or dodge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In Ning Zhuo's perception, time suddenly slowed down significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">This intense premonition of death was not the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Once, during a street battle in the black market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He was too young and made a grave mistake of negligence in the heat of battle, falling into a perilous situation and almost getting killed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">It was Sun Lingtong who flashed out and, in a moment of desperation, used his own body to block the knife for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Boss!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed in shock at that time, his face filled with panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Sun Lingtong waved his hand, pulled out the dagger lodged in his chest, and blood immediately soaked his clothes: "It's nothing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Boss..." Ning Zhuo felt immense guilt and self-blame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">If it weren't for his own carelessness, Sun Lingtong wouldn't have suffered such a severe injury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sun Lingtong tapped his fingers to stop the bleeding: "Hehe, Little Zhuo, don't be sad. You call me boss, so what's it worth for the boss to take a knife for his brother?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Sun Lingtong's hand knife was deeply embedded in Ning Zhuo's abdomen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Sun Lingtong's eyes widened in anger, his spirit eyes bleeding, wishing he could kill himself immediately!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">A giant fist smashed down, the sinister wind howled, and the terrifying killing intent was suffocating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo raised his head, glaring fiercely at the Bull-headed Ghost Soldier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Bull-headed Ghost Soldier's attack was actually blocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Suddenly, a figure stood in front of Ning Zhuo like a mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo's eyes gradually widened, looking at the figure in front of him, his heart exclaiming: "Yuan Dasheng?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The mechanical ape that intercepted the Bull-headed Ghost Soldier stood tall, its eyes emitting green light in all directions, its powerful spirit radiating in all directions, its imposing manner awe-inspiring and inviolable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">It was precisely:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Even if betrayed, the will remains unshaken, the righteous bones and golden resolve are hard to quell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Having experienced life and death, the spirit remains, returning only to fulfill the righteous act!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Yuan Dasheng slightly turned, suddenly spoke, his voice low and powerful: "My lord... I have arrived!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">As if traversing a lifetime, crossing life and death, at the critical moment, Yuan Dasheng was reborn, his spirit fully restored, coming to aid!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Yuan Dasheng can speak?!" Ning Zhuo was astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">At this moment, he felt that there was no longer any barrier between him and Yuan Dasheng, his control over it even clearer and more delicate than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Without a doubt, this was a qualitative change!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo instantly understood: it was his full effort to save Sun Lingtong, disregarding his own life, that greatly aligned with Yuan Dasheng's spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"But how did it suddenly start speaking?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Yuan Dasheng spoke again: "My lord, what are your orders?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo suppressed his doubts and pointed at Cheng Bai, "Take him down!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Yes, sir!" Yuan Dasheng charged forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">A Minotaur Ghost Soldier roared and blocked his path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Yuan Dasheng directly overturned the Minotaur Ghost Soldier, his momentum overwhelmingly fierce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"What is this mechanical puppet?" Cheng Bai sensed something was amiss and hurriedly retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Poisonous ghost mist sprayed along the way, attempting to hinder Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Yuan Dasheng pressed forward relentlessly, ignoring the ghost mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">He continued his charge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Cheng Bai frantically shook his Soul-Rattling Drum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Yuan Dasheng remained unresponsive!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Cheng Bai's heart raced, his mouth dry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">He activated his Innate Talent Nether Death Eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">What he discovered was that Yuan Dashengâ€”had no soul!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"How can it possess such intelligence without a soul?!" Cheng Bai couldn't comprehend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Yuan Dasheng closed in, and Cheng Bai desperately activated numerous magical artifacts and treasures, striking Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Yuan Dasheng's entire body surged with vigorous blood energy, thanks to the blood oil bottle Ning Zhuo had previously installed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">He displayed exquisite martial arts, either blocking or deflecting, forcibly withstanding the various magical artifacts and treasures, and reached Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">He attacked fiercely and relentlessly, not caring for his own life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"The problem isâ€”it's just a mechanical construct, what life does it have to care for?!" Cheng Bai was once again brutally beaten.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">But this time was different from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">His mind was clear, and although his combat power was suppressed, he could still fully exert his current limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">However, Yuan Dasheng, in life, could tear apart a half-step Golden Core Stage fire snake with his bare hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Now, his mechanical body was even stronger than before, and with abundant blood energy, he could freely use the Demonic Blood Vein Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Yuan Dasheng possessed Golden Core Stage combat power! And he was less suppressed by the formation than Cheng Bai!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Cheng Bai retreated step by step, unable to form a coherent defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"Damn it, the Golden Threaded Garment is shattered and can't protect me. How is this mechanical puppet stronger than those Golden Core Body Cultivators?!" The rhythm of the battle was firmly controlled by Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">The advantage gradually turned into a victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Cheng Bai spat blood, severely injured once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">He desperately wanted to escape Yuan Dasheng, but he couldn't.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">The Immortal City Grand Formation had already been activated, prohibiting all Void Traversing Talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Most of Cheng Bai's magical artifacts, treasures, and various spells were aimed at souls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">This was extremely awkward when used against Yuan Dasheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">"Brother, is this mechanical ape your creation?" Sun Lingtong was dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Ning Zhuo himself was also incredulous. "It seems... yes." He hadn't anticipated that Yuan Dasheng's true combat power would be so high!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Ning Zhuo thought to himself, "This time, it seems not only has its spirit been awakened, but it has also reached a higher level. Yuan Dasheng's martial skills are more agile and natural than before, as if it had never died." Yuan Dasheng swung his fist, smashing Cheng Bai's forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">He clung to Cheng Bai, twisted his body, and broke Cheng Bai's left arm backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Yuan Dasheng's monkey tail coiled around Cheng Bai, causing him to lose balance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">He extended his leg and struck horizontally, directly collapsing Cheng Bai's knee!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">Cheng Bai's magical artifacts and treasures struck Yuan Dasheng, riddling him with wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">The battle between the two sides was extremely fierce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">But the problem was, Cheng Bai was of flesh and blood, while Yuan Dasheng was merely a mechanical shell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">In such a prolonged fight, Cheng Bai was at a severe disadvantage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">He tried to distance himself, making every effort, but all ended in failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Cheng Bai excelled at controlling ghost generals and using spells and magical artifacts for long-range attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">This was his primary combat style.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">He wasn't a body cultivator; his main defense relied on the Golden Threaded Garment, but after Ning Zhuo's repeated attacks, it was already shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">In the clash between Cheng Bai and Sun Ning, there were no weaknesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">But facing Yuan Dasheng, his weaknesses immediately became apparent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">"If this continues, I'll die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="349">Cheng Bai never expected the situation to deteriorate so rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="351">At this moment, he was forced to the edge of a cliff, with no choice but to fight desperately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="353">Nether Fire Engulfment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="355">His entire body ignited with pale blue Nether Fire, a flame so cold it could burn everything to ashes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="357">Cheng Bai frantically activated his Netherworld Death Eyes and cast the Yellow Springs spell upon himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="359">The Yellow Springs sizzled under the burning Nether Fire, producing a large amount of steam, temporarily protecting Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="361">But Yuan Dasheng did not have such protection; his entire body material quickly disintegrated under the fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="363">"Not good!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed, extremely tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="365">Yuan Dasheng's combat power was severely affected, rapidly declining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="367">If Cheng Bai were allowed to recover, the previous scenario would inevitably repeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="369">Yuan Dasheng, however, let out a long howl to the sky!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="371">His entire skeleton suddenly shone brightly, emitting dazzling golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="373">Under the protection of the golden light, Yuan Dasheng was almost reduced to a skeleton.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="375">But he still moved freely!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="377">Immortal Talentâ€”Righteous Bone Golden Firmness!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="379">This was still Ning Zhuo's first time witnessing Yuan Dasheng display his immortal prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="381">"Why can Yuan Dasheng still use his immortal prowess in this new mechanical body?" Ning Zhuo's curiosity was piqued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="383">The terrifying Nether Fire couldn't burn Yuan Dasheng to ashes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="385">He once again charged in front of Cheng Bai, their faces almost touching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="387">Yuan Dasheng fiercely unleashed his martial skill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="389">He viciously reached forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="391">With his vital point grasped, Cheng Bai was utterly horrified, his heart filled with a chilling fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="393">"Wait..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="395">Shattering Sun Hand!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="397">Yuan Dasheng had practiced countless times in his previous life, shattering wooden balls, stone balls, iron balls... and now, human balls!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="399">What does it matter if it's the Golden Core Stage? Even immortals would hold their heads in pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="401">Moreover, Cheng Bai wasn't a body cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="403">Cheng Bai's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets, his face turning deathly pale, and he let out a long, desperate howl: "Ohhhâ€”!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="405">If he were like Han Ming, who dual cultivated the Immortal Zombie Transformation Technique, it would be a different story.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="407">But now...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="409">Pain, excruciating pain, unbearable pain, pain beyond endurance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="411">He directly fainted from the agony!!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
