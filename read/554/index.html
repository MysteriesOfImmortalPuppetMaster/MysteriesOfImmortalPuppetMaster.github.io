<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"The Technique of the Nine Heavens Fire Dragon..." Lone Wolf muttered with a slight astonishment as he saw his wolf pack obliterated by the flaming dragons. "It seems Ning Zhuo's strength is even greater than what the intelligence suggested."<br/>
<br/>
Three fiery dragons circled Ning Zhuo, creating an ocean of flames that incinerated every living creature nearby while leaving him untouched. Achieving such precise and controlled devastation required extraordinary mastery.<br/>
<br/>
After all, offensive spells like this could easily harm the caster if mishandled. <br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo's counterattack demonstrated exquisite control, effortlessly converting offense into defense. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone familiar with spell cultivation understood how challenging this truly was.<br/>
<br/>
"The report indicated Ning Zhuo was merely sixteen or seventeen, primarily training in mechanical puppetry. How did he find the time to cultivate spells so diligently?"<br/>
<br/>
It was precisely this miscalculation that had caused Lone Wolf to inadvertently sacrifice a significant number of his wolf soldiers. <br/>
<br/>
As Lone Wolf hesitated, wondering whether to dispatch another batch of wolves against Ning Zhuo, increased pressure from the frontline diverted his attention. He abandoned his earlier thought, dedicating himself entirely to commanding the main army.<br/>
<br/>
The three fiery dragons soared freely - one paving the way ahead, the other two protecting Ning Zhuo on each side. Their fierce flames remained meticulously distanced from him. This mastery was made possible by Ning Zhuo's spiritual technique of the Five-Organ Temple: the Fire Heart Shrine.<br/>
<br/>
Much of Ning Zhuo's spiritual awareness resided within this shrine, where the deity statue bore his own appearance. Controlling fire elements through the shrine elevated every fire-based spell he cast to a superior level of precision.<br/>
<br/>
Benefiting from the three fire dragons that he summoned with Golden Core level strength to open the battlefield, Ning Zhuo continually deployed mechanical puppets, reorganizing his forces. He commanded the three dragons while simultaneously managing the puppet army, maneuvering fluidly across the battlefield<br/>
<br/>
Holding a single position might yield temporary local advantages, but moving across the battlefield allowed him to face weaker, scattered opponents. The fiery dragons' sustained attacks at the heart of the battlefield grew increasingly powerful until they eventually exhausted themselves entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Strategy: Feign Strength to Conceal Weakness!<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan again drew her bow, targeting the Bloodshadow Cave Master. <br/>
<br/>
The Bloodshadow Cave Master was taken aback: "?!"<br/>
<br/>
Alarmed and startled, Bloodshadow hastily rode a wave of blood-red light, darting beneath the battlefield. "Northern Abyss Freezing Ray! Separation and Death Flames!"<br/>
<br/>
Dozens of freezing rays and deadly flames simultaneously struck towards Bloodshadow.<br/>
<br/>
Although the rear defensive walls of the two small military encampments hadn't suffered severe breaches, half of the heavy weaponry remained functional, maintaining modest combat capabilities. <br/>
<br/>
Though Bloodshadow could withstand their attacks, he had no intention of wasting valuable Nascent Soul strength fighting mere artillery. The intensifying battle made him increasingly fatigued, compelling him to conserve as much energy as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, without hesitation, he descended to the ground, hoping artillery would think twice before attacking again.<br/>
<br/>
After all, friendly forces densely populated the ground. Random artillery fire risked accidental casualties, significantly harming morale and weakening overall combat strength.<br/>
<br/>
However, Bloodshadow Cave Master held no such concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Upon landing, he immediately faced attacks from all directions. With a cold snort, he scattered hundreds of blood beads outward, instantly clearing the area around him.<br/>
<br/>
Bloodshadow opened his arms wide and took a deep breath. In the next moment, streams of blood energy surged from the corpses and wounds of fallen cultivators nearby, rapidly absorbed into his body. <br/>
<br/>
The blood energy enveloping Bloodshadow intensified once more.<br/>
<br/>
Both enemy and ally quickly realized his tactic and cursed vehemently, launching concentrated fire against him. <br/>
<br/>
Bloodshadow snorted again and pointed forward, unleashing a devastating beam of blood-red light that pierced several barbarian warriors rushing ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately afterward, he soared back into the sky, breaking into the walls of the encampment once more.<br/>
<br/>
The blood beam he unleashed continued its lethal path, eventually striking diagonally into the rear of Ning Zhuo’s mechanical puppet forces.<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, it annihilated every puppet along its trajectory, the residual blood poison corrupting nearby puppets as well.<br/>
<br/>
Decisively, Ning Zhuo abandoned all puppets tainted by the blood poison, swiftly preserving the rest of his forces.<br/>
<br/>
“Lord of the Blood Shadow Cave!” Sun Lingtong whispered fiercely from within the Dragon Head Cabin, his face filled with hatred.<br/>
<br/>
He hadn't forgotten how, during their earlier reconnaissance mission to the Six Caves Sect headquarters, they were ambushed by the Lord of the Blood Shadow Cave.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo wore a serious expression as he reflected again, “The heated battlefield and omnipresent threat of death push all cultivators to their limits. <br/>
<br/>
Lone Fang is no exception, nor is the Lord of the Blood Shadow Cave!”<br/>
<br/>
“Fortunately, I’m positioned in the mid-zone rather than at the battlefield’s core.”<br/>
<br/>
Recently, Ning Zhuo had been diligently cultivating within the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, dramatically strengthening his physical foundation, allowing him to sustain greater enhancements from the Warrior's Return Technique.<br/>
<br/>
However, from the recent battles, it was clear that the baseline of combat power for Golden Core cultivators remained around Ning Zhuo’s level. <br/>
<br/>
The central battlefield was evidently a meat grinder reserved for Nascent Soul cultivators. <br/>
<br/>
Bai Ling had already decided there was no need to charge into that chaos willingly.<br/>
<br/>
Golden Core cultivators instead followed their puppet armies, steadily approaching Lin You.<br/>
<br/>
Mo Yechen flew low across the battlefield, riding atop his demonic pet, Fourth Brother.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the fierce conflict, his previous opponent, Li Sichu, had long since been replaced by the demonic cultivator Bai Ling. <br/>
<br/>
Bai Ling’s original form was a white crane, a creature naturally gifted in aerial maneuvering. The two clashed in the air while simultaneously deflecting occasional attacks from the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The ground held fewer troops, making the aerial battlefield primarily a domain for the powerful. <br/>
<br/>
Battles on the ground were less intense due to difficulties casting spells without collateral damage. However, aerial battles easily enabled concentrated spell attacks.<br/>
<br/>
When cultivators descended into low altitudes, they faced relentless spell bombardment from enemies below with ease. <br/>
<br/>
Only the strongest among them could withstand such concentrated fire. <br/>
<br/>
Whoever controlled the sky inevitably exerted significant pressure upon ground enemies. <br/>
<br/>
Thus, ever since the conflict erupted, both armies continuously fought fiercely over control of the aerial battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Art - Crane Cry Across the Plains!<br/>
<br/>
Bai Ling suddenly halted mid-air and released a piercing cry towards the heavens.<br/>
<br/>
Tremendous sound waves swiftly surged in all directions. <br/>
<br/>
Mo Yechen dodged quickly, but other soldiers were thrown into disarray, with many weaker cultivators perishing immediately. <br/>
<br/>
Others fell victim to qi deviation under the sonic assault.<br/>
<br/>
Advance!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly pressed forward, deploying another wave of puppets. <br/>
<br/>
Bai Ling’s divine attack ravaged his Sea of Consciousness, leaving him pale-faced.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Flame of Mind Restoration!<br/>
<br/>
Forming seals, he ignited a flame within his Sea of Consciousness. <br/>
<br/>
Under its scorching heat, all harmful thoughts planted by Bai Ling’s divine art burned away entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Conversely, Bai Ling’s own thoughts remained perfectly intact. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo exhaled heavily, stabilizing once more.<br/>
<br/>
Before the Battle of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, neutralizing Bai Ling’s divine art would have been troublesome. The Buddha Heart Demon Seal activated only at the most critical junctures.<br/>
<br/>
Yet now, Ning Zhuo could effortlessly handle this issue using his own capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Reaching into his storage bag, Ning Zhuo replenished the ranks of his puppet army with a single gesture. A quick divine sense check revealed half his reserves were already depleted - a loss he had never experienced before.<br/>
<br/>
Extending his divine sense further, Ning Zhuo frustratingly realized his proactive assault had unintentionally widened the gap between himself and Lin You.<br/>
<br/>
The constant battlefield pressure and unexpected attacks forced Ning Zhuo and his puppets into repeated evasions, inadvertently altering their path. The outcome resembled drifting with the tides, ironically distancing him from his intended target.<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, Ning Zhuo’s resolve remained unshaken. <br/>
<br/>
Drawing a deep breath, he rallied himself for another assault.<br/>
<br/>
Three-layered Flame Shield! <br/>
<br/>
Earthen Armor, Rock Barrier!<br/>
<br/>
Protective fire and earth elemental spells enhanced his defenses, while the Warrior's Return Technique steadily boosted Ning Zhuo’s combat power.<br/>
<br/>
Vines erupted from underground, immediately strangling a dozen barbarian cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Earth Element - Earth Python!<br/>
<br/>
A massive brown-yellow serpent, robust and agile like an ancient tree trunk, swept across the battlefield, hurling away several boar demons and clearing the path ahead for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Fire Element - Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Three fire dragons reappeared, roaring fiercely and igniting an expansive field of flames, dissipating the encirclement around Ning Zhuo and turning his crisis into safety.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm still growing stronger!" Ning Zhuo's heart was thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
The current might of his Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique was significantly stronger than before. <br/>
<br/>
The fire dragons blazed a path, and the cultivators unable to retreat screamed in agony as they perished in the sea of flames. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s dazzling advance through the battlefield finally attracted serious attention.<br/>
<br/>
Three enemy Golden Core cultivators stood in his path, unleashing a combined technique that filled the world with blade radiance.<br/>
<br/>
The puppet constructs shattered into countless fragments under the blade light. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's puppet army was instantly halved!<br/>
<br/>
With a cold snort, Ning Zhuo stomped his foot and clapped his hands together in front of his chest.<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element - Forest Realm Arrival!<br/>
<br/>
Towering ancient trees erupted from the ground, forming a vast forest that transformed the battlefield around Ning Zhuo in mere breaths.<br/>
<br/>
The ancient trees formed a natural barrier to withstand the sharp blade lights but were cut into several pieces. The blade lights slightly weakened after minimal consumption.<br/>
<br/>
Taking advantage of this respite, Ning Zhuo replenished his puppet constructs and led the charge again!<br/>
<br/>
Various five-element spells were unleashed, enveloping the enemy cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
The three enemy Golden Core Cultivators quickly cast defensive spells, struggling to fend off, looking disheveled.<br/>
<br/>
Just as they were about to counterattack, Ning Zhuo opened his mouth and spat.<br/>
<br/>
Metal Element Spell - Profound Metal Slash!<br/>
<br/>
A sharp golden thunderbolt instantly pierced through an enemy cultivator, ending his life before he could even cry out.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining two Golden Core Cultivators stood stunned.<br/>
<br/>
Repeating the maneuver, Ning Zhuo spat out two more golden thunderbolts, directly killing them all. Huff, huff, huff!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gasped heavily; the consumption of spiritual energy was minimal but had reached a critical level. <br/>
<br/>
Quickly swallowing medicinal pills, he restored his spiritual energy reserves.<br/>
<br/>
The Profound Metal Slash was a metal-element offensive technique he had heavily practiced before mastering the Metal Element Lung Palace. <br/>
<br/>
Its power was intense, but its energy consumption correspondingly minimal.<br/>
<br/>
When unleashing the spell, he simultaneously focused on the Metal Element Lung Palace, exponentially enhancing its destructive power and killing all of Ning Zhuo’s enemies.<br/>
<br/>
Witnessing such overwhelming strength, nearby enemy cultivators began proactively retreating. Having asserted dominance, Ning Zhuo felt the resistance from behind notably diminish.<br/>
<br/>
He pressed forward relentlessly, rapidly closing the distance between himself and Lin You.<br/>
<br/>
"Stop right there!" An eagle-headed demon cultivator screeched sharply, stepping forward to intercept. <br/>
<br/>
This was a formidable Golden Core enemy!<br/>
<br/>
"I hail from Wind Pillar Peak, talented enough to catch the eye of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, becoming Elder Long's right-hand man. <br/>
<br/>
Wind Element - Hundred Blade Storm!"<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, the enemy thrust his palms forward, releasing a torrent of spiritual energy that formed hundreds of swirling wind blades aimed at Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
He hastily activated defensive spells for self-protection.<br/>
<br/>
Yet his surrounding puppet army suffered devastating losses, with barely one in ten surviving.<br/>
<br/>
This enemy’s strength was extraordinary, a peak-level threat to Ning Zhuo. With a single strike, he nearly annihilated the entire puppet army.<br/>
<br/>
Military Tactic - Hero's Return Technique. <br/>
<br/>
His battle prowess surged once more.<br/>
<br/>
Puppet - Heavy-armored Blood Ape: Dasheng. <br/>
<br/>
Puppets - Shadow Blade: Night Tiger.<br/>
<br/>
With a solemn expression, he recognized the enemy's overwhelming power. Facing him alone was feasible, but breaking through required powerful reinforcements.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, he had reinforcements!<br/>
<br/>
Thus, he decisively unleashed the two fierce generals at his command.<br/>
<br/>
One figure stood nearly two zhang tall, heavily armored with precious materials such as Scarlet Sun Copper, Myriad Strike Profound Iron, and Adamantine, emphasizing robust defense - Yuan Dasheng. <br/>
<br/>
The other figure was shorter, only four chi in height, with an ominous pale body inlaid with silvery-white streaks, bearing a tiger's head and human body - domineering and ruthless - Meng Yehu.<br/>
<br/>
Wind blades surged forth again.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng stepped forward, like a city wall, shielding Ning Zhuo thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng raised both arms vertically, guarding his face as he squatted slightly, saying, "My lord, this subordinate will protect you thoroughly."<br/>
<br/>
"Mm." Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, glancing sideways towards Meng Yehu, and said heavily, "Go."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yehu replied respectfully, "Yes, Father God."<br/>
<br/>
He responded obediently, activating a talisman to conceal his form, quietly advancing towards Ning Zhuo's enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng grew solemn, narrowed his eyes, pricked up his ears, and utilized divine consciousness, swiftly casting a spell - Wind Walk: Listening Wind, Discerning Position!<br/>
<br/>
Amid countless chaotic sounds, he accurately captured Meng Yehu's footsteps. <br/>
<br/>
Immediately, several wind blades erupted, forcing Meng Yehu into defense and revealing his hidden form. Meng Yehu's surprise attack failed, yet Ning Zhuo wasn't willing to simply submit.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng had no choice but to flap his powerful winds, retreating from his original position to avoid directly enduring magical bombardment.<br/>
<br/>
Several exchanges occurred rapidly, creating a battlefield so intense that other cultivators from both sides dared not approach, actively maintaining distance.<br/>
<br/>
After multiple rounds of attack and defense, Ning Zhuo and Chen Lingfeng both gasped heavily.<br/>
<br/>
"Truly deserving of the reputation as one of the strongest Golden Core cultivators in the Thousand Peak Forest Alliance!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng was slightly shocked: "Merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator, yet able to fight me evenly. Is this the peak talent among the human race…?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yet, I am also a genius among demonkind!" Chen Lingfeng felt his competitive spirit ignited.<br/>
<br/>
From childhood, his exceptional talent had been recognized by the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King. <br/>
<br/>
It was always a source of his pride - his innate gift: Mad Wind Bones!<br/>
<br/>
A chaotic wind erupted from his bones, surged through his 43,877 pores, stirring his hair into disorder, and causing his eyes to blur slightly.</div>
