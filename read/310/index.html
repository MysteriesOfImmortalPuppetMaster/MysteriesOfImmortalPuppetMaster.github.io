<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 310: Golden Branches and Jade Leaves</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">At the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain, the magma boiled and flames roared fiercely. The Lava Immortal Palace, like a solitary island, was being engulfed by wave after wave of demon beast hordes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Meng Kui's spiritual power manifested as a giant hand, entangling with the Nascent Soul-level fire snakes and flame lizards, engaging in a relentless battle. The fire snakes and flame lizards hissed continuously, burning through or tearing apart the spiritual hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Nascent Soul-level demon ape, however, ignored the spiritual hand and focused its attacks on the Lava Immortal Palace. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Boom! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Under the assault of the Fire Fusion Demon Ape, the command platform crumbled into useless debris. It let out a triumphant howl, savoring the pleasure of revenge from the destruction of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In the depths of the clouds and smoke, Meng Kui's expression remained calm, his gaze penetrating deeply. The one commanding the other beast hordes was the royal lineage. The Fire Fusion Demon Ape's attack points were guided by him through the spiritual hand and other means. Compared to the fire snakes and flame lizards, the demon ape possessed higher intelligence. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">However, in the end, they were still demon beasts, not demon cultivators. Demon cultivators, upon gaining wisdom, were no different from ordinary people. The demon beasts, proud and self-satisfied, never realized they were being used by Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">The Nascent Soul-level attacks, when landing on the Lava Immortal Palace, were suppressed to the Golden Core stage. Zhu Zhen and other Golden Core stage cultivators had long ascended into the air, continuously intercepting powerful attacks to ensure the safety of the mechanical constructs. However, their numbers were far too few compared to the onslaught. Many attacks landed within the inner circle of the Lava Immortal Palace, causing varying degrees of damage to the mechanical constructs, some even collapsing entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">While fighting, Zhu Zhen actively searched for the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon. So far, he hadn't found any unusual defensive forces. However, he did notice that the demon beast tide was about to reach the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest. This presented him with the opportunity to fulfill Zhu Xuanji's instructions!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">In the depths of the clouds and smoke, his eyes pierced through the sky, observing the entire battlefield. The battle intent in his heart burned like the flames filling his vision, making him restless. "Great Purity Palace, Great Purity Palace... why haven't you appeared yet?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">Rumbling... The Nascent Soul-level clashes shook the entire Fire Persimmon Mountain. Each collision caused the desk in front of Zhu Hou to tremble slightly. He instinctively looked towards the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain, a fleeting image of Zhu Xuanji flashing in his mind: "I wonder how little ji is doing over there." He smiled slightly, then set aside his minor worries: "If little ji can't succeed, who else in the Zhu royal family can? The child of the past is now the pillar of our Zhu family. Time flies like an arrow..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">Zhu Hou couldn't help but recall the scenes of teaching the young Zhu Xuanji. In the royal capital, on the desk were sixteen enlightenment diagrams. Zhu Hou pointed at each one, asking Zhu Xuanji to explain the insights he had gained from them. Zhu Xuanji responded fluently. Zhu Hou was greatly satisfied and praised, "Xuanji, you possess the Heaven-Piercing Eyes, a talent that can best perceive the essence. Therefore, comprehending enlightenment diagrams often reveals truths unseen by others. Coupled with your intelligence and excellent comprehension, understanding these diagrams is the best cultivation path for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">The young Zhu Xuanji raised his little face, "Uncle, if my Heaven-Piercing Eyes are so strong, why are they only considered a high-grade talent and not an supreme one? Are the supreme talents, also known as immortal talents, stronger than my Heaven-Piercing Eyes? Hmph, I don't believe it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">Zhu Hou laughed, "The level of talent is relative. Is an supreme talent always stronger than a lower talent? Not necessarily, it depends on the specific situation. The so-called levels are just our summaries. Perhaps one day, we will find a better way to utilize the Heaven-Piercing Eyes, elevating its grade to supreme."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">Zhu Xuanji pursued further, "How do you develop talent, Uncle? I heard that you just need to keep using it." Zhu Hou shook his head, "Constant use is not the essence of developing talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">"little ji, before answering this question, let me ask you: what does cultivation mean?" Zhu Xuanji answered without hesitation, "Cultivation is about learning the true principles of the world through practice." Zhu Hou nodded, "Correct. The rise and fall of the sun and moon, the cycle of life and death, are the principles governing the operation and extinction of all things in the world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">"It is by learning and mastering these principles that cultivators can break free from mortal constraints, extend their lifespan, and possess extraordinary powers." At this point, Zhu Hou pointed to the enlightenment diagrams on the desk, "These diagrams are the work of cultivators skilled in painting, recording certain principles of the world. You know about the scriptures, right? Those scriptures are the work of cultivators skilled in calligraphy, recording their understanding of cultivation principles for others to comprehend. In this world, all talents are actually parts of these principles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">"Some talents contain more principles and are easier for us to utilize, so we classify them as higher talents. Conversely, they are lower talents. The Heaven-Piercing Eyes are classified as a superior talent because they contain more principles but are limited to auxiliary applications."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">"Using the Heaven-Piercing Eyes often reveals the essence of things, but the results of this ability are heavily influenced by the cultivator's own knowledge and understanding." Seeing Zhu Xuanji somewhat dejected, Zhu Hou comforted him, "Although talents are graded, they are only the starting point. In the long run, it still depends on the cultivator's own development."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">"If you can understand the principles contained within a talent and master them, you can elevate the talent to a divine ability!" "Whether it's a divine ability or a talent, they are powerful means to help cultivators fight beyond their level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">"Of course, not only talents can transform into divine abilities. The essence of a divine ability is the understanding and mastery of principles and truths. Even an ordinary spell can be researched by a cultivator to discover its principles and elevate it to a divine ability."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">"The enlightenment diagrams you see all have the potential to be elevated to divine abilities." "Last time, I asked you to carefully select from these diagrams and choose the main direction for your future cultivation. What is your choice now, little Ji?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">Zhu Xuanji did not hesitate, pointing to two of the diagrams, "Uncle, I choose these two." Zhu Hou looked closely, "Hmm, not bad."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">"If you study these two diagrams deeply, you might master two martial divine abilities, namely the Golden Mountain Stance and the Jade Pillar Posture. Why did you choose them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">Zhu Xuanji revealed a look of longing and told Zhu Hou that he had read many heroic tales and often fantasized about becoming an unparalleled general on the battlefield, dedicating himself to his family and country. And the standard for those generals was these two divine abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Zhu Xuanji: "Since I was very young, I heard teachers say that our Southern Bean Kingdom royal family lacks formidable generals. In many situations, we rely on the body cultivators of other families. If I can succeed, our Zhu family will have its own formidable general."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">"Good child, good child," Zhu Hou praised, "Being able to consider the bigger picture shows your awareness. Since that's the case, I might as well make an effort to obtain a royal divine ability for you as protection."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">Zhu Xuanji was curious. Zhu Hou explained, "This is an official divine ability called Golden Branches and Jade Leaves. It can be cultivated individually or applied to others for protection. Whether the cultivator or the one receiving the divine ability, they must be members of the nobility, royal family, imperial family, or even the emperor's family. The current grand elder of our Zhu family has mastered this divine ability."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">"Since you've chosen the Golden Mountain Stance and the Jade Pillar Posture, the Golden Branches and Jade Leaves divine ability is most suitable for you. In the future, if you can integrate the three divine abilities, their power will increase dramatically. If you can fully comprehend and merge the three divine abilities into one, you can elevate them to a level beyond divine abilities!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Lava Immortal Palace. The Secret Pavilion of Opportunities. The five-elements qi engulfed Zhu Xuanji, followed closely by the full-force attack of Rudie Niang, unleashing a quasi-Golden Core-level offensive. As the five-elements qi dissipated, a majestic figure stood unmoved!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Rudie Niang's attack created countless spatial fragments, dazzling and dense, yet not a single piece penetrated Zhu Xuanji's body. At this moment, Zhu Xuanji's body expanded to over nine feet, his muscles bulging, but wrapped in a black-edged red robe, forming a martial attire. He stood like a pillar supporting the sky, proudly upright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">His entire body was enveloped in golden qi, faintly revealing a mountain peak. At this moment, on the mountain peak, a forest grew. Each tree was adorned with golden branches and jade leaves, swaying in the wind, producing a continuous crisp sound of clinking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">Official divine abilityâ€”Golden Branches and Jade Leaves! "Three divine abilities?!" Ning Zhuo and others were all shocked to their core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Zhu Xuanji slowly turned, his voice resonating like a great bell, "Ning Zhuo, you have greatly disappointed me!" "I tried to guide you onto the right path, yet you still chose the wrong road, colluding with the shadow demon cultivators." "You have let down Li Leifeng, let down my expectations, and even more so, let down your family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">At this point, Zhu Xuanji swept his arm horizontally, and in an instant, a fierce wind howled. Wherever his arm reached, the colorful fragments disintegrated and scattered in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Yang Chanyu witnessed this scene, her pupils contracted sharply, thinking, "What a joke! This is a quasi-Golden Core-level formation, yet it was so easily dismantled?!" Rudie Niang's face turned pale, and she directly said to Ning Zhuo, "Doctor, we should run! This person is terrifying!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">How to run? Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly. Once he stepped through the door, he couldn't escape. He was also within the range of the Official Techniques Sealed Barrier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">The more critical the situation, the calmer Ning Zhuo's heart became. He revealed a faint smile, his gaze sharp, fearlessly meeting Zhu Xuanji's eyes, "Lord Zhu, you have no evidence, so don't slander me lightly. This time, I am competing openly with you for the Lava Immortal Palace for the sake of my family! The reason for assisting the Void Sect is merely a strategic alliance, a matter of interests."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">"This is precisely my active response to the king's decree to recruit talents." Zhu Xuanji's expression darkened, reprimanding, "Sharp-tongued, eloquent."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
