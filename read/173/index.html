<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 173: Discovery of an Inside Traitor?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The "Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon" that Ning Zhuo exchanged for was quickly read through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The book, from Luo Yunzi's perspective, narrated his misfortunes, wandering across the world, and experiencing various local customs and traditions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The story was quite interesting, and Ning Zhuo felt he gained a lot of insight into different regions' customs and cultures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">However, regarding fate energy and techniques to alter fate, it only touched the surface without any in-depth exploration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This was already the best book Ning Zhuo could exchange for at the All-Book Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The other books related to fate energy that he looked at were even less informative than the "Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Content about fate energy is not widely known and is only circulated within a small range. From what I can see, the Celestial Bureau has the most knowledge about these secrets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Although the Celestial Bureau is a super sect, it is sparsely populated and extremely mysterious. According to Luo Yunzi's account, he once studied at the Celestial Bureau, but the 'Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon' does not mention it at all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"However, Luo Yunzi could change others' fortunes within a certain period and range, giving them wealth, official positions, romantic luck, and so on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"But these spells all have drawbacks. Once specific taboos are touched, the results will be even worse." Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">His previous plan fell through; he couldn't rely on the "Record of Clouds Falling to the Horizon" to elevate the Life Thread Divine Ability to a qualitative change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But it wasn't without gains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">At least he understood that changing others' fortunes had many drawbacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"So, Meng Kui, your Sitting Mountain Observation Technique can create different fate energy fields. What are its drawbacks?" Ning Zhuo pondered this question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">For him, Meng Kui was also a competitor for the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Reality is cruel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Just because Meng Kui is at the Nascent Soul Stage and Ning Zhuo is only at the Qi Refining Stage doesn't mean they don't have a competitive relationship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">When the final moment comes, Ning Zhuo will inevitably face Meng Kui of the Nascent Soul Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"But if I can find the weaknesses of his divine abilities before then, it will undoubtedly increase my chances of winning." Ning Zhuo continued his arduous cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">His Divine Sea cultivation had reached its limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">His Qi Sea cultivation had also reached its peak, but his mana needed purification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">His Essence Sea cultivation still had room for improvement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo's cultivation speed was quite impressive through the extensive consumption of spirit food and spirit pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"However, even if my Essence Sea cultivation reaches the peak of the sixth transformation, I still can't break through the current bottleneck."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo was almost certain that the difficulty behind the second Demonic Gate was the same as the Buddhist Gate and Taoist Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">If nothing unexpected happened, he would still be stuck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Behind the second gate is a special checkpoint that issues the Five Elements Transformation Disk. The more proficient I am in the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique, the better the quality of the Transformation Disk I will receive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Referring to the coffin room of the first Buddhist Gate, I might only get one chance to choose, so I must be extremely cautious. I need to elevate my proficiency in the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique as much as possible before choosing the Transformation Disk." The Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique required diligent practice, and the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra even more so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">According to Ning Zhuo's assessment, this technique was the key to breaking the deadlock!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">After all, compared to the Taoist Gate and Demonic Gate, the Buddhist Gate was his advantageous path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Thus, Ning Zhuo focused on the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra, followed by the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique, and then the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He meticulously scheduled his eating, drinking, and sleeping time down to a single finger snap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo's diligence and effort left those around him in awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"I always thought I was hardworking, but compared to Brother Zhuo, I'm nothing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"To be so diligent and tireless, no wonder Brother Zhuo has achieved what he has today. I am thoroughly convinced."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Brother Zhuo is so outstanding and works so hard. What right do we have to slack off?" Ning Yong, Ning Chen, and others were greatly inspired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">They all took Ning Zhuo as their role model and began their own intense cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">As Ning Zhuo's status continued to rise, his constant success brought about a surge in his influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Without any deliberate actions, Ning Zhuo could directly change the mindset of those around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Upon discovering that Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others were emulating him, Ning Zhuo decisively said to them, "We are all at the peak of the third layer of Qi Refining. To explore deeper into the Immortal Palace, we must fully enhance our proficiency in mechanical constructs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"How about this, I can introduce you to the Flying Disc Workshop."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Once there, you can refine various mechanical constructs and accumulate hands-on experience, which will be very beneficial to you." Ning Yong, Ning Chen, and others had no objections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Since Ning Zhuo said so, he must have his reasons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">These young cultivators chose to listen, and none refused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Thus, Ning Zhuo introduced them to Chen Cha.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo also gave Chen Cha new mechanical blueprints: "This is my modified version of the mechanical fire bomb, a new model primarily used for combat." Chen Cha took a look and nodded in satisfaction, "The materials are much more solid than last time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo smiled, "It's mainly for the Monkey Head Gang. This kind of combat mechanism needs to be reliable, as it concerns lives." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The days flew by.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">That afternoon, as scheduled, Ning Zhuo took a short break to listen to the reports from Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Many of the stewards dismissed by the main branch had been recruited by Ning Zhuo, with Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian being the most outstanding among them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo appointed these two as leaders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">After unifying the black market and setting rules, Ning Zhuo almost became a hands-off manager.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">For the past half month, it had been maintained by the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace and the recruitment order attracted many outsiders, continuously flooding into Fire Persimmon Immortal City, causing the black market's business to boom tenfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">As the black market's revenue increased, so did the difficulty of management.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Fortunately, these Ning family cultivators were all at the Foundation Establishment Stage, and they were not ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators—those selected as stewards by the main branch naturally had their specialties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">These cultivators were the elite among the Foundation Establishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Their use of icebox spells was also very suitable for capturing people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">When cultivators were frozen, they often retained their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">According to Sun Lingtong's arrangements and forces, they couldn't manage the current black market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">However, the former stewards of the Ning family managed the black market in an orderly manner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"These days, you have all worked hard." After listening to the report, Ning Zhuo immediately proceeded with the distribution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He had already investigated the specific salaries of these Foundation Establishment cultivators when they served as stewards for the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo took out 80% of the black market's revenue to distribute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This reached the monthly salary standard these Foundation Establishment cultivators once had.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Since it's the end of the month, let's distribute it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Xiangguo said, "Young Master Zhuo, it seems there's a mistake. We only worked for half a month, but this is a month's salary." Ning Zhuo nodded, "The extra part is a welcome gift from me to everyone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"In the future, every clan member who joins us will receive half of their monthly salary as an entry gift in their first month." Ning Xiangqian was delighted, "This is a good idea, everyone will like it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo continued, "Next, based on individual evaluations and achievements, we will calculate this month's bonus."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"According to the rules I previously set, we will conduct detailed calculations. The process and results of the calculations will be presented to the cultivators for verification."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"This bonus will be distributed at the end of next month, along with next month's salary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"In short, salaries are distributed at the end of the month, and bonuses are distributed at the end of the following month. This way, it will be convenient for those who have disputes about the bonus calculation to report and correct them." Ning Xiangqian nodded repeatedly, "This is a good method. This way, everyone working in the black market will at least feel the same as working in the family. The more contributions they make, the more they get, which is very fair!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Xiangguo, however, frowned slightly, "This way, there will be almost no surplus from the black market's revenue. Young Master Zhuo, you should keep some for yourself. Forgive me for being blunt, but you are distributing too much." Ning Xiangqian was taken aback and, after thinking carefully, also nodded, "It seems to be the case."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo smiled and waved his hand, "It's just the first month. I believe we will do better in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"There will be more outsiders coming to the black market."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"In fact, as long as the Lava Immortal Palace has not recognized a master, there will be an endless stream of cultivators coming from afar."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"They come from afar, and even if they can't gain the recognition of the palace spirit and enter the Immortal Palace, most of them will choose to live in the Lava Immortal Palace for a while."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"These people will greatly stimulate the business in the Immortal City, and the black market is growing larger and larger, isn't it?" Ning Xiangqian grinned, "That's true!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Xiangguo, however, said with a deep gaze, "But Young Master Zhuo, do you really want to keep controlling the black market?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"I personally think this is not a long-term plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"We need legitimate businesses. After all, the black market is not the righteous path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Holding onto it for too long and getting too deeply involved will harm the reputation of our Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"For now, it's still acceptable. People will think: the four major forces have reached a consensus, allowing the Ning family to take over the black market for the stability of the Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"In the future, once there are fewer outsiders and the Immortal Palace recognizes a master, we won't be able to hold onto this territory and will have to give it up." Ning Xiangqian immediately frowned, puzzled, "Why can't we hold onto it? The black market is something we fought for."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Clearly, Ning Xiangguo was more strategic, able to see the bigger picture and think long-term.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Xiangguo continued, "Therefore, I sincerely suggest, Young Master Zhuo, that you don't need to be so generous. Take advantage of this rare opportunity to gather more resources and keep them for yourself. When we withdraw from the black market in the future, at least we will have a reserve of resources."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo looked deeply at Ning Xiangguo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">During this period, although Ning Zhuo kept a low profile, he still used his fragmented time every day to interact with the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators one-on-one as much as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">In this process, Ning Zhuo also gathered more real information about each of them through the Turtle Breath Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Now, most of the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators already had the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian were among them.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
