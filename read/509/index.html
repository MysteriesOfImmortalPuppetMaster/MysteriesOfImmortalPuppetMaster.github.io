<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Upon hearing Shuang Jing's arrangement of Du Tiechuan's words, Liu Er dared not respond.<br/>
<br/>
With a bitter expression, he said, "Commander Du is a dignified Soul Formation level expert, holding a high position of power. Every move he makes is accompanied by wind and thunder. A small figure like me can only follow closely behind, drifting with the current."<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing nodded, pointing at Liu Er, "You are of lowly status, merely a half-blood between human and demon. If you want to scheme, you cannot just drift with the current; you must identify your mountain to rely on."<br/>
<br/>
"Since you have come to seek my help, considering our past camaraderie, I will give you a chance."<br/>
<br/>
"Regarding the matter of heavy armor quotas, I can go against Du Tiechuan's wishes and assist you. However..."<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing dragged out his words, not continuing further.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, understanding the cue, quickly clasped his hands, indicating his willingness to cooperate and asking Shuang Jing to command as he pleased.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing smiled slightly, "Come, serve me tea."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er: "It is my honor!"<br/>
<br/>
He picked up the teapot with both hands, poured the tea, and then raised the cup with both hands, offering it to Shuang Jing.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing did not take it, still sitting upright, and sneered, "Liu Er, you are somewhat confused."<br/>
<br/>
"In terms of status, I am of the royal surname, a noble. You, a mere half-blood, even if you drape yourself in the tiger skin of the Blood Slaughter Dynasty, compared to me, are like mud to clouds."<br/>
<br/>
"In terms of cultivation strength, I am at the Nascent Soul level, while you are merely a small Golden Core."<br/>
<br/>
"Considering the current situation, you are the one seeking my help, urgently in need of heavy armor. Without it, your Three Generals Camp cannot bear the Iron Flow Plains strategy and will inevitably become cannon fodder, buried on the battlefield."<br/>
<br/>
"Is that clear enough?"<br/>
<br/>
"In such a situation, you serve me tea, yet you still stand?"<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing coldly stared at Liu Er, the atmosphere in the room suddenly turning icy.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er stood frozen, his facial muscles twitching slightly.<br/>
<br/>
His heart trembled, a wave of humiliation surging within him.<br/>
<br/>
Gritting his teeth, he forced a smile, "Shuang Jing, i am very sorry! Please excuse my lack of judgment, please... Sir, please have some tea."<br/>
<br/>
His legs trembled slightly as he slowly knelt down, offering the tea to Shuang Jing.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing then smiled, "Now that's more like it."<br/>
<br/>
He took the cup, took a sip, and immediately spat it out on the floor in front of Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
"It's a bit cold."<br/>
<br/>
"You know, tea should be drunk while it's hot. Once it passes that moment, it becomes hard to swallow."<br/>
<br/>
"In life, when an opportunity arises, one must strive with all their might to seize it firmly. Otherwise, missing it could lead to a lifetime of regret."<br/>
<br/>
"You understand this principle, don't you?"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er nodded, "Thank you for the advice, sir, I will remember it."<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing sneered again, "Just remembering isn't enough. Clean the floor first."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was stunned once more.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing narrowed his eyes, looking down at Liu Er who was kneeling on the ground, "What? Someone as lowly as you is just right for this cleaning job."<br/>
<br/>
"You should know, many people desire this opportunity, dreaming of it day and night, yet they cannot obtain it."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er nodded repeatedly, a smile appearing on his face, "Yes, Shuang sir your reprimand is more than justified! I am so sorry for letting you wait and will clean it right away."<br/>
<br/>
With that, he bent down and began wiping the floor with his sleeve.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, the floor was spotless.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing threw his head back and laughed heartily, pointing at Liu Er, "You performed well."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm starting to see some potential in you."<br/>
<br/>
"Alright."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, do one more thing, and I will help you purchase the heavy armor with the quota."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Shuang Jing finally relent, Liu Er exhaled a breath of relief and hurriedly asked what the task was.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing said, "It's simple. Merge your Three Generals Camp into my White Jade Camp as auxiliary troops. Especially your strategist, I have high hopes for him."<br/>
<br/>
"He has close ties with the Red Flower Camp. You need to persuade your strategist to join us as well."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Liu Er about to speak, Shuang Jing immediately raised his hand to stop him, "Of course."<br/>
<br/>
"I just want to see your performance."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm not really keen on having you merge in."<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest, having you mud-legged folks join would require a lot of effort on my part to persuade my own generals."<br/>
<br/>
"But since you are seeking my patronage, you naturally need to show your loyalty."<br/>
<br/>
"If you don't pledge allegiance to me, why should I offend Du Tiechuan for you?"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er fell into a long silence.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, he finally clasped his hands and bowed deeply, "Shuang Jing sir, my two sworn brothers and I advance and retreat together. I am confident in persuading them to join you."<br/>
<br/>
"But our strategist comes from a prominent family and has always invested heavily to support the Three Generals Camp."<br/>
<br/>
"In fact, without him, our financial resources would never have reached this level."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, he has fought alongside us, forming deep bonds of camaraderie."<br/>
<br/>
"If I were to scheme against him, wouldn't that be repaying kindness with enmity?"<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing sneered, "Liu Er, you should slap yourself! Are you saying that pledging allegiance to me is scheming against Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
"Is joining my ranks such a despicable act?"<br/>
<br/>
"Enough to make you repay kindness with enmity?"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er quickly apologized.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing's gaze turned icy, scanning Liu Er up and down, "Now, I give you two choices."<br/>
<br/>
"The first choice, you agree to my final request and act accordingly. Forget about heavy armor; I can even arrange for you to become an official in the court."<br/>
<br/>
"The second choice, you refuse me. Although it would waste my time and emotions, I won't make things difficult for you. Slap yourself thirty times, and I will forgive you. Then, go back to where you came from."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was silent for a moment, then suddenly raised his right hand and began slapping his own face fiercely.<br/>
<br/>
Slap, slap, slap...<br/>
<br/>
He did not stop, truly slapping himself thirty times, until his cheeks were swollen and blood seeped from the corner of his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing snorted coldly, clearly displeased, "I was starting to think well of you, but now I see you are of such small caliber."<br/>
<br/>
"A mere half-blood, of lowly birth and status, yet you still want to have morals?"<br/>
<br/>
"Haha."<br/>
<br/>
"Simply laughable!"<br/>
<br/>
"You are not worthy of my affection. Continue living in your lowliness, and you will eventually regret this foolishness and pay the price."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, get out."<br/>
<br/>
"Allow me to take my leave!" Liu Er bowed deeply and slowly retreated, only turning to lift the tent flap and exit the commander's tent after reaching the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
As Liu Er left, Ning Zhuo finally felt the restraint disappear.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately pushed the door open and bowed to Shuang Jing, "Shuang Jing sir, why go to such lengths? With your caliber, how could you not tolerate an outsider Golden Core cultivator?"<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing looked deeply at Ning Zhuo, "So, Ning Zhuo, what do you say?" Ning Zhuo did not hesitate, bowing again, "Please forgive me, but I must take my leave!"<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha." Shuang Jing laughed coldly three times, pointing at the tent flap. Out of respect for Ning Zhuo's status as the son-in-law of the Supreme General, he did not say "get out."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately left, running all the way to catch up with Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
"Liu sir, Liu sir!" Ning Zhuo called out urgently.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er turned and saw Ning Zhuo chasing after him from behind, his heart stirred.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not hide anything from him, recounting his experiences in Shuang Jing's tent.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er laughed heartily, "The strategist is wise and intelligent, thinking even further ahead than I did."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, "It's a pity that Shuang Jing sir looks down on us from his high position, causing you, General, to suffer such humiliation."<br/>
<br/>
"Not at all." Liu Er shook his head directly, "What does this amount to?"<br/>
<br/>
"As Shuang Jing sir said, many cultivators desire such an opportunity but cannot obtain it. Someone of my status gaining such a chance is truly fortunate."<br/>
<br/>
"It's just that I am unable to grasp such fortune."<br/>
<br/>
"That is my problem."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also shook his head, grasping Liu Er's arm, pleading, " You have treated me with great kindness, and I am deeply grateful!"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er's other hand also grasped Ning Zhuo's arm, "Strategist! Although there is a significant age difference between us, we share a deep bond. The survival of the Three Generals Camp until now is largely due to your efforts."<br/>
<br/>
"My earlier words were not empty or insincere; they came from the heart."<br/>
<br/>
"What virtue or ability do I, Liu Er, possess to be noticed by Shuang Jing?"<br/>
<br/>
"I am merely a half-blood between human and demon."<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Liu Er paused, pointing to a distant hill, "Strategist, look at that hill. Let's settle there and allow me to explain my thoughts to you."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo naturally did not refuse.<br/>
<br/>
The two then flew to the nearest hill, landing on the rocks to rest.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er took out a jug of wine, first pouring himself a cup and drinking, "My father was a demon cultivator, and my mother was human. I was raised solely by my mother."<br/>
<br/>
"At first, it was fine; my demon bloodline did not manifest externally."<br/>
<br/>
"I also had a period of carefree childhood, playing and frolicking like any other child."<br/>
<br/>
"This was the only bright spot in my childhood, but perhaps it was precisely because of this that I felt the subsequent pain more acutely."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er took a sip of wine, "The playmates I once had gave me fear, suspicion, and alienation."<br/>
<br/>
"As I grew older, I faced cold stares, mockery, and gossip from my peers. They called me a half-blood, a hybrid, a half-demon, or a monster."<br/>
<br/>
"I was isolated, no longer having playmates. When I played alone, I was most afraid of encountering peers from the same village. They would mock me as a monster, surround me, push me to the ground, and deliberately throw stones at me."<br/>
<br/>
"I once deeply hated my identity and argued with my mother, blaming her for not giving birth to me as a pure human."<br/>
<br/>
"But as I began to understand some truths, I realized my mother's helplessness, and I gradually learned to stay away from the crowd, avoiding people to protect myself as much as possible."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er poured a cup of wine for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Near the mountain village where I lived, there was a single cultivation sect."<br/>
<br/>
"This was the place I longed to join day and night."<br/>
<br/>
"My cultivation talent was decent, and my mind could be considered agile. I saw joining the sect as my life's hope, yearning for this opportunity to change my fate and life, and to improve my mother's situation."<br/>
<br/>
"But it was laughable; when the sect held its triennial event to recruit disciples, I didn't even make it past the first round."<br/>
<br/>
"The human cultivator at the gate saw me, waved his sleeve, and threw me out."<br/>
<br/>
"His words are still fresh in my memory ‚Äî'How can a hybrid of demon and human be worthy of cultivating with us?'"<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Liu Er looked at Ning Zhuo, clinked cups with him, and drank the wine.<br/>
<br/>
"I was thrown to the ground, bruised and battered, surrounded by the jeers and laughter of the crowd."<br/>
<br/>
"I don't know how I got up."<br/>
<br/>
"I wandered the mountains like a lost soul."<br/>
<br/>
"When my mother, disheveled, found me late at night, she hugged me tightly. But I pushed her away with force, screaming hysterically, pointing at her nose and blaming her for giving birth to me."<br/>
<br/>
"My mother endured my abuse until I was exhausted, then carried me on her back, walking several miles of mountain road back to our thatched cottage."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er's eyes reddened, his voice choked, "If my mother were still alive, I would surely take good care of her. Unfortunately, I was too immature back then."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er looked at Ning Zhuo, "So, Strategist, do not worry. Since childhood, I have endured mockery and ridicule. What I endured today at Shuang Jing sir's place is nothing in comparison."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo raised his cup, toasting Liu Er, "I see that sir now harbors great ambitions, moves forward courageously, possesses outstanding strength, and treats others with a warmth that makes one want to follow."<br/>
<br/>
"It seems an old saying holds true ‚Äî'When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a person, it first tests their resolve, exhausts their body, and starves their flesh...'"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er laughed heartily, "I didn't understand such principles back then."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if a wise person had tried to advise me, I wouldn't have listened at all."<br/>
<br/>
"It wasn't until three years later, when a famine struck, that I was completely changed."<br/>
<br/>
"The mountain village was on the verge of collapse due to the famine, and to survive, the villagers chose me as a sacrificial offering to the gods."<br/>
<br/>
"My mother knelt and begged all the villagers, wailing and pleading for three days and nights, but could not secure my freedom."<br/>
<br/>
"On the day of the sacrifice, just as I was about to be thrown into the fire, my mother rushed over and threw herself into the flames in my place."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er paused here.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained silent.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er took a few deep breaths, then continued, his voice hoarse, "But the villagers still did not spare me and threw me into the fire as well."<br/>
<br/>
"The god secretly saved me."<br/>
<br/>
"Before becoming a god, he was just a guardian beast of the sect. With the sect's support, he was able to develop his worship and become a god."<br/>
<br/>
"In the past years, every so often, he would use his divine power to create famines, allowing the sect to suppress emerging local forces and also harvest the wealth of the rich."<br/>
<br/>
"This way, the sect's status, reputation, and interests could be maintained."<br/>
<br/>
"I begged the god to revive my mother, but he refused. He was also constrained, but this time, moved by my mother's sacrifice and pitying my half-demon status, he secretly spared my life."<br/>
<br/>
"From then on, I completely understood."<br/>
<br/>
"In this world, even if a demon cultivator becomes a god, they are still just a puppet of others."<br/>
<br/>
"Is there a paradise for demon cultivators in this world?"<br/>
<br/>
"Even if there is, would a half-blood like me be accepted?"<br/>
<br/>
"I secretly left the mountain village, living as a beggar and wandering for many years. I met my master and finally began cultivating."<br/>
<br/>
"Gradually, my horizons broadened, and I despairingly realized that people in this world hold disdainful and exclusionary attitudes towards demon cultivators and half-bloods."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er looked up at the sky.<br/>
<br/>
The vast sky stretched endlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Then, Ning Zhuo heard Liu Er's words, filled with hidden excitement.<br/>
<br/>
"Since there is no pure land in this world, I will create one!"<br/>
<br/>
"This is my ambition."<br/>
<br/>
"I will create a pure land where half-bloods like me can live freely, without enduring scorn, mockery, exclusion, or oppression."<br/>
<br/>
"For this, I can dedicate my entire life!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was stunned.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er retracted his gaze, turning to look at Ning Zhuo with a smile, "So, compared to the ambition I bear, what does such humiliation amount to?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was speechless.</div>
