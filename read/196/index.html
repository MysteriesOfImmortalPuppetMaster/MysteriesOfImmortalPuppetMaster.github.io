<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 196: I'm About to Lose My Purity!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The yin wind howled, shadows surged!<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu's face was filled with tension as she frantically retreated.<br/>
<br/>
The ghostly Granny Qiushui was incredibly fast, slicing through the air like a shadow, catching up to her within a few breaths.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, Yang Chanyu chuckled.<br/>
<br/>
She activated the magical artifact within her body, instantly swapping positions with the poisoned crossbow bolt that had just pierced Luo Shang.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang only saw a flash before his eyes, then saw a beautiful female cultivator with a peach blossom face and dressed in pink, smiling sweetly at him.<br/>
<br/>
But Luo Shang felt no beauty from Yang Chanyu; what he felt was the immense pressure of death and overwhelming fear!<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu launched a fierce attack, wielding a single blade, with blade light scattering everywhere, sharp to the extreme.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang struggled to defend, continuously spitting blood, his body slashed over a dozen times, each cut to the bone, blood gushing out.<br/>
<br/>
"Yang Chanyu!" Luo Shang roared, his face twisted with rage, no longer the indifferent calm from before.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Sun Lingtong had recognized him, he too recognized Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
After all, she was a true disciple of the Void Sect, and related information had long been widely circulated.<br/>
<br/>
"You dare to kill me?"<br/>
<br/>
"Aren't you afraid of sparking a war between the Void Sect and the Soul Devouring Sect?!" Luo Shang shouted repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
"Hehe, why wouldn't I dare?" Yang Chanyu's smile grew more beautiful, but her strikes became even more ruthless.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, she frowned.<br/>
<br/>
She realized that, by nature, she shouldn't have responded.<br/>
<br/>
This was a sign that she was being interfered with, her thoughts chaotic and out of control.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu hurriedly mobilized the magical artifact within her body, but the effect was limited, unable to completely dispel the influence.<br/>
<br/>
In the following attempts to kill, despite Luo Shang bleeding profusely, he narrowly escaped death each time.<br/>
<br/>
"This person's fate energy hasn't run out; I can't kill him!" Seeing Granny Qiushui turning back to pursue her again, Yang Chanyu sighed in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
"No, I still have a chance, why should I give up now?!" With this thought, Yang Chanyu's attacks inevitably slowed down a bit.<br/>
<br/>
In such fierce battles, even a slight difference can lead to a huge mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the influence on Yang Chanyu grew deeper, her attacks slowing down bit by bit.<br/>
<br/>
"Granny, save me!!" Luo Shang's face turned purple, he was weak, unable to suppress the poison within his body.<br/>
<br/>
Granny Qiushui made her move, ultimately choosing to save Luo Shang.<br/>
<br/>
She was dispatched to protect Luo Shang, a true disciple.<br/>
<br/>
If she failed, she would be pursued by the Soul Devouring Sect.<br/>
<br/>
By then, the punishment of soul death and dispersal would be light!<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu retreated again.<br/>
<br/>
During her retreat, she continuously shot multiple crossbow bolts.<br/>
<br/>
Granny Qiushui, having suffered a loss earlier, immediately realized that Yang Chanyu might swap positions with the crossbow bolts again to attack Luo Shang.<br/>
<br/>
She thought for a moment, then decisively tore off her left arm, throwing it towards Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
Then, she made a grasping motion towards Luo Shang.<br/>
<br/>
Several female ghosts used by Luo Shang for cultivation were grabbed out by Granny Qiushui and crushed with one hand.<br/>
<br/>
The female ghosts screamed in pain, extremely tragic, but Granny Qiushui's face grew colder, her heart as hard as iron.<br/>
<br/>
Using the female ghosts as materials, she cast a spell, creating a vast ghostly mist.<br/>
<br/>
The ghostly mist tightly entangled Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong, swirling like a vortex.<br/>
<br/>
Granny Qiushui used her remaining right arm to grab Luo Shang and quickly fled.<br/>
<br/>
She bore the sect's heavy responsibility to protect Luo Shang's life, not to hunt down the real culprit behind Cheng Bai's death—that was Luo Shang's task, not hers.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, she had already made her move.<br/>
<br/>
If the aura of a Nascent Soul stage ghost general was leaked, attracting the City Lord Meng Kui, it would be disastrous.<br/>
<br/>
More crucially, Luo Shang was barely alive, his entire body swollen, red and purple.<br/>
<br/>
The poison applied by Yang Chanyu was too potent.<br/>
<br/>
If Granny Qiushui didn't find a way to treat him, Luo Shang would surely die.<br/>
<br/>
Various factors led her to decisively withdraw from the battlefield!<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang was carried away by Granny Qiushui, his body already swollen like a purple pig's head.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes were almost closed, only able to squint into slits.<br/>
<br/>
"Defeated!"<br/>
<br/>
Even his life-saving trump card, Granny Qiushui, had been forced out.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang was ambushed, unable to display his true strength, and was crippled.<br/>
<br/>
"Good job, Yang Chanyu!"<br/>
<br/>
"I'll remember today's grudge, and I'll repay it a hundredfold in the future." "But you won't have it easy today either."<br/>
<br/>
"Granny Qiushui's charm technique is not to be underestimated. You might end up in a situation of internal strife!" Thinking of this, Luo Shang's face showed a venomous expression.<br/>
<br/>
He was extremely sensitive to changes in his state of mind and immediately realized something was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, his face turned to panic.<br/>
<br/>
After the panic, it turned to terror.<br/>
<br/>
He primarily cultivated the Soul-Dissolving Technique, which should have left him expressionless, with emotions hard to arise.<br/>
<br/>
However, at this moment, his state of mind was severely shaken.<br/>
<br/>
"Although I haven't had my cultivation broken, my injuries are too severe! Damn it, what kind of poison is this?"<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
On the other side, Ning Zhuo received warning messages from Sun Lingtong one after another.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Sun!"<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Sun is in danger again."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was so shocked that he interrupted his cultivation and stood up from the meditation mat.<br/>
<br/>
"Soul Devouring Sect, Luo Shang, a Nascent Soul level ghost general..."<br/>
<br/>
"Void Sect, Yang Chanyu, damn it, she's Elder Qing's favored disciple, and a major adversary of Brother Sun within the Void Sect." "This is bad, really bad!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo paced in place, head down, thinking rapidly for a solution.<br/>
<br/>
"The ghostly mist has trapped Brother Sun and Yang Chanyu, formed from the arm of a Nascent Soul ghost general, it's no small matter." "I only have hope of saving Brother Sun by activating the Golden Core level mechanical ape!" "But the mechanical ape isn't finished yet..."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, if I install the Wild Thought Disrupting Drum and disguise the lower half, it might barely work!" With this thought, Ning Zhuo hurried to assemble the mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui frowned.<br/>
<br/>
"A Nascent Soul level aura?" "The direction of Purple Sun Courtyard's gaze is towards the underground base where the battle is happening."<br/>
<br/>
But Meng Kui had no intention of getting up or taking action.<br/>
<br/>
Because he also sensed that Zhu Xuanji was in danger!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji had informed Meng Kui in person about his plan to explore the depths of Fire Persimmon Mountain with three Golden Core cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing this, Meng Kui had to keep an eye on Zhu Xuanji to prevent him from falling into danger and losing his life.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Granny Qiushui had to ensure Luo Shang's safety, Meng Kui also had to ensure that the royal family member Zhu Xuanji didn't die in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
As for those three Golden Core cultivators...<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui would be happy to see them all perish!<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace had shown Meng's family's intentions, and the three factions had fully sided with Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui couldn't directly attack Zhu Xuanji or the three Golden Core cultivators, but he could choose not to save them.<br/>
<br/>
"Just need to save Zhu Xuanji." Meng Kui had already sensed Zhu Xuanji's peril.<br/>
<br/>
He thought for a moment, then summoned Tui Han and Fei Si, ordering them to investigate the location where the Nascent Soul aura appeared.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si provided support from outside, while Tui Han bypassed the city protection formation, delving deep to discover the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
He broke in and saw the swirling, turbulent ghostly mist.<br/>
<br/>
As Tui Han approached, a strong lust arose within him, making his breath heavy, his eyes red, and filled with an urge to vent his desires.<br/>
<br/>
"A Nascent Soul level technique!"<br/>
<br/>
Tui Han, unwilling to give up, retreated to a safe distance and tried using a spell attack, but the effect was negligible.<br/>
<br/>
Within the surging ghostly mist, Yang Chanyu had already fallen under its influence.<br/>
<br/>
Her face was like a peach blossom, her eyes filled with tenderness, as if about to drip water.<br/>
<br/>
She giggled foolishly, running towards Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shouted, "No, don't come over here!"<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu: "Silly boy, stop running." "We already have a marriage contract, why are you shy?" "Stop running, come into sister's arms!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's face was filled with terror, the fear in his heart even stronger than during the battle.<br/>
<br/>
He charged at the ghostly mist, but it was so tough and sturdy that a Foundation Establishment cultivator like him couldn't break through.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, Little Zhuo, where are you?" "Hurry and save me!"<br/>
<br/>
"If you're any later, I'll lose my purity."<br/>
<br/>
The ghostly mist isolated the inside from the outside, and even though Sun Lingtong had Ning Zhuo's Life-Hanging Thread, he couldn't send a message.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Sun, hold on!" Ning Zhuo had already reached another underground secret base, fully assembling the Golden Core level mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Sun, you must hold on." Ning Zhuo didn't know the situation inside the ghostly mist, imagining Yang Chanyu torturing and brutally tormenting Sun Lingtong like Cheng Bai.</div>
