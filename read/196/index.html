<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 196: I'm About to Lose My Purity!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The yin wind howled, shadows surged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Yang Chanyu's face was filled with tension as she frantically retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The ghostly Granny Qiushui was incredibly fast, slicing through the air like a shadow, catching up to her within a few breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">But in the next moment, Yang Chanyu chuckled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">She activated the magical artifact within her body, instantly swapping positions with the poisoned crossbow bolt that had just pierced Luo Shang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Luo Shang only saw a flash before his eyes, then saw a beautiful female cultivator with a peach blossom face and dressed in pink, smiling sweetly at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">But Luo Shang felt no beauty from Yang Chanyu; what he felt was the immense pressure of death and overwhelming fear!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Yang Chanyu launched a fierce attack, wielding a single blade, with blade light scattering everywhere, sharp to the extreme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Luo Shang struggled to defend, continuously spitting blood, his body slashed over a dozen times, each cut to the bone, blood gushing out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Yang Chanyu!" Luo Shang roared, his face twisted with rage, no longer the indifferent calm from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Just as Sun Lingtong had recognized him, he too recognized Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">After all, she was a true disciple of the Void Sect, and related information had long been widely circulated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"You dare to kill me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Aren't you afraid of sparking a war between the Void Sect and the Soul Devouring Sect?!" Luo Shang shouted repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Hehe, why wouldn't I dare?" Yang Chanyu's smile grew more beautiful, but her strikes became even more ruthless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But in the next moment, she frowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">She realized that, by nature, she shouldn't have responded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">This was a sign that she was being interfered with, her thoughts chaotic and out of control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Yang Chanyu hurriedly mobilized the magical artifact within her body, but the effect was limited, unable to completely dispel the influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In the following attempts to kill, despite Luo Shang bleeding profusely, he narrowly escaped death each time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"This person's fate energy hasn't run out; I can't kill him!" Seeing Granny Qiushui turning back to pursue her again, Yang Chanyu sighed in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"No, I still have a chance, why should I give up now?!" With this thought, Yang Chanyu's attacks inevitably slowed down a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">In such fierce battles, even a slight difference can lead to a huge mistake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Moreover, the influence on Yang Chanyu grew deeper, her attacks slowing down bit by bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Granny, save me!!" Luo Shang's face turned purple, he was weak, unable to suppress the poison within his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Granny Qiushui made her move, ultimately choosing to save Luo Shang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">She was dispatched to protect Luo Shang, a true disciple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">If she failed, she would be pursued by the Soul Devouring Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">By then, the punishment of soul death and dispersal would be light!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Yang Chanyu retreated again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">During her retreat, she continuously shot multiple crossbow bolts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Granny Qiushui, having suffered a loss earlier, immediately realized that Yang Chanyu might swap positions with the crossbow bolts again to attack Luo Shang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">She thought for a moment, then decisively tore off her left arm, throwing it towards Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Then, she made a grasping motion towards Luo Shang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Several female ghosts used by Luo Shang for cultivation were grabbed out by Granny Qiushui and crushed with one hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The female ghosts screamed in pain, extremely tragic, but Granny Qiushui's face grew colder, her heart as hard as iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Using the female ghosts as materials, she cast a spell, creating a vast ghostly mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The ghostly mist tightly entangled Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong, swirling like a vortex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Granny Qiushui used her remaining right arm to grab Luo Shang and quickly fled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">She bore the sect's heavy responsibility to protect Luo Shang's life, not to hunt down the real culprit behind Cheng Bai's death - that was Luo Shang's task, not hers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At this moment, she had already made her move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">If the aura of a Nascent Soul stage ghost general was leaked, attracting the City Lord Meng Kui, it would be disastrous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">More crucially, Luo Shang was barely alive, his entire body swollen, red and purple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The poison applied by Yang Chanyu was too potent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">If Granny Qiushui didn't find a way to treat him, Luo Shang would surely die.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Various factors led her to decisively withdraw from the battlefield!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Luo Shang was carried away by Granny Qiushui, his body already swollen like a purple pig's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">His eyes were almost closed, only able to squint into slits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Defeated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Even his life-saving trump card, Granny Qiushui, had been forced out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Luo Shang was ambushed, unable to display his true strength, and was crippled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Good job, Yang Chanyu!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"I'll remember today's grudge, and I'll repay it a hundredfold in the future." "But you won't have it easy today either."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Granny Qiushui's charm technique is not to be underestimated. You might end up in a situation of internal strife!" Thinking of this, Luo Shang's face showed a venomous expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He was extremely sensitive to changes in his state of mind and immediately realized something was wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Thus, his face turned to panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After the panic, it turned to terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He primarily cultivated the Soul-Dissolving Technique, which should have left him expressionless, with emotions hard to arise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">However, at this moment, his state of mind was severely shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Although I haven't had my cultivation broken, my injuries are too severe! Damn it, what kind of poison is this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">On the other side, Ning Zhuo received warning messages from Sun Lingtong one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Brother Sun!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Brother Sun is in danger again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo was so shocked that he interrupted his cultivation and stood up from the meditation mat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Soul Devouring Sect, Luo Shang, a Nascent Soul level ghost general..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Void Sect, Yang Chanyu, damn it, she's Elder Qing's favored disciple, and a major adversary of Brother Sun within the Void Sect." "This is bad, really bad!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo paced in place, head down, thinking rapidly for a solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"The ghostly mist has trapped Brother Sun and Yang Chanyu, formed from the arm of a Nascent Soul ghost general, it's no small matter." "I only have hope of saving Brother Sun by activating the Golden Core level mechanical ape!" "But the mechanical ape isn't finished yet..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Now, if I install the Wild Thought Disrupting Drum and disguise the lower half, it might barely work!" With this thought, Ning Zhuo hurried to assemble the mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Meng Kui frowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"A Nascent Soul level aura?" "The direction of Purple Sun Courtyard's gaze is towards the underground base where the battle is happening."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But Meng Kui had no intention of getting up or taking action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Because he also sensed that Zhu Xuanji was in danger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Zhu Xuanji had informed Meng Kui in person about his plan to explore the depths of Fire Persimmon Mountain with three Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Knowing this, Meng Kui had to keep an eye on Zhu Xuanji to prevent him from falling into danger and losing his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Just as Granny Qiushui had to ensure Luo Shang's safety, Meng Kui also had to ensure that the royal family member Zhu Xuanji didn't die in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">As for those three Golden Core cultivators...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Meng Kui would be happy to see them all perish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The Lava Immortal Palace had shown Meng's family's intentions, and the three factions had fully sided with Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Meng Kui couldn't directly attack Zhu Xuanji or the three Golden Core cultivators, but he could choose not to save them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Just need to save Zhu Xuanji." Meng Kui had already sensed Zhu Xuanji's peril.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He thought for a moment, then summoned Tui Han and Fei Si, ordering them to investigate the location where the Nascent Soul aura appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Fei Si provided support from outside, while Tui Han bypassed the city protection formation, delving deep to discover the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He broke in and saw the swirling, turbulent ghostly mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">As Tui Han approached, a strong lust arose within him, making his breath heavy, his eyes red, and filled with an urge to vent his desires.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"A Nascent Soul level technique!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Tui Han, unwilling to give up, retreated to a safe distance and tried using a spell attack, but the effect was negligible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Within the surging ghostly mist, Yang Chanyu had already fallen under its influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Her face was like a peach blossom, her eyes filled with tenderness, as if about to drip water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">She giggled foolishly, running towards Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong shouted, "No, don't come over here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Yang Chanyu: "Silly boy, stop running." "We already have a marriage contract, why are you shy?" "Stop running, come into sister's arms!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Sun Lingtong's face was filled with terror, the fear in his heart even stronger than during the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He charged at the ghostly mist, but it was so tough and sturdy that a Foundation Establishment cultivator like him couldn't break through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Little Zhuo, Little Zhuo, where are you?" "Hurry and save me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"If you're any later, I'll lose my purity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The ghostly mist isolated the inside from the outside, and even though Sun Lingtong had Ning Zhuo's Life Hanging by a Thread, he couldn't send a message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Brother Sun, hold on!" Ning Zhuo had already reached another underground secret base, fully assembling the Golden Core level mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Brother Sun, you must hold on." Ning Zhuo didn't know the situation inside the ghostly mist, imagining Yang Chanyu torturing and brutally tormenting Sun Lingtong like Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
