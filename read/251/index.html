<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">If it weren't for Ning Xiaohui, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit would have simply slipped away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After some hesitation, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit finally spoke the truth: "Young Master, each time the cannon is fired, the Lava Immortal Palace consumes a large amount of Five Elements Mana. If the results do not meet the minimum standards, the Lava Immortal Palace will consider the cannon fire a loss greater than the gains, and the responsibility will fall on the one who fired it, resulting in a deduction of merits. In fact, if you repair some important mechanisms in the Medical Pavilion and the results are worse than before, your merits will also be deducted. Similarly, if your decisions on the Command Platform are wrong, your merits will be deducted during the post-battle statistics."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo nodded, feeling that such regulations were quite reasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">They effectively prevent incompetents from occupying high positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He then had a new question and continued to ask, "What happens if all my merits are deducted? I mean, if my current merits are negative, will it affect my position?" This was a crucial question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Upon hearing this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo, this little monster, always manages to keenly spot the key points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">It had to answer again, "If the negative merits persist for a period, it will cause a cultivator's position rank to drop. Young Master, your previous merits were negative, and it didn't affect your position because you didn't have any position at all. But now, you have three second-rank positions. If your merits remain negative when the time limit is reached, the rank of these positions will drop significantly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo immediately frowned, "Then, when exactly is this time limit for my position to drop?" This was a big problem for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He had just signed a contract with Zhu Xuanji, and he couldn't enter the Immortal Palace with his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In other words, once his position rank drops, he won't be able to regain a second-rank position by clearing checkpoints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Therefore, before that happens, Ning Zhuo must quickly clear his merit deficit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit thought for a moment and decided it was better to be honest, so it told Ning Zhuo the exact date.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The date was quite far off, and Ning Zhuo calculated that there was at least half a month left. "No, that's not right!" A gleam flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He paused for a moment, carefully choosing his words, and asked, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, do I get a share of the merit contributions from those under my second-rank positions? For example, if I am the head of the Medical Pavilion, and others work under me, do I not get a share of their merits?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shuddered all over! It circled around the throne in disappointment, looking up at the ceiling of the main hall, muttering, "Ning Zhuo found out, he found out, he finally discovered this point!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit sighed deeply, its expression desolate and slightly tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit..." Ning Zhuo kept calling, but received no response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He frowned slightly, a thoughtful look in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo had to thank Ning Xiaohui for discovering this point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Xiaohui had repaired the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng several times in the Medical Pavilion, allowing Ning Zhuo to keenly notice changes in his own merit amount.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Although the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit did not respond or give him a clear answer, Ning Zhuo was almost certain that this was the answer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"In this case, my next task is actually to help others obtain more positions. And these positions must be related to the Medical Pavilion, Command Platform, and Cannon Tower." Ning Zhuo calculated slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">If he completed various tasks himself, he could indeed gain a lot, but there was a risk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Sometimes, if tasks were not up to standard, merits would be deducted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">However, if there were many people under his positions, and he specifically took a share of their merits, as long as the number was large enough, the accumulation speed would be considerable, even far exceeding his personal efforts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">And the most attractive point for him was that enjoying these merit shares carried no risk of merit deduction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Zhu Xuanji and others are my most threatening competitors. But they are outsiders and cannot take such positions. So, I just need to cultivate these reformation team members well, and ensure that the merits of a few outstanding ones among them do not exceed mine!" When Ning Zhuo returned to his residence, he heard the Ning family's reformation team members discussing task assignments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He gathered them, briefly informed them about signing contracts, and then dismissed them, entering his room alone to begin his daily cultivation of breathing exercises.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Because he still carried monitoring methods planted by several Golden Core cultivators, he had to perform this act daily to appear reasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The next day, Ning Zhuo opened his eyes, washed up, and left his residence alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He went to the edge of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Here, battles frequently occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Some Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts would break through the light barrier and charge in, only to be quickly killed by mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Often, after these battles, many new tasks would arise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo stayed at the rear of the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">After the battle ended, some mechanical puppets limped back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo approached these damaged mechanisms, holding his merit token, checking the new task contents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Then, he accurately selected task targets, pulling the target mechanical puppet out of the retreating team for on-the-spot repairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He disassembled these mechanical puppets as much as possible, examining their internal structures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Soon, he made a discovery: the mechanical components used in these puppets were very familiar to him. "These structures and components have almost all appeared in the trial checkpoints." For others, they might only be familiar with the mechanical components related to the Dao Gate route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">But Ning Zhuo had cleared three paths, and many checkpoint rewards had been claimed multiple times, so he was quite familiar with them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">However, on the surface, he still had to put on a show of research.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo's solitary actions in the morning attracted the attention of Zhu Xuanji and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">When he returned, he was reprimanded by the Ning family ancestor through voice transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Cultivators within the Immortal Palace, aside from facing life-threatening dangers from demon beasts, also posed potential threats to each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">At this moment, there were still many rogue cultivators in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Jiufan did not want to see Ning Zhuo get injured or even killed due to acting alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This would be a significant loss for the current situation and the Ning family, even though Ning Zhuo was currently only at the Qi Refining Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo accepted the criticism and began to set out with the main group in the afternoon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">To fully utilize the power of the Lava Immortal Palace, and considering that each position held by their side increased their control over the palace, the Golden Core cultivators were very attentive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Therefore, each reformation team had a Golden Core Stage cultivator overseeing them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Zhu Xuanji and others were very cautious, from their perspective: the culprit controlling the Five Elements Cannon Tower and attacking Fire Persimmon Mountain had always remained hidden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Since this culprit could control the Five Elements Cannon Tower, it was evident that he was a pioneer on the path within the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The advancement of the reformation team posed a great threat to this culprit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He was highly likely to launch a sneak attack to nip the threat in the bud!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The reformation team members generally only had Qi Refining Stage cultivation, with limited combat power, requiring the protection of Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">This arrangement made Ning Zhuo feel quite inconvenienced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He could only suppress his gradually growing impatience and slightly speed up his performance. "Oh... So strong!" "I didn't expect Ning Zhuo's mechanical skills to have improved again. Impressive!" Everyone was amazed by Ning Zhuo, praising him continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo's rapid understanding and mastery of "unfamiliar" mechanisms left people in awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Clearly, he was on a completely different level from others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo wanted to hide his skills, but the situation forced him to show off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"I need to quickly accumulate enough merits to be able to enter and exit the Medical Pavilion. This way, I can stay in the Medical Pavilion all day, repairing a large number of mechanical puppets daily, providing a perfect explanation to the outside world." As the head of the Medical Pavilion, Ning Zhuo naturally knew what the minimum standard for positions in the Medical Pavilion was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The mechanical skills Ning Zhuo displayed were noted by many Golden Core ancestors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Among the many reformation team members, Ning Zhuo not only stood out but was also far ahead, leading the pack! Even someone like Zhu Xuanji, who had seen many talented cultivators, couldn't help but be impressed by Ning Zhuo's performance. "This junior Ning Zhuo really has quite the talent in mechanical arts!" Zhu Xuanji had a clear comparison in mind, which was Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Xiaohui, with the Ice Jade Hand divine ability, was unreasonable in healing and repairing mechanical puppets, almost like cheating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">But even so, Ning Xiaohui's speed in accumulating merits was much slower than Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhu Xuanji's heart moved slightly, recording Ning Zhuo's situation in a jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Then, Zhu Xuanji casually tossed it, and the jade slip transformed into light, eventually flying to Ning Xiaohui's side, hovering in front of her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Xiaohui took the jade slip, placed it on her forehead, and after probing with her divine sense, was secretly shocked. "Is it Ning Zhuo?!" "His progress is so rapid?!" The jade slip also contained Zhu Xuanji's voice: "Do you think Ning Zhuo will reach the minimum standard for the Medical Pavilion's position faster than you?" "I heard his recent goal is to strive for the position of a medical officer." Ning Xiaohui's pupils shrank sharply, almost gritting her teeth, "Ning Zhuo!!!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
