<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"This is the Myriad Manifestations Sect..." Ning Zhuo murmured, his gaze sweeping across the landscape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The scene before him was dreamlike and ethereal, with swirling clouds and towering peaks that resembled an immortal realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Most striking were the eight main peaks, each radiating its own divine aura. These majestic peaks pierced the clouds like colossal giants, their waists veiled in mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">On Heavy Formation Peak, mystical light shimmered as intricate formation diagrams materialized in mid-air, appearing and vanishing in layers. Each formation plate rotated slowly, its surface adorned with countless talismans that resembled twinkling stars or darting fish, weaving through the complex patterns. A group of cultivators, all at the Golden Core stage, worked in unison - some manipulating talismans to fill the formation diagrams, while others channeled spiritual energy to weave invisible threads through the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">On Myriad Beasts Peak, tigers and leopards prowled through the forests, while serpentine dragons coiled in the shadows. The mountain's eastern face was riddled with honeycomb-like beast dens. A large flock of azure birds soared from this side, led by a crested leader with a shepherd boy perched on its back. The boy played a flute, its melodious notes echoing through the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">On Pillglow Peak, countless alchemical furnaces churned, releasing streams of medicinal smoke. Some plumes rose straight as pillars, piercing the sky, while others danced with ethereal grace. The converging smoke and occasional bursts of furnace light painted the sky above Pillglow Peak in a vibrant, ever-shifting tapestry of immortal radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Purple Thunder Peak was bound by massive black chains, coiling around the mountain like a dragon wrapped around a pillar, encircling the peak several times. These chains connected the main peak to the surrounding secondary peaks, spanning the sea of clouds. The mountain winds stirred the chains, causing them to clang and rattle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">On Sword's Cry Peak, a stone sword was plunged upside down into the ground. Sword pavilions dotted the mountain, surrounded by dense bamboo forests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Hundred Herbs Peak was lush with vegetation, where exotic giant flowers bloomed in the rainforest. When thorny vines migrated, they resembled a million serpents slithering across the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Soaring Peak was swept by violent winds, sometimes shooting straight into the sky, sometimes forming swirling azure vortexes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Flowing Cloud Peak was shrouded in the densest cloud layers. The mountain seemed to be cultivating, constantly inhaling and exhaling the surrounding cloud Qi, creating countless cloud formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">These were the eight main peaks!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In addition to these, there were also secondary peaks, smaller peaks, and broken peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo now stood halfway up a smaller peak, with a massive palace behind him housing a teleportation Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">These smaller and secondary peaks were numerous. Ning Zhuo even spotted a mountain floating amidst the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Some peaks boasted soaring pavilions and jade palaces, while others featured flower gardens, medicinal herb gardens, beast enclosures, and celestial pools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Countless cultivators crisscrossed between these peaks like flying ants. Some rode swords through the air, others rode demonic beasts or cloud beasts, while still others piloted mechanical flying boats or rode on clouds and mists.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34"><b></b></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Truly,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">A thousand layers of cloud script lock the celestial dome,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Eight pillars of heaven support the sky, suppressing the nine dragons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Heavy Formation Plate, Star Talisman sea; Myriad Beasts' Nest, Cloud Shepherd, Azure Child.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Nine Revolutions of Crimson Blood Condensation; Thunder Restriction, Triple Coils, binding the fiend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Sword's Cry, inverted, tears of All Living Beings; Vine Dance, Hundred Herbs, devouring Immortal traces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Soaring Gale, raging, stirs Heaven and Earth's Qi; Flowing Clouds, inhaling and exhaling the Ten Thousand Calamities Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Suddenly, Jade Pavilions, Flying Star Rain - only then did I realize this realm was no dream!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50"></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Wen Ruanyu, standing beside Ning Zhuo, explained in a timely manner, "The eight main peaks are inaccessible to ordinary cultivators. Even I need to file a report in advance to ascend them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He gestured with a finger, drawing a circle in the air. "But these smaller peaks house the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Sixteen Halls. These will be your frequent haunts in the future, nephew, so it's best to familiarize yourself with them now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Curious, Ning Zhuo transmitted a question with his divine sense: "Senior Wen, as a Golden Core True Disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, can't you freely access the eight main peaks?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Wen Ruanyu chuckled bitterly. "Even your mother doesn't have that privilege. Our sect is vast, with a massive population, so even Golden Core True Disciples are... numerous. Moreover, there are many internal affairs involved. Your mother likely didn't tell you because the matter is too complicated, especially given the changing circumstances. I'll explain everything after I complete my duty report."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">After a pause, Wen Ruanyu added, "Of course, I'll need some time to investigate the current situation within the sect. After all, I've been away from the Sect Gate for far too long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Are you truly determined to act alone and not stay at my cave residence?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo shook his head, refusing again. "Now that the environment is safe, I'd rather explore this spiritual land on foot. After all, this is the sect my mother joined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Wen Ruanyu chuckled, then sighed, thinking of Senior Sister Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder and gave him one last instruction before leaving: "If there's an emergency, don't hesitate to crush the Jade Pendant. It will alert me, and I'll do everything I can to help!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">After their journey to White Paper Immortal City, Wen Ruanyu had become Ning Zhuo's most reliable ally and resource within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This wasn't just due to Wen Ruanyu's friendship with Meng Yaoyin and his admiration for her, but also because Wen Ruanyu genuinely believed in Ning Zhuo's potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">After a few more words, they parted ways in the plaza.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Wen Ruanyu summoned a cyan cloud, casually tucking one hand behind his back as he strode away with effortless grace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo, like the other cultivators, also left the area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">By nature cautious, he wouldn't use the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon upon entering this precious land - that was typically reserved for Nascent Soul-level cultivators. For a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator like Ning Zhuo to use it would be far too ostentatious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">With the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Flying Cloud Assembly approaching, countless cultivators were flocking to the sect, all hoping to join. To manage the influx, the sect had assigned numerous cultivators to guide the newcomers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo approached one of the cultivator guides to ask for directions. The cultivator pulled out a stack of jade slips. "These are my own handcrafted jade slips," he said. "They contain a detailed map of the sect's terrain and comprehensive introductions. If you're interested, Fellow Daoist, they're just ten Low-Grade Spirit Stones each."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The cultivator was only at the Qi Refining Stage, but facing Ning Zhuo, a Foundation Establishment outsider, he rubbed his hands together, his eyes gleaming with shrewdness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo paid the Spirit Stones and bought a jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The jade slip provided a general overview of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, exactly what Ning Zhuo needed most. Although Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin had left him a message jade slip, it hadn't covered such basic knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Following the map's guidance, Ning Zhuo first arrived at a Cloud Platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Cloud Platform was small, housing only a single palace. A plaque above the entrance read: "Commerce Hall, Twelfth Branch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Myriad Manifestations Sect had eight main peaks and sixteen halls. The Commerce Hall oversaw internal and external trade, managing numerous merchant caravans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The branch palace was entirely cast from red copper, with roof tiles shaped like Pixiu devouring gold. Bronze abacus beads hung from the eaves, clinking melodically in the breeze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo stepped over the golden threshold, his feet landing on floor tiles that shimmered with faint Auspicious Light. The interior layout was remarkably simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The four walls were lined with tall cabinets that reached the ceiling. Long tables, joined end-to-end, formed a circular perimeter around the cabinets. Cultivators managing transactions sat behind the tables, while those appraising, bargaining, or selling stood outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">At the center of the hall stood an octagonal counter arranged in the pattern of the Eight Trigrams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The counter was vast, accommodating at least fifty cultivators within its confines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">A white jade stele rose from the counter's center, its four sides displaying constantly scrolling text. Ning Zhuo glanced at it and saw terms like "Heavenly Fire Sand," "Profound Ice Marrow," and "Flowing Clouds Tea."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Having previously purchased a Jade Slip for guidance, he knew this octagonal counter was called the Eight Directions Treasure Appraisal Platform within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The cultivators within the platform were responsible for appraisals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Some measured the age of medicinal herbs with rulers, while others traced the origins of magic treasures using basins of water. Still others relied on the Discern Truth from Falsehood Formation overhead. As the formation's light swept across the goods, their authenticity was revealed through iridescent rainbow glows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo surveyed the scene before approaching the counter in the southwest corner. He stated his needs and inquired about prices.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He was still seeking information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Commerce Hall naturally offered intelligence for sale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The cultivator presented Ning Zhuo with five price tiers. After some questioning, Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The highest-tier information, priced exorbitantly, was immediately dismissed by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He also refused to pay for the second-tier information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Even the third-tier option strained his current financial resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">During his time in White Paper Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had poured all his resources into establishing the Qing-Jiao Army, essentially exhausting the war profits from the Two Note Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Although he had ultimately thwarted the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long plot and seized a mountain of war spoils, converting these spoils into usable assets would require considerable time and a lengthy process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">This was because the spoils were all Underworld artifacts. Attempting to sell them in bulk would inevitably disrupt the market and cause a massive uproar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Such a high-profile move would also expose too much about Ning Zhuo's true capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Despite forging an alliance with the White Paper City Lord, Ning Zhuo chose not to use her channels to convert these spoils on a large scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">His previous explanation to the City Lord had been that the Qing-Jiao Army had engaged in a brief skirmish in the Underworld before immediately returning. How could he now explain the sudden appearance of such a massive quantity of war spoils?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Qing-Jiao Army needed to maintain close cooperation with White Paper Immortal City. Presenting a false image so early in their alliance would be detrimental to their relationship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Before leaving, Ning Zhuo exchanged Yang Qi with the White Paper City Lord for a batch of Spirit Stones. Despite knowing how crucial Yang Qi was to her, he refrained from exploiting the situation to inflate the price, demonstrating his sincere commitment to cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo used the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon to travel, consuming some Spirit Stones. However, the bulk of his resources was spent on teleportation fees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The cost of using a Teleportation Formation wasn't based on the number of people but on a comprehensive assessment of the cultivator's cultivation level and the value of their possessions. The higher the cultivator's cultivation level and the more valuable their treasures, the higher the fee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon at Ning Zhuo's waist, along with Qing Chi, Sun Lingtong, Old Chef, and the numerous Mechanism Platforms hidden within, were all factored into the price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Of course, the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon's inherent ability to traverse the Void, combined with Sun Lingtong's absorption of Void Evil God marrow, granted Ning Zhuo a discount, resulting in a lower-than-average fee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Cultivators with such capabilities enjoy advantages when using Teleportation Formations. For those who frequently travel and lack a fixed residence, these accumulated savings could amount to a substantial number of Spirit Stones annually.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo hesitated between the third and fourth highest price tiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Just as he was about to inquire about the differences between these tiers from the sales cultivator, two cultivators approached him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">One of them smiled and took the initiative to speak. "Fellow Daoist, I am Shen Xi, and this is my cousin, Su Lingkou. We both hail from Nine Palaces Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo's heart stirred slightly as he quickly recalled that these were the cultivators who had arrived here via the same teleportation array as him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Nine Palaces Immortal City was one of Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu's transit points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"I am Ning Zhuo," he replied with a polite greeting. "It's an honor to meet you both."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Shen Xi explained their purpose: "We weren't intentionally eavesdropping, but our goals align with yours. We also came here to purchase information about the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"In my humble opinion, why don't we pool our resources and buy a Tier 3 Jade Slip together? What do you think, Fellow Daoist?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo carefully studied the pair before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Shen Xi was slender, his complexion as pale as cold jade, his features gentle like ink-wash paintings. A thin layer of calluses covered his right palm, which was currently caressing a circular Jade Pendant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">His hair was secured with an ebony hairpin, its head inlaid with a Mount Sumeru Mustard Stone that radiated the aura of a magic treasure. Over his plain azure robes, he wore a Profound Silkworm Cloud-Patterned Cloak, its corners fastened with Taiji Glazed Clasps that emitted a protective Pure Light. The Jade Pendant in his hand was also a magic treasure formation plate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Shen Xi's cultivation was at the Foundation Establishment Stage, far more advanced than Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Beside him, Su Lingkou had delicate features and bright, lively eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Her hair was bound with a plain silver chain, and she wore a honey-colored, cross-collared short robe paired with a moon-white pleated skirt. Both wrists were adorned with five-colored braided cords.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Though she was also at the Foundation Establishment Stage, the magic treasure aura of her hair chain remained unsuppressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">While their appearances were only above average, their bearing exuded the air of noble lineage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Magic treasures were typically used by Golden Core and Nascent Soul-level cultivators, yet these two each possessed one or two, revealing their considerable wealth. Their entire attire consisted of Magic Artifacts, their auras interconnected, clearly part of a set. This alone set them apart from the crowd, making them stand out like cranes among chickens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In contrast, Ning Zhuo's appearance was unremarkable save for his conspicuously large head and a hint of handsome charm. His clothing and treasures were equally unremarkable (though the Mechanical Dragon coiled around his waist, it was concealed beneath his outer robe, its aura suppressed).</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo smiled at the two cultivators. "That's an excellent suggestion!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">But then he turned to the sales cultivator with a troubled expression, asking if joint purchase was permissible under the rules of the transaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The cultivator waved dismissively, assuring him it was fine, but cautioned Ning Zhuo about the risks involved. For example, one cultivator might examine the item first, then use their divine sense to erase crucial information, doing so subtly and without detection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Upon hearing this, Shen Xi proactively extended his palm to Ning Zhuo, saying, "Fellow Daoist Ning, the Jade Slip may pass through your hands first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo accepted without ceremony, offering a simple thanks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">With their agreement, the sales cultivator handed the Jade Slip to Ning Zhuo. He immediately retrieved a blank Jade Slip and began transcribing its contents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Meanwhile, Shen Xi inquired of the sales cultivator, "If the contents of this Jade Slip can be replicated, wouldn't multiple parties pooling funds to purchase it at a low price and resell it at a higher price severely undermine the Commerce Hall's intelligence business? Does the Myriad Manifestations Sect's regulations not address this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The sales cultivator waved his hand dismissively. "Our Myriad Manifestations Sect may be among the elite Super Sects in terms of scale and membership, but our regulations are surprisingly sparse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"It is precisely this lack of constraints that allows our vast membership to fully flourish, ensuring our sect remains the foremost in the Flying Cloud Kingdom!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Of course, instances of buying low and selling high have occurred. After persisting for a time, they are invariably suppressed and severely punished."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"You are clearly newcomers, and allowing this is my personal decision. You could be deceiving me, but ultimately, it's just a single piece of intelligence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The sales cultivator's magnanimous response resonated deeply with Ning Zhuo, who was still transcribing the Jade Slip.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
